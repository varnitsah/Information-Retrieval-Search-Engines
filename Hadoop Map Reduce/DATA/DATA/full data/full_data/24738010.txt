something obtuse in this our star               shackles the spirits winged feet               but a glory moves us from afar               and we know that we are strong and fleet                                             edmund ollier            once more i behold the face of her          whose actions all had the character          of an inexpressible charm expressed          whose movements flowed from a centre of rest          and whose rest was that of a swallow rife          with the instinct of reposing life          whose mirth had a sadness all the while          it sparkled and laughed and whose sadness lay          in the heaven of such a crystal smile          that you longed to travel the selfsame way          to the brightness of sorrow for round her breathed          a grace like that of the general air          which softens the sharp extremes of things          and connects by its subtle invisible stair          the lowest and the highest she interwreathed          her mortal obscureness with so much light          of the world unrisen that angels wings          could hardly have given her greater right          to float in the winds of the infinity                                         edmund ollier                                       dawn                                  chapter i  you lie you always were a liar and you always will be a liar you told my father how i spent the money  well and what if i did i had to look after myself i suppose you forget that i am only here on sufferance whilst you are the son of the house it does not matter to you but he would have turned me out of doors whined george  oh curse your fine words its you who forget you swab ay its you who forget that you asked me to take the money to the gambling tent and made me promise that you should have half of what we won but that i should play for both what are you beginning to remember nowis it coming back to you after a whole month i am going to quicken your memory up presently i can tell you i have got a good deal to pay off im thinking i know what you are at you want to play cuckoo to turn cousin philip out that cousin george may fill the nest you know the old mans soft points and you keep working him up against me you think that you would like the old place when hes goneay and i daresay that you will get it before you have done but i mean to have my pennorth out of you now at any rate and brushing the tears of anger that stood in his brown eyes away with the back of his hand the speaker proceeded to square up to george in a most determined way  now philip with his broad shoulders and his firmknit frame would even at eighteen have been no mean antagonist for a fullgrown man much more then did he look formidable to the lankly overgrown stripling crouching against the corner of the wall that prevented his further retreat  philip youre not going to strike me are you when you know you are so much stronger  yes i am though if i cant match you with my tongue at any rate i will use my fists look out  oh philip dont ill tell your father  tell him why of course you will i know that but you shall have something to lie about this time and he advanced to the attack with a grim determination not pleasant for his cousin to behold  finding that there was no escape george turned upon him with so shrill a curse that it even frightened from his leafy perch in the oak above the tame turtledove intensely preoccupied as he was in cooing to a newfound mate he did more than curse he fought like a cornered rat and with as much chance as the rat with a trained foxterrier in a few seconds his head was as snugly tucked away in the chancery of his cousins arm as ever any property was in the court of that name and to speak truth it seemed quite possible that when it emerged from its retreat it would like the property be much dilapidated and extensively bled  let us not dwell upon the scene for george it was a very painful one so painful that he never quite forgot it his nose too was never so straight again it was soon over though to one of the parties time went with unnatural slowness  well i think youve had about enough for once soliloquized philip as he critically surveyed the writhing mass on the ground before him and he looked a very handsome lad as he said it  his curly black hair hung in waving confusion over his forehead and flung changing lights and shadows into the depths of his brown eyes whilst his massive and somewhat heavy features were touched into a more active life by the light of that pleasing excitement which animates nine men out of every ten of the anglosaxon race when they are engaged on killing or hurting some other living creature the face too had a certain dignity about it a little of the dignity of justice it was the face of one who feels that if his action has been precipitate and severe it has at any rate been virtuous the full but clearcut lips also had their own expression on them half serious half comical humour contempt and even pity were blended in it altogether philip caresfoots appearance in the moment of boyish vengeance was pleasing and not uninteresting  presently however something of the same change passed over his face that we see in the sky when a cloud passes over the sun the light faded out of it it was astonishing to note how dull and heavyay more how bad it made him look all in a breath  there will be a pretty business about this he murmured and then administering a sharp kick to the prostrate and groaning form on the ground before him he said now then get up im not going to touch you again perhaps though you wont be in quite such a hurry to tell lies about me another time though i suppose that one must always expect a certain amount of lying from a halfbred beggar like you like mother like son you know  this last sentence was accompanied by a bitter laugh and produced a decided effect on the grovelling george who slowly raised himself upon his hands and lifting his head looked his cousin full in the face  it was not the ghastly appearance of his mangled and bloodsoaked countenance that made philip recoil so sharply from the sight of his own handiworkhe had fought too often at school to be chickenhearted about a little bloodshed and besides he knew that his cousin was only knocked about not really injuredbut rather the intense and almost devilish malignity of the expression that hovered on the blurred features and in the halfclosed eyes but no attempt was made by george to translate the look into words and indeed philip felt that it was untranslatable he also felt dimly that the hate and malice with which he was regarded by the individual at his feet was of a more concentrated and enduring character than most men have the power to originate in the lurid light of that one glance he was able though he was not very clever to pierce the darkest recesses of his cousins heart and to see his inmost thought no longer through a veil but face to face and what he saw was sufficient to make the blood leave his ruddy cheek and to fix his eyes into an expression of fear  next second george dropped his head on to the ground again and began to moan in an ostentatious manner possibly in order to attract some one whose footsteps could be plainly heard proceeding slowly down a shrubberypath on the other side of the yard wall at any rate that was the effect produced for next moment before philip could think of escape had he wished to escape a door in the wall was opened and a gentleman pausing on the threshold surveyed the whole scene with the assistance of a goldmounted eyeglass with some evident surprise and little apparent satisfaction  the old gentleman for he was old made so pretty a picture framed as he was in the arched doorway and set off by a natural background of varying shades of green that his general appearance is worth sketching as he stood to begin with he was dressed in the fashion of the commencement of this century and as has been said old though it was difficult to say how old indeed so vigorous and comparatively youthful was his bearing that he was generally taken to be considerably under seventy but as a matter of fact he was but a few years short of eighty he was extremely tall over six feet and stood upright as a lifeguardsman indeed his height and stately carriage would alone have made him a remarkablelooking man had there been nothing else unusual about him but as it happened his features were as uncommon as his person they were clearcut and cast in a noble mould the nose was large and aquiline the chin like his son philips square and determined but it was his eyes that gave a painful fascination to his countenance they were steely blue and glittered under the penthouse of his thick eyebrows that in striking contrast to the snowwhite of his hair were black in hue as tempered steel glitters in a curtained room it was those eyes in conjunction with sundry little peculiarities of temper that had earned for the old man the title of devil caresfoot a sobriquet in which he took peculiar pride so pleased was he with it indeed that he caused it to be engraved in solid oak letters an inch long upon the form of a lifesized and lifelike portrait of himself that hung over the staircase in the house  i am determined he would say to his son to be known to my posterity as i was known to my contemporaries the picture represents my person not inaccurately from the nickname my descendants will be able to gather what the knaves and fools with whom i lived thought of my character ah boy i am wearing out people will soon be staring at that portrait and wondering if it was like me in a very few years i shall no longer be devil but devilled and he would chuckle at his grim and illomened joke  philip felt his fathers eyes playing upon him and shrunk from them his face had at the mere thought of the consequences of his chastisement of his cousin lost the beauty and animation that had clothed it a minute before now it grew leaden and hard the good died away from it altogether and instead of a young god bright with vengeance there was nothing but a sullen youth with dull and frightened eyes to his son as to most people who came under his influence devil caresfoot was a grave reality  presently the picture in the doorway opened its mouth and spoke in a singularly measured gentle voice  you will forgive me philip for interrupting your teteatete but may i ask what is the meaning of this  philip returned no answer  since your cousin is not in a communicative mood george perhaps you will inform me why you are lying on your face and groaning in that unpleasant and aggressive manner  george lifted his bloodstained face from the stones and looking at his uncle groaned louder than ever  may i ask you philip if george has fallen down and hurt himself or if there has been ananaltercation between you  here george himself got up and before philip could make any reply addressed himself to his uncle  sir he said i will answer for philip there has been an altercation and he in the scuffle knocked me down and i confess here he put his hand up to his battered face that i am suffering a good deal but what i want to say is that i beg you will not blame philip he thought that i had wronged him and though i am quite innocent and could easily have cleared myself had he given me a chance i must admit that appearances are to a certain extent against me  he lies broke in philip sullenly  you will wonder sir went on the bloodstained george how i allowed myself to be drawn into such a brutal affair and one so discreditable to your house i can only say that i am very sorry which indeed he wasand that i should never have taken any notice of his wordsknowing that he would regret them on reflectionhad he not in an unguarded moment allowed himself to taunt me with my birth uncle you know the misfortune of my fathers marriage and that she was not his equal in birth but you know too that she was my mother and i love her memory though i never saw her and i could not bear to hear her spoken of like that and i struck him i hope that both you and he will forgive me i cannot say any more  he lies again he cannot speak the truth  philip will you allow me to point out remarked his father in his blandest voice that the continued repetition of the very ugly word lie is neither narrative nor argument perhaps you will be so kind as to tell me your side of the story you know i always wish to be perfectly impartial  he lied to you this morning about the money its true enough that i gambled away the ten pounds at roxham fair instead of paying it into the bank as you told me but he persuaded me to it and he was to have shared the profits if we won i was a blackguard but he was a bigger blackguard why should i have all the blame and have that fellow continually shoved down my throat as a saint and so i thrashed him and that is all about it  sir i am sorry to contradict philip but indeed he is in error the recollection of what took place has escaped him i could if necessary bring forward evidencemr bellamy  there is no need george for you to continue and then fixing his glittering eye on philip it is very melancholy for me having only one son to know him to be such a brute such a bearer of false witness such an impostor as you are do you know that i have just seen mr bellamy the head clerk at the bank and inquired if he knew anything of what happened about that ten pounds and do you know what he told me  no i dont and i dont want to  but i really must beg your attention he told me that the day following the fair your cousin george came to the bank with ten pounds and told him how you had spent the ten pounds i gave you to pay in and that he brought the money his own savings to replace what you had gambled away and bellamy added that under all the circumstances he did not feel justified in placing it to my credit what have you to say to that  what have i to say i have to say that i dont believe a word of it if george had meant to do me a good turn he would have paid the money in and said nothing to bellamy about it why wont you trust me a little more father i tell you that you are turning me into a scoundrel i am being twisted up into a net of lies till i am obliged to lie myself to keep clear of ruin i know what this sneak is at he wants to work you into cutting me out of the property which should be mine by right he knows your weaknesses  my weaknesses sirmy weaknesses thundered his father striking his goldheaded cane on to the stones what do you mean by that  hush uncle he meant nothing broke in george  meant nothing then for an idle speech it is one that may cost him dear look you here philip caresfoot i know very well that our family has been quite as remarkable for its vices as its virtues but for the last two hundred and fifty years we have been gentlemen and you are not a gentleman we have not been thieves and you have proved yourself a thief we have spoken the truth and you are what you are so fond of calling your cousin who is worth two of you a liar now listen however imperious i may have grown in my old age i can still respect the man who thwarts me even though i hate him but i despise the man who deceives me as i despise you my dear son philipand i tell you this and i beg you to lay it to heart that if ever again i find that you have deceived me by heaven i will disinherit you in favour ofoh oh and the old man fell back against the grey wall pressing his hands to his breast and with the cold perspiration starting on to his pallid countenance  both the lads sprang forward but before they reached him he had recovered himself  it is nothing he said in his ordinary gentle voice a trifling indisposition i wish you both good morning and beg you to bear my words in mind  when he was fairly gone george came up to his cousin and laid his hand upon his arm  why do you insist upon quarrelling with me philip it always ends like this you always get the worst of it  but philips only reply was to shake him roughly off and to vanish through the door towards the lake george regarded his departing form with a peculiar smile which was rendered even more peculiar by the distortion of his swollen features                                  chapter ii  it is difficult to imagine any study that would prove more fascinating in itself or more instructive in its issues than the examination of the leading characteristics of individual families as displayed through a series of generations but it is a subject that from its very nature is more or less unapproachable since it is but little that we know even of our immediate ancestors occasionally in glancing at the cracking squares of canvas many of which cannot even boast a name but which alone remain to speak of the real and active life the joys and griefs the sins and virtues that centred in the originals of those hard daubs and of ourselves we may light upon a face that about six generations since was the counterpart of the little boy upon our shoulder or the daughter standing at our side in the same way too partly through tradition and partly by other means we are sometimes able to trace in ourselves and in our children the strong development of characteristics that distinguished the race centuries ago  if local tradition and such records of their individual lives as remained are worthy of any faith it is beyond a doubt that the caresfoots of bratham abbey had handed down their own hard and peculiar cast of character from father to son unaffected in the main by the continual introduction of alien blood on the side of the mother  the history of the caresfoot family had nothing remarkable about it they had been yeomen at bratham from time immemorial perhaps ever since the village had become a geographical fact but it was on the dissolution of the monasteries that they first became of any importance in the county bratham abbey which had shared the common fate was granted by henry viii to a certain courtier sir charles varry by name for two years the owner never came near his new possession but one day he appeared in the village and riding to the house of farmer caresfoot which was its most respectable tenement he begged him to show him the abbey house and the lands attached it was a dark november afternoon and by the time the farmer and his wearied guest had crossed the soaked lands and reached the great grey house the damps and shadows of the night had begun to curtain it and to render its appearance forsaken as it was inexpressibly dreary and lonesome  damp here my friend is it not said sir charles with a shudder looking towards the lake into which the rain was splashing  you are right it be  and lonely too now that the old monks have gone  ay but they do say that the house be mostly full of the spirits of the dead and the yeoman sank his voice to an awed whisper  sir charles crossed himself and muttered i can well believe it and then addressing his companion  you do not know of any man who would buy an abbey with all its rights and franchises do you friend  not rightly sir the land be so poor it hath no heart in it it doth scarce repay the tillage and what the house is you may see the curse of the monks is on it but still sir if you have a mind to be rid of the place i have a little laid by and a natural love for the land having been bred on it and taken the colour of my mind and my stubby growth therefrom and i will give you and this astutest of all the caresfoots whispered a very small sum into sir charles ear  your price is very small good friend it doth almost vanish into nothing and methinks the land that reared you cannot be so unkind as you would have me think the monks did not love bad land but yet if thou hast it in the gold i will take it it will pay off a debt or two and i care not for the burden of the land  and so farmer caresfoot became the lawful owner of bratham abbey with its two advowsons its royal franchises of treasuretrove and deodand and more than a thousand acres of the best land in marlshire  the same astuteness that had enabled this wise progenitor to acquire the estate enabled his descendants to stick tightly to it and though like other families they had at times met with reverses they never lost their grip of the abbey property during the course of the first half of the nineteenth century the land increased largely in value and its acreage was considerably added to by the father of the present owner a man of frugal mind but with the family mania for the collection of all sorts of plate strongly developed but it was philips father devil caresfoot who had during his fifty years tenure of the property raised the family to its present opulent condition firstly by a strict attention to business and the large accumulations resulting from his practice of always living upon half his income and secondly by his marriage late in middle life with miss bland the heiress of the neighbouring isleworth estates that stretched over some two thousand acres of land  this lady who was philips mother did not live long to enjoy her wealth and station her husband never spoke a rough word to her and yet it is no exaggeration to say that she died of fear of him the marriage had been one of convenience not of affection indeed poor anna bland had secretly admired the curate at isleworth and hated mr caresfoot and his glittering eye but she married him for all that to feel that till she died that glance was always playing round her like a rapier in the hands of a skilled fencer and very soon she did die mr caresfoot receiving her last words and wishes with the same exquisite and unmoved politeness that he had extended to every remark she had made to him in the course of their married life having satisfactorily eyed mrs caresfoot off into a better world her husband gave up all idea of further matrimonial ventures and set himself to heap up riches but a little before his wifes death and just after his sons birth an event had occurred in the family that had disturbed him not a little  his father had left two sons himself and a brother many years his junior now this brother was very dear to mr caresfoot his affection for him was the one weak point in his armour nor was it rendered any the less sincere but rather the more touching by the fact that its object was little better than halfwitted it is therefore easy to imagine his distress and anger when he heard that a woman who had till shortly before been kitchenmaid at the abbey house and was now living in the village had been confined of a son which she fixed upon his brother whose wife she declared herself to be investigation only brought out the truth of the story his weakminded brother had been entrapped into a glaring mesalliance  but mr caresfoot proved himself equal to the occasion so soon as his sisterinlaw as it pleased him to call her sardonically had sufficiently recovered he called upon her what took place at the visit never transpired but next day mrs e caresfoot left her native place never to return the child remaining with the father or rather with the uncle that boy was george at the time when this story opens both his parents were dead his father from illness resulting from entire failure of brain power the mother from drink  whether it was that he considered the circumstance of the lads birth entitled him to peculiar consideration or that he transferred to him the affection he bore his father the result was that his nephew was quite as dear if not even dearer to mr caresfoot than his own son not however that he allowed his preference to be apparent save in the negative way that he was blind to faults in george that he was sufficiently quick to note in philip to observers this partiality seemed the more strange when they thought upon philips bonny face and form and then noted how the weakbrained father and coarseblooded mother had left their mark in georges thick lips small restless eyes pallid complexion and loosejointed form  when philip shook off his cousins grasp and vanished towards the lake he did so with bitter wrath and hatred in his heart for he saw but too clearly that he had deeply injured himself in his fathers estimation and what was more he felt that so much as he had sunk his side of the balance by so much he had raised up that of george he was inculpated a bellamy came upon the scene to save george and what was worse an untruthful bellamy he was the aggressor and george the meek in spirit with the soft answer that turneth away wrath it was intolerable he hated his father he hated george there was no justice in the world and he had not wit to play rogue with such a one as his cousin appearances were always against him he hated everybody  and then he began to think that there was in the very next parish somebody whom he did not hate but who on the contrary interested him and was always ready to listen to his troubles and he also became aware of the fact that whilst his mind had been thinking his legs had been walking and that he was very near the abode of that personalmost at its gates in short he paused and looked at his watch it had stopped at halfpast eleven the one blow that george had succeeded in planting upon him having landed on it to the great detriment of both the watch and the strikers knuckles but the sun told him that it was about halfpast twelve not too early to call so he opened the gate and advancing up an avenue of old beeches to a square redbrick house of the time of queen anne boldly rang the bell  was miss lee at home yes miss lee was in the greenhouse perhaps mr philip would step into the garden which mr philip did accordingly  how do you do philip im delighted to see you youve just come in time to help in the slaughter  slaughter slaughter of whata pig  no green fly im going to kill thousands  you cruel girl  i daresay it is cruel but i dont care grumps always said that i had no heart and so far as green fly are concerned grumps was certainly right now just look at this lily it is an auratum i gave threeandsix out of my own money for that bulb last autumn and now the bloom is not worth twopence all through green fly if i were a man i declare i should swear please swear for me philip go outside and do it so that i maynt have it on my conscience but now for vengeance oh i say i forgot you know i suppose i ought to be looking very sorry  why whats the matter any one dead  oh no so much better than that its got grumps  got her what has got her what is it  why chancery of course i always call chancery it i wouldnt take its name in vain for worlds i am too much afraid i might be made to show a cause why and then be locked up for contempt which frequently happens after you have tried to show a cause that is what has happened to grumps she is now showing a cause shortly she will be locked up when she comes out if she ever does come out i think that she will avoid wards in chancery in future she will have too much sympathy with them and too much practical experience of their position  but what on earth do you mean maria what has happened to miss gregson anglice grumps  well you remember one of my guardians or rather his wife got it to appoint her my chaperon but my other guardian wanted to appoint somebody else and after taking eighteen months to do it he has moved the court to show that grumps is not a fit and proper person the idea of calling grumps improper she nearly fainted at it and swore that whether she lived through it or whether she didnt she would never come within a mile of me or any other ward if she could help it not even the ward of an hospital i told her to be careful or she would be committing contempt which frightened her so that she hardly spoke again till she left yesterday poor grumps i expect she is on bread and water now but if she makes herself half as disagreeable to the vicechancellor as she did to me i dont believe that they will keep her long shell wear the gaolers out she will wear the walls out she will wear it down to the bone and then they will let her loose upon the world again why there is the bell for lunch and not a single green fly the less never mind i will do for them tomorrow how it would add to her sufferings in her lonely cell if she could see us going to a teteatete lunch come on philip come quick or the cutlets will get cold and i hate cold cutlets and off she tripped followed by the laughing philip who by the way was now looking quite handsome again  maria lee was not very pretty at her then agejust eighteenbut she was a perfect specimen of a young english country girl fresh as a rose and sound as a bell and endowed besides with a quick wit and a ready sympathy she was essentially one of that class of englishwomen who make the english upper middle class what it isone of the finest and soundest in the world philip following her into the house thought that she was charming nor being a caresfoot and therefore having a considerable eye to the main chance did the fact of her being the heiress to fifteen hundred a year in land detract from her charms  the cutlets were excellent and maria ate three and was very comical about the departed grumps indeed anybody not acquainted with the circumstances would have gathered that that excellent lady was to be shortly put to the question philip was not quite so merry he was oppressed both by recollections of what had happened and apprehensions of what might happen  what is the matter philip she asked when they had left the table to sit under the trees on the lawn i can see that something is the matter tell me all about it philip  and philip told her what had happened that morning laying bare all his heartaches and not even concealing his evil deeds when he had done she pondered awhile tapping her little foot upon the turf  philip she said at last in quite a changed voice i do not think that you are being well treated i do not think that your cousin means kindly by you butbut i do not think that you have behaved rightly either i dont like that about the ten pounds and i think that you should not have touched george he is not so strong as you please try to do as your fatherdear me i am sure i dont wonder that you are afraid of him i amtells you and regain his affection and make it up with george and if you get into any more troubles come and tell me about them before you do anything foolish for though according to grumps i am silly enough two heads are better than one  the tears stood in the lads brown eyes as he listened to her he gulped them down however and said  you are awfully kind to me you are the only friend i have sometimes i think that you are an angel  nonsense philip if it heard you talk like that you would join grumps dont let me hear any more such stuff but though she spoke sharply somehow she did not look displeased  i must be off he said at length i promised to go with my father to see a new building on reynolds farm i have only twenty minutes to get home and rising they went into the house through a french window opening on to the lawn  in the diningroom he turned and after a moments hesitation stuttered out  maria dont be angry with me but may i give you a kiss  she blushed vividly  how dare you suggest such a thingbutbut as grumps has gone and there is no new grumps to refer to and therefore i can only consult my own wishes perhaps if you really wish to philip why philip you may  and he did  when he was gone she leant her head against the cold marble mantelpiece  i do love him she murmured yes that i do                                 chapter iii  philip was not very fond of taking walks with his father since he found that in nine cases out of ten they afforded opportunities for inculcation of facts of the driest description with reference to estate management or to the narration by his parent of little histories of which his conduct upon some recent occasion would adorn the moral on this particular occasion the prospect was particularly unpleasant for his father would he was well aware overflow with awful politeness indeed after the scene of the morning it could not be otherwise oh how much rather would he have spent that lovely afternoon with maria lee dear maria he would go and see her again the very next day  when he arrived some ten minutes after time in the antlerhung hall of the abbey house he found his father standing watch in hand exactly under the big clock as though he was determined to make a note by double entry of every passing second  when i asked you to walk with me this afternoon philip i if my memory does not deceive me was careful to say that i had no wish to interfere with any prior engagement i was aware how little interest compared to your cousin george you take in the estate and i had no wish to impose an uncongenial task but as you kindly volunteered to accompany me i regret that you did not find it convenient to be punctual to the time you fixed i have now waited for you for seventeen minutes and let me tell you that at my time of life i cannot afford to lose seventeen minutes may i ask what has delayed you  this long speech had given philip the opportunity of recovering the breath that he had lost in running home he replied promptly  i have been lunching with miss lee  oh indeed then i no longer wonder that you kept me waiting and i must say that in this particular i commend your taste miss lee is a young lady of good family good manners and good means if her estate went with this property it would complete as pretty a five thousand acres of mixed soil as there is in the county those are beautiful old meadows of hers beautiful perhaps but here the old man checked himself  on leaving the house they had passed together down a walk called the tunnel walk on account of the arching boughs of the limetrees that interlaced themselves overhead at the end of this avenue and on the borders of the lake there stood an enormous but still growing oak known as caresfoots staff it was the old squires favourite tree and the best topped piece of timber for many miles round  i wonder said philip by way of making a little pleasant conversation why that tree was called caresfoots staff  your ignorance astonishes me philip but i suppose that there are some people who can live for years in a place and yet imbibe nothing of its traditions perhaps you know that the monks were driven out of these ruins by henry viii well on the spot where that tree now stands there grew a still greater oak a giant tree its trunk measured sixteen loads of timber which had as tradition said been planted by the first prior of the abbey when england was still saxon the night the monks left a great gale raged over england it was in october when the trees were full of leaf and its fiercest gust tore the great oak from its roothold and flung it into the lake look do you see that rise in the sand there by the edge of the deep pool in the eight foot water that is there it is supposed to lie well the whole countryside said that it was a sign that the monks had gone for ever from bratham abbey and the countryside was right but when your ancestor old yeoman caresfoot bought this place and came to live here in a year when there was a great black frost that set the waters of the lake like one of the newfangled roads he asked his neighbours ay and his labouring folk to come and dine with him and drink to the success of his purchase it was a proud day for him and when dinner was done and they were all mellow with strong ale he bade them step down to the borders of the lake as he would have them be witness to a ceremony when they reached the spot they saw a curious sight for there on a strong dray and dragged by farmer caresfoots six best horses was an oak of fifty years growth coming across the ice earth roots and all  on that spot where it now stands there had been a great hole ten feet deep by fourteen feet square dug to receive it and into that hole caresfoot staff was tilted and levered off the dray and when it had been planted and the frozen earth well trodden in your grandfather in the ninth degree brought his guests back to the old banquetinghall and made a speech which as it was the first and last he ever made was long remembered in the countryside it was put into modern english something like this  neighbourspriors oak has gone into the water and folks said that it was for a sign that the monks would never come back to bratham and that it was the lords wind that put it there and neighbours as ye know the broad bratham lands and the fat marshes down by the brook passed by kings grant to a man that knew not clay from loam or layer from pasturage and from him they passed by the lords will to me as i have asked you here today to celebrate and now neighbours i have a mind and though it seem to you but a childish thing yet i have a mind and have set myself to fulfil it when i was yet a little lad and drove the swine out to feed on the hill yonder when the acorns had fallen afore farmer gyrtons father had gracious leave from the feoffees to put up the fence that doth now so sorely vex us i found one day a great acorn as big as a dows egg and of a rich and wondrous brown and this acorn i bore home and planted in kind earth in the corner of my dads garden thinking that it would grow and that one day i would hew its growth and use it for a staff now that was fifty long years ago lads and there where grew priors oak there neighbours i have set my staff today the monks have told us how in israel every man planted his fig and his vine for the fig i know not rightly what that is but for the vine i will plant no creeping clinging vine but a hearty english oak that if they do but give it good room to breathe in and save their heirloom from the axe shall cast shade and grow acorns and burst into leaf in the spring and grow naked in the winter when ten generations of our children and our childrens children shall have mixed their dust with ours yonder in the graveyard and now neighbours i have talked too long though i am better at doing than talking but ye will even forgive me for i will not talk to you again though on this the great day of my life i was minded to speak but i will bid you every man pledge a health to the caresfoots staff and ask a prayer that so long as it shall push its leaves so long may the race of my loins be here to sit beneath its shade and even mayhap when the corn is ripe and the moon is up and their hearts grow soft towards the past to talk with kinsman or with sweetheart of the old man who struck it in this kindly soil  the old squires face grew tender as he told this legend of the forgotten dead and philips young imagination summoned up the strange oldworld scene of the crowd of rustics gathered in the snow and frost round this very tree  philip said his father suddenly you will hold the yeomans staff one day be like it of an oaken english heart and you will defy wind and weather as it has done and as your forbears have done come we must go on  by the way philip he continued after a while you will remember what i said to you this morningi hope that you will remember it though i spoke in angernever try to deceive me again or you will regret it and now i have something to say to you i wish you to go to college and receive an education that will fit you to hold the position you must in the course of nature one day fill in the county the oxford term begins in a few days and you have for some years been entered at magdalen college i do not expect you to be a scholar but i do expect you to brush off your rough ways and your local ideas and to learn to become such a person both in your conduct and your mind as a gentleman of your station should be  is george to go to college too  no i have spoken to him on the subject and he does not wish it he says very wisely that with his small prospects he would rather spend the time in learning how to earn his living so he is going to be articled to the roxham lawyers foster and son or rather foster and bellamy for young bellamy who is a lawyer by profession came here this morning not to speak about you but on a message from the firm to say that he is now a junior partner and that they will be very happy to take george as an articled clerk he is a hardworking shrewd young man and it will be a great advantage to george to have his advice and example before him  philip assented and went on in silence reflecting on the curious change in his immediate prospects that this walk had brought to light he was much rejoiced at the prospect of losing sight of george for a while and was sufficiently intelligent to appreciate the advantages social and mental that the university would offer him but it struck him that there were two things which he did not like about the scheme the first of these was that whilst he was pursuing his academical studies george would practically be left on the spotfor roxham was only six miles offto put in motion any schemes he might have devised and philip was sure that he had devised schemes and the second that oxford was a long way from maria lee however he kept his objections to himself in due course they reached the buildings they had set out to examine and the old squire having settled what was to be done and what was to be left undone with characteristic promptitude and shrewdness they turned homewards  in passing through the shrubberies on their way back to the house they suddenly came upon a stolidlooking lad of about fifteen emerging from a sidewalk with a nest full of young blackbirds in his hand now if there was one thing in this world more calculated than another to rouse the most objectionable traits of the old squires character into rapid action it was the discovery of boys and more especially birdnesting boys in his plantations in the first place he hated trespassers and in the second it was one of his simple pleasures to walk in the early morning and listen to the singing of the birds that swarmed around accordingly at the obnoxious sight he stopped suddenly and drawing himself up to his full height addressed the trembling youth in his sweetest voice  your name is i believebradyjim bradycorrect me if i am wrong and you have come here youyouyoungvillainto steal my birds  the frightened boy walked slowly backwards followed by the old man with his fiery eyes fixed upon his face till at last concussion against the trunk of a great tree prevented further retreat here he stood for about thirty seconds writhing under the glance that seemed to pierce him through and through till at last he could stand it no longer but flung himself on the ground roaring  oh dont ee squire dont ee now look at me with that ere eye take and thrash me squire but dont ee fix me so i haynt had no more nor twenty this year and a nest of spinxes and tom smith hes had fiftytwo and a young owl oh oh  enraged beyond measure at this last piece of information mr caresfoot took his victim at his word and ceasing his ocular experiments laid into the less honourable portion of his form with the goldheaded malacca cane in a way that astonished the prostrate jim though he was afterwards heard to declare that the squires cane warnt not nothing compared with the squires eye which wore a hot coal it wore and frizzled your innards as sich  when jim brady had departed never to return again and the old man had recovered his usual suavity of manner he remarked to his son  there is some curious property in the human eye a property that is i believe very much developed in my own did you observe the effect of my glance upon that boy i was trying an experiment on him i remember it was always the same with your poor mother she could never bear me to look at her  philip made no reply but he thought that if she had been the object of experiments of that nature it was not very wonderful  shortly after their return home he received a note from miss lee it ran thus    my dear philip   what do you think just after you had gone away i got by the   midday post which jones the butcher brought from roxham   several letters amongst them one from grumps and one from uncle   tom grumps has shown a cause why it said she was not an   improper person but for all that she is so angry with uncle tom   that she will not come back but has accepted an offer to go to   canada as companion to a lady so farewell grumps   now for uncle tom it suggested that i should live with some   of my relations till i came of age and pay them four hundred a   year which i think a good deal i am sure it cant cost four   hundred a year to feed me though i have such an appetite i had   no idea they were all so fond of me before they all want me to   come and live with them except aunt chambers who you know   lives in jersey uncle tom says in his letter that he shall be   glad if his daughters can have the advantage of my example and of   studying my polished manners just fancy my polished manners   and i know because little tom who is a brick told me that only   last year he heard his father tell emilythats the eldestthat   i was a dowdy snubnosed illmannered miss but that she must   keep in with me and flatter me up no i will not live with uncle   tom and i will tell it so if i must leave my home i will go   to aunt chambers at jersey jersey is a beautiful place for   flowers and one learns french there without the trouble of   learning it and i like aunt chambers and she has no children   and nothing but the memory of a dear departed but i dont like   leaving home and feel very much inclined to cry hang the court   of chancery and uncle tom and his interference toothere i   suppose you cant find time to come over tomorrow morning to see   me off goodbye dear philip                                       your affectionate friend                                                      maria lee   philip did manage to find time next morning and came back looking very disconsolate                                  chapter iv  philip went to college in due course and george departed to learn his business as a lawyer in roxham but it will not be necessary for us to enter into the details of their respective careers during this period of their lives  at college philip did fairly well and being a caresfoot did not run into debt he was as his great bodily strength gave promise of a firstclass athlete and for two years stroked the magdalen boat nor did he altogether neglect his books but his reading was of a desultory and outoftheway order and much directed towards the investigation of mystical subjects fairly well liked amongst the men with whom he mixed he could hardly be called popular his temperament was too uncertain for that at times he was the gayest of the gay and then when the fit took him he would be plunged into a state of gloomy depression that might last for days his companions to whom his mystical studies were a favourite jest were wont to assert that on these occasions he was preparing for a visit from his familiar but the joke was one that he never could be prevailed upon to appreciate the fact of the matter was that these fits of gloom were constitutional with him and very possibly had their origin in the state of his mothers mind before his birth when her whole thoughts were coloured by her morbid and fanciful terror of her husband and her frantic anxiety to conciliate him  during the three years that he spent at college philip saw but little of george since when he happened to be down at bratham which was not often for he spent most of his vacations abroad george avoided coming there as much as possible indeed there was a tacit agreement between the two young men that they would see as little of each other as might be convenient but though he did not see much of him himself philip was none the less aware that georges influence over his father was if anything on the increase the old squires letters were full of him and of the admirable way in which he managed the estate for it was now practically in his hands indeed to his surprise and somewhat to his disgust he found that george began to be spoken of indifferently with himself as the young squire long before his college days had come to an end philip had determined that he would do his best as soon as opportunity offered to reduce his cousin to his proper place not by the violent means to which he had resorted in other days but rather by showing himself to be equally capable equally assiduous and equally respectful and affectionate  at last the day came when he was to bid farewell to oxford for good and in due course he found himself in a secondclass railway carriage thinking it useless to waste money he always went secondand bound for roxham  just before the train left the platform at paddington philip was agreeably surprised out of his meditations by the entry into his carriage of an extremely elegant and stately young lady a foreigner as he judged from her strong accent when she addressed the porter with the innate gallantry of twentyone he immediately laid himself out to make the acquaintance of one possessed of such proud yet melting blue eyes such lovely hair and a figure that would not have disgraced diana and with this view set himself to render her such little services as one fellowtraveller can offer to another they were accepted reservedly at first then gratefully and before long the reserve broke down entirely and this very handsome pair dropped into a conversation as animated as the ladys broken english would allow the lady told him that her name was hilda von holtzhausen that she was of a german family and had come to england to enter a family as companion in order to obtain a perfect knowledge of the english language she had already been to france and acquired french when she knew english then she had been promised a place as schoolmistress under government in her own country her father and mother were dead and she had no brothers or sisters and very few friends  where was she going to she was going to a place called roxham here it was written on the ticket she was going to be companion to a dear young lady very rich like all the english whom she had met when she had travelled with her french family to jersey a miss lee  you dont say so said philip has she come back to rewtham  what do you then know her  yesthat is i used to three years ago i live in the next parish  ah then perhaps you are the gentleman of whom i have heard her to speak mr caresfoot whom she did seem to appear to love is not that the wordto be very fond you know  philip laughed blushed and acknowledged his identity with the gentleman whom miss lee did seem to appear to love  oh i am glad then we shall be friends and see each other often shall we not  he declared unreservedly that she should see him very often  from fraulein von holtzhausen philip gathered in the course of their journey a good many particulars about miss lee it appeared that having attained her majority she was coming back to live at her old home at rewtham whither she had tried to persuade her aunt chambers to accompany her but without success that lady being too much attached to jersey to leave it during the course of a long stay on the island the two girls had become fast friends and the friendship had culminated in an offer being made by maria lee to fraulein von holtzhausen to come and live with her as a companion a proposal that exactly suited the latter  the mention of miss lees name had awakened pleasant recollections in philips mind recollections that at any other time might have tended towards the sentimental but when under fire from the blue eyes of this stately foreigner it was impossible for him to feel sentimental about anybody save herself the journey is over all too soon was the secret thought of each as they stepped on to the roxham platform before they had finally said goodbye however a young lady with a dainty figure in a shady hat and pink and white dress came running along the platform  hilda hilda here i am how do you do dear welcome home and she was about to seal her welcome with a kiss when her eye fell upon philip standing by  oh philip she cried with a blush dont you know me have i changed much i should have known you anywhere and i am glad to see you awfully glad excuse the slang but it is such a relief to be able to say awful without being pulled up by aunt chambers just think it is three years since we met do you remember grumps how do i look do you think you will like me as much as you used to  i think that you are looking the same dear girl that you always used to look only you have grown very pretty and it is not possible that i shall like you more than i used to  i think they must teach you to pay compliments at oxford philip she answered flushing with pleasure but it is all rubbish for you to say that i am pretty because i know i am notand then confidentially glancing round to see that there was nobody within hearing hilda was engaged with a porter in looking after her things just look at my nose and you will soon change your mind its broader and flatter and snubbier than ever i consider that i have got a bone to pick with providence about that nose ah here comes hilda isnt she lovely theres beauty for you if you like she hasnt got a nose come and show us to the carriage you will come and lunch with us tomorrow wont you i am so glad to get back to the old house again and i mean to have such a garden life is short and joys are fleeting as aunt chambers always says so i mean to make the best of it whilst it lasts i saw your father yesterday he is a dear old man though he has such awful eyes i never felt so happy in my life as i do now goodbye one oclock and she was gone leaving philip with something to think about  philips reception at home was cordial and reassuring he found his father considerably aged in appearance but as handsome and upright as ever and to all appearance heartily glad to see him  i am glad to see you back my boy he said you come to take your proper place if you look at me you will see that you wont have long to wait before you take mine i cant last much longer philip i feel that eightytwo is a good age to have reached i have had my time and put the property in order and now i suppose i must make room i went with the clerk old jakes and marked out my grave yesterday theres a nice little spot the other side of the stone that they say marks where old yeoman caresfoot who planted caresfoots staff laid his bones and thats where i wish to be put in his good company dont forget that when the time comes philip theres room for another if you care to keep it for yourself but perhaps you will prefer the vault  you must not talk of dying yet father you will live many years yet  no philip perhaps one perhaps two not more than two perhaps a month perhaps not a day my life hangs on a thread now and he pointed to his heart it may snap any day if it gets a strain by the way philip you see that cupboard open it now you see that stoppered bottle with the red label good well now if ever you see me taken with an attack of the heart i have had one since you were away you know and it nearly carried me off you run for that as hard as you can go and give it me to drink half at a time it is a tremendous restorative of some sort and old caley says that if i do not take it when the next attack comes therell be an end of devil caresfoot and he rapped his cane energetically on the oak floor  and so philip i want you to go about and make yourself thoroughly acquainted with the property so that you may be able to take things over when i die without any hitch i hope that you will be careful and do well by the land remember that a big property like this is a sacred trust  and now there are two more things that i will take this opportunity to say a word to you about first i see that you and your cousin george dont get on well and it grieves me you have always had a false idea of george always and thought that he was underhand nothing could be more mistaken than such a notion george is a most estimable young man and my dear brothers only son i wish you would try to remember that philipblood is thicker than water you know and you will be the only two caresfoots left when i am gone now perhaps you may think that i intend enriching george at your expense but that is not so take this key and open the top drawer of that secretaire and give me that bundle this is my will if you care to look over it and can understand itwhich is more than i canyou will see that everything is left to you with the exception of that outlying farm at holston those three essex farms that i bought two years ago and twelve thousand pounds in cash of course as you know the abbey house and the lands immediately round are entailedit has always been the custom to entail them for many generations there put it back and now the last thing is i want you to get married philip i should like to see a grandchild in the house before i die i want you to marry maria lee i like the girl she comes of a good old marlshire stockour family married into hers in the year 1703 besides her property would put yours into a ringfence she is a sharp girl too and quite pretty enough for a wife i hope you will think it over philip  yes father but perhaps she will not have me i am going to lunch there tomorrow  i dont think you need be afraid philip but i wont keep you any longer shake hands my boy youll perhaps think of your old father kindly when you come to stand in his shoes i hope you will philip we have had many a quarrel and sometimes i have been wrong but i have always wished to do my duty by you my boy dont forget to make the best of your time at lunch tomorrow  philip went out of his fathers study considerably touched by the kindness and consideration with which he had been treated and not a little relieved to find his position with reference to his succession to the estate so much better than he had anticipated and his cousin georges so much worse  that redhaired fox has plotted in vain he thought with secret exultation and then he set himself to consider the desirability of falling in with his fathers wishes as regards marriage of maria he was as the reader is aware very fond indeed a few years before he had been in love with her or something very like it he knew too that she would make him a very good wife and the match was one that in every way commended itself to his common sense and his interests yes he would certainly take his fathers advice but every time he said this to himselfand he said it pretty often that eveningthere would arise before his minds eye a vision of the sweet blue eyes of miss lees stately companion what eyes they were to be sure it made philips blood run warm and quick merely to think of them indeed he could almost find it in his heart to wish that hilda was maria and maria was in hildas shoes  what between thoughts of the young lady he had set himself to marry and of the young lady he did not mean to marry but whose eyes he admired philip did not sleep so well as usual that night                                  chapter v  philip did not neglect to go to luncheon at rewtham house and a very pleasant luncheon it was indeed it would have been difficult for him to have said which he found the pleasantest marias cheerful chatter and flattering preference or hildas sweet and gracious presence  after luncheon at marias invitation he gave fraulein von holtzhausen her first lesson in writing in english character and to speak truth he found the task of guiding her fair hand through the mysteries of the english alphabet a by no means uncongenial occupation when he came away his admiration of hildas blue eyes was more pronounced than ever but on the other hand so was his conviction that he would be very foolish if he allowed it to interfere with his intention of making maria lee his wife  he who would drive two women thus in double harness must needs have a light hand and a ready lash and it is certainly to the credit of philips cleverness that he managed so well as he did for as time went on he discovered his position to be this both hilda and maria were in love with him the former deeply and silently the latter openly and ostensibly now however gratifying this fact might be to his pride it was in some ways a thorny discovery since he dared not visibly pay his attentions to either for his part he returned hilda von holtzhausens devotion to a degree that surprised himself his passion for her burnt him like a fire utterly searing away the traces of his former affection for maria lee under these circumstances most young men of twentyone would have thrown prudence to the winds and acknowledged either by acts or words the object of their love but not so philip who even at that age was by no means deficient in the characteristic caution of the caresfoot family he saw clearly that his father would never consent to his marriage with hilda nor to speak truth did he himself at all like the idea of losing miss lee and her estates  on the other hand he knew hildas proud and jealous mind she was no melting beauty who would sigh and submit to an affront but for all her gracious ways at heart a haughty woman who if she reigned at all would reign like alexander unrivalled and alone that she was well aware of her friends tendresse for philip the latter very shortly guessed indeed as he suspected maria was in the habit of confiding to her all her hopes and fears connected with himself a suspicion that made him very careful in his remarks to that young lady  the early summer passed away whilst philip was still thinking over his position and the face of the country was blushing with all the glory of july when one afternoon he found himself as he did pretty frequently in the shady drawingroom at miss lees as he entered the sound of voices told him that there were other visitors beside himself and as soon as his eyes had grown accustomed to the light he saw his cousin george together with his partner mr bellamy and a lady with whom he was not acquainted  george had improved in appearance somewhat since we last saw him meeting with severe treatment at his cousins hands the face had filled up a little with the result that the nose did not look so hooked nor the thick lips so coarse and sensual the hair however was as red as ever and as for the small lightblue eyes they twinkled with the added sharpness and lustre that four years of such experience of the shady side of humanity as can be gathered in a lawyers office is able to give to the student of men and manners  so soon as philip had said howdoyoudo to maria and hilda giving to each a gentle pressure of the hand george greeted him with warmth  how are you philip delighted to see you how is my uncle bellamy saw him this morning and thought that he did not look well  i certainly did think mr philip said the gentleman alluded to a very younglooking applefaced little man with a timid manner who stood in the background nervously rubbing his dry hands togetheri certainly did think that the squire looked aged when i saw him this morning  well you see mr bellamy eightytwo is a good age is it not said philip cheerfully  yes mr philip a good age a very good age for the next heir and mr bellamy chuckled softly somewhere down in his throat and retreated a little  he is getting facetious broke in george that marriage has done that for him by the way philip do you know mrs bellamy she has only been down here a fortnight you know what no then you have a pleasure to come raising his voice so that it might be heard at the other end of the room a very clever woman and as handsome as she is clever  indeed i must ask you to introduce me presently mr bellamy i only recently heard that you were married  mr bellamy blushed and twisted and was about to speak when george cut in again  no i dare say you didnt sly dog bellamy do you know what he did i introduced him to the lady when we were up in town together last christmas i was dreadfully hard hit myself i can assure you and as soon as my back was turned he went and cut me out of the waterand turned my adored into mrs bellamy  what are you taking my name in vain about mr caresfoot said a rich low voice behind them  bless me anne how softly you move you quite startled me said little mr bellamy putting on his spectacles in an agitated manner  my dear a wife like an embodied conscience should always be at her husbands shoulder especially when he does not know it  bellamy made no reply but looked as though the sentiment was one of which he did not approve meantime the lady repeated her question to george and the two fell into a bantering conversation philip having dropped back a little had an opportunity of carefully observing mrs bellamy an occupation not without interest for she was certainly worthy of notice  about twenty years of age and of medium height her figure was so finely proportioned and so roomily made that it gave her the appearance of being taller than she really was the head was set squarely on the shoulders the hair was cut short and clustered in ringlets over the low broad brow whilst the clearly carved egyptian features and square chin gave the whole face a curious expression of resoluteness and power the eyes were heavilylidded and greyishgreen in hue with enormously large dark pupils that had a strange habit of expanding and contracting without apparent reason  gazing at her philip was at a loss to know whether this woman so bizarrely beautiful fascinated or repelled him indeed neither then nor at any future time did he succeed in deciding the question whilst he was still contemplating and wondering how bellamy of all people in the world had managed to marry such a woman and what previous acquaintance george had had with her he saw the lady whisper something to his cousin who at once turned and introduced him  philip he said let me introduce you to the most charming lady of my acquaintance mrs bellamy  philip bowed and expressed himself delighted whilst the lady curtsied with a mixture of grace and dignity that became her infinitely well  your cousin has often spoken to me of you mr caresfoot but he never told me here she hesitated and broke off  what did he never tell you mrs bellamy nothing to my disadvantage i hope  on the contrary if you wish to know she said in that tone of flattering frankness which is sometimes so charming in a womans mouth he never told me that you were young and handsome i fancied you forty at least  i should dearly like to tell you mrs bellamy what my cousin george never told me but i wont for fear i should make bellamy jealous  jealousy mr caresfoot is a luxury that my husband is not allowed to indulge in it is very well for lovers but what is a compliment in a lover becomes an impertinence in a husband but if i keep you here much longer i shall be drawing the enmity of miss lee andyes of fraulein von holtzhausen too on to my devoted head and as that is the only sort of jealousy i have any fear of or indeed any respect for being as it is the expression of the natural abhorrence of one woman for another i had rather avoid it  philip followed the direction of her sleepy eyes and saw that both miss lee and hilda appeared to be put out the former was talking absently to mr bellamy and glancing continually in the direction of that gentlemans wife the latter too whilst appearing to listen to some compliment from george was gazing at mrs bellamy with a curious look of dislike and apprehension in her face  you see what i mean fraulein von holtzhausen actually looks as though she were afraid of me can you fancy any one being afraid of me except my husband of coursefor as you know when a woman is talking of men her husband is always excepted come we must be going but mr caresfoot bend a little nearer if you will accept it from such a stranger i want to give you a bit of advicemake your choice pretty soon or you will lose them both  what do you meanhow do you know  i mean nothing at all or just as much as you like and for the rest i use my eyes come let us join the others  a few minutes later hilda put down her work and declaring that she felt hot threw open the french window and went out into the garden whither on some pretext or other philip followed her  what a lovely woman that is said mrs bellamy with enthusiasm to miss lee as soon as philip was out of earshot her tout ensemble positively kills one i feel plain and dowdy as a milkmaid alongside of a courtbeauty when i am in the room with her dont you miss lee  oh i dont know i never thought about it but of course she is lovely and im plain so there is no possibility of comparison between us  well i think you rate yourself rather low if you will allow me to say so but most women would but poorly satisfy the sight of a man when she was present i know that i should not care to trust my admirer if i had one however devoted he might be for a single day in her company would you  i really dont know what do you mean  mean miss lee why i mean nothing at all what should i mean except that beauty is a magnet which attracts all men it serves them for a standard of morality and a test of right and wrong men are different from women if a man is faithful to one of us it is only because no other woman of sufficient charm has become between him and us you can never trust a man  what dreadful ideas you have  do you think so i hope not i only speak what i have observed take the case of fraulein von holtzhausen for instance did you not notice that whilst she was in the room the eyes of the three gentlemen were all fixed upon her and as soon as she leaves it one of them follows her as the others would have done had they not been forestalled one cannot blame them they are simply following a natural law any other man would do the same where such a charming person is concerned  i certainly did not notice it indeed to speak the truth i thought that they were more occupied with you  with me why my dear miss lee i dont set up for being good looking what a strange idea but i dare say you are right it is only one of my theories based upon my own casual observations and after all men are not a very interesting subject are they lets talk of something more excitingdresses for instance  but poor maria was too uncomfortable and disturbed to talk of anything else so she collapsed into silence and shortly after mr and mrs bellamy and george made their adieux  meanwhile philip and hilda had been walking leisurely down the shrubberies adjoining the house  why have you come out she asked in german a language he understood well  to walk with you why do you speak to me in german  because it is my pleasure to do so and i never asked you to walk with me you are wanted in the drawingroom you had better go back  no i wont go hilda that is not until you have promised me something  do not call me hilda if you please i am the fraulein von holtzhausen what is it you want me to promise  i want you to meet me this evening at nine oclock in the summer house  i think mr caresfoot that you are forgetting a little what is due to me to yourself andto miss lee  what do you mean by due to miss lee  simply that she is in love with you and that you have encouraged her in her affection you need not contradict me she tells me all about it  nonsense hilda if you will meet me tonight i will explain everything there is no need for you to be jealous  she swept round upon him tossing her head and stamping her dainty foot upon the gravel  mr caresfoot she said once and for all i am not jealous and i will not meet you i have too much respect for myself and too little for you and she was gone  philips face as he stood looking after her was not pleasant to see it was very hard and angry  jealous is she i will give her something to be jealous for the proud minx and in his vexation he knocked off the head of a carnation with his stick  philip what are you doing those are my pet australian carnations at least i think they are australian how can you destroy them like that  all right maria i was only plucking one for you wont you put it in your dress where are the others  they have all gone come in it is so hot out there and tell me what you think of mrs bellamy  i think that she is very handsome and very clever i wonder where bellamy picked her up  i dont know i wish he hadnt picked her up at all i dont like her she says unpleasant things and though i have only seen her three times she seems to know all about me and everybody else i am not very quick but do you know just now i thought that she was insinuating that you were in love with hilda thats not true is it philip dont think me forward if i ask you if that is true and if i say that if it is it is better that i should know it i shant be angry philip and the girl stood before him to await his answer one hand pressed against her bosom to still the beating of her heart whilst with the other she screened her blushing brow  and philip too stood face to face with her sweet self with conscience and with opportunity now whispered conscience is the time before very much harm is done now is the acceptable time to tell her all about it and whilst forbidding her love to enlist her sympathy and friendship it will be wrong to encourage her affection when you ardently love another woman you cannot palter any more now whispered opportunity shouldering conscience aside is the time to secure her her love and her possessions and to reward hilda for her pride do not sacrifice yourself to an infatuation do not tell her about hildait would only breed jealousies you can settle with her afterwards take the goods the gods provide you  all this and more passed through his mind and he had made his choice long before the rich blood that mantled in the ladys cheek had sunk back to the true breast from whence it came  oh instant of time born to colour all eternity to thine own hue for this man thou hast come and gone oh fleeting moment bearing desolation or healing on thy wings how the angels in whose charge lie the souls of men must tremble and turn pale as they mark thy flight through the circumstances of a mans existence and thence taking thy secrets with thee away to add thy fateful store to the records of his past  he took her hand the hand that was pressed upon her bosom  maria he said you should not get such ideas into your head i admire hilda very much and that is all why dear i have always looked upon myself as half engaged to youthat is so far as i am concerned and i have only been waiting till circumstances would allow me to do so to ask you if you think me worth marrying  for a while she made no reply but only blushed the more at last she looked up a little  you have made me very happy philip that was all she said  i am very glad dear that you can find anything in me to like but if you do care for me and think me worth waiting for i am going to ask something of your affection i am going to ask you to trust me as well as to love me i do not for reasons that i will not enter into but which i beg you to believe are perfectly straightforward wish anything to be said of our engagement at present not even to your friend hilda do you trust me sufficiently to agree to that  philip i trust you as much as i love you and for years i have loved you with all my heart and now dear please go i want to think  in the hall a servant gave him a note it was from hilda and ran thus  i have changed my mind i will meet you in the summerhouse this evening i have something to say to you  philip whistled as he read it  devilish awkward he thought to himself if i am going to marry maria she must leave this but i cannot bear to part with her i love her i love her                                  chapter vi  it was some time before philip could make up his mind whether or no he would attend his tryst with hilda in the first place he felt that it was an unsafe proceeding generally inasmuch as moonlight meetings with so lovely a person might should they come to the knowledge of miss lee be open to misconstruction and particularly because should she show the least tenderness towards him he knew in his heart that he could not trust himself however much he might be engaged in another direction at twentyone the affections cannot be outraged with impunity but have an awkward way of asserting themselves ties of honour notwithstanding  but as a rule when in our hearts we wish to do anything that thing must be bad indeed if we cannot find a satisfactory excuse for doing it and so it was with philip now thought he to himself would be his opportunity to inform hilda of his relations with maria lee and to put an end to his flirtation with her for ostensibly at any rate it was nothing more than a very serious flirtationthat is to say though there had been words of love and even on her part a passionate avowal of affection wrung in an unguarded moment from the depths of her proud heart there had been no formal engagement it was a thing that must be done and now was the time to do it and so he made up his mind to go  but when that night he found himself sitting in the appointed place and waiting for the coming of the woman he was about to discard but whom he loved with all the intensity of his fierce nature he began to view the matter in other lights and to feel his resolution oozing from him whether it was the silence of the place that told upon his nerves strained as they were with expectationfor silence and more especially silence by night is a great unveiler of realitiesor the dread of bitter words or the prescience of the sharp pang of parting for he knew enough of hilda to know that what he had to say once said she would trouble him no morewhether it was these things or whatever it was that affected him he grew most unaccountably anxious and depressed moreover in this congenial condition of the atmosphere of his mind all its darker and hidden characteristics sprang into a vigorous growth superstitions and presentiments crowded in upon him he peopled his surroundings with the shades of intangible deeds that yet awaited doing and grew afraid of his own thoughts he would have fled from the spot but he could not fly he could only watch the flicker of the moonlight upon the peaceful pool beside him andwait  at last she came with quick and anxious steps and though but a few minutes before he had dreaded her coming he now welcomed it eagerly for our feelings of whatever sort when directed towards each other are so superficial as compared with the intensity of our fears when we are terrified by calamity or the presence real or fancied of the unknown that in any moment of emergency more especially if it be of a mental kind we are apt to welcome our worst enemy as a drowning man welcomes a spar  at last he said with a sigh of relief how late you are  i could not get away there were some people to dinner and then in a softened voice how pale you look are you ill  no only a little tired  after this there was silence and the pair stood facing one another each occupied with their own thoughts and each dreading to put them into words once philip made a beginning of speech but his voice failed him the beating of his heart seemed to choke his utterance  at length she leaned as though for support against the trunk of a pinetree in the boughs of which the night breeze was whispering and spoke in a cold clear voice  you asked me to meet you here tonight have you anything to say to me no do not speak perhaps i had better speak first i have something to say to you and what i have to say may influence whatever is in your mind listen you remember what passed between us nearly a month ago when i was so weak as to let you see how much i loved you  philip bowed his head in assent  very good i have come here tonight not to give you any lovers meeting but to tell you that no such words must be spoken again and that i am about to make it impossible that they should be spoken either by you or by me i am going away from here never i hope to return  going away he gasped when  here was the very thing he hoped for coming to pass and yet the words that should have been so full of comfort fell upon him cold as ice and struck him into misery  when why tomorrow morning a relation of mine is ill in germany the only one i have i never saw him and care nothing for him but it will give me a pretext and once gone i shall not return i have told maria that i must go she cried about it poor girl  at these words all recollection of his purpose passed out of philips mind all he realized was that unless he could alter her determination he was about the lose the woman he so passionately adored and whose haughty pride was to him in itself more charming than all poor marias gentle love  hilda do not go he said seizing her hand which she immediately withdrew do not leave me you know how i love you  and why should i not leave you even supposing it to be true that you do love me to my cost i love you and am i any longer to endure the daily humiliation of seeing myself the poor german companion who has nothing but her beauty put aside in favour of another whom i also love you say you love me and bid me stay now tell me what is your purpose towards me do you intend to try to take advantage of my infatuation to make me your mistress it is i am told a common thing for such proposals to be made to women in my position whom it would be folly for wealthy gentlemen to marry if so abandon that idea for i tell you philip that i would rather die than so disgrace my ancient name to gratify myself i know you moneyloving english do not think very much of race unless the bearers of the name are rich but we do and although you would think it a mesalliance to marry me i on the other hand should not be proud of an alliance with you why philip my ancestors were princes of royal blood when yours still herded the swine in these woods i can show more than thirty quarterings upon my shield each the mark of a noble house and i will not be the first to put a bar sinister across them now i have spoken plainly indelicately perhaps and there is only one more word to be said between us and that word is goodbye and she held out her hand  he did not seem to see it indeed he had scarcely heard the latter part of what she said presently he lifted his face and it bore traces of a dreadful inward struggle it was deadly pale and great black rings had painted themselves beneath the troubled eyes  hilda he said hoarsely dont go i cannot bear to let you go i will marry you  think of what you are saying philip and do not be rash i do not wish to entrap you into marriage you love money remember that maria with all her possessions asks nothing better than to become your wife and that i have absolutely nothing but my name and my good looks look at me and she stepped out into a patch of moonlight that found its way between the trees and drawing the filmy shawl she wore from her head and bare neck and bosom stood before him in all the brightness of her beauty shaded as it was and made more lovely by the shadows of the night  examine me very carefully she went on with bitter sarcasm look into my features and study my form and carriage or you may be disappointed with your bargain and complain that you have not got your moneys worth remember too that an accident an illness and at the best the passage of a few years may quite spoil my value as a beautiful woman and reflect before i take you at your word  philip had sat or rather crouched himself down upon the log of a tree that lay outside the summerhouse and covered his face with his hand as though her loveliness was more than he could bear to look upon now however he raised his eyes and let them dwell upon her scornful features  i had rather he said slowlyi had rather lose my life than lose you i love you so that i would buy you at the price even of my honour when will you marry me  what have you made up your mind so quickly are you sure then and here she changed her whole tone and bearing and passionately stretched out her arms towards himmy dearest philip my life my love i will marry you when you will  tomorrow  tomorrow if you like  you must promise me something first  what is it  that you will keep the marriage a complete secret and bear another name until my fathers death if you do not he will most probably disinherit me  i do not like your terms philip i do not like secret marriages but you are giving up much to marry me so i suppose i must give up something to marry you  you solemnly promise that nothing shall induce you to reveal that you are my wife until i give you permission to do so  i promisethat is provided you do not force me to in selfdefence  philip laughed  you need not fear that he said but how shall we arrange about getting married  i can meet you in london  very well i will go up early tomorrow and get a licence and then on wednesday i can meet you and we can be married  as you will philip where shall i meet you  he gave her an address which she carefully noted down  now she said you must go it is late yes you may kiss me now there that will do now go in another minute he was gone  i have won the game she mused poor maria i am sorry for her but perhaps hers is the better part she will get over it but mine is a sad fate i love passionately madly but i do not trust the man i love why should our marriage be so secret he cannot be entangled with maria or she would have told me and she stretched out her arms towards the path by which he had left her and cried aloud in the native tongue that sounded so soft upon her lips oh my hearts darling if i could only trust you as well as i love you it is a happy woman that i should be tonight                                 chapter vii  nothing occurred to interfere with the plan of action decided on by hilda and philip no misadventure came to mock them dashing the tantalus cup of joy to earth before their eyes on the contrary within fortyeight hours of the conversation recorded in the last chapter they were as completely and irrevocably man and wife as a special licence and the curate of a city church assisted by the clerk and the pewopener could make them  then followed a brief period of such delirium as turned the london lodgings dingy and stuffy as they were in the height of the hot summer into an earthly paradise a garden of eden into which alas the serpent had no need to seek an entrance but as was natural when the first glory of realized happiness was beginning to grow faint on their horizon the young couple turned themselves to consider their position and found in it mutually and severally many things that did not please them for philip indeed it was full of anxieties for he had many complications to deal with first there was his secret engagement to maria lee of which be it remembered his wife was totally ignorant and which was in itself a sufficiently awkward affair for a married man to have on his hands then there was the paramount need of keeping his marriage with hilda as secret as the dead to say nothing of the necessity of his living for the most part away from his wife indeed his only consolation was that he had plenty of money on which to support her inasmuch as his father had from the date of his leaving oxford made him an allowance of one thousand a year  hilda had begun to discover that she was not without her troubles for one thing her husbands fits of moodiness and fretful anxiety troubled her and led her possessed as she was with a more than ordinary share of womanly shrewdness to suspect that he was hiding something from her but what chiefly vexed her proud nature was the necessity of concealment and all its attendant petty falsehoods and subterfuges it was not pleasant for hilda caresfoot to have to pass as mrs roberts and to be careful not to show herself in public places in the daytime where there was a possibility of her being seen by any one who might recognize in her striking figure the lady who had lived with miss lee in marlshire it was not pleasant to her to be obliged to reply to maria lees affectionate letters full as they were of entreaty for her return by epistles that had to be forwarded to a country town in a remote district of germany to be posted and which were in themselves full of lies that however white they might have seemed under all the circumstances she felt in her conscience to be very black indeed in short there was in their union none of that sense of finality and of security that is under ordinary circumstances the distinguishing mark of marriage in this country it partook rather of the nature of an illicit connection  at the end of a fortnight of wedded bliss all these little things had begun to make themselves felt and in truth they were but the commencement of evils for one afternoon philip for the first time since his wedding tore himself away from his wifes side and paid a visit to a club to which he had been recently elected here he found no less than three letters from his father the first requesting his return the second commanding it in exceptionally polite language and the thirdwhich written in mingled anxiety and anger had just arrivedcoolly announcing his parents intention should he not hear of him by return of setting detective officers to work to discover his whereabouts from this letter it appeared indeed that his cousin george had already been despatched to london to look for him and on reference to the hall porter he discovered that a gentleman answering to his description had already inquired for him several times  cursing his own folly in not having kept up some communication with his father he made the best of his way back to his lodgings to find hilda waiting for him somewhat disconsolately  i am glad you have come back love she said drawing him towards her till his dark curls mingled with her own fair locks and kissing him upon the forehead i have missed you dreadfully i dont understand how i can have lived all these years without you  i am afraid dear you will have to live without me for a while now listen and he read her the letters he had just received  she listened attentively till he had finished  what are you going to do she asked with some anxiety in her voice  do why of course i must go home at once  and what am i to do  well i dont know i suppose that you must stop here  that will be pleasant for me will it not  no dear it will be pleasant neither for you nor me but what can i do you know the man my father is to deal with if i stop here in defiance to his wishes especially as he has been anxious about me there is no knowing what might not happen remember hilda that we have to deal with george whose whole life is devoted to secret endeavours to supplant me if i were to give him such an opportunity as i should by stopping away now i should deserve all i got or rather all i did not get  hilda sighed and acquiesced had she been a softerminded woman she would have wept and relieved her feelings but she was not soft minded and so before the post went out he wrote an affectionate letter to his father expressing his sorrow at the latters anxiety at at his own negligence in not having written to him the fact of the matter being he said that he had been taken up with visiting some of his oxford friends and had not till that afternoon been near his club to look for letters he would however he added return on the morrow and make his apologies in person  this letter he handed to his wife to read  do you think that will do he asked when she had finished  oh yes she replied with a touch of her old sarcasm it is a masterpiece of falsehood  philip looked very angry and fumed and fretted but he made no reply and on the following morning he departed to bratham abbey  ah philip philip said his father under the mellow influence of his fourth glass of port on the night of his arrival i know well enough what kept you up in town well well i dont complain young men will be young men but dont let these affairs interfere with the business of life remember maria lee my boy you have serious interests in that direction interests that must not be trifled with interests that i have a right to expect you will not trifle with  his son made no reply but sipped his wine in silence aching at his heart for his absent bride and wondering what his father would say did he really know what had kept him in town  after this matters went on smoothly enough for a month or more since fortunately for philip the great maria lee question a question that the more he considered it the more thorny did it appear was for the moment shelved by the absence of that young lady on a visit to her aunt in the isle of wight twice during that month he managed on different pretexts to get up to london and visit his wife whom he found as patient as was possible under the circumstances but anything but happy indeed on the second occasion she urged on him strongly the ignominy of her position and even begged him to make a clean breast of it to his father offering to undertake the task herself he refused equally warmly and some sharp words ensued to be however quickly followed by a reconciliation  on his return from this second visit philip found a note signed affectionately yours maria lee waiting for him which announced that young ladys return and begged him to come over to lunch on the following day  he wentindeed he had no alternative but to go and again fortune favoured him in the person of a diffident young lady who was stopping with maria and who never left her side all that afternoon much to the disgust of the latter and the relief of philip one thing however he was not spared and that was the perusal of hildas last letter to her friend written apparently from germany and giving a lively description of the writers daily life and the state of her uncles health which she said precluded all possibility of her return alas he already knew its every line too well for as hilda refused to undertake the task he had but a week before drafted it himself but philip was growing hardened to deception and found it possible to read it from end to end and speculate upon its contents with maria without blush or hesitation  but he could not always expect to find miss lee in the custody of such an obtuse friend and needless to say it became a matter of very serious importance to him to know how he should treat her it occurred to him that his safest course might be to throw himself upon her generosity and make a clean breast of it but when it came to the point he was too weak to thus expose his shameful conduct to the woman whose heart he had won and to whom he was bound by every tie of honour that a gentleman holds sacred  he thought of the scornful wonder with which she would listen to his tale and preferred to take the risk of greater disaster in the future to the certainty of present shame in the end he contrived to establish a species of confidential intimacy with maria which whilst it somewhat mystified the poor girl was not without its charm inasmuch as it tended to transform the everyday philip into a hero of romance  but in the main maria was illsuited to play heroine to her wooers hero herself as open as the daylight it was quite incomprehensible to her why their relationship should be kept such a dark and mysterious secret or why if her lover gave her a kiss it should be done with as many precautions as though he were about to commit a murder  she was a very modest maiden and in her heart believed it a wonderful thing that philip should have fallen in love with hera thing to be very proud of and she felt it hard that she should be denied the gratification of openly acknowledging her lover and showing him off to her friends after the fashion that is so delightful to the female mind  but though this consciousness of the deprivation of a lawful joy set up a certain feeling of irritation in her mind she did not allow it to override her entire trust in and love for philip whatever he did was no doubt wise and right but for all that on several occasions she took an opportunity to make him acquainted with her views of the matter and to ask him questions that he found it increasingly difficult to answer  in this way by the exercise of ceaseless diplomacy and with the assistance of a great deal of falsehood of the most artistic nature philip managed to tide over the next six months but at the end of that time the position was very far from improved hilda was chafing more and more at the ignominy of her position maria was daily growing more and more impatient to have their engagement made public and last but by no means least his father was almost daily at him on the subject of miss lee till at length he succeeded in wringing from him the confession that there existed some sort of understanding between maria and himself  now the old squire was a shrewd man of the world and was not therefore slow to guess that what prevented this understanding from being openly acknowledged as an engagement was some entanglement on his sons part indeed it had recently become clear to him that london had developed strange attractions for philip that this entanglement could be marriage was however an idea that never entered into his head he had too good an opinion of his sons common sense to believe it possible that he would deliberately jeopardize his inheritance by marrying without his permission but philips reluctance and obstinacy annoyed him excessively devil caresfoot was not a man accustomed to be thwarted indeed he had never been thwarted in his life and he did not mean to be now he had set his heart upon this marriage and it would have to be a good reason that could turn him from his purpose  accordingly having extracted the above information he said no more to philip but proceeded to lay his own plans  that very afternoon he commenced to put them into action at three oclock he ordered the carriage and pair a vehicle that was rarely used giving special directions that the coachman should see that his wig was properly curled an illcurled wig had before now been known to produce a very bad effect upon mr caresfoots nerves and also upon its wearers future prospects in life  at three precisely the heavy open carriage swung upon csprings and drawn by two huge greys drew up in front of the halldoor and the squire who was as usual dressed in the oldfashioned kneebreeches and carried in his hand his goldheaded cane stepped solemnly into it and seated himself exactly in the middle of the back seat not leaning back as is the fashion of our degenerate days but holding himself bolt upright any more imposing sight than this old gentleman presented thus seated and moving at a stately pace through the village street it is impossible to conceive but it so oppressed the very children that fear at the spectacle which was an unwonted one for the squire had not thus driven abroad in state for some years overcame their curiosity and at his approach they incontinently fled  so soon as the carriage had passed through the drivegates of the abbey the squire ordered the coachman to drive to rewtham house whither in due course he safely arrived  he was ushered into the drawingroom whilst a servant went in search of miss lee whom she found walking in the garden  a gentleman to see you miss  i am not at home who is it  mr caresfoot miss  oh why didnt you say so before and taking it for granted that philip had paid her an unexpected visit she started off for the house at a run  why philip she exclaimed as she swung open the door this is good of you ooh for at that moment mr caresfoot senior appeared from behind the back of the door where he had been standing by the fireplace and made his most imposing bow  that my dear maria was the first time that i have heard myself called philip for many a long year and i fear that that was by accident neither the name nor the blush were meant for me now where they  i thought replied maria who was still overwhelmed with confusion i thought that it was philip your son you know he has not been here for so long  with such a welcome waiting him it is indeed wonderful that he can keep away and the old squire bowing again with such courtly grace as to drive what little selfpossession remained to poor maria after her flying entry entirely out of her head  and now my dear went on her visitor fixing his piercing eyes upon her face with your permission we will sit down and have a little talk together wont you take off your hat  maria took off her hat as suggested and sat down meekly full under fire of the glowing eyes that had produced such curious effects upon subjects so dissimilar as the late mrs caresfoot and jim brady she could however think of nothing appropriate to say  my dear the old gentleman continued presently the subject upon which i have taken upon myself to speak to you is one very nearly affecting your happiness and also of a delicate nature my excuse for alluding to it must be that you are the child of my old friendah we were great friends fifty years ago my dearand that i have myself a near interest in the matter do you understand me  no not quite  well then forgive an old man who has no time to waste if he comes to the point i mean i have come to ask you maria if any understanding or engagement exists between philip and yourself  the eyes were full upon her now and she felt that they were drawing her secret from her as a corkscrew does a cork at last it came out with a pop  yes we are engaged  thank you my dear how long have you been engaged  about eight months  and why has the affair been kept so secret  i dont know philip wished it he told me not to tell any one i suppose that i should not by rights have told you  make yourself easy my dear philip has already told me that there was an understanding between you i only wanted to hear the confirmation of such good news from your own lips young men are great coxcombs my dear and apt to fancy things where ladies are concerned i am rejoiced to hear that there is no mistake on his part  i am so glad that you are pleased she said shyly  pleased my dear said the old gentleman rising and walking up and down the room in his excitement pleased is not the word for it i am more rejoiced than if some one had left me another estate look here maria i had set my heart upon this thing coming to pass i have thought of it for years i loved your father and you are like your father girl ay i love you too because you are a generous honest woman and will bring a good strain of blood into a family that wants generosityay and i sometimes think wants honesty too and then your land runs into ours and as i cant buy it i am glad that it should come in by marriage i have always wanted to see the abbey isleworth and rewtham estates in a ring fence before i died come and give me a kiss my dear  maria did as she was bid  i will try to be a good daughter to you she said if i marry philip but and here her voice trembled a little i want to make you understand that though this engagement exists i have sometimes thought of late that perhaps he wanted to break it off and  break it off almost shouted the old man his eyes flashing break it off by god the day he plays fast and loose with you that day i leave the property to his cousin georgethere there i frightened you i beg your pardon but in his own interest maria i advise you to hold him fast to his word to change the subject your news has freshened me up so much that i mean to have a little company will you come and dine with me next thursday  i shall be very glad mr caresfoot  thank you and perhaps till then you will not unless he happens to ask you mention the subject of our conversation to philip i want to have a talk with him first  maria assented and the squire took his leave with the same magnificence of mien that had marked his arrival                                 chapter viii  that evening his father astonished philip by telling him that he intended to give a dinnerparty on that day week  you see philip he said with a grim smile i have only got a year or so at the most before me and i wish to see a little of my neighbours before i go i have not had much society of late years i mean to do the thing well while i am about it and ask everybody in the neighbourhood how many can dine with comfort in the old banquetinghall do you suppose  about fiveandforty i should think  fiveandforty i remember that we sat down sixty to dinner when i came of age but then we were a little crowded so we will limit the number to fifty  are you going to have fifty people to dinner asked philip aghast  certainly i shall ask you to come and help me to write the invitations presently i have prepared a list and will you kindly send over to bell at roxham i wish to speak to him he must bring his men over to do up the old hall a bit and by the way write to gunters and order a mancook to be here on tuesday and to bring with him materials for the best dinner for fifty people that he can supply i will see after the wine myself we will finish off that wonderful port my grandfather laid down now bustle about my lad we have no time to lose we must get all the notes out today  philip started to execute his orders pretty well convinced in his own mind that his father was taking leave of his senses who ever heard of a dinner being given to fifty people before especially in a house where such rare entertainments had always been of a traditionally select and solemn nature the expense too reflected philip would be large a man of his fathers age had in his opinion no right to make such ducksanddrakes of money that was so near to belonging to somebody else but one thing was clear his father had set his mind upon it and when once that was the case to try to thwart him was more than philip dared  when the notes of invitation arrived at their respective destinations great was the excitement in the neighbourhood of bratham abbey curiosity was rampant on the point and the refusals were few and far between  at length the eventful evening arrived and with it the expected guests among whom the old squire in his dress of a past generation resplendent in diamond buckles frilled shirtfront and silk stockingswas with his snowwhite hair and stately bearing himself by far the most striking figure  standing near the door of the large drawingroom he received his guests as they arrived with an air that would have done credit to an ambassador but when miss lee entered philip noticed with a prophetic shudder that in lieu of the accustomed bow he gave her a kiss he also noticed for he was an observant man that the gathered company was pervaded by a curious air of expectation they were nearly all of them people who had been neighbours of the caresfoot family for years in many instances for generationsand as intimate with its members as the highstomached stiffness of english countrylife will allow they therefore were well acquainted with the family history and peculiarities but it was clear from their faces that their knowledge was of no help to them now and that they were totally in the dark as to why they were all gathered together in this unwonted fashion  at length to the relief of all the last of the chosen fifty guests put in an appearance and dinner was announced everybody made his way to his allotted partner and awaited the signal to move forward when a fresh piquancy was added to the proceedings by an unexpected incidentin which maria lee played a principal part maria was sitting in a corner of the drawingroom wondering if philip was going to take her in to dinner and why he had not been to see her lately when suddenly she became aware that all the room was looking at her and on raising her eyes she perceived the cause for there close upon her and advancing with majestic step and outstretched arm was old mr caresfoot possessed by the evident intention of taking her down in the full face of all the married ladies and people of title present she prayed that the floor might open and swallow her indeed of the two she would have preferred that way of going down to dinner but it did not so there was no alternative left to her but to accept the proffered arm and to pass with as much dignity as she could muster in such a trying moment in front of the intensely interested companyfrom which she could hear an involuntary murmur of surprise through the wideflung doors down the great oak staircase loaded with exotics thence along a passage carpeted with crimson cloth and through double doors of oak that were flung open at their approach into the banquetinghall on its threshold not only she but almost every member of the company who passed in behind them uttered an exclamation of surprise and indeed the sight before them amply justified it  the hall was a chamber of noble proportions sixty feet in length by thirty wide it was very lofty and the dark chestnut beams of the beautiful arched roof were thrown into strong relief by the light of many candles the walls were panelled to the roof with oak that had become almost black in the course of centuries here and there relieved by portraits and shining suits of armour  down the centre of the room ran a long wide table whereon and on a huge sideboard was spread the whole of the caresfoot plate which catching the light of the suspended candles threw it back in dazzling gleams till the beholder was positively bewildered with the brilliancy of the sight  oh how beautiful said maria in astonishment  yes answered the old gentleman as he took his seat at the head of the table placing maria on his right the plate is very fine it has taken two hundred years to get together but my father did more in that way than all of us put together he spent ten thousand pounds on plate during his lifetime that gold service on the sideboard belonged to him i have only spent two mind my love he added in a low voice when it comes into your keeping that it is preserved intact but i dont recommend you to add to it there is too much already for a simple country gentlemans family  maria blushed and was silent  the dinner which was served on a most magnificent scale wore itself away as all big countydinners do in bursts of sedate but not profoundly interesting conversation indeed had it not been for the novelty of the sight maria would have been rather bored the squires stately compliments notwithstanding as it was she felt inclined to envy the party at the other end amongst whom looking down the long vista of sparkling glass and silver she could now and again catch sight of philips face beaming with animation and even in the pauses of conversation hear the echo of his distant laughter  what good spirits he is in she thought to herself  and indeed philip was or appeared to be in excellent spirits his handsome face that of late had been so gloomy was lit up with laughter and he contrived by his witty talk to keep those round him in continual merriment  philip seems very happy doesnt he said george sotto voce to mrs bellamy who was sitting next to him  you must be a very bad judge of the face as an index to the mind if you think that he is happy i have been watching him all dinner and i draw a very different conclusion  why look how he is laughing  have you never seen a man laugh to hide his misery never mind his lips watch his eyes they are dilated with fear see how he keeps glancing towards his father and miss lee there did you see him start believe me he is not happy and unless i am mistaken he will be even less so before the night is over we are not all asked here for nothing  i hope not i hope not if so we shall have to act upon our information eh but to change the subject you look lovely tonight  of course i do i am lovely i wish i could return the compliment but conscientiously i cant did you ever see such plate look at that centrepiece  it is wonderful said george i never saw it at all out before i wonder he added with a sigh if i shall ever have the fingering of it  yes she said with a strange look of her large eyes if you continue to be guided by me you shall i tell you so and i never make mistakes hush something is going to happen what is it  the dinner had come to an end and in accordance with the old fashioned custom the cloth had been removed leaving bare an ancient table of polished oak nearly forty feet in length and composed of slabs of timber a good two inches thick  when the wine had been handed round the old squire motioned to the servants to leave the room and then having first whispered something in the ear of miss lee that caused her to turn very red he slowly rose to his feet in the midst of a dead silence  look at your cousins face whispered mrs bellamy george looked it was ghastly pale and the black eyes were gleaming like polished jet against white paper  friends and neighbours amongst whom or amongst whose fathers i have lived for so many years began the speaker whose voice soft as it was filled the great hall with ease it was if tradition does not lie in this very room and at this very table that the only caresfoot who ever made an afterdinner speech of his own accord delivered himself of his burden that man was my ancestor in the eighth degree old yeoman caresfoot and the occasion of his speech was to him a very important one being the day on which he planted caresfoots staff the great oak by the water yonder to mark the founding of a house of country gentry some centuries have elapsed since my forefather stood where i stand most like with his hand upon this board as mine is now and addressed a company not so fine or so well dressed but perhapsi mean no disrespecton the whole as good at heart as that before me now yes the sapling oak has grown into the biggest tree in the countryside twixt then and now it seems therefore to be fit that on what is to me as great a day as the planting of that oak was to my yeoman forefather that i like him should gather my ancient friends and neighbours round me under the same ancient roof that i may like him make them the partakers of my joy  none of you sitting at this board today can look upon the old man who now asks your attention without realizing what he himself has already learned namely that his day is over now life is hard to quit when a man grows old the terrors of the unknown land loom just as large and terrible as they did to his youthful imagination larger perhaps but it is a fact that must be faced a hard inevitable fact and age realizing this looks round it for consolations and finds only two first that as its interests and affections here fade and fall away in just that same proportion do they grow and gather there upon the further shore and secondly that after natures eternal fashion the youth and vigour of a new generation is waiting to replace the wornout decrepitude of that which sinks into oblivion my life is done it cannot be long before the churchyard claims its own but i live again in my son and take such cold comfort as i may from that idea of family and of longcontinued and assured succession that has so largely helped to make this country what she is  but you will wonder what can be the particular purpose for which i have bidden you here tonight be assured that it was not to ask you to listen to gloomy sermons on the to others not very interesting fact of my approaching end but rather for a joyful and a definite reason one wish i have long had it isthat before i go i may see my sons child the little caresfoot that is to fill my place in future years prattling about my knees but this i shall never see what i have to announce to you however is the first step towards it my sons engagement to miss lee the young lady on my right  look at his face whispered mrs bellamy to her neighbour during the murmur of applause that followed this announcement look quick  philip had put his hands down upon his chair as though to raise himself up and an expression of such mingled rage and terror swept across his features as once seen could not easily be forgotten but so quickly did it pass that perhaps mrs bellamy who was watching was the only one in all that company to observe it in another moment he was smiling and bowing his acknowledgements to whispered and telegraphed congratulations  you all know miss lee went on the old squire as you knew her father and mother before her she is a sound shoot from an honest stock a girl after my own heart a girl that i love and that all who come under her influence will love and this engagement is to me the most joyful news that i have heard for many a year may god ay and man too so deal with my son as he deals with maria lee  and now i have done i have already kept you too long with your consent we will have no more speeches no returning of thanks we will spare philip his blushes but before i sit down i will bid you all farewell for i am in my eightythird year and i feel that i shall never see very many of your faces again i wish that i had been a better neighbour to you all as there are many other things i wish now that it is too late to fulfil them but i still hope that some of you will now and again find a kind thought for the old man whom among yourselves you talk of as devil caresfoot believe me my friends there is truth in the old proverb the devil is not always as black as he is painted i give you my toast my son philip and his affianced wife maria lee  the whole company rose actuated by a common impulse and drank the health standing and such was the pathos of the old squires speech that there were eyes among those present that were not free from tears then the ladies retired amongst them poor maria who was naturally upset at the unexpected and in some ways unwelcome notoriety thus given to herself  in the drawingroom she was so overwhelmed with congratulations that at last feeling that she could not face a fresh edition from the male portion of the gathering she ordered her carriage and quietly slipped away home to think over matters at her leisure  philip too came in for his share of honours down below and acknowledged them as best he might for he had not the moral courage to repudiate the position he felt that his father had forced his hand completely and that there was nothing to be done and sank into the outward calmness of despair but if his companions could have seen the whirlpool of hatred terror and fury that raged within his breast as he sat and chatted and sipped his greatgrandfathers port they would have been justifiably astonished  at length the banquet for it was nothing less came to an end and having bowed their farewell to the last departing guest the old man and his son were left alone together in the deserted drawingroom philip was seated by a table his face buried in his hand whilst his father was standing by the dying fire tapping his eyeglass nervously on the mantelpiece it was he who broke the somewhat ominous silence  well philip how did you like my speech  thus addressed the son lifted his face from his hand it was white as a sheet  by what authority he asked in a harsh whisper did you announce me as engaged to miss lee  by my own philip i had it from both your lips that you were engaged i did not choose that it should remain a secret any longer  you had no right to make that speech i will not marry miss lee understand once and for all i will not marry her  in speaking thus philip had nerved himself to bear one of those dreadful outbursts of fury that had earned his father his title but to his astonishment none such came the steely eyes glinted a little as he answered in his most polite manner and that was all  your position philip then is that you are engaged very publicly engaged to a girl whom you have no intention of marryinga very disgraceful position mine is that i have with every possible solemnity announced a marriage that will not come offa very ridiculous position very good my dear philip please yourself i cannot force you into a disgraceful marriage but you must not suppose that you can thus thwart me with impunity allow me to show you the alternative i see you are tired but i shall not detain you long take that easychair this house and the land round it also the plate which is very valuable but cannot be soldby the way see that it is safely locked up before you go to bedare strictly entailed and must of course belong to you the value of the entailed land is about 1000 pounds a year or a little less in bad times of the unentailed a clear 4000 pounds of my personal property about 900 pounds should you persist in your refusal to marry miss lee or should the marriage in any way fall through except from circumstances entirely beyond your control i must to use your own admirably emphatic language ask you to understand once and for all that where your name appears in my will with reference to the unentailed and personal property it will be erased and that of your cousin george substituted please yourself philip please yourself it is a matter of entire indifference to me i am very fond of george and shall be glad to do him a good turn if you force me to it though it is a pity to split up the property but probably you will like to take a week to consider whether you prefer to stick to the girl you have got hold of up in town thereoh yes i know there is some oneand abandon the property or marry miss lee and retain the propertya very pretty problem for an amorous young man to consider there i wont keep you up any longer good night philip good night just see to the plate will you remember you have a personal interest in that i cant leave it away  philip rose without a word and left the room but when he was gone it was his fathers turn to hide his face in his hands  oh god he groaned aloud to think that all my plans should come to such an end as this to think that i am as powerless to prevent their collapse as a child is to support a falling tree that the only power left me is the power of vengeancevengeance on my own son i have lived too long and the dregs of life are bitter                                  chapter ix  poor hilda found life in her london lodging anything but cheerful and frequently begged philip to allow her to settle somewhere in the country this however he refused to do on two grounds in the first place because few country villages would be so convenient for him to get at as london and in the second because he declared that the great city was the safest hidingplace in the world  and so hilda continued perforce to live her lonesome existence that was only cheered by her husbands short and uncertain visits friends she had none nor did she dare to make any the only person whose conversation she could rely on to relieve the tedium of the long weeks was her landlady mrs jacobs the widow of a cheesemonger who had ruined a fine business by his drinking and other vicious propensities and out of a good property had only left his wife the leasehold of a house in lincolns inn fields which fortunately for her had been settled upon her at her marriage like most people who have seen better daysnot but what she was now very comfortably offshe delighted in talking of her misfortunes and of the perfidiousness of man and in hilda who had poor girl nothing else to listen to she found a most attentive audience as was only natural where such a charming person and such a good listener were concerned honest mrs jacobs soon grew fond of her interesting lodger about whose husbands circumstances and history she soon wove many an imaginary tale for needless to say her most pertinent inquiries failed to extract much information from hilda one of her favourite fictions was that her lodger was the victim of her handsome husband who had in some way beguiled her from her home beyond the seas in order to keep her in solitary confinement and out of the reach of a hated rival another that he kept her thus that he might have greater liberty for his own actions  in course of time these ideas took such possession of her mind that she grew to believe in them and when speaking of hilda to any of her other lodgers would shake her head and talk of her mysteriously as a lamb and a victim  as for that lady herself whilst far from suspecting her good landladys gloomy surmises she certainly fell more and more a prey to depression and anxieties and occasionally even to suspicion to all of which evils she grew increasingly liable as she drew nearer to an event that was no longer very distant she could not but notice a change in philips manner on the rare occasions when he was able to visit her of which the most marked developments were fits of silence and irritability a certain reticence also that became more and more noticeable as time went on led her to feel that there was an invisible something growing up between thema something that the pride she possessed in such a striking degree forbade her to attempt to pierce but which was none the less galling to her on that account very shortly before the events narrated in the last chapter she had taken the occasion of a visit from philip to complain somewhat bitterly of her position begging him to tell her when there was any prospect of her being allowed to take her rightful placea question her husband was quite unable to answer satisfactorily seeing that there was nothing to be got out of him with womanly tact she changed the subject and asked after maria lee for whom she entertained a genuine affectionwhen he last saw her how she was looking if there was any prospect of her getting married and other questions of the same sortthe result of which was to evoke a most violent and to her inexplicable fit of irritability on the part of her husband something of a scene ensued which was finally terminated about five oclock in the afternoon by philips abrupt departure to catch his train  shortly afterwards mrs jacobs coming up to bring some tea found hilda indulging in tears that she had been too proud to shed before her husband and having had an extended personal experience of such matters rightly guessed that there had been a conjugal tiff the blame of which needless to say she fixed upon the departed philip  lor mrs roberts as hilda was called she said dont take on like that theyre all brutes thats what they are if only you could have seen my samuel whos dead and gone these ten years and buried in a private grave at kensal cemeterythough he didnt leave anything to pay for it except three dozen and five of brandyhe was a beauty poor dear he was your husband aint nothing to him  my husband let me tell you mrs jacobs is not a brute at all sobbed hilda with dignity  ah mrs roberts that is just what i used to say of samuel but he was the biggest brute in the three kingdoms for all that but if you ask me meaning no offence i call a man a brute as only comes to see his lawful wife about twice a month let alone making an angel cry  mr roberts has his reasons mrs jacobs you must not talk of him like that  ah so my samuel used to say when he stopped away from home for three nights at a time till i followed him and found out his reason and a mighty pretty reason she was too all paint and feathers the hussy and eyes as big as a teacup they all have their reasons but they never tell em but come and put on your things and go out a bit theres a dear it is a beautiful warm evening you feel tiredoh never mind that it is necessary for people as is in an interested way to take exercise i well remembers  here hilda however cut the subject short and deprived herself of mrs jacobs reminiscences by going to put on her things  it was a bright warm evening and she found the air so pleasant that after strolling round lincolns inn fields she thought she would extend her walk a little and struck past lincolns inn hall into new square and then made her way to the archway opposite to where the new law courts now stand under this archway a legal bookseller has built his nest and behind windows of broad plateglass were ranged specimens of his seductive wares baits on which to catch students avaricious of legal knowledge as they pass on their way to chambers or hall now at this window a young man was standing at the moment that hilda entered the archway his eyes fixed upon a pamphlet on the laws of succession that young man was george caresfoot who was considering whether it would be worth his while to buy the pamphlet in order to see if he would be entitled to anything if his uncle should happen to die intestate as he sometimes feared might be the case he had come up to town on business connected with his firm and was now waiting till it was time to begin an evening of what he understood as pleasure for george was a very gay young man  he was however also a very sharp one so sharp that he even noticed shadows especially when as in this case the shadow was clearly defined and flung lifesized on the dark background of the books before him he watched it for a moment and as its owner with an absent air slowly passed from the bright sunlight into the shade of the arch it struck the astute george that there was something familiar about this particular and by no means unpleasing shadow waiting till it had vanished and the footsteps gone past him he turned round and at a glance recognized hilda von holtzhausen miss lees beautiful companion who was supposed to have departed into the more distant parts of germany georges eyes twinkled and a whole host of ideas rushed into his really able mind  caught at last for a sovereign he muttered  meanwhile hilda walked slowly on into chancery lane then turned to the left till she came into holborn and thence made her way round by another route back to lincolns inn fields needless to say george followed at a respectful distance his first impulse had been to go up and speak to her but he resisted the inclination  on the doorstep of the house where hilda lodged stood her landlady giving a piece of her mind to a butcherboy both as regarded his masters meat and his personal qualities she paused for breath just as hilda passed up the steps and turning said something that made the latter laugh the butcherboy took the opportunity of beating a rapid retreat leaving mrs jacobs crowing after him from her own doorstep as soon as hilda had gone into the house george saw his opportunity advancing politely towards mrs jacobs he asked her if she was the landlady of the house and when she had answered in the affirmative he made inquiries about apartments  thank you sir said mrs jacobs but i do not let rooms to single gentlemen  you take too much for granted maam i am married  she looked at him doubtfully i suppose sir you would have no objection to giving a reference  a dozen if you like maam but shall we look at the rooms  mrs jacobs assented and they made their way upstairs george keeping in front on the firstfloor he saw a pair of ladys shoes on a mat outside the door and guessed to whom they belonged  are these the rooms he said laying his hand upon the doorhandle  no sir no they are mrs roberts next floor please sir  mrs robertsi suppose the very handsome young lady i saw come into the house no offence maam but a mans bound to be careful where he brings his wife i suppose shes all right  lord yes poor dear answered mrs jacobs in indignation why they came here straight from st judes battersea the day they were married a runaway match i fancy  thats all right she looked charming i hope her husband is worthy of her remarked george as he gazed round mrs jacobs rooms  well as to that hes handsome enough for them as likes those black men but i dont like people as only comes to visit their lawful wives about twice a month but suddenly checking herself it isnt any affair of mine  no indeed very reprehensible i am as a married man entirely of your mind these are charming rooms maam charming i shall certainly take them if my wife approves i will let you know by tomorrows postjacobs yes i have it down good evening maam and he was gone  instead of going out that evening as he had intended george sat in the smokingroom of his hotel and thought he also wrote a letter which he addressed to mrs bellamy  next morning taking a cab he drove to st judes battersea and inspected the register  presently he asked for a certified copy of the following entry august 1 1856 philip caresfoot bachelor gentleman to hilda von holtzhausen spinster by license signed j few curate as witness fred natt eliza chambers  that evening hilda received an anonymous letter written in a round clerks hand that had been posted in the city it was addressed to mrs roberts and its contents ran thus  a sincere friend warns mrs philip caresfoot that her husband is deceiving her and has become entangled with a young lady of her acquaintance burn this wait and watch  the letter fell from her hands as though it had stung her  mrs jacobs was right she said aloud with a bitter laugh men always have a reason oh let him beware and she threw back her beautiful head and the great blue eyes sparkled like those of a snake about to strike the sword of jealousy that she had hitherto repelled with the shield of a womans trust in the man she loves had entered into her soul and could philip have seen her under these new circumstances he would have realized that he had indeed good reason to beware no wonder she went on no wonder that he finds her name irritating upon my lips no doubt to him it is a desecration oh oh and she flung herself on her face and wept tears of jealous rage  well said george to mrs bellamy as they drove home together after the great dinner party do not be shocked my reader bellamy was on the bow well how shall we strike shall i go to the old man tomorrow and show him my certified copy there is no time to lose he might die any day  no we must act through mrs philip  why  it is more scientific and it will be more amusing  poor thing it will be a blow to her dont you like her  no  why not  because she did not trust me and because she eclipses me therefore i am glad of an opportunity of destroying her  you are a very ruthless woman  when i have an end in view i march straight to it i do not vacillatethat is all but never mind me here we are near home go to town by the first train tomorrow morning and post another letter announcing what has happened here then come back and wait  ay reflected george that is a wonderful womana woman it is good to have some hold over    we left hilda stretched on her face sobbing but the fit did not last long she rose and flung open the window she seemed stifled for want of air then she sat down to think what she should do vanish and leave no trace no not yet appear and claim her place no not yet the time was not ripe for choice between these two extremes upbraid philip with his faithlessness no not without proofs what did that hateful letter say wait and watch yes that was what she would do but she could not wait here she felt as though she must go somewhere get some change of scene or she should break down she had heard mrs jacobs speak of a village not more than two hours from london that a convalescent lodger of hers had visited and found charming she would go there for a week and watch the spring cast her mantle over the earth and listen to the laughter of the brooks and try to forget her burning love and jealousy and just for that one week be happy as she was when as a little girl she roamed all day through the woods of her native germany alas she forgot that it is the heart and not the scene that makes happiness  that evening she wrote a note to her husband saying that she felt that change of air was necessary for her and that she was going out of london for a few days to some quiet place from whence she would write to him he must not however expect many letters as she wanted complete rest  on the following morning she went and if the sweet spring air did not bring peace to her mind at any rate it to a very great extent set up her in strength she wrote but one letter during her absence and that was to say that she should be back in london by midday on the first of may this letter reached philip on the morning of the great dinnerparty and was either accidentally or on purpose sent without the writers address on the morning of the first of maythat is two days after the dinnerparty which was given on the twentyninth of aprilhilda rose early and commenced to pack her things with the assistance of a stout servant girl who did all the odd jobs and a great deal of the work in the oldfashioned farmhouse in which she was staying presently the cowboy came whistling up the little garden bright with crocuses and tulips that lay in front of the house and knocked at the front door  lawks said the stout girl in accents of deep surprise as she drew her head in from the open lattice jims got a letter  perhaps it is for me suggested hilda a little nervously she had grown nervous about the post of late will you go and see  the letter was for her in the handwriting of mrs jacobs she opened it it contained another addressed in the character the sight of which made her feel sick and faint she could not trust herself to read it in the presence of the girl  sally she said i feel rather faint i shall lie down a little i will ring for you presently  sally retired and she opened her letter  fifteen minutes after the girl received her summons she found hilda very pale and with a curious look upon her face  i hope youre better mum she said for she was a kindhearted girl  betterah yes thank you sally i am cured quite cured but please be quick with the things for i shall leave by the nine oclock train                                  chapter x  the night of the dinnerparty was a nearly sleepless one for philip although his father had so considerately regretted his wearied appearance he could do nothing but walk walk walk like some unquiet ghost up and down his great oakpanelled bedroom till about dawn his legs gave way beneath him and think think think till his mind recoiled confused and helpless from the dead wall of its objects and out of all this walking and thinking there emerged after an hour of stupor that it would be a misnomer to call sleep two fixed results the first of these was that he hated his father as a lost soul must hate its torturing demon blindly madly impotently hated him and the second that he could no longer delay taking his wife into his confidence then he remembered the letter he had received from her on the previous morning he got it and saw that it bore no address merely stating that she would be in london by midday on the first of may that was on the morrow till then it was clear he must wait and he was not sorry for the reprieve his was not a pleasant story for a husband to have to tell  fortunately for philip there was an engagement of long standing for this day the thirtieth of april to go in conjunction with other persons to effect a valuation of the fallows c of a large tenant who was going out at michaelmas this prevented any call being made upon him to go and see maria lee as after the events of the previous evening it might have been expected he would he started early on this business and did not return till late so he saw nothing of his father that day  on the morning of the first of may he breakfasted about halfpast eight and then without seeing his father drove to roxham to catch a train that got him up to london about twenty minutes to twelve as he steamed slowly into paddington station another train steamed out and had he been careful to examine the occupants of the firstclass carriages as they passed him in a slow procession he might have seen something that would have interested him but he was not unnaturally too much occupied with his own thoughts to allow of the indulgence of an idle curiosity on the arrival of his train he took a cab and drove without delay to the house in lincolns inn fields and asked for mrs roberts  she isnt back yet sir was mrs jacobs reply i got this note from her this morning to say that she would be here by twelve but its twenty past now so i suppose that she has missed the train or changed her mind but there will be another in at three so perhaps you had best wait for that sir  philip was put out by this contretemps but at the same time he was relieved to find that he had a space to breathe in before the inevitable and dreadful moment of exposure and infamy for he had grown afraid of his wife  three oclock came in due course but no hilda philip was seriously disturbed but there was now no train by which she could arrive that day so he was forced to the conclusion that she had postponed her departure there were now two things to be done one to follow her down to where she was stayingfor he had ascertained her address from mrs jacobs the other to return home and come back on the morrow for reasons which appeared to him imperative but which need not be entered into here he decided on the latter course so leaving a note for his wife he drove in a very bad temper back to paddington in time to catch the five oclock train to roxham  let us now return to the abbey house where whilst philip was cooling his heels in lincolns inn fields a rather curious scene was in progress  at one oclock old mr caresfoot as was his rule sat down to lunch which frugal as it was so far as he was concerned was yet served with some oldfashioned ceremony by a butler and a footman just as the meal was coming to an end a fly with some luggage on it drove up to the halldoor the footman went to open it  simmons said the squire to the old butler look out and tell me who that is  simmons did as he was bid and replied  i dont rightly know squire but its a lady and she be wonderful tall  just then the footman returned and said that a lady who would not give her name wished to speak to him in private  are you sure the lady did not mean mr philip  no sir she asked for mr philip first and when i told her that he was out she asked for you sir i have shown her into the study  humph at any rate she has come off a journey and must be hungry set another place and ask her in here  in another moment there was a rustle of a silk dress and a lady arrayed in a long cloak and with a thick veil on was shown into the room mr caresfoot rising with that courteous air for which he was remarkable bowed and begged her to be seated and then motioned to the servants to leave the room  madam i am told that you wish to speak to me might i ask whom i have the honour of addressing  she with a rapid motion removed her hat and veil and exposed her sternly beautiful face to his inquiring gaze  do you not know me mr caresfoot she said in her foreign accent  surely yes you are the young lady who lived with maria miss von holtzhausen  that was my name it is now hilda caresfoot i am your son philips wife  as this astounding news broke upon his ears her hearers face became a shifting study incredulity wonder fury all swept across it and then in a single second it seemed to freeze next moment he spoke with overpowering politeness  so madam then i have to congratulate myself on the possession of a very lovely daughterinlaw  a silence ensued that they were both too moved to break at last the old man said in an altered tone  we have much to talk of and you must be tired take off your cloak and eat whilst i think  she obeyed him and he saw that not only was she his sons wife but that she must before long present the world with an heir to the name of caresfoot this made him think the more but meanwhile he continued to attend to her wants she ate little but calmly  that woman has nerve said he to himself  then he rang the bell and bade simmons wait till he had written a note  send james to roxham at once with this take this ladys things off the fly and put them in the red bedroom by the way i am at home to nobody except mr bellamy and then turning to hilda now if you will come into my study we will continue our chat and he offered her his arm here we are secure from interruption he said with a ghost of a smile take this chair now forgive my impertinence but i must ask you if i am to understand that you are my sons legal wife  she flushed a little as she answered  sir i am i have been careful to bring the proof here it is and she took from a little handbag a certified copy of the register of her marriage and gave it to him he examined it carefully through his gold eyeglass and handed it back  perfectly in order hum some eight months since i see may i ask why i am now for the first time favoured with a sight of this interesting documentin short why you come down like an angel from the clouds and reveal yourself at the present moment  i have come she answered because of these and she handed him two letters i have come to ascertain if they are true if my husband is a doubly perjured or a basely slandered man  he read the two anonymous letters with the contents of the first we are acquainted the second merely told of the public announcement of philips engagement  speak she said with desperate energy the calm of her face breaking up like ice before a rush of waters you must know everything tell me my fate  girl these villanous letters are in every particular true you have married in my son the biggest scoundrel in the county i can only say that i grieve for you  she listened in silence then rising from her chair said with a gesture infinitely tragic in its simplicity  then it is finished before god and man i renounce him listen she went on turning to her fatherinlaw i loved your son he won my heart but though he said he loved me i suspected him of playing fast and loose with me on the one hand and with my friend maria lee on the other so i determined to go away and told him so then it was that he offered to marry me at once if i would change my purpose i loved him and i consentedyes because i loved him so i consented to even more i agreed to keep the marriage secret from you you see what it has led to i a von holtzhausen and the last of my name stand here a byword and a scorn my story will be found amusing at every dinnertable in the countryside and my shame will even cling to my unborn child this is the return he has made me for my sacrifice of selfrespect and for consenting to marry him at all to outrage my love and make me a public mockery  we have been accustomed broke in the old squire his pride somewhat nettled to consider our own a good family to marry into you do not seem to share that view  good yes there is plenty of your money for those who care for it but sir as i told your son it is not a family he did me no honour in marrying me though i was nothing but a german companion with no dower but her beauty iand here she flung her head back with an air of ineffable pridedid him the honour my ancestors sir were princes when his were ploughboys  well well answered the old man testily ten generations of country gentry and the lord only knows how many more of stout yeomen before them is a good enough descent for us but i like your pride and i am glad that you spring from an ancient race you have been shamefully treated hildais not your name hildabut there are others more free from blame than you are who have been treated worse  ah maria then she knows nothing  yes there is maria and myself but never mind that philip will i suppose be back in a few hoursoh yes he will be back and his eyes glinted unpleasantly and what shall you do then what course do you intend to take  i intend to claim my rights to force him to acknowledge me here where he suffered his engagement to another woman to be proclaimed and then i intend to leave him he has killed my respect i will not live with him again i can earn my living in germany i have done with him but sir do not you be hard upon him it is a matter between me and him let him not suffer on my account  my dear pray confine yourself to your own affairs and leave me to settle mine there shall be no harshness nobody shall suffer more than they deserve there dont break down go and rest for there are painful scenes before you  he rang the bell and sent for the housekeeper she came presently a pleasantlooking woman of about thirty years of age with a comely face and honest eyes  this lady pigott said the old squire addressing her is mrs philip caresfoot and you will be so kind as to treat her with all respect dont open your eyes but attend to me for the present you had best put her in the red room and attend to her yourself do you understand  oh yes sir i understand pigott replied curtseying will you be pleased to come along with me maam  hilda rose and took pigotts arm excitement and fatigue had worn her out before she went however she turned and with tears in her eyes thanked the old man for his kindness to a friendless woman  the hard eyes grew kindly as he stooped and kissed the broad white brow and said in his stately way  my dear as yet i have shown you nothing but the courtesy due to a lady should i live i hope to bestow on you the affection i owe to a muchwronged daughter goodby  and thus they parted little knowing where they should meet again  a woman i respectwell english or german the blood will tellhe said as soon as the door had closed poor thingpoor maria too the scoundrelah there it is again and he pressed his hand to his heart this business has upset me and no wonder  the pang passed and sitting down he wrote a letter that evidently embarrassed him considerably and addressed it to miss lee this he put in the postbox and then going to a secretaire he unlocked it and taking out a document he began to puzzle over it attentively  presently simmons announced that mr bellamy was waiting  show him in at once said the old man briskly                                  chapter xi  it was some minutes past seven that evening when the lawyer left and he had not been gone a quarter of an hour before a hired gig drove up to the door containing philip who had got back from town in the worst of bad tempers and as no conveyance was waiting for him had been forced to post over from roxham apparently his father had been expecting his arrival for the moment the servant opened the door he appeared from his study and addressed him in a tone that was as near to being jovial as he ever went  hallo philip back again are you been up to town i suppose and driven over in the george gig thats lucky i wanted to speak to you come in here theres a good fellow i want to speak to you  why is he so infernally genial reflected philip timeo danaos et dona ferentes then aloud all right father but if it is all the same to you i should like to get some dinner first  dinner why i have had none yet i have been too busy i shall not keep you long we will dine together presently  philip was surprised and glanced at him suspiciously his habits were extremely regular why had he had no dinner  meanwhile his father led the way into the study muttering below his breath  one more chancehis last chance  a wood fire was burning brightly on the hearth for the evening was chilly and some sherry and glasses stood upon the table  take a glass of wine philip i am going to have one it is a good thing to begin a conversation on what says the psalmist wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make him a cheerful countenancea cheerful countenance ho ho my old limbs are tired i am going to sit downgoing to sit down  he seated himself in a wellworn leather armchair by the side of the fire so that his back was towards the dying daylight but the brightness of the flames threw the clearcut features into strong relief against the gloom and by it philip could see that the withered cheeks were flushed somehow the whole strongly defined scene made him feel uncanny and restless  cold for the first of may isnt it lad the world is very cold at eightytwo eightytwo a great age yet it seems but the other day that i used to sit in this very chair and dandle you upon my knee and make this repeater strike for you and yet that is twenty years since and i have lived through four twenties and two years a great age a cold world  aint you well asked his son brusquely but not unkindly  well ah yes thank you philip i never felt better my memory is so good i can see things i have forgotten seventy years or more dear dear it was behind that bookcase in a hole in the board that i used to hide my flint and steel which i used for making little fires at the foot of caresfoots staff there is a mark on the bark now i was mischievous as a little lad and thought that the old tree would make a fine blaze i was audacious too and delighted to hide the things in my fathers study under the very nose of authority ay and other memories come upon me as i think it was here upon this very table that they stood my mothers coffin i was standing where you are now when i wrenched open the halffastened shell to kiss her once more before they screwed her down for ever i wonder would you do as much for me i loved my mother and that was fifty years ago i wonder shall we meet again that was on the first of may a longgone first of may they threw branches of blackthorn bloom upon her coffin odd very odd but business lad businesswhat was it ah i know and his manner changed in a second and became hard and stern about maria have you come to a decision  philip moved restlessly on his chair poked the logs to a brighter blaze and threw on a handful of pine chips from a basket by his side before he answered then he said  no i have not  your reluctance is very strange philip i cannot understand it i suppose that you are not already married are you philip  there was a lurid calm about the old mans face as he asked this question that was very dreadful in its intensity under the shadow of his thick black eyebrows gleams of light glinted and flickered in the expanded pupils as before the outburst of a tempest the forked lightning flickers in the belly of the cloud his voice too was constrained and harsh  owing to the position of his fathers head philip could not see this play of feature but he heard the voice and thought that it meant mischief he had but a second to decide between confession and the lie that leaped to his lips an inward conviction told him that his father was not long for this world was it worth while to face his anger when matters might yet be kept dark till the end the tone of the voice ah how he mistook its meaningdeceived him it was not he thought possible that his father could know anything had he possessed a little more knowledge of the world he might have judged differently  married no indeed what put that idea into your head and he laughed outright  presently he became aware that his father had risen and was approaching towards him another moment and a hand of iron was laid upon his shoulder the awful eyes blazed into his face and seemed to pierce him through and through and a voice that he could not have recognized hissed into his ear  you unutterable liar you everlasting hound your wife is at this moment in this house  philip sprang up with an exclamation of rage and cursed hilda aloud  no went on his father standing before him his tall frame swaying backwards and forwards with excitement no do not curse her she like your other poor dupe is an honest woman on yourself be the damnation you living fraud you outcast from all honour who have brought shame and reproach upon our honest name on you be it may every curse attend you and may remorse torture you listen you lied to me you lied to your wife trebly did you lie to the unfortunate girl you have deceived but if you will not speak it for once hear the truth and remember that you have to deal with one so relentless that fools mistaking justice for oppression call him devil i devil caresfoot tell you that i will disinherit you of every stick stone and stiver that the law allows me and start you in the enjoyment of the rest with my bitterest curse this i will do now whilst i am alive when i am dead by heaven i will haunt you if i can  here he stopped for want of breath and stood for a moment in the full light of the cheery blaze one hand raised above his head as though to strike and presenting with his glittering eyes and working features so terrible a spectacle of rage that his son recoiled involuntarily before him  but fury begets fury as love begets love and in another second philip felt his own wicked temper boil up within him he clenched his teeth and stood firm  do your worst he said i hate you i wish to god that you were dead  hardly had these dreadful words left his lips when a change came over the old mans face it seemed to stiffen and putting one hand to his heart he staggered back into his chair pointing and making signs as he fell towards a little cupboard in the angle of the wall his son at once guessed what had happened his father had got one of the attacks of the heart to which he was subject and was motioning to him to bring the medicine which he had before shown him and which alone could save him in these seizures actuated by a common impulse of humanity philip for the moment forgot their quarrel and stepped with all speed to fetch it as it happened there stood beneath this cupboard a table and on this table lay the document which his father had been reading that afternoon before the arrival of mr bellamy it was his will and as is usual in the case of such deeds the date was endorsed upon the back all this philip saw at a single glance and he also saw that the will was dated some years back and therefore one under which he would inherit doubtless the same that his father had some months before offered to show him  it flashed through his mind that his father had got it out in order to burn it and this idea was followed by another that for a moment stilled his heart  if he should die now he cannot destroy it if he does not take the medicine he will die  thought flies fast in moments of emergency philip too was a man of determined mind where his own interests were concerned and his blood was heated and his reason blinded by fury and terror he was not long in settling on his course of action taking the bottle from the cupboard he poured out its contents into one of the wineglasses that stood upon the table and coming up to his father with it addressed him he knew that these attacks although they were of a nature to cause intense pain did not rob the sufferer of his senses the old man though he lay before him gasping with agony was quite in a condition to understand him  listen to me he said in a slow distinct voice just now you said that you would disinherit me this medicine will save your life and if i let it fall you will die and there is no more in the house swear before god that you will not carry out your threat and i will give it to you lift up your hand to show me that you swear  silence followed only broken by the gasps of the dying man  if you will not swear i will pour it out before your eyes  again there was silence but this time the old man made an effort to rise and ring the bell  his son threw him roughly back  for the last time he said in a hoarse whisper will you swear  a struggle passed over his fathers face now nearly black with pain and presently from the distended lips that did not seem to move there burst a single worddestined to echo for ever in his sons ears  murderer  it was his last he sank back groaned and died and at the same moment the flame from the pinechips flickered itself away and of a sudden the room grew nearly dark philip stood for awhile aghast at his own handiwork and watched the dull light glance on the dead white of his fathers brow he was benumbed by terror at what he had done and in that awful second of realization would have given his own life to have it undone  presently however the instinct of selfpreservation came to his aid he lit a candle and taking some of the medicine in the glass smeared it over the dead mans chin and coat and then broke the glass on the floor by his sidethus making it appear that he had died whilst attempting to swallow the medicine  next he raised a loud outcry and violently rang the bell in a minute the room was full of startled servants one of whom was instantly despatched for mr caley the doctor meanwhile after a vain attempt to restore animation the studytable was cleared and the corpse laid on it as its mothers had been on that day fifty years before  then came a dreadful hush and the shadow of death came down upon the house and brooded over it the menservants moved to and fro with muffled feet and the women wept for in a way they had all loved the imperious old man and the last change had come very suddenly philips brain burned he was consumed by the desire of action suddenly he bethought him of his wife upstairs after what he had just passed through no scene with her could disturb himit would he even felt be welcome he went up to the room where she was and entered it was evident that she had been told of what had happened as both she and pigott who was undressing herfor she was wearied outwere weeping she did not appear surprised at his appearance the shock of the old mans death extinguished all surprise it was he who broke the silence  he is dead he said  yes i have heard  if you are at liberty for a few minutes i wish to talk to you he said savagely  i too she answered have something to say but i am too weary and upset to say it now i will see you tomorrow  he turned and went without answering and pigott noticed that no kiss or word of endearment passed between them and that the tone of their words was cold  soon after philip got downstairs the doctor came philip met him in the hall and accompanied him into the study where the body was he made a rapid examination more as a matter of form than anything else for his first glance had told him that life was extinct  quite dead he said sorrowfully my old friend gone at last one of a fine sort too a just man for all his temper they called him devil and he was fierce when he was younger but if i never meet a worse devil than he was i shall do well he was very kind to me once very how did he goin pain i fear  we were talking together when suddenly he was seized with the attack i got the medicine as quick as i could and tried to get it down his throat but he could not swallow and in the hurry the glass was knocked by a jerk of his head right out of my hands next second he was dead  very quickquicker than i should have expected did he say anything  no  now just as philip delivered himself of this last lie a curious incident happened or rather an incident that is apt to seem curious to a person who has just told a lie the corpse distinctly moved its right handthe same that had been clasped over the old mans head as he denounced his son  good god said philip turning pale as death whats that and even the doctor started a little and cast a keen look at the dead face  nothing he said i have seen that happen before where there has been considerable tension of the muscles before death it is only their final slackening that is all come will you ring the bell they had better come and take it upstairs  this sad task had just been performed and mr caley was about to take his leave when pigott came down and whispered something into his ear that evidently caused him the most lively astonishment drawing philip aside he said  the housekeeper asks me to come up and see mrs philip caresfoot whom she thinks is going to be confined does she mean your wife  yes answered philip sullenly she does it is a long story and i am too upset to tell it you now it will soon be all over the country i suppose  the old doctor whistled but judged it advisable not to put any more questions when suddenly an idea seemed to strike him  you said you were talking to your father when the fit took him was it about your marriage  yes  when did he first know of it  today i believe  ah thank you and he followed pigott upstairs  that night exactly at twelve oclock another little lamp floated out on the waters of life angela was born                                 chapter xii  when the doctor had gone upstairs philip went into the diningroom to eat something only to find that food was repugnant to him he could scarcely swallow a mouthful to some extent however he supplied its place by wine of which he drank several glasses then drawn by a strange fascination he went back into the little study and remembering the will bethought himself that it might be as well to secure it in taking it off the table however a folded and much erased sheet of manuscript was disclosed recognizing bellamys writing he took it up and commenced to read the draft for it was nothing else its substance was as follows  the document began by stating that the testators former will was declared null and void on account of the treacherous and dishonourable conduct of his son philip it then in brief but sweeping terms bequeathed and devised to trustees of whom philip was not one the unentailed property and personalty to be held by them firstly for the benefit of any son that might be born to the said disinherited philip by his wife hildathe question of daughters being probably by accident passed over in silenceand failing such issue then to the testators nephew george caresfoot absolutely subject however to the following curious condition should the said george caresfoot either by deed of gift or will attempt to convey the estate to his cousin philip or to descendants of the said philip then the gift over to the said george was to be of none effect and the whole was to pass to some distant cousins of the testators who lived in scotland then followed several legacies and one charge on the estate to the extent of 1000 pounds a year payable to the separate use of the aforesaid hilda caresfoot for life and reverting at death to the holder of the estate  in plain english philip was under this draft totally disinherited first in favour of his own male issue by his wife hilda all mention of daughters being omitted and failing such issue in favour of his hated cousin george who as though to add insult to injury was prohibited from willing the property back either to himself or his descendants by whom the testator had probably understood the children of a second marriage  philip read the document over twice carefully  phew he said that was touch and go thank heavens he had no time to carry out his kind intentions  but presently a terrible thought struck him he rang the bell hastily it was answered by the footman who since he had an hour before helped to carry his poor master upstairs had become quite demoralized it was some time before philip could get an answer to his question as to whether or no any one had been with his father that day whilst he was out at last he succeeded in extracting a reply from the man that nobody had been except the young ladyleastways he begged pardon mrs caresfoot as he was told she was  never mind her said philip feeling as though a load had been taken from his breast you are sure nobody else has been  no sir nobody leastways he begged pardon nobody except lawyer bellamy and his clerk who had been there all the afternoon writing with a black bag and had sent for simmons to be witnessed  you can go said philip in a quiet voice he saw it all now he had let the old man die after he had executed the fresh will disinheriting him he had let him die he had effectually and beyond redemption cut his own throat doubtless too bellamy had taken the new will with him there was no chance of his being able to destroy it  by degrees however his fit of brooding gave way to one of sullen fury against his wife himself but most of all against his dead father drunk with excitement rage and baffled avarice he seized and candle and staggered up to the room where the corpse had been laid launching imprecations as he went at his dead fathers head but when he came face to face with that dread presence his passion died and a cold sense of the awful quiet and omnipotence of death came upon him and chilled him into fear in some indistinct way he realized how impotent is the chafing of the waters of mortality against the iron bound coasts of death to what purpose did he rail against that solemn quiet thing that husk and mask of life which lay in unmoved mockery of his reviling  his father was dead and he even he had killed his father he was his fathers murderer and then a terror of the reckoning that must one day be struck between that dead mans spirit and his own took possession of him and a foreknowledge of the awful shadow under which he must henceforth live crept into his mind and froze the very marrow in his bones he looked again at the face and to his excited imagination it appeared to have assumed a sardonic smile the curse of cain fell upon him as he looked and weighed him down his hair rose and the cold sweat poured from his forehead at length he could bear it no longer but turning fled out of the room and out of the house far into the night  when haggard with mental and bodily exhaustion he at length returned it was after midnight he found dr caley waiting for him he had just come from the sickroom and wore an anxious look upon his face  your wife has been delivered of a fine girl he said but i am bound to tell you that her condition is far from satisfactory the case is a most complicated and dangerous one  a girl groaned philip mindful of the will are you sure that it is a girl  of course i am sure answered the doctor testily  and hilda illi dont understand  look here my good fellow you are upset take a glass of brandy and go to bed your wife does not wish to see you now but if necessary i will send for you now do as i tell you or you will be down next your nerves are seriously shaken  philip did as he was bid and as soon as he had seen him off to his room the doctor returned upstairs  in the early morning he sent for two of his brotherpractitioners and they held a consultation the upshot of which was that they had come to the conclusion nothing short of a miracle could save hildas life a conclusion that she herself had arrived at some hours before  doctor she said i trust to you to let me know when the end is near i wish my husband to be present when i die but not before  hush my childnever talk of dying yet please god you have many years of life before you  she shook her golden head a little sadly  no doctor my sand has run out and perhaps it as as well give me the childwhy do you keep the child away from me it is the messenger sent to call me to a happier world yes she is an angel messenger when i am gone see that you call her angela so that i may know by what name to greet her when the time comes  during the course of the morning she expressed a strong desire to see maria lee who was accordingly sent for  it will be remembered that old mr caresfoot had on the previous day immediately after hilda had left him sat down and written to maria lee in this note he told her the whole shameful truth ending it with a few words of bitter humiliation and selfreproach that such a thing should have befallen her at the hands of one bearing his name over the agony of shame and grief thus let loose upon this unfortunate girl we will draw a veil it is fortunate for the endurance of human reason that life does not hold many such hours as that through which she passed after the receipt of this letter as was but natural notwithstanding old mr caresfoots brief vindication of hildas conduct in his letter maria was filled with indignation at what to herself she called her treachery and deceit  while she was yet full of these thoughts a messenger came galloping over from bratham abbey bringing a note from dr caley that told her of her old friends sudden death and of hildas dangerous condition and her desire to see her the receipt of this news plunged her into a fresh access of grief for she had grown fond of the old man nor had the warm affection for hilda that had found a place in her gentle heart been altogether wrenched away and now that she heard that her rival was face to face with that king of terrors before whom all earthly love hate hope and ambition must fall down and cease their troubling it revived in all its force nor did any thought of her own wrongs come to chill it  within half an hour she was at the door of the abbey house where the doctor met her and in answer to her eager question told her that humanly speaking it was impossible her friend could live through another twentyfour hours adding an injunction that she must not stay with her long  she entered the sickroom with a heavy heart and there from hildas dying lips she heard the story of her marriage and of philips perfidy their reconciliation was as complete as her friends failing voice and strength would allow at length she tore herself away and turning at the door took her last look at hilda who had raised herself upon her elbow and was gazing at her retreating form with an earnestness that was very touching the eyes maria felt were taking their fill of what they looked upon for the last time in this world catching her tearful gaze the dying woman smiled and lifting her hand pointed upwards thus they parted  but maria could control herself no longer her own blasted prospects the loss of the man she loved and the affecting scene through which she had just passed all helped to break her down running downstairs into the diningroom she threw herself on a sofa and gave full passage to her grief presently she became aware that she was not alone philip stood before her or rather the wreck of him whom she knew as philip indeed it was hard to recognize in this scared man with dishevelled hair white and trembling lips and eyes ringed round with black the bold handsome youth whom she had loved the sight of him stayed her sorrow and a sense of her bitter injuries rushed in upon her  what do you want with me she asked  want i want forgiveness i am crushed maria crushedquite crushed and he put his hands to his face and sobbed  she answered him with the quiet dignity that good women can command in moments of emergencydignity of a very different stamp from hildas haughty pride but perhaps as impressive in its way  you ask forgiveness of me and say that you are crushed has it occurred to you that without fault of my own except the fault of trusting you as entirely as i loved you i too am crushed do you know that you have wantonly or to gain selfish ends broken my heart blighted my name and driven me from my home for i can live here no more do you understand that you have done me one of the greatest injuries one person can do to another i say do you know all this philip caresfoot and knowing it do you still ask me to forgive you do you think it possible that i can forgive  he had never heard her speak like this before and did not remember that intense feeling is the mother of eloquence he gazed at her for a moment in astonishment then he dropped his face into his hands again and groaned making no other answer after waiting awhile she went on  i am an insignificant creature i know and perhaps the mite of my happiness or misery makes little difference in the scale of things but to me the gift of all my love was everything i gave it to you philipgave it without a doubt or murmur gave it with both hands i can never have it back to give again how you have treated it you best know here she broke down a little and then continued it may seem curious but though my love has been so mistakenly given though you to whom it was given have dealt so ill with it yet i am anxious that on my side there should be no bitter memory that in looking back at all this in after years you should never be able to dwell upon any harsh or unkind word of mine it is on that account and also because i feel that it is not for me to judge you and that you have already much to bear that i do as you ask me and say philip from my heart i forgive you as i trust that the almighty may forgive me  he flung himself upon his knees before her and tried to take her hand you do not know how you have humbled me he groaned  she gazed at him with pity  i am sorry she said i did not wish to humble you i have one word more to say and then i must go i have just bid my last earthly farewell toyour wife my farewell to you must be as complete as that as complete as though the grave had already swallowed one of us we have done with each other for ever i do not think that i shall come back here in my waking moments your name shall never willingly pass my lips again i will say it for the last time now philip philip philip whom i chose to love out of all the world i pray god that he will take me or deaden the edge of what i suffer and that he may never let my feet cross your path or my eyes fall upon your face again  in another second she had passed out of the room and out of his life    that night or rather just before dawn on the following morning hilda knowing that her end was very near sent for her husband  go quickly doctor she said i shall die at dawn  the doctor found him seated in the same spot where maria lee had left him  what more misery he said when he had told his errand i cannot bear it there is a curse upon medeath and wickedness misery and death  you must come if you wish to see your wife alive  i will come and he rose and followed him  a sad sight awaited him the moment of the grey dawn was drawing near and by his wifes request a window had been unshuttered that her dimmed eyes might once more look upon the light on the great bed in the centre of the room lay hilda whose life was now quickly draining from her and by her side was placed the sleeping infant she was raised and supported on either side by pillows and her unbound golden hair fell around her shoulders enclosing her face as in a frame her pallid countenance seemed touched with an awful beauty that had not belonged to it in life whilst in her eyes was that dread and prescient gaze which sometimes come to those who are about to solve deaths mystery  by the side of the bed knelt mr fraser the clergyman of the parish repeating in an earnest tone the prayers for the dying whilst the sadfaced attendants moved with muffled tread backwards and forwards from the ring of light around the bed into the dark shadows that lay beyond  when philip came the clergyman ceased praying and drew back into the further part of the room as did pigott and the nurse the former taking the baby with her  hilda motioned to him to come close to her he came and bent over and kissed her and she with an effort threw one ivory arm around his neck and smiled sweetly after about a minute during which she was apparently collecting her thoughts she spoke in a low voice and in her native tongue  i have not sent for you before philip for two reasonsfirst because i wished to spare you pain and next in order that i might have time to rid my mind of angry thoughts against you they are all gone nowgone with every other earthly interest but i was angry with you philip and now listen to mefor i have not much timeand do not forget my words in future years when the story of my life will seem but as a shadow that once fell upon your path change your ways philip dear abandon deceit atone for the past if you can make your peace with maria lee and marry herah it is a pity that you did not do that at first and leave me to go my waysand above all humble your heart before the power that i am about to face i love you dear and notwithstanding all i am thankful to have been your wife please god we shall meet again  she paused awhile and then spoke in english to the astonishment of all her voice was strong and clear and she uttered her words with an energy that under the circumstances seemed almost awful  tell her to bring the child  there was no need for philip to repeat what she said for pigott heard her and at once came forward with the baby which she laid beside her  the dying woman placed her hand upon its tiny head and turning her eyes upwards with the rapt expression of one who sees a vision said  may the power of god be about you to protect you my motherless babe may angels guard you and make you as they are and may the heavy curse and everlasting doom of the almighty fall upon those who would bring evil upon you  she paused and then addressed her husband  philip you have heard my words in your charge i leave the child see that you never betray my trust  then turning to pigott she said in a fainter voice  thank you for your kindness to me you have a good face if you can stop with my child and give her your love and care and now may god have mercy on my soul  then came a minutes silence broken only by the stifled sobs of those who stood around till a ray of light from the rising sun struggled through the grey mist of the morning and touching the heads of mother and child illumined them as with a glory it passed as quickly as it came drawing away with it the mothers life suddenly as it faded she spread out her arms sighed and smiled when the doctor reached the bed her story was told she had fallen asleep  death had been very gentle with her                                 chapter xiii  go my reader if the day is dull and you feel inclined to moralize for whatever may be said to the contrary there are less useful occupationsand look at your village churchyard what do you see before you a plot of enclosed ground backed by a grey old church a number of tombstones more or less decrepit and a great quantity of little oblong mounds covered with rank grass if you have any imagination any power of thought you will see more than that first with the instinctive selfishness of human nature you will recognize your own future habitation perhaps your eye will mark the identical spot where the body you love must lie through all seasons and weathers through the slow centuries that will flit so fast for you till the crash of doom it is good that you should think of that although it makes you shudder the english churchyard takes the place of the egyptian mummy at the feast or the slave in the roman conquerors carit mocks your vigour and whispers of the end of beauty and strength  probably you need some such reminder but if giving to the inevitable the sigh that is its due you pursue the vein of thought it may further occur to you that the plot before you is in a sense a summary of the aspirations of humanity it marks the realization of human hopes it is the crown of human ambitions the grave of human failures here too is the end of the man and here the birthplace of the angel or the demon it is his sure inheritance one that he never solicits and never squanders and last it is the only certain restingplace of sleepless tired mortality  here it was that they brought hilda and the old squire and laid them side by side against the coffin of yeoman caresfoot whose fancy it had been to be buried in stone and then piling primroses and blackthorn blooms upon their graves left them to their chilly sleep farewell to them they have passed to where as yet we may not follow violent old man and proud and lovely woman rest in peace if peace be the portion of you both  to return to the living the news of the sudden decease of old mr caresfoot of the discovery of philips secret marriage and the death of his wife of the terms of the old mans will under which hilda being dead and having only left a daughter behind her george inherited all the unentailed portion of the property with the curious provision that he was never to leave it back to philip or his children of the sudden departure of miss lee and of many other things that were some of them true and some of them false following as they did upon the heels of the great dinnerparty and the announcement made thereat threw the countryside into a state of indescribable ferment when this settled down it left a strong and permanent residuum of public indignation and contempt directed against philip the more cordially perhaps because he was no longer a rich man people very rarely express contempt or indignation against a rich man who happens to be their neighbour in the country whatever he may have done they keep their virtue for those who are impoverished or for their unfortunate relations but for philip it was felt that there was no excuse and no forgiveness he had lost both his character and his money and must therefore be cut and from that day forward he was cut accordingly  as for philip himself he was fortunately as yet ignorant of the kind intentions of his friends and neighbours who had been so fond of him a week ago he had enough upon his shoulders without thatfor he had spoken no lie when he told maria lee that he was crushed by the dreadful and repeated blows that had fallen upon him blows that had robbed him of everything that made life worth living and given him in return nothing but an infant who could not inherit and who was therefore only an incumbrance  who is it that says after all let a bad man take what pains he may to push it down a human soul is an awful ghostly unique possession for a bad man to have during the time that had elapsed between the death and burial of his father and wife philip had become thoroughly acquainted with the truth of this remark  do what he would he could never for a single hour shake himself free from the recollection of his fathers death whenever he shut his eyes his uneasy mind continually conjured up the whole scene with uncanny distinctness the gloomy room the contorted face of the dying man the red flicker of the firelight on the wallall these things were burnt deep into the tablets of his memory more and more did he recognize the fact that even should he live long enough to bury the events of that hour beneath the debris of many years the lapse of time would be insufficient to bring forgetfulness and the recognition brought with it moral helplessness he had too sufficient religious feeling to make him uneasy as to his future fate and possessed a certain amount of imagination which was at this time all directed towards that awful day when he and his dead father must settle their final accounts already in the quiet nights he would wake with a start thinking that the inevitable time had come superstitious fears also would seize him with their clammy fingers and he would shake and tremble at the fancied step of ghostly feet and his blood would curdle in his veins as his mind hearkened to voices that were for ever still  and worst of all what had been done and could never be undone had been done in vain these deadly torments must be endured whilst the object for which they had been incurred had utterly escaped him he had sold himself to the powers of evil for a price and that price had not been paid but the bond was good for all that  and so he would brood hour after hour till he felt himself drawing near to madness sometimes by a strong effort he would succeed in tearing his mind away from the subject but then its place was instantly filled by a proud form with reproachful eyes and he would feel that there too death had put it out of his power to make atonement of those whom he had wronged maria lee alone survived and she had left him in sorrow more bitter than any anger truly philip caresfoot was in melancholy case somewhere he had read that the wages of sin is death but surely what he felt surpassed the bitterness of death his evildoing had not prospered with him the snare he had set for his father had fallen back upon himself and he was a crushed and ruined man  it affords a curious insight into his character to reflect that all these piledup calamities all this wreck and sudden death did not bring him penitent on his knees before the maker he had outraged the crimes he had committed especially if unsuccessful or the sorrows that had fallen upon him would have sufficed to reduce ninetenths of ordinary men to a condition of humble supplication for generally speaking irreligion or rather forgetfulness of god is a plant of no deep growth in the human heart since its roots are turned by the rock of that innate knowledge of a higher power that forms the foundation of every soul and on which we are glad enough to set our feet when the storms of trouble and emergency threaten to destroy us but with philip this was not so he never thought of repentance his was not the nature to fall down and say lord i have sinned take thou my burden from me indeed he was not so much sorry for the past as fearful for the future it was not grief for wrongdoing that wrung his heart and broke his spirit but rather his natural sorrow at losing the only creature he had ever deeply loved chagrin at the shame of his position and the failure of his hopes and the icy fingers of superstitious fears  the crisis had come and passed he had sinned against his father in heaven and his father on earth and he did not sorrow for his sin his wife had left him murmuring with her dying lips exhortations to repentance and he did not soften shame and loss had fallen upon him and he did not turn to god but his pride was broken all that remained to him of strength was his wickedness the flood that had swept over him had purged away not the evil but the good from the evil it only took its courage henceforth if he sins at all his will be no bold and hazardous villany which whilst it excites horror can almost compel respect but rather the low and sordid crime the safe and treacherous iniquity  ajax no longer defies the lightninghe mutters curses on it beneath his breath  on the evening of the double funeralwhich philip did not feel equal to attending and at which george in a most egregious hatband and with many sobs and tears officiated as chief mournermr fraser thought it would be a kind act on his part to go and offer such consolation to the bereaved man as lay within his power if indeed he would accept it somewhat contrary to his expectation he was on arrival at the abbey house asked in without delay  i am glad to see a human face said philip to the clergyman as he entered the room this loneliness is intolerable i am as much alone as though i lay stark in the churchyard like my poor wife  mr fraser did not answer him immediately so taken up was he in noticing the wonderful changes a week had wrought in his appearance not only did his countenance bear traces of the illness and exhaustion that might not unnaturally be expected in such a case of bereavement but it faithfully reflected the change that had taken place in his mental attitude his eyes had lost the frank boldness that had made them very pleasing to some people they looked scared the mouth too was rendered conspicuous by the absence of the firm lines that once gave it character indeed the mans whole appearance was pitiful and almost abject  i am afraid he said at length in a tone of gentle compassion that you must have suffered a great deal caresfoot  suffered i have suffered the tortures of the damned i still suffer them i shall always suffer them  i do not wish said the clergyman with a little hesitation to appear officious or to make a mockery of your grief by telling you that it is for your good but i should fail in my duty if i did not point out to you that he who strikes the blow has the power to heal the wound and that very often such things are for our ultimate benefit either in this world or the next carry your troubles to him my dear fellow acknowledge his hand and if you know in your heart of any way in which you have sinned offer him your hearty repentance do this and you will not be deserted your life that now seems to you nothing but ashes may yet be both a happy and a useful one  philip smiled bitterly as he answered  you talk to me of repentancehow can i repent when providence has treated me so cruelly robbing me at a single blow of my wife and my fortune i know that i did wrong in concealing my marriage but i was driven to it by fear of my father ah if you had seen him as i saw him you would have known that they were right to call him devil caresfoot he checked himself and then went onhe forced me into the engagement with miss lee and announced it without my consent now i am ruinedeverything is taken from me  you have your little daughter and all the entailed estateat least so i am told  my little daughteri never want to see her face she killed her mother if it had been a boy it would have been different for then at any rate that accursed george would not have got my birthright my little daughter indeed dont enumerate her among my earthly blessings  it is rather sad to hear you talk like that of your child but at any rate you are not left in want you have one of the finest old places in the county and a thousand a year which to most men would be riches  and which to me answered philip is beggary i should have had six and i have got one but look you here fraser i swear before god  hush i cannot listen to such talk  well then before anything you like that while i live i will never rest one single moment until i get my own back again it may seem impossible but i will find a way for instance he added as a thought struck him strangely enough the will does not forbid me to buy the lands back if i can get them no other way i will buy them do you heari will buy them i must have them again before i die  how will you get the money  the moneyi will save it make it steal it get it somehow oh do not be afraid i will get the money it will take a few years but i will get it somehow it is not the want of a few thousands that will stop a determined man  and suppose your cousin wont sell  i will find a way to make him sellsome bribe something there there and his enthusiasm and eagerness vanished in a moment and the broken look came back upon his face its all nonsense i am talking impossibilitiesa little weak in my mind i suppose forget it theres a good fellow say nothing about it and so you buried them ah me ah me and george did chief mourner i suppose he blubbered freely he always could blubber freely when he liked i remember how he used to take folks in as a lad and then laugh at them thats why they called him crocodile at school well hes my master now and im his very humble servant perhaps one day it will be the other way up again what must you go if you knew how fearfully lonely i am you would not go my nerves have quite gone and i fancy all sorts of things i can think of nothing but those two graves out there in the dark have they sodded them over tell them to sod them over it was kind of you to come and see me you mustnt pay any attention to my talk i am not quite myself good night  mr fraser was an extremely unsuspicious man but somehow as he picked his way to the vicarage to eat his solitary chop he felt a doubt rising in his mind as to whether his disclaimer notwithstanding philip had not sincerely meant all he said  he is shockingly changed he mused and i am not sure that it is a change for the better poor fellow he has a great deal to bear and should be kindly judged it is all so painful that i must try to divert my mind mrs brown will you bring me a little chocolate coloured book that you will see on the table in my study when you come back with the potatoes it has platoplatoprinted on the back                                 chapter xiv  the jubilation of george at the turn events had taken may perhaps be more easily imagined than described there is generally one weak point about all artful schemes to keep other people out of their rights they break down over some unforeseen detail or through the neglect of some trivial and obvious precaution but this was one of the glorious instances to the contrary that prove the rule nothing had broken down everything had prospered as a holy cause always should and does in theory the stars in their courses had fought for sisera everything had succeeded beyond expectation nothing had failed in the gratitude of his heart george would willingly have given a thousand pounds towards the establishment of a trainingschool for anonymous letterwriters or the erection of a statue to hilda caresfoot whose outraged pride and womanly jealousy had done him such yeoman service  speaking seriously he had great cause for rejoicing instead of a comparatively slender younger sons portion he had stepped into a fine and unencumbered property of over five thousand a year and that in the heyday of his youth when in the full possession of all his capacities for enjoyment which were large indeed henceforth everything that money could buy would be his including the respect and flattery of his poorer neighbours an added flavour too was given to the overflowing cup of his good fortune by the fact that it had been wrenched from the hands of the cousin whom he hated and on whom he had from a boy sworn to be avenged poor philip bankrupt in honour and broken in fortune he could afford to pity him now to pity him ostentatiously and in public he was openhanded with his pity was george nor did he lack a sympathizer in these delicious moments of unexpected triumph  did i not tell you said mrs bellamy in her full rich tones on the afternoon of the reading of the willdid i not tell you that if you would consent to be guided by me i would pull you through and have i not pulled you through never misdoubt my judgment again my dear george it is infinitely sounder than your own  you did anne you certainly did you are a charming woman and as clever as you are charming  compliments are all very well and i am sure i appreciate yoursand she gave a little curtseyat their proper value but i must remind you george that i have done my part of the bargain and that now you must do yours  oh thats all right bellamy shall have the agency and two hundred a year with it and to show you that i have not forgotten you perhaps you will accept this in memorial of our joint achievement and he drew from his pocket and opened a case containing a superb set of sapphires  mrs bellamy had all a beautiful womans love for jewels and especially adored sapphires  oh she said clasping her hands thank you george they are perfectly lovely  perhaps he replied politely but not half so lovely as their wearer i wonder he added with a little laugh what the old boy would say if he could know that a thousand pounds of his personalty had gone by anticipation to buy a necklace for anne bellamy  to this remark she made no reply being apparently absorbed in her own thoughts at last she spoke  i dont want to seem ungracious george but theseand she touched the jewelswere not the reward i expected i want the letters you promised me back  my dear anne you are under a mistake i never promised you the letters i said that under the circumstances i might possibly restore thema very different thing from promising  mrs bellamy flushed a little and the great pupils of her sleepy eyes contracted till she looked quite dangerous  then i must have strangely misunderstood you she said  what do you want the letters for cant you trust me with them  dont you think george that if you had passed through something very terrible you would like to have all the mementoes of that dark time destroyed those letters are the record of my terrible time nothing remains of it but those written lines i want to burn them to stamp them into powder to obliterate them as i have obliterated all the past whilst they exist i can never feel safe supposing you were to turn traitor to me and let those letters fall into the hands of others supposing that you lost them i should be a ruined woman i speak frankly you see i fully appreciate my danger principally because i know that the more intimate a man and woman have been the more chance there is of their becoming bitter enemies george give me those letters do not overcloud my future with the shadows of the past  you talk as well as you do everything else anne you are really a very remarkable woman but curiously enough those letters the existence of which is so obnoxious to you are to me a source of great interest you know that i love to study charactercurious occupation for a young man isnt itbut i do well in my small experience i have never yet either in fiction or in real life come across such a fascinating display as is reflected in those letters there i can and often do trace in minutest detail the agony of a strong mind can see the barriers of what people call religion early training self respect and other curiosities which we name virtues bursting away one by one under pressure like the watertight bulkheads they put in passenger steamers till at length the work is done the moral ship sinks and the writer stands revealed what you are my dear anne the loveliest the cleverest and the most utterly unscrupulous woman in the three kingdoms  she rose very quietly but quite white with passion and answered in her low voice  whatever i am you made me and you are a devil george caresfoot or you could not take pleasure in the tortures you inflicted before you destroyed but dont go too far or you may regret it am i a woman to be played with i think that you have trained me too well  he laughed a little uneasily  there you see grattez le russe c and out comes the true character look at your face in the glass it is magnificent but not pleasant rather dangerous indeed why anne do be reasonable if i gave you those letters i should never be able to sleep in peace for the sake of my own safety i dare not abandon the whiphand i have of you remember you could if you chose say some unpleasant things about me and i dont want that any more than you do just now but you see whilst i hold in my power what would if necessary effectually ruin you and probably bellamy toofor this country society is absurdly prejudicedi have little cause for fear perhaps in the future you may be able to render me some service for which you shall have the letterswho knows you see i am perfectly frank with you for the simple reason that i know that it is useless to try to conceal my thoughts from a person of your perception  well well perhaps you are right it is difficult to trust oneself much less any one else at any rate she said with a bitter smile you have given me bellamy a start in society and a sapphire necklace in twenty years i hope if the fates are kind to have lost bellamy on the roadhe is really unendurableto rule society and to have as many sapphire necklaces and other fine things as i care for in enumerating my qualities you omitted one ambition  with your looks your determination and your brains there is nothing that you will not be able to do if you set your mind to it and dont make an enemy of your devoted friend  and thus the conversation ended  now little bellamy had after much anxious thought just about this time come to a bold determinationnamely to asset his marital authority over mrs bellamy indeed his selfpride was much injured by the treatment he received at his wifes hands for it seemed to him that he was utterly ignored in his own house in fact it would not be too much to say that he was an entire nonentity he had married mrs bellamy for love or rather from fascination though she had nothing in the worldmarried her in a fortnight from the time that george had first introduced him when he had walked out of church with his beautiful bride he had thought himself the luckiest man in london whereas now he could not but feel that matrimony had not fulfilled his expectations in the first place loves young dreamhe was barely thirtycame to a rude awakening for once married it was impossible though he had in common with the majority of little men a tolerably good opinion of himselfbut that he should perceive that his wife did not care one brass farthing about him to his soft advances she was as cold as a marble statue the lovely eyes never grew tender for him indeed he found that she was worse than a statue for statues cannot indulge in bitter mockery and contemptuous comments and mrs bellamy could and what is more frequently did  it is very well reflected her husband to marry the loveliest woman in the county but i dont see the use of it if she treats one like a dog  at last this state of affairs had grown intolerable and meditating in the solitude of his office mr bellamy resolved to assert himself once and for all and set matters on a proper footing and mrs bellamy in her place but it is one thing for husbands of the bellamy stamp to form highstomached resolutions and another for them to put those resolutions into active and visible operation on wives of the mrs bellamy stamp indeed had it not been for a little incident about to be detailed it is doubtful if mr bellamy would have ever come to the scratch at all  when george had gone mrs bellamy sat down in by no means the sweetest of tempers to think but thinking in this instance proved an unprofitable occupation and she gave it up in order to admire the sapphire necklace that lay upon her knee at that moment her husband entered the room but she took no notice merely going on examining the stones after moving about a little as though to attract attention the gentleman spoke  i have managed to get home to lunch my dear  indeed  well you might take a little notice of me  why is there anything remarkable about you this morning  no there is not but remarkable or not a man who has been fool enoughmr bellamy laid great emphasis on the word foolto get married has a right to expect when he comes into his own house that he will have a little notice taken of him and not be as completely overlooked asas though he were a tub of butter in a grocers shop and he pugged out his chest rubbed his hands and looked defiant  the lady laid her head back on the chair and laughed with exquisite enjoyment  really my dear john you will kill me she said at length  may i ask he replied looking as though there was nothing in the world that he would like better what you are laughing at  your slightly vulgar but happy simile it is easy to see where you draw your inspiration from if you had only said butterine inferior butter you know the counterfeit article it would have been perfect  her husband gave a glance at his tubby little figure in the glass  am i to understand that you refer to me as butterine mrs bellamy  oh certainly yes if you like but butter or not you will melt if you lose your temper so  i have not lost my temper madam i am perfectly cool he replied positively gasping with fury here his eye fell upon the necklace what necklace is that who gave you that necklace i demand to know  you demand to know be careful what you say please mr george caresfoot gave me the necklace it cost a thousand pounds are you satisfied  no i am not satisfied i will not have that cursed george caresfoot continually here i will send him back his necklace i will assert my rights as an englishman and a spouse i will  you will sit down and listen to me  the tone of the voice checked his absurd linguistic and physical capers and caused him to look at his wife she was standing and pointing to a chair her face was calm and immovable only her eyes appeared to expand and contract with startling rapidity one glance was enough for bellamy he felt frightened and sat down in the indicated chair  thats right she said pleasantly now we can have a cosy chat john you are a lawyer and therefore i suppose more or less a man of the world now as a lawyer and a man of the world i ask you to look at me and then at yourself and say if you think it likely or even possible that i married you for love to be frank i did nothing of the sort i married you because you were the person most suited to my purpose if you will only understand that it will save us both a great deal of trouble as for your talk about asserting yourself and exercising your authority it is simple nonsense you are very well in your way my dear john and a fair attorney but do you suppose for one moment that you are capable of matching yourself against me if so you make a shocking mistake be advised and do not try the experiment but dont think that the bargain is all my sideit is not if you will behave yourself properly and be guided by my advice i will make you one of the richest and most powerful men in the county if you will not i shall shake myself free of you as soon as i am strong enough rise i must and will and if you will not rise with me i will rise alone as regards your complaints of my not caring about you the world is wide my dear john console yourself elsewhere i shall not be jealous and now i think i have explained everything it is so much more satisfactory to have a clear understanding come shall we go to lunch  but bellamy wanted no lunch that day  after all he soliloquized to himself between the pangs of a racking headache brought on by his outburst of temper time sometimes brings its revenges and if it does you may look out mrs bellamy                                  chapter xv  it is perhaps time that the reader should know a little of the ancient house and loyalty where many of the personages of whose history these pages treat lived and moved and had their being  the abbey house so called was in reality that part of the monastery which had been devoted to the use of successive generations of priors it was like the ruins that lay to its rear entirely built of grey masonry rendered greyer still by the lichens that fed upon its walls which were of exceeding strength and thickness it was a long irregular building and roofed with old and narrow tiles which from red had in the course of ages faded to sober russet the banqueting hall was a separate building at its northern end and connected with the main dwelling by a covered way the aspect of the house was westerly and the front windows looked on to an expanse of parklike land heavily timbered with oaks of large size some of them pollards that might have pushed their first leaves in the time of william the conqueror in spring their vivid green was diversified by the reddish brown of a double line of noble walnuttrees a full half mile in length marking the track of the carriagedrive that led to the roxham highroad  behind the house lay the walled garden celebrated in the time of the monks as being a fortnight earlier than any other in the neighbourhood skirting the southern wall of this garden which was a little less than a hundred paces long the visitor reached the scattered ruins of the old monastery that had for generations served as a stone quarry to the surrounding villages but of which enough was left including a magnificent gateway to show how great had been its former extent passing on through these he would come to an enclosure that marked the boundaries of the old graveyard now turned to agricultural uses and then to the church itself a building with a very fine tower but possessing no particular interest if we except some exceedingly good brasses and a colossal figure of a monk cut out of the solid heart of an oak and supposed to be the effigy of a prior of the abbey who died in the time of edward i below the church again and about one hundred and fifty paces from it was the vicarage a comparatively modern building possessing no architectural attraction and evidently reared out of the remains of the monastery  at the south end of the abbey house itself lay a small grass plot and pleasuregarden fringed with shrubberies and adorned with two fine cedartrees one of these trees was at its further extremity and under it there ran a path cut through the dense shrubbery this path which was edged with limes and called the tunnel walk led to the lake and debouched in the little glade where stood caresfoots staff the lake itself was a fine piece of water partly natural and partly constructed by the monks measuring a full mile round and from fifty to two hundred yards in width it was in the shape of a mans shoe the heel facing west like the house but projecting beyond it the narrow part representing the hollow of the instep being exactly opposite to it and the sole swelling out in an easterly direction  bratham abbey was altogether a fine old place but the most remarkable thing about it was its air of antiquity and the solemnity of its peace it did not indeed strike the spirit with that religious awe which is apt to fall upon us as we gaze along the vaulted aisles of great cathedrals but it appealed perhaps with equal strength to the softer and more reflective side of our nature for generation after generation that house had been the home of men like ourselves they had passed and were forgotten but it remained the sole witness of the stories of their lives hands of which the very bones had long since crumbled into dust had planted those old oaks and walnuts that still donned their green robes in summer and shed them in the autumn to stand great skeletons through the winter months awaiting the resurrection of the spring  there lay upon the place and its surroundings a burden of dead lives intangible but none the less real the air was thick with memories as suggestive as the grey dust in a vault even in the summer in the full burst of nature revelling in her strength the place was sad but in the winter when the wind came howling through the groaning trees and drove the grey scud across an ashy sky when the birds were dumb and there were no cattle on the sodden lawn its isolated melancholy was a palpable thing  that hoary house might have been a gateway of the dim land we call the past looking down in stony sorrow on the follies of those who so soon must cross its portals and to the wise who could hear the lesson pregnant with echoes of the warning voices of many generations  here it was that angela grew up to womanhood    some nine and a half years had passed from the date of the events described in the foregoing pages when one evening mr fraser bethought him that he had been indoors all day and proposed reading till late that night and that therefore he had better take some exercise  a tall and somewhat nervouslooking man with dark eyes a sensitive mouth and that peculiar stoop and pallor of complexion which those devoted to much study almost invariably acquire he had student written on his face his history was a sufficiently common one he possessed academical abilities of a very high order and had in his youth distinguished himself greatly at college both as a classical and a mathematical scholar when quite young he was appointed through the influence of a relation to his present living where the income was good and the population very small indeed freed from all necessity for exertion he shut himself up with his books having his little round of parish work for relaxation and never sought to emerge from the quiet of his aimless studies to struggle for fame and place in the laborious world mr fraser was what people call an able man thrown away if they had known his shy sensitive nature a little better they would have understood that he was infinitely more suited for the solitary and peaceful lot in life which he had chosen than to become a unit in the turbulent and greedy crowd that is struggling through all the ages up the slippery slopes of the temple of that greatest of our godssuccess  there are many such men probably you my reader know one or two with infinite labour they store up honey from the fields of knowledge collect endless data from the statistics of science pile up their calculations against the very stars and all to no end as a rule they do not write books they gather the learning for the learnings sake and for the very love of it rejoice to count their labour lost and thus they go on from year to year until the golden bowl is broken and the pitcher broken at the fountain and the gathered knowledge sinks or appears to sink back to whence it came alas that one generation cannot hand on its wisdom and experiencemore especially its experienceto another in its perfect form if it could we men should soon become as gods  it was a mild evening in the latter end of october when mr fraser started on his walk the moon was up in the heavens as he an hour later made his way from the side of the lake where he had been wandering back to the churchyard through which he had to pass to reach the vicarage just before he came to the gate however he was surprised in such a solitary spot to see a slight figure leaning against the wall opposite the place where lay the mortal remains of the old squire and his daughterinlaw hilda he stood still and watched the figure appeared to be gazing steadily at the graves presently it turned and saw him and he recognized the great grey eyes and golden hair of little angela caresfoot  angela my dear what are you doing here at this time of night he asked in some surprise  she blushed a little as she shook hands rather awkwardly with him  dont be angry with me she said in a deprecatory voice but i was so lonely this evening that i came here for company  came here for company what do you mean  she hung her head  come he said tell me what you mean  i dont quite know myself how can i tell you  he looked more puzzled than ever and she observed it and went on  i will try to tell you but you must not be cross like pigott when she cannot understand me sometimes i feel ever so much alone as though i was looking for something and could not find it and then i come and stand here and look at my mothers grave and i get company and am not lonely any more that is all i know i cannot tell you any more do you think me silly pigott does  i think you are a very strange child are you not afraid to come here alone at night  afraidoh no nobody comes here the people in the village dare not come here after dark because they say that the ruins are full of spirits jakes told me that but i must be stupid i cannot see them and i want so very much to see them i hope it is not wrong but i told my father so the other day and he turned white and was angry with pigott for giving me such ideas but you know pigott did not give them to me at all i am not afraid to come i like it it is so quiet and if one listens enough in the quiet i always think one may hear something that other people do not hear  do you hear anything then  yes i hear things but i cannot understand them listen to the wind in the branches of that tree the chestnut off which the leaf is falling now it says something if only i could catch it  yes child yes you are right in a way all nature tells the same eternal tale if our ears were not stopped to its voices he answered with a sigh indeed the childs talk had struck a vein of thought familiar to his own mind and what is more it deeply interested him there was a quaint faroff wisdom in it  it is pleasant tonight is it not mr fraser said the little maid though everything is dying the things die softly without any pain this year last year they were all killed in the rain and wind look at that cloud floating across the moon is it not beautiful i wonder what it is the shadow of i think all the clouds are shadows of something up in heaven  and when there are no clouds  oh then heaven is quite still and happy  but heaven is always happy  is it i dont understand how it can be always happy if we go there there must be so many to be sorry for  mr fraser mused a little that last remark was difficult to answer he looked at the fleecy cloud and falling into her humour said  i think your cloud is the shadow of an eagle carrying a lamb to its little ones  and i think she answered confidently that it is the shadow of an angel carrying a baby home  again he was silenced the idea was infinitely more poetical than his own  this he reflected is a child of a curious mental calibre  before he could pursue the thought further she broke in upon it in quite a different strain  have you seen jack and jill they are jolly  who are jack and jill  why my ravens of course i got them out of the old tree with a hole in it at the end of the lake  the tree at the end of the lake why the hole where the ravens nest is fifty feet up who got them for you  i got them myself samyou know samwas afraid to go up he said he should fall and that the old birds would peck his eyes so i went by myself one morning quite early with a bag tied round my neck and got up it was hard work and i nearly tumbled once but i got on the bough beneath the hole at last it shook very much it is so rotten you have no idea there were three little ones in the nest all with great mouths i took two and left one for the old birds when i was nearly down again the old birds found me out and flew at me and beat my head with their wings and peckedoh they did peck look here and she showed him a scar on her hand thats where they pecked but i stuck to my bag and got down at last and im glad i did for we are great friends now and i am sure the cross old birds would be quite pleased if they knew how nicely i am educating their young ones and how their manners have improved but i say mr fraser dont tell pigott she cannot climb trees and does not like to see me do it she does not know i went after them myself  mr fraser laughed  i wont tell her angela my dear but you must be carefulyou might tumble and kill yourself  i dont think i shall mr fraser unless i am meant to god looks after me as much when i am up a tree as when i am upon the ground  once more he had nothing to say he could not venture to disturb her faith  i will walk home with you my dear tell me angela would you like to learn  learnlearn what  books and the languages that other nations nations that have passed away used to talk and how to calculate numbers and distances  yes i should like to learn very much but who will teach me i have learnt all pigott knows two years ago and since then i have been trying to learn about the trees and flowers and stars but i look and watch and cant understand  ah my dear contact with nature is the highest education but the mind that would appreciate her wonders must have a foundation of knowledge to work upon the uneducated man is rarely sensitive to the thousand beauties and marvels of the fields around him and the skies above him but if you like i will teach you angela i am practically an idle man and it will give me great pleasure but you must promise to work and do what i tell you  oh how good you are of course i will work when am i to begin  i dont knowtomorrow if you like but i must speak to your father first  her face fell a little at the mention of her fathers name but presently she said quietly  my father he will not care if i learn or not i hardly ever see my father he does not like me i see nobody but pigott and you and old jakes and sam sometimes you need not ask my father he will never miss me whilst i am learning ask pigott  at that moment pigott herself hove into view in a great flurry  oh here you are miss angela where have you been to you naughty girl at some of your stargazing tricks again ill be bound frightening the life out of a body its just too bad of you miss angela  the little girl looked at her with a peculiarly winning smile and took her very solid hand between her own tiny palms  dont be cross pigott dear she said i didnt mean to frighten you i couldnt help goingi couldnt indeed and then i stopped talking to mr fraser  there there i should just like to know who can be cross with you when you put on those ways are your feet wet ah i thought so run on in and take them off  wont that be just a little difficult and she was gone with a merry laugh  there sir thats just like her catching a body up like and twisting what she says till you dont know which is head and which is heels ill be bound you found her down yonder and she nodded towards the churchyard  yes  pigott drew a little nearer and spoke in a low voice  tis my belief sir that that child sees things she is just the oddest child i ever saw theres nothing she likes better than to slip out of a night and to go to that there beastly churchyard saving your presence for company as she calls itnice sort of company indeed and it is just the same way with storms you remember that dreadful gale a month ago the one that took down the north grove and blew the spire off rewtham church well just when it was at its worst and i was asitting and praying that the roof might keep over our heads i look round for angela and cant see her some of your tricks again thinks i to myself and just then up comes mrs jakes to say that sam had seen little missy creeping down the tunnel walk i was that scared that i ran down got hold of sam for jakes said he wouldnt go out with all them trees aflying about in the air like strawsno not for a thousand pounds and off we set after her here pigott paused to groan at the recollection of that walk  well said mr fraser who was rather interestedeverything about this queer child interested him where did you find her  well sir you know where the old wall runs out into the water before caresfoots staff there well at the end of it theres a post sunk in with a ring in it to tie boats to now would you believe it out there at the end of the wall and tied to the ring by a scarf passed round her middle was that dreadful child she was standing there her back against the post right in the teeth of the gale with the spray dashing over her her arms stretched out before her her hat gone her long hair standing out behind straight as an iron bar and her eyes flashing as though they were on fire and all the while there were the great trees crashing down all round in a way enough to make a body sick with fright we got her back safe thank god but how long we shall keep her im sure i dont know now she is drowning herself in the lake for she takes to the water like a duck and now breaking her neck off trees and now going to ghosts in the churchyard for company its wearing me to the bonethats what it is  mr fraser smiled for to tell the truth pigotts bones were pretty comfortably covered  come he said you would not part with her for all her wicked deeds would you  part with her answered pigott in hot indignation part with my little beauty i would rather part with my head the love there never was another like her nor never will be with her sweet ways and if i know anything about girls shell be the beauty of england she will shes made for a beautiful woman and look at them eyes and forehead and hairwhere did you ever see the like and as for her queer ways what can you expect from a child as has got a great empty mind and nothing to put in it and no one to talk to but a common woman like me and a fatherhere she dropped her voiceas is a miser and hates the sight of his own flesh and blood  hush you should not say such things pigott now i will tell you something i am going on to ask your master to allow me to educate angela  im right glad to hear it sir shes sharp enough to learn anything and its kind of you to teach her if you can make her mind like what her body will be if she lives somebody will be a lucky man one of these days goodnight sir and many thanks for bringing missy home  next day angela began her education                                 chapter xvi  reader we are about to see angela again and to see a good deal of her but you must be prepared for a change in her personal appearance for the curtain has been down for ten years since last you met the child whose odd propensities excited pigotts wonder and indignation and mr frasers interest and ten years as we all know can work many changes in the history of the world and individuals in ten years some have been swept clean off the board and their places taken by others a few have grown richer many poorer some of us sadder some wiser and all of us ten years older now this was exactly what had happened to little angelathat is the angela we knew as little and ten years make curious differences between the slim child of nine and a half and the woman of nearly twenty  when we last saw her angela was about to commence her education let us reintroduce ourselves on the memorable evening when after ten years of study mr fraser a master by no means easily pleased expressed himself unable to teach her any more  it is christmas eve drip drop drip falls the rain from the leafless boughs on to the sodden earth the apology for daylight that has been doing its dull duty for the last few hours is slowly effacing itself and the gale is celebrating the fact and showing its joy at the closingin of the melancholy night by howling its loudest through the trees and flogging the flying scud it has brought with it from the sea till it whirls across the sky like a succession of ghostly racehorses  this is outside the vicarage let us look within in a wellworn arm chair in the comfortable study near to a table covered with books and holding some loose sheets of foolscap in his hand sits mr fraser his hair is a little greyer than when he began angelas education about as grey as rather accommodating hair will get at the age of fiftythree otherwise his general appearance is much the same and his face as refined and gentlemanlike as ever presently he lays down the sheets of paper which he has been studying attentively and says  your solution is perfectly sound angela but you have arrived at it in a characteristic fashion and by your own road not but what your method has some meritsfor one thing it is more concise than my own but on the other hand it shows a feminine weakness it is not possible to follow every step from your premises to your conclusion correct as it is  ah says a low voice with a happy ripple in it the owner of which is busy with some teathings out of range of the ring of light thrown by the double readinglamp you often blame me for jumping to conclusions but what does it matter provided they are right the whole secret is that i used the equivalent algebraic formula but suppressed the working in order to puzzle you and the voice laughed sweetly  that is not worthy of a mathematician said mr fraser with some irritation it is nothing but a trick a tour de force  the solution is correct you say  quite  then i maintain that it is perfectly mathematical the object of mathematics is to arrive at the truth  vox et preterea nihil come out of that corner my dear i hate arguing with a person i cannot see but there there what is the use of arguing at all the fact is angela you are a firstclass mathematician and i am only secondclass i am obliged to stick to the old tracks you cut a roman road of your own great masters are entitled to do that the algebraic formula never occurred to me when i worked the problem out and it took me two days to do  you are trying to make me vain you forget that whatever i know which is just enough to show me how much i have to learn i have learnt from you as for being your superior in mathematics i dont think that as a clergyman you should make such a statement here is your tea and the owner of the voice came forward into the ring of light  she was tall beyond the ordinary height of woman and possessed unusual beauty of form that the tightfitting grey dress she wore was well calculated to display her complexion which was of a dazzling fairness was set off by the darkness of the lashes that curled over the deep grey eyes the face itself was rounded and very lovely and surmounted by an ample forehead whilst her hair which was twisted into a massive knot was of a tinge of chestnut gold and marked with deepset ripples the charm of her face however did not as is so often the case begin and end with its physical attractions there was more much more in it than that but how is it possible to describe on paper a presence at once so full of grace and dignity of the soft loveliness of woman and of a higher and more spiritual beauty there hangs in the louvre a picture by raphael which represents a saint passing with light steps over the prostrate form of a dragon there is in that heaveninspired face the equal of which has been rarely if ever put on canvas a blending of earthly beauty and of the calm awecompelling spiritgazethat gaze that holy dignity which can only come to such as are in truth and in deed pure in heartthat will give to those who know it a better idea of what angela was like than any written description  at times but ah how rarely we may have seen some such look as that she wore on the faces of those around us it may be brought by a great sorrow or be the companion of an overwhelming joy it may announce the consummation of some sublime selfsacrifice or convey the swift assurance of an everlasting love it is to be found alike on the features of the happy mother as she kisses her newborn babe and on the pallid countenance of the saint sinking to his rest the sharp moment that brings us nearer god and goes nigh to piercing the veil that hides his presence is the occasion that calls it into being it is a beauty born of the murmuring sound of the harps of heaven it is the light of the eternal lamp gleaming faintly through its earthly casket  this spiritlook before which all wickedness must feel ashamed had found a home in angelas grey eyes there was a strange nobility about her whether it dwelt in the stately form or on the broad brow or in the large glance of the deep eyes it is not possible to say but it was certainly a part of herself as selfevident as her face or features she might well have been the inspiration of the lines that run                      truth in her might beloved                       grand in her sway                     truth with her eyes beloved                       clearer than day                     holy and pure beloved                       spotless and free                     is there one thing beloved                       fairer than thee   mr fraser absently set down the tea that angela was giving him when we took the liberty to describe her personal appearance  now angela read a little  what shall i read  oh anything you like please yourself  thus enjoined she went to a bookshelf and taking down two volumes handed one to mr fraser and then opening her copy at haphazard announced the page to her companion and sitting down began to read  what sound is this now soft and melodious as the sweep of a summer gale over a southern sea and now again like to the distant stamp and rush and break of the wave of battle what can it be but the roll of those magnificent hexameters with which homer charms a listening world and rarely have english lips given them with a juster cadence  stop my dear shut up your book you are as good a greek scholar as i can make you shut up your book for the last time your education my dear angela is satisfactorily completed i have succeeded with you  completed mr fraser said angela openeyed do you mean to say that i am to stop now just as i have begun to learn  my dear you have learnt everything that i can teach you and besides i am going away the day after tomorrow  going away and then and there without the slightest warning angelawho for all her beauty and learning very much resembled the rest of her sexburst into tears  come come angela said mr fraser in a voice meant to be gruff but only succeeding in being husky for oddly enough it is trying even to a clergyman on the wrong side of middleage to be wept over by a lovely woman dont be nonsensical i am only going for a few months  at this intelligence she pulled up a little  oh she said between her sobs how you frightened me how could you be so cruel where are you going to  i am going for a long trip in southern europe do you know that i have scarcely been away from this place for twenty years so i mean to celebrate the conclusion of our studies by taking a holiday  i wish you would take me with you  mr fraser coloured slightly and his eye brightened he sighed as he answered  i am afraid my dear that it would be impossible  something warned angela not to pursue the subject  now angela i believe that it is usual on the occasion of the severance of a scholastic connection to deliver something in the nature of a farewell oration well i am not going to do that but i want you to listen to a few words  she did not answer but drawing a stool to a corner of the fireplace she wiped her eyes and sat down almost at his feet clasping her knees with her hands and gazing rather sadly into the fire  you have dear angela he began been educated in a somewhat unusual way with the result that after ten years of steady work that has been always interesting though sometimes arduous you have acquired information denied to the vast majority of your sex whilst at the same time you could be put to the blush in many things by a schoolgirl of fifteen for instance though i firmly believe that you could at the present moment take a double first at the university your knowledge of english literature is almost nil and your history of the weakest all a womans ordinary accomplishments such as drawing playing singing have of necessity been to a great extent neglected since i was not able to teach them to you myself and you have had to be guided solely by books and by the light of nature in giving to them such time as you could spare  your mind on the other hand has been daily saturated with the noblest thoughts of the intellectual giants of two thousand years ago and would in that respect be as much in place in a welleducated grecian maiden living before the time of christ as in an english girl of the nineteenth century  i have educated you thus angela partly by accident and partly by design you will remember when you began to come here some ten years sinceyou were a little thing thenand i had offered to give you some teaching because you interested me and i saw that you were running wild in mind and body but when i had undertaken the task i was somewhat puzzled how to carry it out it is one thing to offer to educate a little girl and another to do it not knowing where to begin i fell back upon the latin grammar where i had begun myself and so by degrees you slid into the curriculum of a classical and mathematical education then after a year or two i perceived your power of work and your great natural ability and i formed a design i said to myself i will see how far a woman cultivated under favourable conditions can go i will patiently teach this girl till the literature of greece and rome become as familiar to her as her mothertongue till figures and symbols hide no mysteries from her till she can read the heavens like a book i will teach her mind to follow the secret ways of knowledge i will train it till it can soar above its fellows like a falcon above sparrows angela my proud design pursued steadily through many years has been at length accomplished your bright intellect has risen to the strain i have put upon it and you are at this moment one of the best allround scholars of my acquaintance  she flushed to the eyes at this high praise and was about to speak but he stopped her with a motion of the hand and went on  i have recognized in teaching you a fact but too little known that a classical education properly understood is the foundation of all learning there is little that is worth saying which has not already been beautifully said by the ancients little that is worthy of meditation on which they have not already profoundly reflected save indeed the one great subject of christian meditation this foundation my dear angela you possess to an eminent degree henceforth you will need no assistance from me or any other man for to your trained mind all ordinary knowledge will be easy to assimilate you will receive in the course of a few days a parting present from myself in the shape of a box of carefully chosen books on european literature and history devote yourself to the study of these and of the german language which was your mothers native tongue for the next year and then i shall consider that you are fairly finished and then too my dear angela i shall expect to reap a full reward for my labours  what is it that you will expect of me  i shall expect angela and he rose from his chair and walked up and down the room in his excitementi shall expect to see you take your proper place in your generation i shall say choose your own line become a critical scholar a practical mathematician orand perhaps that is what you are most suited for with your imaginative powersa writer of fiction for remember that fiction properly understood and directed to worthy aims is the noblest and most farreaching as it is also the most difficult of the arts in watching the success that will assuredly attend you in this or any other line i shall be amply rewarded for my trouble  angela shook her head with a gesture of doubt but he did not wait for her to answer  well my dear i must not keep you any longerit is quite dark and blowing a gale of windexcept to say one more word remember that all this isindirectly perhaps but still none the less trulya means to an end there are two educations the education of the mind and the education of the soul unless you minister to the latter all the time and toil spent upon the former will prove to little purpose the learning will it is true remain but it will be as the quartz out of which the gold has been already crushed or the dry husks of corn it will be valueless and turn to no good use will serve only to feed the swine of intellectual voluptuousness and infidelity it is believe me the higher learning of the soul that gilds our earthly lore the loftier object of all education is so to train the intellect that it may become competent to understand something however little of the nature of our god and to the true christian the real end of learning is the appreciation of his attributes as exemplified in his mysteries and earthly wonders but perhaps that is a subject on which you are as well fitted to discourse as i am so i will not enter into it finis my dear finis  angelas answer to this long oration was a simple one she rose slowly from her low seat and putting her hands upon mr frasers shoulders kissed him on the forehead and said  how shall i ever learn to be grateful enough for all i owe you what should i have been now but for you how good and patient you have been to me  this embrace affected the clergyman strangely he put his hand to his heart and a troubled look came into his eyes thrusting her gently away from him he sat down  angela he said presently go away now dear i am tired tonight i shall see you at church tomorrow to say goodby  and so she went homewards through the wind and storm little knowing that she left her master to struggle with a tempest far more tremendous than that which raged around her  as for him as the door closed he gave a sigh of relief  pray god i have not put it off too long he said to himself and now for tomorrows sermon sleep for the young laughter for the happy work for old foolswork work work  and thus it was that angela became a scholar                                 chapter xvii  the winter months passed away slowly for angela but not by any means unhappily though she was quite alone and missed mr fraser sadly she found considerable consolation in his present of books and in the thought that she was getting a good hold of her new subjects of study and then came the wonder of the spring with its rush of budding life and who least of all angela could be sad in springtime but nevertheless that spring marked an important change in our heroine for it was during its sweet hours when having put her books aside she would roam alone or in company with her ravens through the flowerstarred woods around the lake that a feeling of restlessness amounting at times almost to dissatisfaction took possession of her indeed as the weeks crept on and she drew near the completion of her twentieth year she realized with a sigh that she could no longer call herself a girl and began to feel that her life was incomplete that something was wanting in it and this was what was wanting in angelas life she had if we except her nurse no one to love and she had so much love to give  did she but guess it the still recesses of her heart already tremble to the footfall of one now drawing near out of the multitude of the lives around her a life is marked to mingle with her own she does not know it but as the first reflection of the dawn strikes the unconscious sky and shadows the coming of its king so the red flush that now so often springs unbidden to her brow tells of girlhoods twilight ended and proclaims the advent of womans life and love    angela called her father one day as he heard her footsteps passing his study come in here i want to speak to you  his daughter stopped and a look of blank astonishment spread itself over her face she had not been called into that study for years she entered however as bidden her father who was seated at his writingtable which was piled up with accountbooks did not greatly differ in appearance from what he was when we last saw him twenty years ago his frame had grown more massive and acquired a slight stoop but he was still a young powerfullooking man and certainly did not appear a day more than his age of fortytwo the eyes however so long as no one was looking at them had contracted a concentrated stare as though they were eternally gazing at some object in space and this appearance was rendered the more marked by an apparently permanent puckering of the skin of the forehead the moment however that they came under the fire of anybody elses optics and oddly enough more particularly those of his own daughter the stare vanished and they grew shifty and uncertain to a curious degree  philip was employed in adding up something when his daughter entered and motioned to her to sit down she did so and fixed her great grey eyes on him with some curiosity the effect was remarkable her father fidgeted made a mistake in his calculations glanced all round the room with his shifty eyes ah how changed from those bold black eyes with which maria lee fell in love fourandtwenty years ago and finally threw down his pen with an exclamation that would have shocked angela had she understood it  how often angela have i asked you not to stare me out of countenance it is a most unladylike trick of yours  she blushed painfully  i beg your pardon i forgot i will look out of the window  dont be a fool look like other people but now i want to speak to you in the first place i find that the household expenditure for the last year was three hundred and fifty pounds that is more than i can afford it must not exceed three hundred this year  i will do my best to keep the expenses down father but i can assure you that there is no money wasted now  then came a pause which after humming and hawing a little philip was the first to break  do you know that i saw your cousin george yesterday he is back at last at isleworth  yes pigott told me that he had come he has been away a long while  when did you last see him  when i was about thirteen i believe before he lost the election and went away  he has been down here several times since then i wonder that you did not see him  i always disliked him and kept out of his way  gad you cant dislike him more than i do but i keep good friends with him for all that and you must do the same now look here angela will you promise to keep a secret  yes father if you wish it  well then i appear to be a poor man dont i and remember he added hastily that with reference to household expenses i am poor but as a matter of factand here he sunk his voice and glanced suspiciously roundi am worth at this moment nearly one hundred and fifty thousand pounds in hard cash  that is six thousand pounds a year at four per cent commented angela without a moments hesitation then i really think you might put a flue into the old greenhouse and allow a shilling a week to mrs jakes mother  curse mrs jakes mother nobody but a woman would have interrupted with such nonsense listen you must have heard how i was disinherited on account of my marriage with your mother and the isleworth estates left to your cousin george and how with a refined ingenuity he was forbidden to bequeath them back to me or to my children but mark this he is not forbidden to sell them to me no doubt the old man never dreamt that i should have the money to buy them but you see i have almost enough  how did you get so much money  get it first i took the gold plate my grandfather bought and sold it i had no right to do it but i could not afford to have so much capital lying idle it fetched nearly five thousand pounds with this i speculated successfully in two years i had eighteen thousand the eighteen thousand i invested in a fourth share in a coalmine when money was scarce and coals cheap coals rose enormously just then and in five years time i sold my share to the coholders for eightytwo thousand in addition to twentyone thousand received by way of interest since then i have not speculated for fear my luck should desert me i have simply allowed the money to accumulate on mortgage and other investments and bided my time for i have sworn to have those estates back before i die it is for this cause that i have toiled and thought and screwed and been cut by the whole neighbourhood for twenty years but now i think that with your help my time is coming  with my help what is it that you wish me to do  listen answered her father nervously tapping his pencil on the accountbook before him george is not very fond of isleworthin fact he rather dislikes it but like all the caresfoots he does not care about parting with landed property and though we appear to be good friends he hates me too much ever to consent under ordinary circumstances to sell it to me it is to you i look to overcome that objection  i how  you are a woman and you ask me how you should get the blind side of a man  i do not in the least understand you  philip smiled incredulously  then i suppose i must explain if ever you take the trouble to look at yourself in the glass you will probably see that nature has been very kind to you in the matter of good looks nor are you by any means deficient in brains your cousin george is very fond of a pretty woman and to be plain what i want you to do is to make use of your advantages to get him under your thumb and persuade him into selling the property  oh father how can you ejaculated angela in an agony of shame  you idiot i wont want you to marry him i only want you to make a fool of him surely being of the sex you are you wont find that an uncongenial occupation  angelas blushes had given away to pallor now and she answered with cold contempt  i dont think you quite understand what a girl feelsat least what i feel for i know no other girls perhaps it would be useless for me to try to explain i had rather go blind than use my eyes for such a shameful purpose  angela said her father with as much temper as he ever showed now let me tell you that you are a silly fool you are more you are an encumbrance your birth he added bitterly robbed me of your mother and the fact of your being a girl deprived our branch of the family of their rights now that you have grown up you prefer to gratify your whims rather than help me to realize the object of my life by a simple course of action that could do no one any harm i never asked you to commit yourself in any way well well it is what i must expect we have not seen much of each other heretofore and perhaps the less we meet in the future the better  you have no right to talk to me so she answered with flashing eyes though i am your daughter and it is cowardly to reproach me with my birth my sex and my dependence am i responsible for any of these things but i will not burden you long and as to what you wanted me to do and think such a little of i ask you is it what my poor mother would have wished her daughter  here philip abruptly rose and left the room and the house  she is as like her mother as possible he mused as soon as he was clear of the house it might have been hilda herself only she is twice as beautiful as hilda was i shall have another bad night after this i know i shall i must get rid of that girl somehow i cannot bear her about me she is a daily reminder of things i dare not remember and whenever she stares at me with those great eyes of hers i feel as though she were looking through me i wonder if she knows the story of maria lee  and then dismissing or trying to dismiss the matter from his mind he took his way across the fields to isleworth hall a large white brick mansion in the queen anne style about two miles distant from the abbey and on arrival asked for his cousin george and was at once shown into that gentlemans presence  years had told upon george more than they had upon philip and though there were no touches of grey in the flaming red of his hair the bloodshot eyes and the puckered crowsfeet beneath them to say nothing of the slight but constant trembling of the hand all showed that he was a man well on in middlelife and who had lived every day of it time too had made the face more intensely unpleasant and vulgarlooking than ever such caresfoot characteristics as it possessed were year by year giving place in an increasingly greater degree to the kitchenmaid strain introduced by the mother in short george caresfoot did not even look a gentleman whereas philip certainly did  you dont seem very well george i am afraid that your travels have not agreed with you  my dear philip answered his cousin in a languid and affected voice if you had lived the life that i have for the last twenty years you would look a little knocked up i have had some very good times but the fact is that i have been too prodigal of my strength not thought enough about the future it is a great mistake and one of the worst results is that i am utterly blase of everything even la belle passion is played out for me i havent seen a woman i care twopence about for ten years  ah you should sell this place and take a house in town it would suit you much better  i can do that without selling the place i dont intend to sell the placein fact nothing would induce me to do so some day i may marry and want to transmit it to some future caresfoot but i confess i dont mean to do that just yet marry when you want a nurse but never before thats my maxim marriage is an excellent institution for parsons and fools the two classes that providence has created to populate the world but a wise man should as soon think of walking into a springtrap take your own case for instance my dear philip look what marriage led to  at any rate answered his cousin bitterly it led to your advantage  exactly and that is one of the reasons why i have such a respect for the institution in the abstract it has been my personal benefactor and i worship it accordinglyat a distance by the way talking of marriage reminds me of its legitimate fruits bellamy tells me that your daughter angela if i had a daughter i should call her diabola it is more appropriate for a woman has grown uncommonly handsome bring her to see me i adore beauty in all its forms especially its female form is she really so handsome  i am no judge but you will soon have an opportunity of forming an opinionthat is i hope so i propose coming with angela to make a formal call on you tomorrow  good tell my fair cousin that i shall be certain to be in and be prepared metaphorically to fall at the feet of so much loveliness by the way that reminds me you have heard of bellamys or rather mrs bellamys good fortune i suppose  no  whatnot why he is now sir john bellamy knight  indeed how is that  you remember the byeelection six months back  oh yes i was actually badgered by mrs bellamy into promising to vote much against my personal convenience  exactly well just at the time old prescott died you may remember that mr showers the member of the government was unseated on petition from some borough or other and came down here posthaste to get reelected but he had sir percy vivyan against him and as i know to my cost this benighted country is not fond of those who preach the gospel of progress bellamy who is a stout radical as you knowchiefly i fancy because there is more to be got out of that side of politicsgot the job as showers agent but three days before it became quite clear that his cause cabinet minister or not was hopeless then it was that mrsi beg her pardon ladybellamy came to the fore just as showers was thinking of withdrawing she demanded a private interview with him next day she posted off to old sir percy who is a perfect fool of the chivalrous school and was desperately fond of her and mirabile dictu that evening sir percy withdraws on the plea of illhealth or some such rubbish and showers walks over within three months mr bellamy becomes sir john bellamy nominally for his services as townclerk of roxham and i hear that old sir percy is now perfectly rampant and goes about cursing her ladyship up hill and down dale and declaring that he has been shockingly takenin how our mutual friend worked the ropes is more than i can tell you but she did work them and to some purpose  she is an uncommonly handsome woman  ah yes youre right there she is a1 but let us stroll out a little it is a fine evening for the 30th of april tomorrow will be the 1st of may so it will a day neither of us are likely to forget  philip winced at the allusion but said nothing  by the way george went on i am expecting a visitor my ward young arthur heigham who is just back from india he will be twenty five in a few days when he comes of age and is coming down to settle up the fact is that ten thousand of his money is on the jotley property and both bellamy and myself are anxious that it should stop there for the present as if the mortgage were called in it might be awkward  is he well off  comfortably about a thousand a year comes of an old family too bellamy and i knew his father captain heigham slightly when we were in business his wife by the way was a distant cousin of ours they are both dead now the captain was wiped out at inkerman and for some unknown reason left me the young gentlemans sole guardian and joint trustee with a london lawyer a certain mr borley i have never seen him yetmy ward i meanhe has always been at eton or cambridge or in india or somewhere  here philip began to manifest signs of considerable uneasiness the cause of which was sufficiently apparent for whilst they were talking a very large and savagelooking animal of the sheepdog order had emerged from the house and was following him up and down growling in a low and ominous undertone its nose being the while glued to his calves as they alternately presented themselves in his line of vision  would you mind calling off this animal george he said at length he does not look amiable  oh thats snarleyow dont mind him he never bites unless you stop philip instinctively quickened his pace isnt he a beauty hes a pure bred thibet sheepdog and i will back him to fight against any animal of his own weight he killed two dogs in one morning the other day and pulled down a beggarwoman in the evening you should have heard her holler  at that moment fortunately for philips calves which were beginning to tingle with an unwholesome excitement mr snarleyows attention was diverted by the approach of a dogcart and he left to enjoy the amusement of snapping and barking at the horse the cart pulled up at the door and out of it emerged a tall and extremely gentlemanly looking young fellow followed by a very large red bulldog  mr caresfoot i believe said the young gentleman to george taking off his hat  yes mr heigham at your service i am very glad to see you my cousin mr philip caresfoot                                chapter xviii  i must apologize for having brought aleck my dog you know with me began arthur heigham but the fact was that at the very last moment the man i was going to leave him with had to go away and i had no time to find another place before the train left i thought that if you objected to dogs he could easily be sent somewhere into the village he is very goodtempered though appearances are against him  oh he will be all right i daresay said george rather sulkily for with the exception of snarleyow in whose fiendish temper he found something refreshing and congenial he liked no dogs but you must be careful or snarleyow my dog will give him a hammering here good dog good dog and he attempted to pat aleck on the head but the animal growled savagely and avoided him  i never knew him do that before ejaculated arthur in confusion and heartily wishing aleck somewhere else i suppose he has taken a dislike to you dogs do sometimes you know  next second it struck him that this was one of those things that had better have been left unsaid and he grew more uncomfortable than ever but at this very moment the situation was rendered intensely lively by the approach of the redoubtable snarleyow himself who having snapped at the horses heels all the way to the stables had on his return to the front of the house spotted aleck from afar he was now advancing on tiptoe in full order of battle his wickedlooking teeth gleaming and his coat and tail standing out like an angry bears  arthur already sufficiently put out about the dog question thought it best to take no notice and even when he distinctly heard george quietly sah on his dog as he passed him he contented himself with giving aleck a kick by way of a warning to behave himself and entered into some desultory conversation with philip but presently a series of growls behind him announced that an encounter was imminent looking round he perceived that snarleyow was standing over the bulldog of which he was more than twice the size and holding on to the skin of his neck with his long teeth whilst george was looking on with scarcely suppressed amusement  i think mr caresfoot that you had better call your dog off said arthur goodtemperedly mine is a peaceable animal but he is an awkward customer when he does fight  oh better let them settle it they will be much better friends afterwards hold him snarleyow  thus encouraged the big dog seized the other and fairly lifted him off the ground shaking him violentlya proceeding that had the effect of thoroughly rousing alecks temper and then began a most homeric combat at first the bulldog was dreadfully mauled his antagonists size weight and length of leg and jaw to say nothing of the thick coat by which he was protected all telling against him but he took his punishment very quietly never so much as uttering a growl in strange contrast to the big dogs vociferous style of doing business and at last patience was rewarded by his enemys forepaw finding its way into alecks powerful jaw and remaining there till snarleyows attentions to the back of his neck forced him to shift his hold from that time forward the sheepdog had to fight on three legs which he found demoralizing but still he had the advantage and it was not until any other dog of alecks size would have retreated half killed that the bulldogs superior courage and stamina began to tell quite heedless of his injuries and the blood that poured into his eyes he slowly but surely drove the great sheepdog who by this time would have been glad to stop back into an angle of the wall and then suddenly pinned him by the throat down went snarleyow on the top of the bulldog and rolled right over him but when he staggered to his legs again his throat was still in its cruel grip  take your dog off shouted george seeing that affairs had taken a turn he very little expected  i fear that is impossible replied arthur politely but looking anything but polite  if you dont get it off i will shoot it  you will do nothing of the sort mr caresfoot you set the dog on and you must take the consequences ah the affair is finished  as he spoke the choking snarleyow whose black tongue was protruding from his jaws gave one last convulsive struggle and ceased to breathe satisfied with this result aleck let go and having sniffed contemptuously at his dead antagonist returned to his masters side and sitting quietly down began to lick such of his numerous wounds as he could reach  george when he realized that his favourite was dead turned upon his guest in a perfect fury his face looked like a devils but arthur acting with wonderful selfpossession for so young a man stopped him  remember mr caresfoot before you say anything that you may regret that neither i nor my dog is to blame for what has happened i am exceedingly sorry that your dog should have been killed but it is your own fault i am afraid however that after what has happened i shall be as unwelcome here as aleck so if you will kindly order the cart for me again i will move on our business can no doubt be finished off by letter  george made no reply it was evident that he could not trust himself to speak but turning sullenly on his heel walked towards the house  wait a bit mr heigham said philip who had been watching the whole scene with secret delight you are perfectly in the right i will go and try to bring my cousin to his senses i am very thankful to your dog for killing that accursed brute  he was away for about ten minutes during which arthur took aleck to a fountain there was in the centre of a grass plot in front of the house and washed his many wounds none of which however were thanks to the looseness of his hide very serious just as he had finished that operation a gardener arrived with a wheelbarrow to fetch away the deceased snarleyow  lord sir he said to arthur i am glad to have the job of tucking up this here brute he bit my missus last week and killed a whole clutch of early ducks i seed the row through the bushes that ere dog of yours sir he did fight in proper style i should like to have a dog like he  just then the rearrival of philip put a stop to the conversation drawing arthur aside he told him that george begged to apologize for what had occurred and hoped that he would not think of going away  but added philip with a little laugh i dont pretend that he has taken a fancy to you and if i were you i should cut my visit short  that is exactly my view of the case i will leave tomorrow evening  philip made no further remarks for a few moments he was evidently thinking presently he said  i see you have a fishingrod amongst your things if you find the time hang heavy on your hands tomorrow or wish to keep out of the way you had better come over to bratham lake and fish there are some very large carp and perch there and pike too for the matter of that but they are out of season  arthur thanked him and said that he should probably come and having received instructions as to the road they parted arthur to go and shut up aleck in an outhouse pointed out to him by his friend the gardener and thence to dress for a dinner that he looked forward to with dread and philip to make his way home as he passed up through the little flowergarden at the abbey house he came across his daughter picking the blight from her shooting rosetrees  angela he said i am sorry if i offended your prejudices this afternoon dont let us say anything more about it but i want you to come and pay a formal call with me at isleworth tomorrow it will only be civil that you should do so  i never paid a call in my life she answered doubtfully and i dont want to call on my cousin george  oh very well and he began to move on she stopped him  i will go if you like  at three oclock then oh by the way dont be surprised if you see a young gentleman fishing here tomorrow  angela reflected to herself that she had never yet seen a young gentleman to speak to in her life and then asked with undisguised interest who he was  well he is a sort of connection of your own through the prestons who are cousins of ours if any of them are left his mother was a preston and his name is arthur preston heigham george told me something about him just now and on thinking it over i remember the whole story he is an orphan and georges ward  what is he like asked angela ingenuously  really i dont know rather tall i thinka gentlemanly fellow it really is a relief to speak to a gentleman again there has been a nice disturbance at isleworth and then he told his daughter the history of the great dog fight  i should think mr heigham was perfectly in the right and i should like to see his dog was her comment on the occurrence    as arthur dressed himself for dinner that evening he came to the conclusion that he disliked his host more than any man he ever saw and to say the truth he descended into the diningroom with considerable misgivings just as he entered the opposite door opened and sir john bellamy was announced on seeing him george emerged from the sulky silence into which he was plunged and advanced to meet him  hullo bellamy i must congratulate you upon your accession to rank  thank you caresfoot thank you replied mr bellamy who with the exception that he had grown a size larger and boasted a bald patch on the top of his head that gave him something of a appearance of a jolly little monk looked very much the same as when we last saw him as a newly married man  a kind providence he went on rubbing his dry hands and glancing nervously under the chairs has put this honour into my hands  a providence in petticoats you mean broke in george  possibly my dear caresfoot but i do not see him is it possible that he is lurking yonder behind the sofa  who on earth do you mean  i mean that exceedingly fine dog of yours snarleyow snarleyow where are you excuse me for taking precautions but last time he put his head under my chair and bit me severely as i dare say you remember  arthur groaned at hearing the subject thus brought forward  mr heighams dog killed snarleyow this afternoon said george in a savage voice  at this intelligence sir johns face became wreathed in smiles  i am deeply delightedi mean grievedto hear it poor snarleyow he was a charming dog and to think that such a fate should have overtaken him when it was only last week that he did the same kind office for annes spaniel poor snarleyow you should really have him stuffed but my dear caresfoot you have not yet introduced me to the hero of the evening mr heigham mr heigham i am delighted to make your acquaintance and he shook hands with arthur with gentle enthusiasm as though he were the last scion of a race that he had known and loved for generations  presently dinner was announced and the three sat down at a small round table in the centre of the big diningroom on which was placed a shaded lamp it was not a cheerful dinner george having said grace relapsed into moody silence eating and drinking with gusto but in moderation and savouring every sup of wine and morsel of food as though he regretted its departure he was not free from gluttony but he was a judicious glutton for his part arthur found a certain fascination in watching his guardians red head as he bobbed up and down opposite to him and speculating on the thickness of each individual hair that contributed to give it such a spiky effect what had his mother been like he wondered that she had started him in life with such an entirely detestable countenance meanwhile he was replying in monosyllables to sir johns gentle babblings till at last even that gentlemans flow of conversation ran dry and arthur was left free to contemplate the head in solemn silence as soon as the cloth had been cleared away george suggested that they had better get to work arthur assented and sir john smiling with much sweetness remarked profoundly that business was one of the ills of life and must be attended to  at any rate it is an ill that has agreed uncommonly well with you growled george as rising from the table he went to a solid iron safe that stood in the corner of the room and unlocking it with a small key that he took from his pocket extracted a bundle of documents  that is an excellent deedbox of yours caresfoot said sir john carelessly  yes that lock would not be very easy to pick it is made on my own design  but dont you find that small parcels such as private letters are apt to get lost in it it is so big  oh no there is a separate compartment for them now mr heigham and then with the able and benign assistance of sir john he proceeded to utterly confuse and mystify arthur till stocks preferenceshares consols and mortgages were all whirling in his bewildered brain having satisfactorily reduced him to this condition he suddenly sprang upon him the proposal he had in view with reference to the jotley mortgage pointing out to him that it was an excellent investment and strongly advising him as a friend to leave the money upon the land arthur hesitated a little more from natural caution than anything he could urge to the contrary and george noticing it said  it is only right that before you come to any decision you should see the map of the estate and a copy of the deed i have both in the next room if you care to come and look at them  arthur assented and they went off together sir john whose eyes appeared to be a little heavy under the influence of the port presuming that he was not wanted but no sooner had the door closed than the worthy knight proved himself very wideawake indeed he commenced a singular course of action advancing on tiptoe to the safe in the corner of the room he closely inspected it through his eyeglass then he cautiously tried the lid of an artfully contrived subdivision  um he muttered half aloud thats where they are i wish i had ten minutes  next he returned swiftly to the table and taking a piece of the soft bread which he was eating instead of biscuit with his wine he rapidly kneaded it into dough and going to the safe divided the material into two portions one portion he carefully pressed upon the keyhole of the subdivision and then extracting the key of the safe itself took a very fair impress of its wards on the other this done he carefully put the pieces of dough in his breastpocket in such a way that they were not likely to be crushed and with a smile of satisfaction returned to his chair helped himself to a glass of port and dozed off  hullo bellamy gone to sleep wake up man we have settled this business about the mortgage will you write to mr borley and convey mr heighams decision and perhapsaddressing arthuryou will do the same on your own account  certainly i will write caresfoot and now i think that i must be off her ladyship does not like having to sit up for me  george laughed in a peculiarly insulting way  i dont think she would care much bellamy if you stayed away all night but look here tell her i want to see her tomorrow dont forget  sir john bit his knightly lip but answered smiling that he would remember and begging george not to ring as his trap was at the hall door and the servant waiting he bade an affectionate goodnight to arthur to whom he expressed a hope that they would soon meet again and let himself out of the room but as soon as the door was closed he went through another performance exceedingly inappropriate in a knight turning round his smug face red with anger he pirouetted on his toes and shook his fist violently in the direction of the door  you scoundrel he said between his teeth you have made a fool of me for twenty years and i have been obliged to grin and bear it but i will be even with you yet and her too more especially her  so soon as sir john had left arthur told his host that if the morning was fine he proposed to go and fish in bratham lake and that he also proposed to take his departure by the last train on the following evening to these propositions george offered no objection indeed they were distinctly agreeable to him as lessening the time he would be forced to spend in the society of a guest he cordially detested for such was the feeling that he had conceived towards arthur  then they parted for the night but before he left the room george went to lock up the safe that was still open in the corner struck by some thought he unlocked the separate compartment with a key that hung on his watchchain and extracted therefrom a thick and neatly folded packet of letters drawing out one or two he glanced through them and replaced them  oh lady anne lady anne he said to himself as he closed the case you are up in the world now and you aspire to rule the county society and have both the wealth and the wit to do it but you must not kick over the traces or i shall be forced to suppress you lady anne though you are the wife of a brummagem knight and i think that it is time you had a little reminder you are growing a touch too independent                                 chapter xix  arthurs sleep was oppressed that night by horrible nightmares of fighting dogs whereof the largest and most ferocious was fitted with georges red head the effect of which screwed without any eye to the fitness of things to the body of the deceased snarleyow struck him as peculiarly disagreeable he himself was armed with a gun and whilst he was still arguing with sir john bellamy the nice point whether should he execute that particular animal as he felt a carnal longing to do it would be manslaughter or dogslaughter he found himself wide awake  it was very early in the morning of the 1st of may and contrary to the usual experience of the inhabitants of these islands the sky gave promise of a particularly fine day just the day for fishing he did not feel sleepy and had he done so he had had enough of his doggy dreams so he got up dressed and taking his fishingrod let himself out of the house as he had been instructed to do on the previous evening and releasing aleck from his outhouse proceeded towards bratham lake  and about this time angela woke up too for she always rose early and ran to the window to see what sort of a day she had got for her birthday seeing it to be so fine she threw open the old lattice at which her pet raven jack was already tapping to be admitted and let the sweet air play upon her face and neck and thought what a wonderful thing it was to be twenty years old and then kneeling by the window she said her prayers after her own fashion thanking god who had spared her to see this day and praying him to show her what to do with her life and if it was his will to make it a little less lonely then she rose and dressed herself feeling that now that she had done with her teens she was in every respect a woman grown indeed quite old and in honour of the event she chose out of her scanty store of dresses all of them made by pigott and herself her very prettiest the one she had had for sunday wear last summer a tightfitting robe of white stuff with soft little frills round the neck and wrists next she put on a pair of stout boots calculated to keep out the morning dew and started off  now all this had taken a good time nearly an hour perhaps for being her birthday and there having been some mention of a young gentleman who might possibly come to fish she had plaited up her shining hair with extra care a very laborious business when your hair hangs down to your knees  meanwhile our other early riser arthur had made his way first to the foot of the lake and then along the little path that skirted its area till he came to caresfoot staff having sufficiently admired that majestic oak for he was a great lover of timber he proceeded to investigate the surrounding water with the eye of a true fisherman a few yards further up there jutted into the water that fragment of wall on which stood the post now quite rotten to which angela had bound herself on the day of the great storm at his feet too the foundations of another wall ran out for some distance into the lake being doubtless the underpinning of an ancient boathouse but this did not rise out of the water but stopped within six inches of the surface between these two walls lay a very deep pool  just the place for a heavy fish reflected arthur and even as he thought it he saw a fivepound carp rise nearly to the surface in order to clear the obstruction of the wall and sink silently into the depths  retiring carefully to one of two quaintly carven stone blocks placed at the foot of the oaktree on which doubtless many a monk had sat in meditation he set himself to get his fishinggear together presently however struck by the beauty of the spot and its quiet only broken by the songs of many nesting birds he stopped a while to look around him above his head the branches of a great oak now clothing themselves with the most vivid green formed a domelike roof beneath the shade of which grew the softest moss starred here and there with primroses and violets outside the circle of its shadow the brushwood of mingled hazel and ashstubs rose thick and high ringingin the little spot as with a wall except where its depths were pierced by the passage of a long green lane of limes that unlike the shrubberies appeared to be kept in careful order and of which the arching boughs formed a perfect leafy tunnel before him lay the lake where the long morning lights quivered and danced as its calm was now and again ruffled by a gentle breeze the whole scene had a lovely and peaceful look and gazing on it arthur fell into a reverie  sitting thus dreamily his face looked at its best its expression of gentle thoughtfulness giving it an attraction beyond what it was entitled to judged purely from a sculptors point of view it was an intellectual face a face that gave signs of great mental possibilities but for all that a little weak about the mouth the brow indicated some degree of power and the mouth and eyes no small capacities for affection and all sorts of human sympathy and kindness these last in varying lights could change as often as the english climate their groundwork however was blue and they were honest and bonny in short a man in looking at arthur heigham at the age of twentyfour would have reflected that even among english gentlemen he was remarkable for his gentlemanlike appearance and a fellow one would like to know a girl would have dubbed him nicelooking and a middleaged womanand most women do not really understand the immense difference between men until they are getting on that way would have recognized in him a young man by no means uninteresting and one who might according to the circumstances of his life develop into anything ornothing in particular  presently drawn by some unguessed attraction arthur took his eyes off an industrious waterhen who was building a nest in a hurried way as though she were not quite sure of his intentions and perceived a large raven standing on one leg on the grass about three yards from him and peering at him comically out of one eye this was odd but his glance did not stop at the raven for a yard or two beyond it he caught sight of a white skirt and his eyes travelling upwards saw first a rounded waist and then a bust and pair of shoulders such as few women can boast and at last another pair of eyes and he then and there fell utterly and irretrievably in love  good heavens he said aloudpoor fellow he did not mean to say it it was wrung from the depths of his heartgood heavens how lovely she is  let the reader imagine the dreadful confusion produced in that other pair of eyes at the open expression of such a sentiment and the vivid blush that stained the fair face in which they were set if he can but somehow they did not grow angryperhaps it was not in the nature of the most sternly repressive young lady to grow angry at a compliment which however marked was so evidently genuine and unpremeditated in another moment arthur bethought him of what he had said and it was his turn to blush he recovered himself pretty well however rising from his stone seat he took off his hat and said humbly  i beg your pardon but you startled me so and really for a moment i thought that you were the spirit of the place or he added gracefully pointing to a branch of halfopened hawthorn bloom she held in her hand the original queen of the may  angela blushed again the compliment was only implied this time she had therefore no possible pretext for getting angry  for a moment she dropped the sweet eyes that looked as though they were fresh from reading the truths of heaven before his gaze of unmistakable admiration and stood confused and as she stood it struck arthur that there was something more than mere beauty of form and feature about heran indescribable something a glory of innocence a reflection of gods own light that tinged the worship her loveliness commanded with a touch of reverential awe  the angels must look like that he thought but he had no time to think any more for next moment she had gathered up her courage in both her hands and was speaking to him in a soft voice of which the tones went ringing on through all the changes of his life  my father told me that he had asked you to come and fish but i did not expect to meet you so early ii fear that i am disturbing you and she made as though she would be going  arthur felt that this was a contingency to be prevented at all hazards  you are miss caresfoot he said hurriedly are you not  yesi am angela i need not ask your name my father told it me you are mr arthur heigham  yes and do you know that we are cousins this was a slight exaggeration but he was glad to advance any plea to her confidence that occurred to him  yes my father said something about our being related i have no relations except my cousin george and i am very glad to make the acquaintance of one and she held out her hand to him in a winning way  he took it almost reverently  you cannot he said with much sincerity be more glad than i am i too am without relations till lately i had my mother but she died last year  were you very fond of her she asked softly  he nodded in reply and feeling instinctively that she was on delicate ground angela pursued the conversation no further  meanwhile aleck had awoke from a comfortable sleep in which he was indulging on the other stone seat and coming forward sniffed at angela and wagged his tail in approvala liberty that was instantly resented by the big raven who had now been joined by another not quite so large advancing boldly it pecked him sharply on the taila proceeding that caused master aleck to jump round as quickly as his maimed condition would allow him only to receive a still harder peck from its companion bird indeed it was not until angela intervened with the bough of hawthorn that they would cease from their attack  they are such jealous creatures she explained they always follow me about and fly at every dog that comes near me poor dog that is the one i suppose who killed snarleyow my father told me all about it  yes it is easy to see that said arthur laughing and pointing to aleck who indeed was in lamentable case having one eye entirely closed a large strip of plaster on his head and all the rest of his body more or less marked with bites it is an uncommonly awkward business for me and your cousin will not forgive it in a hurry i fancy but it really was not poor alecks faulthe is gentle as a lamb if only he is let alone  he has a very honest face though his nose does look as though it were broken she said and stooping down she patted the dog  but i must be going in to breakfast she went on presently it is eight oclock the sun always strikes that bough at eight in spring and she pointed to a dead limb half hidden by the budding foliage of the oak  you must observe closely to have noticed that but i do not think that the sun is quite on it yet i do not like to lose my newfound relations in such a hurry he added with a somewhat forced smile and i am to go away from here this evening  the intelligence was evidently very little satisfactory to angela nor did she attempt to conceal her concern  i am very sorry to hear that she said i hoped you were going to stay for some time  and so i might have had it not been for that brute aleck but he has put a long sojourn with your cousin and the ghost of snarleyow out of the question so i suppose i must go by the 620 train at any rate he added more brightly as a thought struck him i must go from isleworth  she did not appear to see the drift of the last part of his remark but answered  i am going with my father to call at isleworth at three this afternoon so perhaps we shall meet again there but now before i go in i will show you a better place than this to fish a little higher up where jakes our gardener always sets his nightlines  arthur assented as he would have been glad to assent to anything likely to prolong the interview and they walked off slowly together talking as cheerfully as a sense that the conversation must soon come to an end would allow the spot was reached all too soon and angela with evident reluctance for she was not accustomed to conceal her feelings said that she must now go  why must you go so soon  well to tell you the truth today is my birthdayi am twenty todayand i know that pigott my old nurse means to give me a little present at breakfast and she will be dreadfully disappointed if i am late she has been thinking a great deal about it you see  may i wish you many very many happy returns of the day andwith a little hesitationmay i also offer you a present a very worthless one i fear  how can i stammered angela when he cut her short  dont be afraid it is nothing tangible though it is something that you may not think worth accepting  what do you mean she said bluntly for her interest was aroused  dont be angry my present is only the offer of myself as your sincere friend  she blushed vividly as she answered  you are very kind i have never had but one friendmr fraser but if you think you can like me enough it will make me very happy to be your friend too and in another second she was gone with her ravens flying after her to receive her present and a jobation from pigott for being late and to eat her breakfast with such appetite as an entirely new set of sensations can give  in the garden she met her father walking up and down before the house and informed him that she had been talking to mr heigham he looked up with a curious expression of interest  why did you not ask him in to breakfast he said  because there is nothing to eat except bread and milk  ahwell perhaps you were right i will go down and speak to him no i forgot i shall see him this afternoon  and arthur let those who disbelieve in love at first sight laugh if they will sat down to think trembling in every limb utterly shaken by the inrush of a new and strong emotion he had not come to the age of twentyfour without some experience of the other sex but never before had he known any such sensation as that which now overpowered him never before had he fully realized what solitude meant as he did now that she had left him in youth when love does come he comes as a strong man armed  and so steady and overwhelming all resistance the full tide of a pure passion poured itself into his heart there was no pretence or makebelieve about it the bold that sped from angelas grey eyes had gone straight home and would remain an everfixed mark so long as life itself should last  for only once in a lifetime does a man succumb after this fashion to many indeed no such fortunecall it good or illwill ever come since the majority of men flirt or marry indulge in platonic friendships or in a consistent course of admiration of their neighbours wives as fate or fancy leads them and wear their time away without ever having known the meaning of such love as this there is no fixed rule about it the most unlikely even the more sordid and contemptible of mankind are liable to become the subjects of an enduring passion only then it raises them for though strong affection especially if unrequited sometimes wears and enervates the mind its influence is in the main undoubtedly ennobling but though such affection is bounded by no rule it is curious to observe how generally true are the old sayings which declare that a mans thoughts return to his first real love as naturally and unconsciously as the needle that has for a while been drawn aside by some overmastering influence returns to its magnetic pole the needle has wavered but it has never shaken off its allegiance that would be against nature and is therefore impossible and so it is with the heart it is the eves that he loved as a lad which he sees through the gathering darkness of his deathbed it is a chance but that he will always adore the star which first came to share his loneliness in this shadowed world above all the shining multitudes in heaven  and though it is not every watcher who will find it early or late that star may rise for him as it did for arthur now a man may meet a face which it is quite beyond his power to forget and be touched of lips that print their kiss upon his very heart yes the star may rise to pursue its course perhaps beyond the ken of his horizon or only to set again before he has learnt to understand its beauty rarely very rarely to shed its perfect light upon him for all his time of watching the star may rise and set the sweet lips whose touch still thrills him after so many years may lie today                   beyond the graveyards barren wall   or worse still have since been sold to some richer owner but if once it has risen if once those lips have met the memory must remain the soul knows no forgetfulness and the little thread of life spun out will it not claim its own for the compact that it has sealed is holy among holy things that love which it has given is of its own nature and not of the body aloneit is inscrutable as death and everlasting as the heavens  yes the fiat has gone forth for good or for evil for comfort or for scorn for the world and for eternity he loves her henceforth that love so lightly and yet so irredeemably given will become the guiding spirit of his inner life roughhewing his destinies directing his ends and shooting its memories and hopes through the whole fabric of his being like an interwoven thread of gold he may sin against it but he can never forget it other interests and ties may overlay it but they cannot extinguish it he may drown its fragrance in voluptuous scents but when these have satiated and become hateful it will rearise pure and sweet as ever time or separation cannot destroy itfor it is immortal use cannot stale it pain can only sanctify it it will be to him as a beaconlight to the seaworn mariner that tells of home and peace upon the shore as a rainbowpromise set upon the sky it alone of all things pertaining to him will defy the attacks of the consuming years and when old and withered he lays him down to die it will at last present itself before his glazing eyes an embodied joy clad in shining robes and breathing the airs of paradise  for such is love to those to whom it has been given to see him face to face                                  chapter xx  arthur did not do much fishing that morning indeed he never so much as got his line into the waterhe simply sat there lost in dreams and hoping in a vague way that angela would come back again but she did not come back though it would be difficult to say what prevented her for had he but known it she was for the space of a full hour sitting within a hundred yards of him and occasionally peeping out to watch his mode of fishing with some curiosity it was she reflected exceedingly unlike that practised by jakes she too was wishing that he would detect her and come to talk to her but amongst other new sensations she was now the victim of a most unaccountable shyness and could not make up her mind to reveal her whereabouts  at last arthur awoke from his long reverie and remembered with a sudden pang that he had had nothing to eat since the previous evening and that he was consequently exceedingly hungry he also discovered on consulting his watch that it was twelve oclock and moreover that he was quite stiff from sitting so long in the same position so sighing to think that such a vulgar necessity as that of obtaining food should force him to depart he put up his unused fishingrod and started for isleworth where he arrived just as the bell was ringing for lunch  george received him with cold civility and asked him what sport he had to which he was forced to replynone  did you see anybody there  yes i met miss caresfoot  ah trust a girl to trail out a man what is she like i remember her a rawboned girl of fourteen with fine eyes  i think that she is the handsomest woman i ever saw arthur replied coldly  ah said george with a rude little laugh youth is always enthusiastic especially when the object is of the dairymaid cut  there was something so intensely insolent in his hosts way of talking that arthur longed to throw a dish at him but he restrained his feelings and dropped the subject  let me see you are only just home from india are you asked george presently  i got back at the beginning of last month  and what were you doing there  travelling about and shooting  did you get much sport  no i was rather unfortunate but i and another fellow killed two tigers and went after a rogue elephant but he nearly killed us i got some very good ibixshooting in cashmere however  what do you intend to do with yourself now your education has been extravagantly expensive especially the cambridge part of it are you going to turn it to any account  yes i am going to travel for another year and then read for the bar there is no particular object in being called too young and i wish to see something more of the world first  ah i see idleness called by a fine name  really i cannot agree with you said arthur who was rapidly losing his temper  of course you cant but every man has a right to choose his own road to the dogs come he added with a smile of malice as he noticed arthurs rising colour no need to get angry you see i stand in loco parentis and feel bound to express my opinion  i must congratulate you on the success with which you assume the character answered arthur now thoroughly putout but as everything i have done or mean to do is so distasteful to you i think it is a pity that you did not give me the benefit of your advice a little sooner  georges only answer was a laugh and presently the two parted detesting each other more cordially than ever  at halfpast three when george was still away for he had gone out with his bailiff immediately after lunch philip and his daughter were shown into the drawingroom where we may be sure arthur was awaiting them  mr caresfoot is not back yet said arthur but i do not suppose that he will be long  oh he will be here soon said philip because i told him we were coming to call what sort of sport did you have what none i am very sorry you must come and try againah i forgot you are going away by the way mr heigham why should you go just yet if you are fond of fishing and have nothing better to do come and put up at the abbey house for a while we are plain people but there is plenty of room and you shall have a hearty welcome would you care to come  it would have been amusing to any outsider to watch angelas face as she heard this astounding proposition for nobody had been invited inside her fathers doors within her recollection it assumed first of all a look of blank amazement which was presently changed into one of absolute horror  would he come indeed reflected arthur would he step into paradise would he accept the humble offer of free quarters in the garden of eden rapture beamed so visibly from every feature of his face that philip saw it and smiled just as he was about to accept with enthusiasm he caught sight of angelas look of distress it chilled him like the sudden shock of cold water she did not wish him to come he thought she did not care for him obliged however to give an answer he said  i shall be delighted ifand here he bowed towards hermiss caresfoot does not object  if father broke in angela with hesitation you could arrange that mr heigham came tomorrow not today it would be more convenient i must get a room ready  ah domestic details i had overlooked them i daresay you can manage thateh heigham  oh yes easily thank you  as he said the words the door was flung open and lady bellamy was announced with the energy that a footman always devotes to the enunciation of a title and next second a splendid creature magnificently dressed sailed into the room  ah how do you do mr caresfoot she said in that low rich voice that he remembered so well it is some time since we met indeed it quite brings back old times to see you when we were all young people together  at any rate lady bellamy you show no signs of age indeed if you will permit me to say so you look more beautiful than ever  ah mr caresfoot you have not forgotten how to be gallant but let me tell you that it entirely depends upon what light i am in if you saw me in the midst of one of those newfangled electric illuminations you would see that i do look old but what can one expect at forty here her glance fell upon angelas face for the first time and she absolutely started the great pupils of her eyes expanded and a dark frown spread itself for a moment over her countenance next second it was gone is it possible that that beautiful girl is your daughter but remembering her mother i need not ask look at her mr caresfoot and then look at me and say whether or not i look old and who is the young man her lover i supposeat any rate he looks like it but please introduce me  angela said philip crossing to the window where they were talking let me introduce you to lady bellamy mr heighamlady bellamy  i am delighted to make your acquaintance miss caresfoot though i think it is very generous of me to say so  angela looked puzzled  indeed she said  what do you not guess why it is generous then look at yourself in the glass and you will see i used to have some pretension to good looks but i could never have stood beside you at the best of times and now your mother even when i was at my best always killed me if i was in the same room with her and you are even handsomer than your mother  angela blushed very much at this unqualified praise and putting it and the exclamation her appearance had that morning wrung from arthur together she suddenly came to the conclusionfor odd as it may seem she had never before taken the matter into serious consideration that she must be very goodlooking a conclusion that made her feel extremely happy she could not quite tell why  it was whilst she was thus blushing and looking her happiest and loveliest that george returning from his walk chanced to look in at the window and see her and gradually drawn by the attraction of her beauty his eyes fixed themselves intently upon her and his coarse features grew instinct with a mixture of hungry wickedness and delighted astonishment it was thus that arthur and lady bellamy saw him philip who was looking at a picture in the corner of the room did not see him nor indeed did angela the look was unmistakable and once more the dark frown settled upon lady bellamys brow and the expanding pupils filled the heavylidded eyes as for arthur it made him feel sick with unreasonable alarm  next minute george entered the room with a stupid smile upon his face and looking as dazed as a bat that has suddenly been shown the sun angelas heavenlit beauty had come upon his gross mind as a revelation it fascinated him he had lost his command over himself  oh here you are at last george said lady bellamyit was always her habit to call him george we have all been like sheep without a shepherd though i saw you keeping an eye on the flock through the window  george started he did not know that he had been observed  i did not know that you were all here or i would have been back sooner he said and then began to shake hands  when he came to angela he favoured her with a tender pressure of the fingers and an elaborate and highflown speech of welcome both of which were inexpressibly disagreeable to her but here lady bellamy intervened and skilfully forced him into a conversation with her in which philip joined  what does lady bellamy remind you of angela asked arthur as soon as the hum of talk made it improbable that they would be overheard  of an egyptian sorceress i think look at the low broad forehead the curling hair the full lips and the inscrutable look of the face  to my mind she is an ideal of the spirit of power i am very much afraid of her and as for himnodding towards georgei dislike him even more than i was prepared to and she gave a little shudder by the way mr heigham you really must not be so rash as to accept my fathers invitation  if you do not wish to see me of course i will not he answered in a hurt and disappointed tone  oh it is not that indeed how could you think so when only this morning we agreed to be friends  well what is it then he asked blankly  why mr heigham the fact is that wethat is my old nurse and i for my father is irregular in his meals and always takes them by himselflive so very plainly and i am ashamed to ask you to share our mode of life for instance we have nothing but bread and milk for breakfast and the golden head sunk in some confusion before his amused gaze  oh is that all he said cheerily i am very fond of bread and milk  and then went on angela with her confession we never drink wine and i know that gentlemen do  i am a teetotaller so that does not matter  really  yesreally  but then you know my father shuts himself up all day so that you will have nobody but myself to talk to  oh never mindencouragingly i am sure that we shall get on  well if in spite of all this and a great deal moreah a very great deal that i have not time to tell youyou still care to come i will do my best to amuse you at any rate we can read together that will be something if you dont find me too stupid you must remember that i have only had a private education and have never been to college like you i shall be glad of the opportunity of rubbing up my classics a little i have been neglecting them rather lately and actually got into a mess over a passage in aristophanes that i shall ask you to clear up  this was enough for arthur whose knowledge of the classics was that of the ordinary university graduate he turned the subject with remarkable promptitude  tell me he said looking her straight in the face are you glad that i am coming  the grey eyes dropped a little before the boldness of his gaze but she answered unhesitatingly  yes for my own sake i am glad but i fear that you will find it very dull  come angela we must be off i want to be home by a quarter to six said philip just then  she rose at once and shook hands with arthur murmuring goodby till tomorrow morning and then with lady bellamy  george meanwhile with the most unwonted hospitality was pressing her father to stay to dinner and when he declined announcing his intention of coming over to see him on the morrow at last he got away but not before lady bellamy had bid him a seemingly cordial adieu  you and your charming daughter must come and see me at rewtham house when we get in what have you not heard that sir john has bought it from poor maria lees executors  philip turned pale as death and hurried from the room  it is good reflected lady bellamy as she watched the effect of her shaft to let him know that i never forget  but even when her father had gone the path was still blocked to angela  what said george who was when in an amiable mood that worst of all cads a jocose cad are you going to play truant too my pretty cousin then first you must pay the penalty not a very heavy one however and he threw his long arm round her waist and prepared to give her a cousinly embrace  at first angela not being accustomed to little jokes of the sort did not understand what his intentions were but as soon as she did being an extremely powerful young woman she soon put a stop to them shaking george away from her so sharply by a little swing of her lithe body that stumbling over a footstool in his rapid backward passage he in a trice measured his length upon the floor seeing what she had done angela turned and fled after her father  as for arthur the scene was too much for his risible nerves and he fairly roared with laughter whilst even lady bellamy went as near to it as she ever did  george rose white with wrath  mr heigham he said i see nothing to laugh at in an accident  dont you replied arthur i do it is just the most ludicrous accident that i ever saw  george turned away muttering something that it was perhaps as well his guest did not hear and at once began to attack lady bellamy  my dear george was her rejoinder let this little adventure teach you that it is not wise for middleaged men to indulge in gallantries towards young ladies and especially young ladies of thews and sinews goodnight  at the same moment the footman announced that the dogcart which arthur had ordered was waiting for him  goodby mr heigham goodby said george with angry sarcasm within twentyfour hours you have killed my favourite dog taken offence at my wellmeant advice and ridiculed my misfortune if we should ever meet again doubtless you will have further surprises in store for me and without giving arthur time to make any reply he left the room                                 chapter xxi  early on the day following arthurs departure from isleworth lady bellamy received a note from george requesting her if convenient to come and see him that morning as he had something rather important to talk to her about  john she said to her husband at breakfast do you want the brougham this morning  no why  because i am going over to isleworth  hadnt you better take the luggagecart too and your luggage in it and live there altogether it would save trouble sending backwards and forwards suggested her husband with severe sarcasm  lady bellamy cut the top off an egg with a single clean strokeall her movements were decisivebefore she answered  i thought she said that we had done with that sort of nonsense some years ago are you going to begin it again  yes lady bellamy i am i am not going to stand being bullied and jeered at by that damned scoundrel caresfoot any more i am not going to stand your eternal visits to him  you have stood them for twenty years rather late in the day to object now isnt it she remarked coolly beginning her egg  it is never too late to mend it is not too late for you to stop quietly at home and do your duty by your husband  most men would think that i had done my duty by him pretty well twenty years ago you were nobody and had comparatively speaking nothing now you have a title and between three and four thousand a year who have you to thank for that certainly not yourself  curse the title and the money i had rather be a poor devil of an attorney with a large family and five hundred a year to keep them on than live the life i do between you and that vulgar beast caresfoot its a dogs life not a mans and poor bellamy was so overcome at his real or imaginary wrongs that the tears actually rolled down his puffy little face  his wife surveyed him with some amusement  i think she said that you are a miserable creature  perhaps i am anne but i tell you what it is even a miserable creature can be driven too far it may perhaps be worth your while to be a little careful  she cast one swift look at him a look not without apprehension in it for there was a ring about his voice that she did not like but his appearance was so ludicrously wretched that it reassured her she finished her egg and then slowly driving the spoon through the shell she said  dont threaten john it is a bad habit and shows an unchristian state of mind besides it might force me to crrrush you in self defence you know and john and the eggshell having finally collapsed together lady bellamy ordered the brougham  having thus sufficiently scourged her husband she departed in due course to visit her own taskmaster little guessing what awaited her at his hands after all there is a deal of poetic justice in the world little smith fresh from his mothers apronstrings is savagely beaten by the cock of the school jones and to him jones is an allpowerful cruel devil placed above all possibility of retribution if however little smith could see the omnipotent jones being mentally ploughed and harrowed by his papa the clergyman in celebration of the double event of his having missed a scholarship and taken too much sherry it is probable that his wounded feelings would be greatly soothed nor does it stop there robinson the squire of the parish takes it out of the reverend jones and speaks ill of him to the bishop a low churchman on the matter of vestments and very shortly afterwards sir buster brown the chairman of the quarter sessions expresses his opinion pretty freely of robinson in his magisterial capacity only in his turn to receive a most unexampled wigging from her majestys judge baron muddlebone for not showing him that respect he was accustomed to receive from the high sheriff of the county and even over the august person of the judge himself there hangs the fear of the only thing that he cannot commit for contempt public opinion justice why the world is full of it only it is mostly built upon a foundation of wrong  lady bellamy found george sitting in the diningroom beside the safe that had so greatly interested her husband it was open and he was reading a selection from the bundle of letters which the reader may remember having seen in his hands before  how do anne he said without rising you look very handsome this morning i never saw a woman wear better  she vouchsafed no reply to his greeting but turned as pale as death  what she said huskily pointing with her finger to the letters in his hand what are you doing with those letters  bravo anne quite tragic what a lady macbeth you would make come quote all the perfumes of araby will not sweeten this little hand oh oh oh go on  what are you doing with those letters  have you never broken a dog by showing him the whip anne i have got something to ask of you and i wish to get you into a generous frame of mind first listen now i am going to read you a few extracts from a past that is so vividly recorded here  she sank into a chair hid her face in her hands and groaned george whose own features betrayed a certain nervousness took a yellow sheet of paper and began to read  do you know how old i am today nineteen and i have been married a year and a half ah what a happy lass i was before i married how they worshipped me in my old home queen anne they always called me well they are dead now and pray god they sleep so sound that they can neither hear nor see yes a year and a halfa year of happiness half a year of hell happiness whilst i did not know you hell since i saw your face what secret spring of wickedness did you touch in my heart i never had a thought of wrong before you came but when i first set eyes upon your face i felt some strange change come over me i recognized my evil destiny how you discovered my fascination how you led me on to evil you best know i am no coward i do not wish to excuse myself but sometimes i think that you have much to answer for george hark i hear my baby crying my beautiful boy with his fathers eyes do you know i believe that the child has grown afraid of me it beats at me with its tiny hands i think that my very dog dislikes me now they know me as i am nature tells them everybody knows me except him he will come in presently from visiting his sick and poor and kiss me and call me his sweet wife and i shall act the living lie oh god i cannot bear it much longer  there is more of the same sort remarked george coolly it affords a most interesting study of mental anatomy but i have no time to read more of it we will pass on to another  lady bellamy did not move she sat trembling a little her face buried in her hands  he took up a second letter and began to read a marked passage  the die is cast i will come i can no longer resist your influence it grows stronger every day and now it makes me a murderess for the shock will kill him and yet i am tired of the sameness and smallness of my life my mind is too big to be cramped in such narrow fetters  that extract is really very funny said george critically but dont look depressed anne i am only going to trouble you with one more dated a year or so later listen  i have several times seen the man you sent me he is a fool and contemptible in appearance and worst of all shows signs of falling in love with me but if you wish it i will go through the marriage ceremony with him poor little dupe you will not marry me yourself and i would do more than that to keep near you indeed i have no choice i must keep near you i went to the zoological gardens the other day and saw a rattlesnake fed upon a live rabbit the poor thing had ample room to run away in but could not it was fascinated and sat still and screamed at last the snake struck it and i thought that its eyes looked like yours i am as helpless as that poor animal and you are much more cruel than the snake and yet my mind is infinitely stronger than your own in every way i cannot understand it what is the source of your power over me but i am quite reckless now so what does it matter i will do anything that does not put me within reach of the law you know that my husband is dead i knew that he would die he expired with my name upon his lips the child too i hear died in a fit of croup the nurse had gone out and there was no one to look after it upon my word i may well be reckless for there is no forgiveness for such as you and i as for little b as i think i told you i will lead him on and marry him at any rate i will make his fortune for him i must devote myself to something and ambition is more absorbing than anything elseat least i shall rise to something great goodnight i dont know which aches most my head or my heart  now that extract would be interesting reading to bellamy would it not  here she suddenly sprang forward and snatched at the letter but george was too quick for her he flung it into the safe by his side and swung the heavy lid to  no no my dear anne that property is too valuable to be parted with except for a consideration  her attempt frustrated she dropped back into her chair  what are you torturing me for she asked hoarsely have you any object in dragging up the ghost of that dead past or is it merely for amusement  did i not tell you that i had a favour to ask of you and wished to get you into a proper frame of mind first  a favour you mean that you have some wickedness in hand that you are too great a coward to execute yourself out with it i know you too well to be shocked  oh very well you saw angela caresfoot philips daughter here yesterday  yes i saw her  very good i mean to marry her and you must manage it for me  lady bellamy sat quite still and made no answer  you will now continued george relieved to find that he had not provoked the outburst he had expected understand why i read you those extracts i am thoroughly determined upon marrying that girl at whatever cost and i see very clearly that i shall not be able to do so without your help with your help the matter will be easy for no obstacle except the death of the girl herself can prevail against your iron determination and unbounded fertility of resource  and if i refuse  i must have read those extracts to very little purpose for you to talk about refusing if you refuse the pangs of conscience will overcome me and i shall feel obliged to place these letters and more especially those referring to himself in the hands of your husband of course it will for my own sake be unpleasant to me to have to do so but i can easily travel for a year or two till the talk has blown over for you it will be different bellamy has no cause to love you now judge what he will feel when he knows all the truth he will scarcely keep the story to himself and even were he to do so it could easily be set about in other ways and in either case you will be a ruined woman and all that you have toiled and schemed for for twenty years will be snatched from you in an instant if on the other hand you do not refuse and i cannot believe that you will i will on my weddingday burn these uncomfortable records before your eyes or if you prefer it you shall burn them yourself  you have only seen this girl once is it possible that you are in earnest in wishing to marry her  do you think that i should go through this scene by way of a joke i never was so much in earnest in my life before i am in love with her i tell you as much in love as though i had known her for years what happened to you with reference to me has happened to me with reference to her or something very like it and marry her i must and will  lady bellamy as she heard these words rose from her chair and flung herself on the ground before him clasping his knees with her hands  oh george george she cried in a broken voice have some little pity do not force me to do this unnatural thing is your heart a stone or are you altogether a devil that by such cruel threats you can drive me into becoming the instrument of my own shame i know what i am none better but for whose sake did i become so surely george i have some claim on your compassion if i have none on your love think again george and if you will not give her up choose some other means to compass this poor girls ruin  get up anne and dont talk sentimental rubbish not but what he added with a sneer it is rather amusing to hear you pitying your successful rival  she sprang to her feet all the softness and entreaty gone from her face which was instead now spread with her darkest and most vindictive look  i pity her she said i hate her look you if i have to do this my only consolation will be in knowing that what i do will drag my successor down below my own level i suffer she shall suffer more i know you a fiend she shall find a whole hell with you she is purer and better than i have ever been soon you shall make her worse than i have dreamt of being her purity shall be dishonoured her love betrayed her life reduced to such chaos that she shall cease to believe even in her god and in return for these things i will give heryou your new plaything shall pass through my mill george caresfoot before ever she comes to yours and on her i will repay with interest all that i have suffered at your hands and exhausted with the fierceness of her own invective and the violence of conflicting passions she sank back into her chair  bravo anne quite in your old style i daresay that the young lady will require a little moulding and she could not be in better hands but mind no tricksi am not going to be cheated out of my bride  you need not fear george i shall not murder her i do not believe in violence it is the last resort of fools if i did you would not be alive now  george laughed a little uneasily  well we are good friends again so there is no need to talk of such things he said the campaign will not be by any means an easy one there are many obstacles in the way and i dont think that my intended has taken a particular fancy to me you will have to work for your letters anne but first of all take a day or two to think it over and make a plan of the campaign and now goodby i have got a bad headache and am going to lie down  she rose and went without another word but all necessity for setting about her shameful task was soon postponed by news that reached her the next morning to the effect that george caresfoot was seriously ill                                 chapter xxii  the dogcart that arthur had hired to take him away belonged to an oldfashioned inn in the parish of rewtham situated about a mile from rewtham house which had just passed into the hands of the bellamys and two from bratham abbey and thither arthur had himself driven his jehu known through all the country round as old sam was an ancient ostler who had been in the service of the rewtham kings head man and boy for over fifty years and from him arthur collected a good deal of inaccurate information about the caresfoot family including a garbled version of all the death of angelas mother and philips disinheritance  after all there are few more comfortable places than an inn not a huge london hotel where you are known as no 48 and have to lock the door of your cell when you come out of it and deliver up your key to the warder in the hall but an oldfashioned country establishment where they cook your breakfast exactly as you like it and give you sound ale and a fourposter at least so thought arthur as he sat in the private parlour smoking his pipe and reflecting on the curious vicissitudes of existence now here he was with all the hopes and interests of his life utterly changed in a single space of sixand twenty hours why sixandtwenty hours ago he had never met his respected guardian nor sir john and lady bellamy nor philip and his daughter he could hardly believe that it was only that morning that he had first seen angela it seemed weeks ago and if time could have been measured on a new principle by events and not by minutes it would have been weeks the wheel of life he thought revolves with a strange irregularity for months and years it turns slowly and steadily under the even pressure of monotonous events but on some unexpected day a tide comes rushing down the stream of being and spins it round at speed and then tears onward to the ocean called the past leaving its plaything to creak and turn to turn and creak or wrecked perhaps and useless  thinking thus arthur made his way to bed the excitement of the day had wearied him and for a while he slept soundly but as the fatigue of the body wore off the activity of his mind asserted itself and he began to dream vague happy dreams of angela that by degrees took shape and form till they stood out clear before the vision of his mind he dreamt that he and angela were journeying two such happy travellers through the green fields in summer till byandby they came to the dark entrance of a wood into which they plunged fearing nothing thicker grew the overshadowing branches and darker grew the path and now they journeyed loverwise with their arms around each other but as they passed along they came to a place where the paths forked and here he stooped to kiss her already he could feel the thrill of her embrace when she was swept from him by an unseen force and carried down the path before them leaving him rooted where he was but still he could trace her progress as she went wringing her hands in sorrow and presently he saw the form of lady bellamy robed as an egyptian sorceress and holding a letter in her hand which she offered to angela whispering in her ear she took it and then in a second the letter turned to a great snake with georges head that threw its coils around her and struck at her with its fangs next the darkness of night rushed down upon the scene and out of the darkness came wild cries and mocking laughter and the choking sounds of death and his senses left him  when sight and sense came back he dreamt that he was still walking down a wooded lane but the foliage of the overhanging trees was of a richer green the air was sweet with the scent of unknown flowers beautiful birds flitted around him and from faroff came the murmur of the sea and as he travelled brokenhearted a fair woman with a gentle voice stood by his side and kissed and comforted him till at length he grew weary of her kisses and she left him weeping and he went on his way alone seeking his lost angela and then at length the path took a sudden turn and he stood on the shore of an illimitable ocean over which brooded a strange light as where                      the quiet end of evening smiles                     miles on miles   and there with the soft light lingering on her hair and tears of gladness in her eyes stood angela more lovely than before her arms outstretched to greet him and then the night closed in and he awoke  his eyes opened upon the solemn and beautiful hour of the first quickening of the dawn and the thrill and softness that comes from contact with the things we meet in sleep was still upon him he got up and flung open his lattice window from the garden beneath rose the sweet scent of may flowers very different from that of his dream which yet lingered in his nostrils whilst from a neighbouring lilac bush streamed the rich melody of the nightingale presently it ceased before the broadening daylight but in its stead pure and clear and cold arose the notes of the mavis giving tuneful thanks and glory to its maker and as he listened a great calm stole upon his spirit and kneeling down there by the open window with the breath of spring upon his brow and the voice of the happy birds within his ears he prayed to the almighty with all his heart that it might please him in his wise mercy to verify his dream inasmuch as he would be well content to suffer if by suffering he might at last attain to such an unutterable joy and rising from his knees feeling better and stronger he knew in some dim way that that undertaking must be blest which in such a solemn hour of the heart he did not fear to pray god to guide to guard and to consummate  and on many an afterday and in many another place the book of his life would reopen at this wellconned page and he would see the dim light in the faint flushed sky and hear the song of the thrush swelling upwards strong and sweet and remember his prayer and the peace that fell upon his soul  by ten oclock that morning arthur his dog and his portmanteau had all arrived together in front of the abbey house before his feet had touched the mossgrown gravel the halldoor was flung open and angela appeared to welcome him looking as old sam the ostler forcibly put it afterwards to his helper just like a hangel with the wings off jakes too emerged from the recesses of the garden and asked angela in a tone of aggrieved sarcasm as he edged his way suspiciously past aleck why the gentleman had not brought the rampingest lion from the zoologic gardens with him at once having thus expressed his feelings on the subject of bulldogs he shouldered the portmanteau and made his way with it upstairs arthur followed him up the wide oak stairs every one of which was squared out of a single log stopping for a while on the landing where the staircase turned to gaze at the sternfaced picture that hung so that it looked through the large window facing it right across the park and over the whole stretch of the abbey lands and to wonder at the deepgraved inscription of devil caresfoot set so conspicuously beneath  his room was the largest upon the first landing and the same in which angelas mother had died it had never been used from that hour to this and indeed in a little recess or open space between a cupboard and the wall there still stood two trestles draped with rotten black cloth that had originally been brought there to rest her coffin on and which angela had overlooked in getting the room ready  this spacious but somewhat gloomy apartment was hung round with portraits of the caresfoots of past ages many of which bore a marked resemblance to philip but amongst whom he looked in vain for one in the slightest degree like angela whose handiwork he recognized in two large bowls of flowers placed upon the dark oak dressingtable  just as jakes had finished unbuckling his portmanteau a task that he had undertaken with some groaning and was departing in haste lest he should be asked to do something else arthur caught sight of the trestles  what are those he asked cheerfully  coffinstools was the abrupt reply  coffinstools ejaculated arthur feeling that it was unpleasant to have little details connected with ones latter end brought thus abruptly into notice what the deuce are they doing here  brought to put the last as slept in that ere bed on and stood ever since  dont you think insinuated arthur gently that you had better take them away  cant do so they be part of the furniture they bestand there all handy for the next one too maybe you and he vanished with a sardonic grin  jakes did not submit to the indignities of unbuckling portmanteaus and having his legs sniffed at by bulldogs for nothing not by any means pleased by suggestions so unpleasant arthur took his way downstairs determined to renew the coffinstool question with his host he found angela waiting for him in the hall and making friends with aleck  will you come in and see my father for a minute before we go out she said  arthur assented and she led the way into the study where philip always sat the same room in which his father had died he was sitting at a writingtable as usual at work on farm accounts rising he greeted arthur civilly taking however no notice of his daughter although he had not seen her since the previous day  well heigham so you have made up your mind to brave these barbarous wilds have you i am delighted to see you but i must warn you that beyond a pipe and a glass of grog in the evening i have not much time to put at your disposal we are rather a curious household i dont know whether angela has told you but for one thing we do not take our meals together so you will have to make your choice between the diningroom and the nursery for my daughter is not out of the nursery yet and he gave a little laugh on the whole perhaps you had better be relegated to the nursery it will at any rate be more amusing to you that the society of a morose old fellow like myself and besides i am very irregular in my habits angela you are staring at me again i should be so very much obliged if you would look the other way i only hope heigham that old pigott wont talk your head off she has got a dreadful tongue well dont let me keep you any longer it is a lovely day for the time of year try to amuse yourself somehow and i hope for your sake that angela will not occupy herself with you as she does with me by staring as though she wished to examine your brains and backbone goodby for the present  what does he mean asked arthur as soon as they were fairly outside the door about your staring at him  mean answered poor angela who looked as though she were going to cry i wish i could tell you all i know is that he cannot bear me to look at himhe is always complaining of it that is why we do not take our meals togetherat least i believe it is he detests my being near him i am sure i dont know why it makes me very unhappy i cannot see anything different in my eyes from anybody elses can you and she turned them swimming as they were with tears of mortification full upon arthur  he scrutinized their depths very closely so closely indeed that presently she turned them away again with a blush  well she said i am sure you have looked long enough are they different  very different replied the oracle with enthusiasm  how  well theythey are larger  is that all  and they are deeper  deeperthat is nothing i want to know if they produce any unpleasant effect upon youdifferent from other peoples eyes i mean  well if you ask me i am afraid that your eyes do produce a strange effect upon me but i cannot say that it is an unpleasant one but you did not look long enough for me to form a really sound opinion let us try again  no i will not and i do believe that you are laughing at me i think that is very unkind and she marched on in silence  dont be angry with me or i shall be miserable i really was not laughing at you only if you knew what wonderful eyes you have got you would not ask such ridiculous questions about them your father must be a strange man to get such ideas i am sure i should be delighted if you would look at me all day long but tell me something more about your father he interests me very much  angela felt the telltale blood rise to her face as he praised her eyes and bit her lips with vexation it seemed to her that she had suddenly caught an epidemic of blushing  i cannot tell you very much about my father because i do not know much his life is to a great extent a sealed book to me but they say that once he was a very different man when he was quite young i mean but all of a sudden his fathermy grandfather you knowwhose picture is on the stairs died and within a day or two my mother died too that was when i was born after that he broke down and became what he is now for twenty years he has lived as he does now poring all day over books of accounts and very rarely seeing anybody for he does all his business by letter or nearly all of it and he has no friends there was some story about his being engaged to a lady who lived at rewtham when he married my mother which i daresay you have heard but i dont know much about it but mr heighamand here she dropped her voicethere is one thing that i must warn you of my father has strange fancies at times he is dreadfully superstitious and thinks that he has communications with beings from another world i believe that it is all nonsense but i tell you so that you may not be surprised at anything he says or does he is not a happy man mr heigham  apparently not i cannot imagine any one being happy who is superstitious it is the most dreadful bondage in the world  where are your ravens today asked arthur presently  i dont know i have not seen very much of them for the last week or two they have made a nest in one of the big trees at the back of the house and i daresay that they are there or perhaps they are hunting for their foodthey always feed themselves but i will soon tell you and she whistled in a soft but penetrating note  next minute there was a swoop of wings and the largest raven after hovering over her for a minute lit upon her shoulder and rubbed his black head against her face  this is jack you see i expect that jill is busy sitting on her eggs fly away jack and look after your wife she clapped her hands and the great bird giving a reproachful croak spread his wings and was gone  you have a strange power over animals to make those birds so fond of you  do you think so it is only because i have living as i do quite alone had time to study all their ways and make friends of them do you see that thrush there i know him well i fed him during the frost last winter if you will stand back with the dog you shall see  arthur hid himself behind a thick bush and watched angela whistled again but in another note with a curious result not only the thrush in question but quite a dozen other birds of different sorts and sizes came flying round her some settling at her feet and one a little robin actually perching itself upon her hat presently she dismissed them as she had done the raven by clapping her hands and came back to arthur  in the winter time she said i could show you more curious things than that  i think that you are a witch said arthur who was astounded at the sight  she laughed as she answered  the only witchery that i use is kindness                                chapter xxiii  pigott angelas old nurse was by no means sorry to hear of arthurs visit to the abbey house though having in her youth been a servant in good houses she was distressed at the nature of his reception but putting this aside she thought it high time that her darling should see a young man or two that she might learn what the world was like pigott was no believer in female celibacy and angelas future was a frequent subject of meditation with her for she knew very well that her present mode of life was scarcely suited either to her birth her beauty or her capabilities not that she ever in her highest flights imagined angela as a great lady or one of societys shining stars she loved to picture her in some quiet happy home beloved by her husband and surrounded by children as beautiful as herself it was but a moderate ambition for one so peerlessly endowed but she would have been glad to see it fulfilled for of late years there had sprung up in nurse pigotts mind an increasing dislike of her surroundings which sometimes almost amounted to a feeling of horror philip she had always detested with his preoccupied air and uncanny ways  there must she would say be something wicked about a man as is afraid to have his own bonny daughter look him in the face to say nothing of his being that mean as to grudge her the clothes on her back and make her live worse nor a servantgirl  having therefore by a quiet peep through the curtains ascertained that he was nicelooking and about the right age pigott confessed to herself that she was heartily glad of arthurs arrival and determined that should she take to him on further acquaintance he should find a warm ally in her in any advances he might choose to make on the fortress of angelas affections  i do so hope that you dont mind dining at halfpast twelve and with my old nurse angela said as they went together up the stairs to the room they used as a diningroom  of course i donti like it really i do  angela shook her head and looking but partially convinced led the way down the passage and into the room where to her astonishment she perceived that the dinnertable was furnished with a more sumptuous meal than she had seen upon it for years the fact being that pigott had received orders from philip which she did not know of not to spare expense whilst arthur was his guest  what waste reflected angela in whom the pressure of circumstances had developed an economical turn of mind as she glanced at the unaccustomed jug of beer he said he was a teetotaller  a loud hem from pigott arresting her attention stopped all further consideration of the matter that good lady who in honour of the occasion was dressed in a black gown of a formidable character and a manyribboned cap was standing up behind her chair waiting to be introduced to the visitor angela proceeded to go through the ceremony which pigotts straightupanddown attitude rendered rather trying  nurse this is the gentleman that my father has asked to stay with us mr heigham let me introduce you to my old nurse pigott  arthur bowed politely whilst pigott made two obligatory curtsies requiring a step backwards after each as though to make room for another her speech too carefully prepared for the occasion is worthy of transcription  hem she said this sir is a pleasure as i little expected and i well knows that it is not what you or the likes is accustomed to aeating of dinners and teas with old women which i hopes sir how as you will put up with it seeing how as the habits of this house is what might without mistake be called peculiar which i says without any offence to miss angela cause though her bringingup has been what i call odd she knows it as well as i do which indeed is the only consolation i has to offer being right sure as indeed i am how as any young gentleman as ever breathed would sit in a pool of water to dine along with miss angela let alone an old nurse i aint such a fool as i may look no need for you to go ablushing of miss angela and now sir if you please we will sit down for fear lest the gravy should begin to grease and utterly exhausted by the exuberance of her own verbosity she plunged into her chairan example which arthur bowing his acknowledgements of her opening address was not slow to follow  one of his first acts was at pigotts invitation to help himself to a glass of beer of which to speak truth he drank a good deal  angela watched the proceeding with interest  what she asked presently is a teetotaller  the recollection of his statement of the previous day flashed into his mind he was however equal to the occasion  a teetotaller he replied with gravity is a person who only drinks beer and angela the apparent discrepancy explained retired satisfied  that was a very pleasant dinner what a thing it is to be young and in love how it gilds the dull gingerbread of life what new capacities of enjoyment it opens up to us and for the matter of that of pain also and oh what stupendous fools it makes of us in everybody elses eyes except our own and if we are lucky those of our adored  the afternoon and evening passed much as the morning had done angela took arthur round the place and showed him all the spots connected with her strange and lonely childhood of which she told him many a curious story in fact before the day was over he knew all the history of her innocent life and was struck with amazement at the variety and depth of her scholastic acquirements and the extraordinary power of her mind which combined with her simplicity and total ignorance of the ways of the world produced an affect as charming as it was unusual needless to say that every hour he knew her he fell more deeply in love with her  at length about eight oclock just as it was beginning to get dark she suggested that he should go and sit a while with her father  and what are you going to do asked arthur  oh i am going to read a little and then go to bed i always go to bed about nine and she held out her hand to say goodnight he took it and said  goodnight then i wish it were tomorrow  why  because then i should be saying goodmorning angela instead of goodnight angela may i call you angela we seem to know each other so well you see  yes of course she laughed back everybody i know calls me angela so why shouldnt you  and will you call me arthur everybody i know calls me arthur  angela hesitated and angela blushed though why she hesitated and why she blushed was perhaps more than she could have exactly said  yes i suppose sothat is if you like it it is a pretty name arthur goodnight arthur and she was gone  his companion gone arthur turned and entered the house the study door was open so he went straight in philip who was sitting and staring in an abstracted way at the empty fireplace with a light behind him turned quickly round as he heard the footstep  oh its you is it heigham i suppose angela has gone upstairs she goes to roost very early i hope that she has not bored you and that old pigott hasnt talked your head off i told you that we were an odd lot you know but if you find us odder than you bargained for i should advise you to clear out  thank you i have spent a very happy day  indeed i am glad to hear it you must be easily satisfied have an arcadian mind and that sort of thing take some whisky and light your pipe  arthur did so and presently philip in that tone of gentlemanly ease which above everything distinguished him from his cousin led the conversation round to his guests prospects and affairs more especially his money affairs arthur answered him frankly enough but this money talk had not the same charms for him that it had for his host indeed a marked repugnance to everything that had to do with money was one of his characteristics and wearied out at length with pecuniary details and endless researches into the mysteries of investment he took advantage of a pause to attempt to change the subject  well he said i am much obliged to you for your advice for i am very ignorant myself and hate anything to do with money i go back to first principles and believe that we should all be better without it  i always thought answered philip with a semicontemptuous smile that the desire of money or amongst savage races its equivalent shells or what not was the first principle of human nature  perhaps it isi really dont know but i heartily wish that it could be eliminated off the face of the earth  forgive me laughed philip but that is the speech of a very young man why eliminate money and you take away the principal interest of life and destroy the social fabric of the world what is power but money comfortmoney social considerationmoney ay and love and health and happiness itself money money money tell me he went on rising and addressing him with a curious earnestness what god is there more worthy of our adoration than plutus seeing that if we worship him enough he alone of the idols we set in high places will never fail us at need  it is a worship that rarely brings lasting happiness with it in our greed to collect the means of enjoyment surely we lose the power to enjoy  pshaw that is the cant of fools of those who do not know of those who cannot feel but i know and i feel and i tell you that it is not so the collection of those means is in itself a pleasure because it gives a consciousness of power dont talk to me of fate that sovereign throwing the coin on to the table is fates own seal you see me for instance apparently poor and helpless a social pariah one to be avoided and even insulted good before long these will right all that for me i shall by their help be powerful and courted yet ay believe me heigham money is a living moving force leave it still and it accumulates expend it and it gratifies every wish save it and that is best of all and you hold in your hand a lever that will lift the world i tell you that there is no height to which it cannot bring you no gulf it will not bridge you  except soliloquized arthur the cliffs of the hereafter andthe grave  his words produced a curious effect philips eloquence broke off short and for a moment a great fear crept into his eyes  silence ensued which neither of them seemed to care to break meanwhile the wind suddenly sprang up and began to moan and sigh amongst the halfclad boughs of the trees outsidemaking arthur thought to himself a very melancholy music presently philip laid his hand upon his guests arm and he felt that it shook like an aspen leaf  tell me he said in a hoarse whisper what do you see there  arthur started and followed the direction of his eyes to the bare wall opposite the window at that end of the room through which the door was made  i see he said some moving shadows  what do they resemble  i dont know nothing in particular what are they  what are they hissed philip whose face was livid with terror they are the shades of the dead sent here to torture me look she goes to meet him the old man is telling her now she will wring her hands  nonsense mr caresfoot nonsense said arthur shaking himself together i see nothing of the sort why it is only the shadows flung by the moonlight through the swinging boughs of that tree cut it down and you will have no more writing upon your wall  ah of course you are right heigham quite right ejaculated his host faintly wiping the cold sweat from his brow it is nothing but the moonlight how ridiculous of me i suppose i am a little out of sortsliver wrong give me some whisky theres a good fellow and ill drink damnation to all the shadows and the trees that throw them ha ha ha  there was something so uncanny about his hosts manner and his evident conviction of the origin of the wavering figures on the wall which had now disappeared that arthur felt had it not been for angela he would not be sorry to get clear of him and his shadows as soon as possible for superstition he knew is as contagious as smallpox when at length he reached his great bare bedchamber not by the way a comfortable sort of place to sleep in after such an experience it was only after some hours in the excited state of his imagination that tired though he was he could get the rest he needed                                 chapter xxiv  next morning when they met at their eight oclock breakfast arthur noticed that angela was distressed about something  there is bad news she said almost before he greeted her my cousin george is very ill with typhus fever  indeed remarked arthur rather coolly  well i must say it does not appear to distress you very much  no i cant say it does to be honest i detest your cousin and i dont care if he is ill or not there  as she appeared to have no reply ready the subject then dropped  after breakfast angela proposed that they should walkfor the day was again fineto the top of a hill about a mile away whence a view of the surrounding country could be obtained he consented and on the way told her of his curious experiences with her father on the previous night she listened attentively and when he had finished shook her head  there is she said something about my father that separates him from everybody else his life never comes out into the sunlight of the passing day it always gropes along in the shadow of some gloomy past what the mystery is that envelops him i neither know nor care to inquire but i am sure that there is one  how do you explain the shadows  i believe your explanation is right they are under certain conditions of light thrown by a tree that grows some distance off i have seen something that looks like figures on that wall myself in full daylight that he should interpret such a simple thing as he does shows a curious state of mind  you do not think then said arthur in order to draw her out that it is possible after all he was right and that they were something from another place the reality of his terror was almost enough to make one believe in them i can tell you  no i do not answered angela after a minutes thought i have no doubt that the veil between ourselves and the unseen world is thinner than we think i believe too that communication and even warnings sometimes under favourable conditions or when the veil is worn thin by trouble or prayer can pass from the other world to ourselves but the very fact of my fathers terror proves to me that his shadows are nothing of the sort for it is hardly possible that spirits can be permitted to come to terrify us poor mortals if they come at all it is in love and gentleness to comfort or to warn and not to work upon our superstitions  you speak as though you knew all about it you should join the new ghost society he answered irreverently sitting himself down on a fallen tree an example that she followed  i have thought about it sometimes that is all and so far as i have read i think that my belief is a common one and what the bible teaches us but if you will not think me foolish i will tell you something that confirms me in it you know that my mother died when i was born well it may seem strange to you but i am convinced that she is sometimes very near me  do you mean that you see or hear her  no i only feel her presence more rarely now i am sorry to say as i grow older  how do you mean  i can hardly explain what i mean but sometimesit may be at night or when i am sitting alone in the daytimea great calm comes upon me and i am a changed woman all my thoughts rise into a higher purer air and are as it were tinged with a reflected light everything earthly seems to pass away from me and i feel as though fetters had fallen from my soul and i know that i am near my mother then everything passes and i am left myself again  and what are the thoughts you have at these times  ah i wish i could tell you they pass away with her who brought them leaving nothing but a vague afterglow in my mind like that in the sky after the sun has set but now look at the view is it not beautiful in the sunlight all the world seems to be rejoicing  angela was right the view was charming below lay the thatched roofs of the little village of bratham and to the right the waters of the lake shone like silver in the glancing sunlight whilst the gables of the old house peeping out from amongst the budding foliage looked very picturesque the spring had cast her green garment over the land from every copse rang out the melody of birds and the gentle breeze was heavy with the scent of the unnumbered violets that starred the mossy carpet at their feet in the fields where grew the wheat and clover now springing into lusty life the busy weeders were at work and on the warm brown fallows the sower went forth to sow from the early pastures beneath where purled a little brook there came a pleasant lowing of kine wellcontented with the new grass and a cheerful bleating of lambs to whom as yet life was nothing but one long skip it was a charming scene and its influence sank deep into the gazers hearts  it is depressing to think said arthur rather sententiously but really chiefly with the object of getting at his companions views that all this cannot last but is as it were like ourselves under sentence of death                       it rose and fell and fleeted                      upon earths troubled sea                      a wave that swells to vanish                      into eternity                      oh mystery and wonder                      of wings that cannot fly                      of ears that cannot hearken                      of life that livesto die  quoth angela by way of comment  whose lines are those asked arthur i dont know them  my own she said shyly that is they are a translation of a verse of a greek ode i wrote for mr fraser i will say you the original if you like i think it better than the translation and i believe that it is fair greek  thank you thank you miss bluestocking i am quite satisfied with your english version you positively alarm me angela most people are quite content if they can put a poem written in english into greek you reverse the process and having coolly given expression to your thoughts in greek condescend to translate them into your native tongue i only wish you had been at cambridge orwhat do they call the placegirton it would have been a joke to see you come out doublefirst  ah she broke in blushing you are like mr fraser you overrate my acquirements i am sorry to say i am not the perfect scholar you think me and about most things i am shockingly ignorant i should indeed be silly if after ten years patient work under such a scholar as mr fraser i did not know some classics and mathematics why do you know for the last three years that we worked together we used as a rule to carry on our ordinary conversations during work in latin and greek month and month about sometimes with the funniest results one never knows how little one does know of a dead language till one tries to talk it just try to speak in latin for the next five minutes and you will see  thank you i am not going to expose my ignorance for your amusement angela  she laughed  no she said it is you who wish to amuse yourself at my expense by trying to make me believe that i am a great scholar but what i was going to say before you attacked me about my fancied acquirements was that in my opinion your remark about the whole world being under sentence of death was rather a morbid one  why it is obviously true  yes in a sense but to my mind this scene speaks more of resurrection than of death look at the earth pushing up her flowers and the dead trees breaking into beauty there is no sign of death there but rather of a renewed and glorified life  yes but there is still the awful fact of death to face nature herself has been temporarily dead before she blooms into beauty she dies every autumn to rise again in the same form every spring but how do we know in what form we shall emerge from the chrysalis as soon as a man begins to think at all he stands face to face with this hideous problem to the solution of which he knows himself to be drawing daily nearer his position i often think is worse than that of a criminal under sentence because the criminal is only being deprived of the employment of a term indefinite indeed but absolutely limited but man at large does not know of what he is deprived and what he must inherit in the aeons that await him it is the uncertainty of death that is its most dreadful part and with that hanging over our race the wonder to me is not only that we for the most part put the subject entirely out of mind but that we can ever think seriously of anything else  i remember answered angela once thinking very much in the same way and i went to mr fraser for advice the bible he said will satisfy your doubts and fears if only you will read it in a right spirit and indeed more or less it did i cannot of course venture to advise you but i pass his advice on it is that of a very good man  have you then no dread of death or rather of what lies beyond it  she turned her eyes upon him with something of wonder in them  and why she said should i who am immortal fear a change that i know has no power to harm me that can on the contrary only bring me nearer to the purpose of my being certainly i shrink from death itself as we all must but of the dangers beyond i have no fear pleasant as this world is at times there is something in us all that strives to rise above it and if i knew that i must die within this hour i believe that i could meet my fate without a qualm i am sure that when our trembling hands have drawn the veil from death we shall find his features passionless indeed but very beautiful  arthur looked at her with astonishment wondering what manner of woman this could be who in the first flush of youth and beauty could face the great unknown without a tremor when he spoke again it was with something of envious bitterness  ah it is very well for you whose life has been so pure and free from evil but it is different for me with all my consciousness of sins and imperfections for me and thousands like me strive as we will immortality has terrors as well as hopes it is and always will be human to fear the future for human nature never changes you know the lines in hamlet it is                  that the dread of something after death             the undiscovered country from whose bourn             no traveller returnspuzzles the will             and makes us rather bear those ills we have             than fly to others that we know not of             thus conscience does make cowards of us all  they are true and while men last they always will be true  oh arthur she answered earnestly and for the first time addressing him in conversation by his christian name how limited your trust must be in the mercy of a creator whose mercy is as wide as the ocean that you can talk like that you speak of me too as better than yourselfhow am i better i have my bad thoughts and do bad things as much as you and though they may not be the same i am sure they are quite as black as yours since everybody must be responsible according to their characters and temptations i try however to trust in god to cover my sins and believe that if i do my best he will forgive me that is all but i have no business to preach to you who are older and wiser than i am  if he broke in laying his hand involuntarily upon her own you knewalthough i have never spoken of them to any one before and could not speak of them to anybody but yourselfhow these things weigh upon my mind you would not say that but would try to teach me your faith  how can i teach you arthur when i have so much to learn myself she answered simply and from that moment though she did not know it as yet she loved him  this conversationa very curious one arthur thought to himself afterwards for two young people on a spring morninghaving come to an end nothing more was said for some while and they took their way down the hill varying the route in order to pass through the little hamlet of bratham under a chestnuttree that stood upon the village green arthur noticed not a village blacksmith but a small crowd mostly composed of children gathered round somebody on going to see who it was he discovered a batteredlooking old man with an intellectual face and the remnants of a gentlemanlike appearance playing on the violin a very few touches of his bow told arthur who knew something of music that he was in the presence of a performer of no mean merit seeing the quality of his two auditors and that they appreciated his performance the player changed his music and from a village jig passed to one of the more difficult opera airs which he executed in brilliant fashion  bravo cried arthur as the last notes thrilled and died away i see you understand how to play the fiddle  yes sir and so i should for i have played first violin at her majestys opera before now name what you like and i will play it you or if you like it better you shall hear the water running in a brook the wind passing through the trees or the waves falling on the beach only say the word  arthur thought for a moment  it is a beautiful day let us have a contrastgive us the music of a storm  the old man considered a while  i understand but you set a difficult subject even for me and taking up his bow he made several attempts at beginning i cant do it he said set something else  no no try again that or nothing  again he started and this time his genius took possession of him the notes fell very softly at first but with an ominous sound then rose and wailed like the rising of the wind next the music came in gusts the rain pattered and the thunder roared till at length the tempest seemed to spend its force and pass slowly away into the distance  there sir what do you say to thathave i fulfilled your expectations  write it down and it will be one of the finest pieces of violin music in the country  write it down the divine afflatus is not to be caged sir it comes and goes i could never write that music down  arthur felt in his pocket without answering and found five shillings  if you will accept this he said  thank you sir very much i am gladder of five shillings now than i once was of as many pounds and he rose to go  a man of your talent should not be wandering about like this  i must earn a living somehow for all talleyrands witticism to the contrary was the curious answer  have you no friends  no sir this is my only friend all the rest have deserted me and he tapped his violin and was gone  lord sir said a farmer who was standing by hes gone to get drunk he is the biggest old drunkard in the countryside and yet they do say he was gentleman once and the best fiddler in london but he cant be depended on so no one will hire him now  how sad said angela as they moved homewards  yes and what music that was i never heard any with such imagination before you have a turn that way angela you should try to put it into words it would make a poem  i complain like the old man that you set a difficult subject she said but i will try if you will promise not to laugh at the result  if you succeed on paper only half so well as he did on the violin your verses will be worth listening to and i certainly shall not laugh                                 chapter xxv  on the following day the somewhat curious religious conversation between arthur and angelaa conversation which begun on arthurs part out of curiosity had ended on both sides very much in earnest the weather broke up and the grand old english climate reasserted its treacherous supremacy from summer weather the inhabitants of the county of marlshire suddenly found themselves plunged into a spell of cold that was by contrast almost arctic storms of sleet drove against the windowpanes and there was even a very damaging nightfrost while that dreadful scourge which nobody in his senses except kingsley can ever have liked the east wind literally pervaded the whole place and went whistling through the surrounding trees and ruins in a way calculated to make even a laplander shiver  under these cheerless circumstances our pair of companionsfor as yet they were ostensibly at any rate nothing moregave up their outdoor excursions and took to rambling over the disused rooms in the old house and hunting up many a record some of them valuable and curious enough of longforgotten caresfoots and even of the old priors before them a splendidly illuminated missal being amongst the latter prizes when this amusement was exhausted they sat together over the fire in the nursery and angela translated to him from her favourite classical authors especially homer with an ease and fluency of expression that to arthur was little short of miraculous or when they got tired of that he read to her from standard writers which elaborate as her education had been in certain respects she had scarcely yet even opened notably shakespeare and milton needless to say herself imbued with a strong poetic feeling these immortal writers were a source of intense delight to her  how is it that mr fraser never gave you shakespeare to read asked arthur one day as he shut up the volume having come to the end of hamlet  he said that i should be better able to appreciate it when my mind had been prepared to do so by the help of a classical and mathematical education and that it would be a mistake to cloy my mental palate with sweets before i had learnt to appreciate their flavours  there is some sense in that remarked arthur by the way how are the verses you promised to write me getting on have you done them yet  i have done something she answered modestly but i really do not think that they are worth producing it is very tiresome of you to have remembered about them  arthur however by this time knew enough of angelas abilities to be sure that her something would be something more or less worth hearing and mildly insisted on their production and then to her confusion on her reading them aloud they ran as follows and whatever angelas opinion of them may have been the reader shall judge of them for himself                           a storm on the strings         the minstrel sat in his lonely room         its walls were bare and the twilight grey         fell and crept and gathered to gloom         it came like the ghost of the dying day         and the chords fell hushed and low                                                     pianissimo         his arm was raised and the violin         quivered and shook with the strain it bore         while the swelling forth of the sounds within         rose with a sweetness unknown before         and the chords fell soft and low                                                     piano         the first cold flap of the tempests wings         clashed with the silence before the storm         the raindrops pattered across the strings         as the gathering thunderclouds took form         drip drop high and low                                                     staccato         heavily rolling the thunder roared         sudden and jagged the lightning played         faster and faster the raindrops poured         sobbing and surging the treecrests swayed         cracking and crashing above below                                                     crescendo         the wind tore howling across the wold         and tangled his train in the groaning trees         wrapped the dense clouds in his mantle cold         then shivered and died in a wailing breeze         whistling and weeping high and low                                                     sostenuto         a pale sun broke from the driving cloud         and flashed in the raindrops serenely cool         at the touch of his finger the forest bowed         as it shimmered and glanced in the ruffled pool         while the rustling leaves soughed soft and low                                                     gracioso         it was only a dream on the throbbing strings         an echo of nature in phantasy wrought         a breath of her breath and a touch of her wings         from a kingdom outspread in the regions of thought         below rolled the sound of the citys din         and the fading day as the night drew in         showed the quaint old face and the pointed chin         and the arm that was raised oer the violin         as the old man whispered his hopes dead tale         to the friend who could comfort though others might fail         and the chords stole hushed and low                                                     pianissimo   he stopped and the sheet of paper fell from his hands  well she said with all the eagerness of a newborn writer tell me do you think them very bad  well angela you know  ah go on now i am ready to be crushed pray dont spare my feelings  i was about to say that thanks be to providence i am not a critic but i think  oh yes let me hear what you think you are speaking so slowly in order to get time to invent something extra cutting well i deserve it  dont interrupt i was going to say that i think the piece above the average of secondclass poetry and that a few of the lines touch the firstclass standard you have caught something of the divine afflatus that the drunken old fellow said he could not cage but i do not think that you will ever be popular as a writer of verses if you keep to that style i doubt if there is a magazine in the kingdom that would take those lines unless they were by a known writer they would return them marked good but too vague for the general public magazine editors dont like lines from a kingdom outspread in the regions of thought for as they say such poems are apt to excite vagueness in the brains of that dim entity the general public what they do like are commonplace ideas put in pretty language and sweetened with sentimentality or emotional religious feelings such as the thinking powers of their subscribers are competent to absorb without mental strain and without leaving their accustomed channels to be popular it is necessary to be commonplace or at the least to describe the commonplace to work in a wellworn groove and not to startlerequirements which unfortunately simple as they seem very few persons possess the art of acting up to see what happens to the unfortunate novelist for instance who dares to break the unwritten law and defraud his readers of the orthodox transformation scene of the reward of virtue and the discomfiture of vice or to make his creation finish up in a way that however well it may be suited to its tenor or illustrate its more subtle meaning is contrary to the general readers idea as to how it should endbadly as it is called he simply collapses to rise no more if he is new at the trade and if he is a known man that book wont sell  you talk quite feelingly said angela who was getting rather bored and wanted not unnaturally to hear more about her own lines  yes replied arthur grimly i do once i was fool enough to write a book but i must tell you that it is a painful subject with me it never came out nobody would have it  oh arthur i am so sorry i should like to read your book but as regards the verses i am glad that you like them and i really dont care what a hypothetical general public would say i wrote them to please you not the general public  well my dear i am sure i am much obliged to you i shall value them doubly once for the givers sake and once for their own  angela blushed but did not reprove the term of endearment which had slipped unawares from his lips poetry is a dangerous subject between two young people who at heart adore one another it is apt to excite the brain and bring about startling revelations  the day following the reading of angelas piece of poetry was rendered remarkable by two events of which the first was that the weather suddenly turned a somersault and became beautifully warm and the second that news reached the abbey house that thanks chiefly to lady bellamys devoted nursingwho fearless of infection had to the great admiration of all her neighbours volunteered her services when no nurse could be found to undertake the casegeorge was pronounced out of danger this piece of news was peculiarly grateful to philip for had his cousin died the estates must have passed away for ever under the terms of his uncles will for he knew that george had made none angela too tried like a good girl as she was to lash herself into enthusiasm about it though in her heart she went as near hating her cousin since his attempted indignity towards herself as her gentle nature would allow arthur alone was cynically indifferent he hated george without any reservation whatsoever  and after this their came for our pair of embryo lovers some ten or twelve such happy days for there was no talk of arthurs departure philip having on several occasions pointedly told him that the house was at his disposal for as long as he chose to remain in it the sky was blue in those days or only flecked with summer clouds just as arthur and angelas perfect companionship was flecked and shaded with the deeper hues of dawning passion alas the sky in this terrestrial clime is never quite blue  but as yet nothing of love had passed between them no kiss or word of endearment only when hand touched hand a strange thrill had moved them both and sent the warm blood to stain angelas clear brow like a wavering tint of sunlight thrown upon the marble features of some white venus only in each others eyes they found a holy mystery the spell was not yet fully at work but the wand of earths great enchanter had touched them and they were changed angela is hardly the same girl she was when we met her a little more than a fortnight back a nameless change has come over her face and manner the merry smile once so bright has grown softer and more sweet and the laughing light of her grey eyes has given place to a look of some such gratitude and wonder as that with which the traveller in lonely deserts gazes on the oasis of his perfect rest  many times arthur had almost blurted out the truth to the woman he passionately adored and every day so added to the suppressed fire of his love that at length he felt that he could not keep his secret to himself much longer and yet he feared to tell it better he thought to live happy if in doubt than to risk all his fortune on a single throw for before his eyes there lay the black dread of failure and then what would life be worth here with angela he lived in a garden of eden that no forebodings no anxieties no fear of that partially scotched serpent george could render wretched so long as it was gladdened by the presence of her whom he hoped to make his eve but without and around where she could not be there was nothing but clods and thistles and a black desolation that even in imagination he dared not face  and angela gazing on veiled mysteries with wondering eyes was she happy during those springtide days almost but still there was in her heart a consciousness of effort a sense of transformation and knowledge of the growth of hidden things the bud bursting into the glory of the rose must if there be feeling in a rose undergo some such effort before it can make its beauty known the butterfly but newly freed from the dull husk that hid its splendours at first must feel the imperfect wings it stretches in the sun to be irksome to its unaccustomed sense and so it was with angela she spread her half grown wings in the sun of her new existence and found them strange not knowing as yet that they were shaped to bear her to the flower crowned heights of love  hers was one of those rare natures in which the passion that we know by the generic term of love approached as near perfection as is possible in our human hearts for there are many sorts and divisions of love ranging from the affection pure steady and divine that is showered upon us from above to the degrading madness of such a one as george caresfoot it is surely one of the saddest evidences of our poor humanity that even among the purest of us there are none who can altogether rid the whiteness of the love they have to offer of its earthly stain indeed if we could so far conquer the promptings of our nature as to love with perfect purity we should become like angels but just as white flowers are sometimes to be found on the blackest peak so there do bloom in the world spirits as pure as they are rareso free from evil so closely shadowed by the almighty wing that they can almost reach to this perfection then the love they have to give is too refined too holy and strong to be understood of the mass of men often it is squandered on some unequal and unanswering nature sometimes it is wisely offered up to him from whom it came  we gaze upon an icebound river and there is nothing to tell us that beneath that white cloak its current rushes to the ocean but presently the spring comes the prisoned waters burst their fetters and we see a glad torrent sparkling in the sunlight and so it was with our heroines heart the breath of arthurs passion and the light of arthurs eyes had beat upon it and almost freed the river of its love already the listener might hear the icesheets crack and start soon they will be gone and her deep devotion will set as strong towards him as the tide of the torrent towards its receiving sea  fine writing perhaps the reader will say but surely none too fine to describe the most beautiful thing in this strange world the irrevocable gift of a good womans love  however that may be it will have served its purpose if it makes it clear that a crisis is at hand in the affairs of the heart of two of the central actors on this mimic stage                                 chapter xxvi  one saturday morning when may was threeparts gone philip announced his intention of going up to london till the monday on business he was a man who had long since become callous to appearances and though arthur fearful lest spiteful things should be said of angela almost hinted that it would look odd his host merely laughed and said that he had little doubt but that his daughter was quite able to look after herself even when such a fascinating young gentleman as himself was concerned as a matter of fact his object was to get rid of angela by marrying her to this young heigham who had so opportunely tumbled down from the skies and whom he rather liked than otherwise this being the case he rightly concluded that the more the two were left together the greater probability there was of his object being attained accordingly he left them together as much as possible  it was on the evening of this saturday that arthur gathered up his courage and asked angela to come and walk through the ruins with him angela hesitated a little the shadow of something about to happen had fallen on her mind but the extraordinary beauty of the evening to say nothing of the prospect of his company turned the scale in arthurs favour  it was one of those nights of which if we are lucky we get some five or six in the course of an english summer the moon was at her full and the twilight ended she filled the heavens with her light every twig and blade of grass showed out as clearly as in the day but looked like frosted silver the silence was intense and so still was the air that the sharp shadows of the trees were motionless upon the grass only growing with the growing hours it was one of those nights that fill us with an indescribable emotion bringing us into closer companionship with the unseen than ever does the garish busy day in such an hour we can sometimes feel or think that we can feel other presences around us and involuntarily we listen for the whisper of the wings and the halfforgotten voices of our beloved  on this particular evening some such feeling was stirring in angelas heart as with slow steps she led the way into the little village churchyard a similar spot to that which is to be found in many a country parish except that the population being very small there were but few recent graves most of the mounds had no headstones to recall the names of the neglected dead but here and there were dotted discoloured slabs some sunk a foot or two into the soil a few lying prone upon it and the remainder thrown by the gradual subsidence of their supports into every variety of angle as though they had been suddenly halted in the maddest whirl of a grotesque dance of death  picking her way through these angela stopped under an ancient yew and pointing to one of the two shadowed mounts to which the moonlight scarcely struggled said in a low voice  that is my mothers grave  it was a modest tenement enough a little heap of close green turf surrounded by a railing and planted with sweetwilliams and forget menots at its head was placed a white marble cross on which arthur could just distinguish the words hilda caresfoot and the date of death  he was about to speak but she stopped him with a gentle movement and then stepping forward to the head of the railing she buried her face in her hands and remained motionless arthur watched her with curiosity what he wondered was passing in the mind of this strange and beautiful woman who had grown up so sweet and pure amidst moral desolation like a white lily blooming alone on the black african plains in winter suddenly she raised her head and saw the inquiring look he bent upon her she came towards him and in that sweet half pleading voice which was one of her greatest charms she said  i fear you think me very foolish  why should i think you foolish  because i have come here at night to stand before a halfforgotten grave  i do not think you foolish indeed i was only wondering what was passing in your mind  angela hung her head and made no answer and the clock above them boomed out the hour raising its sullen note in insolent defiance of the silence what is it that is so solemn about the striking of the belfryclock when one stands in a churchyard at night is it that the hour softens our natures and makes them more amenable to semi superstitious influences or is it that the thousand evidences of departed mortality which surround us appealing with dumb force to natural fears throw open for a space the gates of our worldsealed imagination to tenant its vast halls with prophetic echoes of our end perhaps it is useless to inquire the result remains the same few of us can hear those tones at night without a qualm and did we put our thoughts into words they would run something thus  that sound once broke upon the living ears of those who sleep around us we hear it now in a little while hour after hour it will echo against the tombstones of our graves and new generations coming out of the silent future will stand where we stand and hearken and muse as we mused over the old problems that we have gone to solve whilst weshall we not be deaf to hear and dumb to utter  such at any rate were the unspoken thoughts that crept into the hearts of arthur and angela as the full sound from the belfry thinned itself away into silence she grew a little pale and glanced at him and he gave an involuntary shiver while even the dog aleck sniffed and whined uncomfortably  it feels cold he said shall we go  they turned and walked towards the gate and by the time they reached it all superstitious thoughts had vanishedat any rate from arthurs mind for he recollected that he had set himself a task to do and that now would be the time to do it absorbed in this reflection he forgot his politeness and passed first through the turnstile on the further side he paused and looked earnestly into his beloveds face their eyes met and there was that in his that caused her to swiftly drop her own a silence ensued as they stood by the gate he broke it  it is a lovely night let us walk through the ruins  i shall wet my feet the dew must be falling  there is no dew falling tonight wont you come  let us go tomorrow it is later than i generally go in pigott will wonder what has become of me  never mind pigott the night is too fine to waste asleep besides you know one should always look at ruins by moonlight please come  she looked at him doubtfully hesitated and came  what do you want to see she said presently with as near an approach to irritation as he had ever heard her indulge in that is the famous window that mr fraser always goes into raptures about  it is beautiful shall we sit down here and look at it  they sat down on a low mass of fallen masonry some fifteen paces from the window around them lay a delicate tracery of shadows whilst they themselves were seated in the eye of the moonlight and remained for a while as silent and as still as though they had been the shades of the painted figures that had once filled the stony frame above them  angela he said at lengthangela listen and i will tell you something my mother a woman to whom sorrow had become almost an inspiration when she was dying spoke to me something thus there is she said but one thing that i know of that has the power to make life happy as god meant it to be and as the folly and weakness of men and women render it nearly impossible for it to be and that is love love has been the consolation of my own existence in the midst of many troubles first the great devotion i bore your father and then that which i entertain for yourself without these two ties life would indeed have been a desert and yet though it is a grief to me to leave you and though i shrink from the dark passage that lies before me so far does that first great love outweigh the love i bear you that in my calmer moments i am glad to go because i know i am awaited by your father and from this i wish you to learn a lesson look for your happiness in life from the love of your life for there only will you find it do not fritter away your heart but seek out some woman some one good and pure and true and in giving her your devotion you will reap a full reward for her happiness will reflect your own and if your choice is right you will however stormy your life may be lay up for yourself as i feel that i have done an everlasting joy  she listened to him in silence  angela he went on boldly enough now that the ice was broken i have often thought about what my mother said but until now i have never quite understood her meaning i do understand it now angela do you understand me  there was no answer she sat there upon the fallen masonry gazing at the ruins round her motionless and white as a marble goddess forgotten in her desecrated fane  oh angela listen to melisten to me i have found the woman of whom my mother spoke who must be so good and pure and true you are she i love you angela i love you with my whole life and soul i love you for this world and the next oh do not reject me though i am so little worthy of you i will try to grow so dearest can you love me  still there was silence but he thought that he saw her breast heave gently then he placed his hand all trembling with the fierce emotion that throbbed along his veins upon the palm that hung listless by her side and gazed into her eyes still she neither spoke nor shrank and in the imperfect light her face looked very pale while her lovely eyes were dark and meaningless as those of one entranced  then slowly he gathered up his courage for an effort and raising his face to the level of her own he kissed her full upon her lips she stirred she sighed he had broken the spell the sweet face that had withdrawn itself drew nearer to him for a second the awakened eyes looked into his own and filled them with reflected splendour and then he became aware of a warm arm thrown about his neck and next the stars grew dim and sense and life itself seemed to shake upon their thrones for a joy almost too great for mortal man to bear took possession of his heart as she laid her willing lips upon his own and then before he knew her purpose she slid down upon her knees beside him and placed her head upon her breast  dearest he said dont kneel so look at me  slowly she raised her face wreathed and lovely with many blushes and looked upon him with tearful eyes he tried to raise her  let me be she said speaking very low i am best so it is the attitude of adoration and i have foundmy divinity  but i cannot bear to see you kneel to me  oh arthur you do not understand a minute since i did not understand that a woman is very humble when she really loves  do youreally love me angela  i do  have you known that long  i only knew it whenwhen you kissed me before then there was something in my heart but i did not know what it was listen dear she went on for one minute to me first and i will get up for he was again attempting to raise her what i have to say is best said upon my knees for i want to thank god who sent you to me and to thank you too for your goodness it is so wonderful that you should love a simple girl like me and i am so thankful to you oh i have never lived till now and rising to her full stature i feel as though i had been crowned a queen of happy things dethrone me desert me and i will still be grateful to you for this hour of imperial happiness but if you after a while when you know all my faults and imperfections better can still care for me i know that there is something in me that will enable me to repay you for what you have given me by making your whole life happy dear i do not know if i speak as other women do but believe me it is out of the fulness of my heart take care arthur oh take care lest your fate should be that of the magician you spoke of the other day who evoked the spirit and then fell down before it in terror you have also called up a spirit and i pray that it was not done in sport lest it should trouble you hereafter  angela do not speak so to me it is i who should have knelt to you yes you were right when you called yourself a queen of happy things you are a queen  hush dont overrate me your disillusion will be the more painful come arthur let us go home  he rose and went with her in a dream of joy that for a moment precluded speech at the door she bade him goodnight and oh happiness gave him her lips to kiss then they parted their hearts too full for words one thing he asked her however  what was it that took you to your mothers grave tonight  she looked at him with a curiously mixed expression of shy love and conviction on her face and answered  her spirit who led me to your heart                                chapter xxvii  georges recovery when the doctors had given up all hope was sufficiently marvellous to suggest the idea that a certain power had determinedon the hangmans principle perhapsto give him the longest of ropes but it could in reality be traced to a more terrestrial influencenamely lady bellamys nursing had it not been for this nursing it is very certain that her patient would have joined his forefathers in the bratham churchyard for whole days and nights she watched and tended him scarcely closing her own eyes and quite heedless of the danger of infection till in the end she conquered the fever and snatched him from the jaws of the grave how often has not a womans devotion been successful in such a struggle  on the monday following the events narrated in the last chapter george now in an advanced stage of convalescence though forbidden to go abroad for another fortnight was sitting downstairs enjoying the warm sunshine and the sensation of returning life and vigour that was creeping into his veins when lady bellamy came into the room bringing with her some medicine  here is your tonic george it is the last dose that i can give you as i am going back to my disconsolate husband at luncheontime  i cant have you go away yet i am not well enough  i must go george people will begin to talk if i stop here any longer  well if you must i suppose you must he answered sulkily but i must say i think that you show a great want of consideration for my comfort who is to look after me i should like to know i am far from well yetfar from well  believe me she said softly i am very sorry to leave you and am glad to have been of help to you though you have never thought much about it  oh i am sure i am much obliged but it is not likely that you would leave me to rot of fever without coming to look after me  she sighed as she answered  you would not do as much for me  oh bother anne dont get sentimental before you go i must speak to you about that girl angela have you taken any steps  lady bellamy started  what are you still bent upon that project  of course i am it seemed to me that all my illness was one long dream of her i am more bent upon it than ever  and do you still insist upon my playing the part you had marked out for me do you know george that there were times in your illness when if i had relaxed my care for a single five minutes it would have turned the scale against you and that once i did not close my eyes for five nights look at me how thin and worn i am it is from nursing you i have saved your life surely you will not now force me to do this unnatural thing  if my dear anne you had saved my life fifty times i would still force you to do it ah it is no use your looking at that safe i have no doubt that you got my keys and searched it whilst i was ill but i was too sharp for you i had the letters moved when i heard that you were coming to nurse me they are back there now though how disappointed you must have been and he chuckled  i should have done better to let you die monster of wickedness and ingratitude that you are she said stamping her foot upon the floor and the tears of vexation standing in her eyes  the letters my dear anne remember that you have got to earn your letters i am very much obliged to you for your nursing but business is business  she was silent for a moment and then spoke in her ordinary tone  by the way talking of letters there was one came for you this morning in your cousin philips handwriting and with a london postmark will you read it  read ityes anything from the father of my inamorata will be welcome  she fetched the letter and gave it him he read it aloud after a page of congratulations on his convalescence it ended  and now i want to make a proposal to youviz to buy back the isleworth lands from you i know that the place is distasteful to you and will probably be doubly so after your severe illness but if you care to keep the house and grounds i am not particularly anxious to acquire them i am prepared to offer a good price c c  ill see him hanged first was georges comment how did he get the money  saved it and made it i suppose  well at any rate he shall not buy me out with it no no master philip i am not fond enough of you to do you that turn  it does not strike you she said coldly that you hold in your hands a lever that may roll all your difficulties about this girl out of the way  by jove you are right anne trust a womans brain but i dont want to sell the estates unless i am forced to  would you rather part with the land or give up your project of marrying angela caresfoot  why do you ask  because you will have to choose between the two  then i had rather sell  you had better give it up george i am not superstitious but i have knowledge in things that you do not understand and i foresee nothing but disaster in this plan  once and for all anne i will not give it up whilst i have any breath left in my body and i take my oath that unless you help me and help me honestly i will expose you  oh i am your very humble servant you may count on me the galley slave pulls well when the lash hangs over his shoulders and she laughed coldly  just then a servant announced that mr caresfoot was at the door and anxious to speak to his cousin he was ordered to show him into the drawingroom as soon as he had gone on his errand george said  i will not see him say i am too unwell but do you go and see that you make the most of your chance  lady bellamy nodded and left the room she found philip in the drawingroom  ah how do you do mr caresfoot i come from your cousin to say that he cannot see you today he has scarcely recovered sufficiently from the illness through which i have been nursing him but of course you know all about that  oh yes lady bellamy i have heard all about it including your own brave behaviour to which the doctor tells me george owes his life i am sorry that he cannot see me though i have just come down from town and called in on my way from roxham i had some rather important business that i wanted to speak about  about your offer to repurchase the isleworth lands she asked  ah you know of the affair yes that was it  then i am commissioned to give you a reply  philip listened anxiously  your cousin absolutely refuses to sell any part of the lands  will nothing chance his determination i am ready to give a good price and pay a separate valuation for the timber  nothing he does not intend to sell  a deep depression spread itself over her hearers face  then there go the hopes of twenty years he said for twenty long years ever since my misfortune i have toiled and schemed to get these lands back and now it is all for nothing well there is nothing more to be said and he turned to go  stop a minute mr caresfoot do you know you interest me very much  i am proud to interest so charming a lady he answered a touch of depressed gallantry  that is as it should be but you interest me because you are an instance of the truth of the saying that every man has some ruling passion if only one could discover it why do you want these particular lands your money will buy others just as good  why does a swiss get homesick why does a man defrauded of his own wish to recover it  lady bellamy mused a little  what would you say if i showed you an easy way to get them  philip turned sharply round with a new look of hope upon his face  you would earn my eternal gratitudea gratitude that i should be glad to put into a practical shape  she laughed  oh you must speak to sir john about that now listen i am going to surprise you your cousin wants to get married  get married george wants to get married  exactly so and now i have a further surprise in store for youhe wants to marry your daughter angela  this time philip said nothing but he started in evident and uncomfortable astonishment if lady bellamy wished to surprise him she had certainly succeeded  surely you are joking he said  i never was further from joking in my life he is desperately in love with her and wild to marry her  well  well dont you now see a way to force your cousin to sell the lands  at the price of angelas hand  precisely  philip walked up and down the room in thought though as the reader may remember he had himself but a month before been base enough to suggest that his daughter should use her eyes to forward his projects he had never in justice to him be it said dreamt of forcing her into a marriage in every way little less than unnatural his idea of responsibility towards his daughter was as regards sins of omission extremely lax but there were some of commission that he did not care to face certain fears and memories oppressed him too much to allow of it  lady bellamy he said presently you have known my cousin george intimately for many years and are probably sufficiently acquainted with his habits of life to know that such a marriage would be an infamy  many a man who has been wild in his youth makes a good husband she answered quietly  the more i think of it went on philip excitedly after the fashion of one who would lash himself into a passion the more i see the utter impossibility of any such thing and i must say that i wonder at your having undertaken such an errand on the one hand there is a young girl who though i do not from force of circumstances see much of myself is i believe as good as she is handsome  and on the other broke in lady bellamy ironically are the isleworth estates  and on the other went on philip without paying heed to her remark i am going to speak plainly lady bellamyis a man utterly devoid of the foundations of moral character whose appearance is certainly against him who i have got reason to know is not to be trusted and who is old enough to be her father and her cousin to bootand you ask me to forward such a marriage as this i will have nothing to do with it my responsibilities as a father forbid it it would be the wickedest thing i have ever done to put the girl into the power of such a man  lady bellamy burst into a low peal of laughter she never laughed aloud she thought that it was now time to throw him a little off his balance  forgive me she said with her sweetest smile but you must admit that there is something rather ludicrous in hearing the hero of the great maria lee scandal talking about moral character and the father who detests his daughter so much that he fears to look her in the face and whose sole object is to rid himself of an encumbrance prating of his paternal responsibilities  philip started visibly at her words  ah mr caresfoot she went on i surprise you by my knowledge but we women are sad spies and it is my little amusement to find out other peoples secrets a very useful little amusement i could tell you many things  i was about to say broke in philip who had naturally no desire to see more of the secrets of his life unveiled by lady bellamy that even if i did wish to get rid of angela i should have little difficulty in doing so as young heigham who has been stopping at the abbey house for a fortnight or so is head over ears in love with her indeed i should think it highly probable that they are at this moment engaged  it was lady bellamys turn to start now  ah she said i did not know that that complicates matters and then with a sudden change of tonemr caresfoot as a friend let me beg of you not to throw away such a chance in a hurry for the sake of a few nonsensical ideas abut a girl what is she after all that she should stand in the way of such grave interests as you have in hand i tell you that he is perfectly mad about her you can make your own terms and fix your own price  price ay that is what it would bea price for her body and soul  well and what of it the thing is done every day only one does not talk of it in that way  who taught you who were once a young girl yourself to plead such a cause as this  nonsense it is a very good causea cause that will benefit everybody especially your daughter george will get what he wants you with the recovery of the estates will also recover your lost position and reputation both to a great extent an affair of landed property mr heigham will gain a little experience whilst she will bloom into a great lady and like any other girl in the same circumstances learn to adore her husband in a few months  and what will you get lady bellamy  i she replied with a gay laugh oh you know virtue is its own reward i shall be quite satisfied in seeing everybody else made happy come i do not want to press you about the matter at present think it over at your leisure i only beg you not to give a decided answer to young heigham should he ask you for angela till i have seen you againsay in a weeks time then if you dont like it you can leave it alone and nobody will be a penny the worse  as you like but i tell you that i can never consent and philip took his leave  your cousin entirely refuses his consent and angela is by this time probably engaged to your exward arthur heigham was lady bellamys not very promising report to the interesting invalid in the dining room  after relieving his feelings at this intelligence in language more forcible than polite george remarked that under these circumstances matters looked very bad  not at all they look very well i shall see your cousin again in a weeks time when i shall have a different tale to tell  why wait a week with that young blackguard making the running on the spot  because i have put poison into philips mind and the surest poison always works slow besides the mischief has been done goodby i will come and see you in a day or two when i have made my plans you see i mean to earn my letters                                chapter xxviii  with what degree of soundness our pair of lovers slumbered on that memorable saturday night let those who have been so fortunate or unfortunate as to have been placed in analogous circumstances form their own opinion  it is however certain that arthur gazed upon the moon and sundry of the larger planets for some hours until they unkindly set and left him for his candle had burnt out to find his way to bed in the dark with his reflections we will not trouble ourselves or rather we will not intrude upon their privacy but there was another person in the house who sat at an open window and looked upon the heavens angela to wit let us avail ourselves of our rightful privilege and look into her thoughts  arthurs love had come upon her as a surprise but it had found a perfect home all the days and hours that she had spent in his company had unknown to herself been mysteriously employed in preparing a habitation to receive it we all know the beautiful bible story of the creation how first there was an empty void and the spirit brooding on the waters then light and then life and last man coming to turn all things to his uses surely that story which is the type and symbol of many things is of none more so than of the growth and birth of a perfected love in the human heart  the soil is made ready in the dead winter and receives the seed into its bosom then comes the spring and it is clothed with verdure space is void till the sun shoots its sudden rays athwart it and makes it splendid the heart is cold and unwitting of its ends till the spirit broods upon it as upon the waters and it grows quick with the purposes of life and then what a change is there what has the flower in common with the seed from whence it sprang or the noonday sky with the darkness before the dawn  thinking in her chamber with the night air playing on her hot brow and her hand pressed upon her heart as though to still the tumult of its joy angela grew vaguely conscious of these things  was she the same in heart and mind that she had been a month ago no a thousand times no then what was this mysterious change that seemed to shake her inmost life to its foundations what angel had troubled the waters into which she had so newly plunged and whence came the healing virtue that she found in them bringing rest after the vague trouble of the last two weeks with sight to see the only goodher love with speed to follow and strength to hold oh happy happy world oh merciful creator who gave her to drink of such a living spring oh arthur beloved arthur  on sunday mornings it was pigotts habit to relax the draconian severity of her laws in the matter of breakfast which generally speaking was not till about halfpast eight oclock at that hour precisely on the sabbath in question she appeared as usualno not as usual for it being sunday she had on her stiff black gownand with all due solemnity made the tea  a few minutes elapsed and angela entered dressed in white and very lovely in her simple tightfitting robe but a trifle pale and with a shy look upon her face  she greeted her nurse with a kiss  why what is the matter with you dearie ejaculated pigott whose watchful eye detected a change she could not define you look different somehow  hush i will tell you byandby  at that moment arthurs quick step was heard advancing down the passage together with a pattering noise that announced the presence of aleck and as they came angela poor angela grew red and redder and yet more painfully red till pigott watching her face was enabled to form a shrewd guess as to what was the cause of her unaccustomed looks  on came the steps and open flew the door more and more ready to sink into the earth looked angela and so interested grew nurse pigott that she actually poured some hot tea on to her dress a thing she could never remember having done before  the first to enter was aleck who following his custom sprang upon angela and licked her hand and behind aleck looking somewhat confused but handsome and happyfor his was one of those faces that become handsome when their owners are happycame alecks master and then there ensued an infinitesimal but most awkward pause  on such occasions as the present namely the first meeting after an engagement there is alwaysespecially when it occurs in the presence of a third persona very considerable difficulty in the minds of the parties to know what demeanour they are to adopt towards one another are they to treat the little affair of the previous evening as a kind of confidential communication not to be alluded to except in private conversation and to drop into the mr and miss of yesterday that would certainly be the easiest but then it would also be a decided act of mutual retreat or are they to rush into each others arms as becomes betrothed lovers this process is so new that they feel that it still requires private rehearsal and meanwhile time presses and everybody is beginning to stare and something must be done  these were very much the feelings of arthur and angela he hesitated before her confused and she kept her head down over the dog but presently aleck getting bored moved on and as it would have been inane to continue to stare at the floor she had to raise herself as slowly as she might soon their eyes arrived in the same plane and whether a mutual glance of intelligence was exchanged or whether their power of attraction overcame his power of resistance it is not easy to determine but certain it is that following a primary natural law arthur gravitated towards her and kissed her on the face  my exclaimed pigott and the milkjug rolled unheeded on the floor  hum i suppose i had better explain began he  i think you have spilt the milk added she  that we have become engaged and are  all to pieces i declare broke in angela with her head somewhere near the carpet  and then they both laughed  well i never no not in all my born days sir and miss angela all i have got to say about this extraordinary proceedingthey glanced at each other in alarmis that i am very glad to hear on it and i hope and pray how as you may be happy and if you treat my angela right youll be just the happiest and luckiest man in the three kingdoms including ireland the royal family and if you treat her wrong worse will come to you and her poor mothers last words as i heard with my own ears will come true to you and serve you right and theres all the milk upon the floor and god bless you both my dears is the prayer of an old woman  and here the worthy soul broke down and began to cry nor were angelas eyes free from tears  after this little episode breakfast proceeded in something like the usual way church was at 1030 and a while before the hour arthur and angela strolled down to the spot that had already become as holy ground to them and looked into each others eyes and said again the same sweet words then they went on and mingling with the little congregationthat did not number more than thirty soulsthey passed into the cool quiet of the church  lawks said a woman as they went by aint she just a beauty what a pretty wedding theyd make  arthur overheard it and noted the woman and afterwards found a pretext to give her five shillings because he said it was a lucky omen  on the communiontable of the pretty little church there was spread the fair white cloth of the rubric it was the day for the monthly celebration of the sacrament that met the religious requirements of the village  will you stay to the sacrament with me whispered angela to her lover in the interval between their seating themselves and the entry of the clergyman mr frasers locum tenens  arthur nodded assent  and so when the time came those two went up together to the altar rails and kneeling side by side ate of the bread and drank of the cup and rising departed thence with a new link between them for be sure part of the prayers which they offered up at that high moment were in humble petition to the almighty to set his solemn seal and blessing on their love indeed so far as angela was concerned there were few acts of her simple life that she did not consecrate by prayer how much more then was she bent on bringing this the greatest of all her acts before her makers throne  strange indeed and full of a holy promise is the yearning with which we turn to heaven to seek sanctification of our deeds feeling our weakness and craving strength from the source of strength a yearning of which the church with that subtle knowledge of human nature which is one of the mainsprings of its power has not been slow to avail itself and this need is more especially felt in matters connected with the noblest of all passions perhaps because all true love and all true religion come from a common home  thus pledged to one another with a new and awful pledge and knit together in the bonds of an universal love embracing their poor affection as the wide skies embrace the earth they rose and went their ways purer to worship and stronger to endure  that afternoon arthur had a conversation with his betrothed that partaking of a business nature in the beginning ended rather oddly  i must speak to your father when he comes back tomorrow dear he began  my father oh yes i had forgotten about that and she looked a little anxious  fortunately i am fairly well off so i see no cause why he should object  well i think that he will be rather glad to get rid of pigott and myself you know that he is not very fond of me  that is strange want of taste on his part  oh i dont know everybody does not see me with your eyes arthur  because they have not the chance all the world would love you if it knew you but seriously i think that he can hardly object or he would not have allowed us to be thrown so much together for in nine cases out of ten that sort of thing has only one result  what do you mean  i mean that to import a young fellow into the house and throw him solely into a daughters company is very apt to bring aboutwell what has been brought about  then you mean that you think that i should have fallen in love with any gentleman who had come here  arthur not seeing the slight flash of indignation in her eyes replied  well you know there is always a risk but i should imagine that it would very much depend upon the gentleman  arthurwith a little stampi am ashamed of you how can you think such things of me you must have a very poor opinion of me  my dear why should i suppose myself superior to anybody else that you should only fall in love with me you set too high a value on me  and you set too low a value on me you do not understand me you are my fate my other self how would it have been possible for me to love any one but you i feel as though i had been travelling to meet you since the beginning of the world to stand by your side till it crumbles away yes for eternity itself oh arthur do not laugh at what i say i am indeed only a simple girl but as i told you last night there is something stirring in me now my real life my eternal part something that you have awakened and with which you have to deal something apart from the me you see before you as i speak i feel and know that when we are dead and gone i shall love you still when more ages have passed than there are leaves upon that tree i shall love you still arthur i am yours for ever for the time that is and is to be  she spoke with the grand freedom of one inspired nay he felt that she was inspired and the same feeling of awe that had come upon him when he first saw her face again took possession of him taking her hand he kissed it  dearest he said dearest angela who am i that you should love me so what have i done that such a treasure should be given to me i hope that it may be as you say  it will be as i say she answered as she bent to kiss him and they went on in silence                                 chapter xxix  philip arrived home about one oclock on the monday and after their nursery dinner arthur made his way to the study and soon found himself in the dread presencefor what presence is more dread most people would rather face a chiefjustice with the goutof the man whose daughter he was about to ask in marriage  philip whom he found seated by a tray the contents of which he seemed in no humour to touch received him with his customary politeness saying with a smile that he hoped he had not come to tell him that he was sick of the place and its inhabitants and was going away  far from it mr caresfoot i come to speak to you on a very different subject  philip glanced up with a quick look of expectant curiosity but said nothing  in short said arthur desperately i come to ask you to sanction my engagement to angela  a pausea very awkward pauseensued  you are then engaged to my daughter  subject to your consent i am  then came another pause  you will understand me heigham when i say that you take me rather by surprise in this business your acquaintance with her has been short  that is true but i have seen a great deal of her  perhaps but she knows absolutely nothing of the world and her preference for youfor as you say you are engaged to her i presume she has shown a preferencemay be a mistake merely a young girls romantic idea  arthur thought of his conversation of the previous day with angela and could not help smiling as he answered  i think if you ask her that she will tell you that is not the case  heigham i will be frank with you i like you and you have i believe sufficient means of course you know that my daughter will have nothingat any rate till i am dead he added quickly  i never thought about the matter but i shall be only too glad to marry her with nothing but herself  very good i was going to say that notwithstanding this marriage is an important matter and i must have time to think over it before i give you a decided answer say a week i shall not however expect you to leave here unless you wish to do so nor shall i seek to place any restrictions on your intercourse with angela since it would appear that the mischief is already done i am flattered by your proposal but i must have time and you must understand that in this instance hesitation does not necessarily mean consent  in affairs of this nature a man is satisfied with small mercies and willing to put up with inconveniences that appear trifling in comparison with the disasters that might have overtaken him arthur was no exception to the general rule indeed he was profuse in his thanks and buoyed up with all the confidence of youth felt sure in his heart that he would soon find a way to extinguish any objections that might still linger in philips mind  his wouldbe fatherinlaw contented himself with acknowledging his remarks with courtesy and the interview came to an end  arthur gone however his host lost all his calmness of demeanour and rising from his untasted meal paced up and down the room in thought everything had he reflected fallen out as he wished young heigham wished to marry his daughter and he could not wish for a better husband save for the fatality which had sent that woman to him on her fiends errand he would have given his consent at once and been glad to give it not that he meant to refuse ithe had no such idea and then he began to think what supposing that lady bellamys embassy had been of a nature that he could entertain which it was not it would mean to him it would mean the realization of the work and aspirations of twenty years it would mean his reentry into the property and position from which he had according to his own view been unjustly ousted it would mean last but not least triumph over george and now chance mighty chance as fools call providence had at last thrown into his hands a lever with which it would be easy to topple over every stumblingblock that lay in his path to triumph more he might even be able to spoil that egyptian george giving him less than his due  oh how he hungered for the broad acres of his birthright longing for them as a lover longs for his lost bride the opportunity would never come again why should he throw it away to do so would be to turn his cousin into an open and implacable foe why should he allow this girl whose birth had bereft him of the only creature he had ever loved whose sex had alienated the family estates and for whose company he cared nothing to come as a destruction on his plans she would be welloff the man loved her as for her being engaged to this young heigham women soon got over those things after all now that he came to think of the matter calmly what valid cause was there why the thing should not be  and as he paced to and fro and thought thus an answer came into his mind for there rose up before him a vision of his dying wife and there sounded in his ears the murmur of her halfforgotten voice that for all its broken softness had with its last accents called down gods winged vengeance and his everlasting doom on him who would harm her unprotected child and feeling that if he did this thing on him would be the vengeance and the doom he thought of the shadows of the night and grew afraid  when arthur and his host met according to their custom that evening no allusion was made on either side to their conversation of the afternoon nor did her father even speak a word to angela on the subject life to all appearance went on in the old house precisely as though nothing had happened philip did not attempt to put the smallest restraint on arthur and his daughter and studiously shut his eyes to the pretty obvious signs of their mutual affection for them the long june days were golden but all too short every morning found their mutual love more perfect but when the flakes of crimson light faded from the skies and night dropped her veil over the tall trees and peaceful lake by some miracle it had grown deeper and more perfect still day by day arthur discovered new charms in angela here some hidden knowledge there an unsuspected grace and everywhere an allembracing charity and love day by day he gazed deeper into the depths of her mind and still there were more to plumb for it was a storehouse of noble thoughts and high ambitionsambitions many of which could only find fulfilment in another world than this and the more he saw of her the prouder he was to think that such a perfect creature should so dearly love himself and with the greater joy did he look forward to that supreme and happy hour when he should call her his and so day added itself to day and found them happy  indeed the aspect of their fortunes seemed as smooth and smiling as the summer surface of the lake about philips final consent to their engagement they did not trouble themselves judging not unnaturally that his conduct was in itself a guarantee of approval if he meant to raise any serious objections he would surely have done so before arthur would urge and angela would quite agree with him and wonder what parent could find it in his heart to object to her bonnieeyed lover  what a merciful provision of providence it is that throws a veil over the future only to be pierced by the keenesteyed of scotchmen where should we find a flavour in those unfrequent cups that the shyest of the gods joy holds to our yearning lips could we know of the bitter that lurks in the tinselled bowl surely we have much to be thankful for but for nothing should we be so grateful as for this blessed impotence of foresight  but as it is often on the bluest days that the mercury begins to sink beneath the breath of faroff hurricane so there is a warning spirit implanted in sensitive minds that makes them mistrustful of too great happiness we feel that for most of us the wheel of our fortunes revolves too quickly to allow of a long continuance of unbroken joy  arthur said angela one morning when eight days had passed since her fathers return from town we are too happy we should throw something into the lake  i have not got a ring except the one you gave me he answered for his signet was on his finger so unless we sacrifice aleck or the ravens i dont know what it is to be  dont joke arthur i tell you we are too happy  could arthur have seen through an acre or so of undergrowth as angela uttered these words he would have perceived a very smart pageboy with the bellamy crest on his buttons delivering a letter to philip it is true that there was nothing particularly alarming about that but its contents might have given a point to angelas forebodings it ran thus                                            rewtham house monday   my dear mr caresfoot   with reference to our conversation last week about your daughter   and g can you come over and have a quiet chat with me this   afternoon                                        sincerely yours                                                   anne bellamy   philip read this note and then reread it knowing in his heart that now was his opportunity to act up to his convictions and put an end to the whole transaction in a few decisive words but a man who has for so many years given place to the devil of avarice even though it be avarice with a legitimate object cannot shake himself free from his clothes in a moment even when as in philips case honour and right to say nothing of a still more powerful factor superstition speak so loudly in his ears surely he thought there would be no harm in hearing what she had to say he could explain his reasons for having nothing to do with the matter so much better in person such mental struggles have only one end presently the smart pageboy bore back this note    dear lady bellamy   i will be with you at halfpast three                                                             pc   it was with very curious sensations that philip was that afternoon shown into a richly furnished boudoir in rewtham house he had not been in that room since he had talked to maria lee sitting on that very sofa now occupied by lady bellamys still beautiful form and he could not but feel that it was a place of evil omen for him  lady bellamy rose to greet him with her most fascinating smile  this is very kind she said as she motioned him to a seat which philip afterwards discovered had been carefully arranged so as to put his features in the full light whilst sitting on the sofa her own were concealed well mr caresfoot she began after a little pause i suppose i had better come to the point at once first of all i presume that as you anticipated would be the case there exists some sort of understanding between mr heigham and your daughter  philip nodded  well your cousin is as determined as ever about the matter indeed he is simply infatuated or bewitched i really dont know which  i am sorry for it lady bellamy as i cannot  one moment mr caresfoot first let me tell you his offer then we can talk it over he offers conditionally on his marriage with your daughter to sell you the isleworth estates at a fair valuation hereafter to be agreed upon and to make a large settlement  and what part does he wish me to play in the matter  this first you must get rid of young heigham and prevent him from holding any communication either with angela herself or with any other person connected with this place for one year from the date of his departure secondly you must throw no obstacle in georges path thirdly if required you must dismiss her old nurse pigott  it cannot be lady bellamy i came here to tell you so i dare not force my daughter into such a marriage for all the estates in england  lady bellamy laughed  it is amusing she said to see a father afraid of his own daughter but you are overhasty mr caresfoot who asked you to force her all you are asked to do is not to interfere and leave the rest to myself and george you will have nothing to do with it one way or the other nor will any responsibility rest with you besides it is very probable that your cousin will live down his fancy or some other obstacle will arise to put an end to the thing in which case mr heigham will come back at the end of his years probation and events will take their natural course it is only wise and right that you should try the constancy of these young lovers instead of letting them marry out of hand if on the other hand angela should in the course of the year declare a preference for her cousin surely that will be no affair of yours  i dont understand what your interest is in this matter lady bellamy  my dear mr caresfoot what does my interest matter to you perhaps i have one perhaps i have not all women love matchmaking you know what really is important is your decision and she shot a glance at him from the heavylidded eyes only to recognize that he was not convinced by her arguments or if convinced obstinate by the way she went on slowly george asked me to make a payment to you on his account money that has he says been long owing but which it has not hitherto been convenient to repay  what is the sum asked philip abstractedly  a large one a thousand pounds  it did not require the peculiar intonation she threw into her voice to make the matter clear to him he was well aware that no such sum was owing  here is the cheque she went on and taking from her purse a signed and crossed cheque upon a london banker she unfolded it and threw it upon the table watching him the while  philip gazed at the money with the eyes of a hungry wolf a thousand pounds that might be his for the asking nay for the taking it would bind him to nothing the misers greed took possession of him as he looked slowly he raised his hand twitching with excitement and stretched it out towards the cheque but before his fingers touched it lady bellamy as though by accident dropped her white palm upon the precious paper  i suppose that mr heigham will leave tomorrow on the understanding we mentioned she said carelessly but in a significant tone  philip nodded  the hand was withdrawn as carelessly as it had come leaving the cheque blushing in all its naked beauty upon the table philip took it as deliberately as he could and put it in his pocket then rising he said goodbye adding as he passed through the door  remember i have no responsibility in the matter i wash my hands of it and wish to hear nothing about it  the thousand pounds has done it reflected lady bellamy i told george that he would rise greedily at money i have not watched him for twenty years for nothing fancy selling an only daughters happiness in life for a thousand pounds and such a daughter too i wonder how much he would take to murder her if he were certain that he would not be found out upon my word my work grows quite interesting that cur philip is as good as a play and she laughed her own peculiar laugh                                 chapter xxx  into philips guilty thoughts as he wended his homeward way we will not inquire and indeed for all the warm glow that the thousand pound cheque in his pocket diffused through his system they were not to be envied perhaps no scoundrel presents at heart such a miserable object to himself and all who know him as the scoundrel who attempts to deceive himself and whilst reaping its profits tries to shoulder the responsibility of his iniquity on to the backs of others  unfortunately in this prosaic world of bargains one cannot receive cheques for one thousand pounds without in some shape or form giving a quid pro quo now philips quid was to rid his house and the neighbourhood of arthur heigham his guest and his daughters lover it was not a task he liked but the unearned cheque in his breeches pocket continually reminded him of the obligation it entailed  when arthur came to smoke his pipe with his host that evening the latter looked so gloomy and depressed that he wondered to himself if he was going to be treated to a repetition of the shadow scene little guessing that there was something much more personally unpleasant before him  heigham philip said suddenly and looking studiously in the other direction i want to speak to you i have been thinking over our conversation of about a week ago on the subject of your engagement to angela and have now come to a final determination i may say at once that i approve of you in every way here his hearers heart bounded with delight but under all the circumstances i dont think that i should be right in sanctioning an immediate engagement you are not sufficiently sure of each other for that i may seem oldfashioned but i am a great believer in the virtue of constancy and im anxious in your own interests to put yours and angelas to the test the terms that i can offer you are these you must leave here tomorrow and must give me your word of honour as a gentlemanwhich i know will be the most effectual guarantee that i can take from youthat you will not for the space of a year either attempt to see angela again or to hold any written communication with her or anybody in any way connected with her the year ended you can return and should you both still be of the same mind you can then marry her as soon as you like if you decline to accede to these termswhich i believe to be to your mutual ultimate advantagei must refuse my consent to the engagement altogether  a silence followed this speech the match that arthur had lit before philip began burnt itself out between his fingers without his appearing to suffer any particular inconvenience and now his pipe fell with a crash into the grate and broke into fragmentsa fit symbol of the blow dealt to his hopes for some moments he was so completely overwhelmed at the idea of losing angela for a whole long year losing her as completely as though she were dead that he could not answer at length he found his voice and said hoarsely  yours are hard terms  i cannot argue the point with you heigham such as they are they are my terms founded on what i consider i owe to my daughter do you accept them  i cannot answer you offhand my happiness and angelas are too vitally concerned to allow me to do so i must consult her first  very good i have no objection but you must let me have your answer by ten tomorrow  had arthur only known his own strength and philips weaknessthe strength that honesty and honour ever have in the face of dishonour and dishonestyhad he known the hesitating feebleness of philips avaricetossed mind how easy it would have been for him to tear his bald arguments to sheds and by the bare exhibition of unshaken purpose to confound and disallow his determinationshad he then and there refused to agree to his ultimatum so divided was philip in his mind and so shaken by superstitious fears that he would have accepted it as an omen and have yielded to a decision of character that had no real existence in himself but he did not know indeed how could he know and he was besides too thorough a gentleman to allow himself to suspect foul play and so too sad for talk and oppressed by the dread sense of coming separation from her whom he loved more dearly than his life he sought his room there to think and pace to pace and think until the stars had set  when wearied out at length he threw himself into bed it was only to exchange bad for worse for on such occasions sleep is worse than wakefulness it is so full of dreams big with coming pain shortly after dawn he got up again and went into the garden and listened to the birds singing their matin hymn but he was in no mood for the songs of birds however sweet and it was a positive relief to him when old jakes emerged his cross face set in the gladness of the morning like a sullen cloud in the blue sky and began to do something to his favourite bed of cabbages not that arthur was fond of old jakes on the contrary ever since the coffinstand conversation which betrayed he considered a malevolent mind he detested him personally but still he set a fancy value on him because he was connected with the daily life of his betrothed  and then at last out came angela having spied him from behind the curtains of her window clothed in the same white gown in which he had first beheld her and which he consequently considered the prettiest of frocks never did she look more lovely than when she came walking towards him that morning with her light proud step which was so full of grace and womanly dignity never had he thought her more sweet and heartcompelling than when having first made sure that jakes had retreated to feed his pigs she shyly lifted her bright face to be greeted with his kiss but she was quick of sympathy and had learned to read him like an open page and before his lips had fairly fallen on her own she knew that things had gone amiss  oh what is it arthur she said with a little pant of fear  be brave dear and i will tell you and in somewhat choky tones he recounted word for word what had passed between her father and himself  she listened in perfect silence and bore the blow as a brave woman should when he had finished she said with a little tremor in her voice  you will not forget me in a year will you arthur  he kissed her by way of answer and then they agreed to go together to philip and try to turn him from his purpose  breakfast was not a cheerful meal that day and pigott noticing the prevailing depression remarked with sarcasm that they might for all appearance to the contrary have been married for twenty years but even this spirited sally did not provoke a laugh ten oclock the hour that was to decide their fate came all too soon and it was with very anxious hearts that they took their way to the study philip who was seated in residence appeared to view angelas arrival with some uneasiness  of course angela he said i am always glad to see you but i hardly expected  i beg your pardon for intruding father she answered but as this is very important to me i thought that i had better come too and hear what is settled  as it was evident that she meant to stay philip did not attempt to gainsay her  oh very well very welli suppose you have heard the terms upon which i am prepared to consent to your engagement  yes arthur has told me and it is to implore you to modify them that we have come father they are cruel termsto be dead to each other for a whole long year  i cannot help it angela i am sorry to inflict pain upon either of you but i have arrived at them entirely in your own interests and after a great deal of anxious thought believe me a years probation will be very good for both of you it is not probable that where my only child is concerned i should wish to do anything except what is for her happiness  arthur looked rebellion at angela philip saw it and added  of course you can defy meit is i believe rather the fashion for girls nowadays to do sobut if you do you must both clearly understand first that you cannot marry without my consent till the first of may next or very nearly a year hence when angela comes of age and that i shall equally forbid all intercourse in the interval and secondly that when you do so it will be against my wish and that i shall cut her name out of my will for this property is only entailed in the male line it now only remains for me to ask you if you agree to my conditions  angela answered him speaking very slowly and clearly  i accept them on my own behalf not because i understand them or think them right or because of your threats but because though you do not care for me i am your daughter and should obey youand believe that you wish to do what is best for me that is why i accept although it will make my life wretched for a year  do you hear what she says said philip turning to arthur do you also agree  he answered boldly and with some temper how would he have answered could he have seen the thousand pound cheque that was reposing upon the table in philips rusty pocketbook and known for what purpose it came there  if it had not been angelas wish i would never have agreed i think your terms preposterous and i only hope that you have some satisfactory reason for them for you have not shown us any but since she takes this view of the matter and because so far as i can see you have completely cornered us i suppose i must you are her father and cannot in nature wish to thwart her happiness and if you have any plan of causing her to forget mei dont want to be conceited but i believe that it will fail here angela smiled somewhat sadly so unless one of us dies before the year is up i shall come back to be married on the 9th of june next year  really my dear heigham your way of talking is so aggressive that some fathers might be tempted to ask you not to come back at all but perhaps it is under the circumstances excusable  you would probably think so if you were in my place blurted out arthur  you give me then your word of honour as a gentleman that you will attempt either in person or by letter no communication with angela or with anybody about this place for one year from today  on the condition that at the end of the year i may return and marry her as soon as i like  certainly your marriage can take place on the 9th of june next if you like and care to bring a license and a proper settlementsay of half your incomewith you answered philip with a half smile  i take you at your word said arthur eagerly that is if angela agrees angela made no signs of disagreement then on those terms i give you my promise  very good then that is settled and i will send for a dogcart to take you to the four oclock train i fear you will hardly be ready for the 1225 i shall however hope he added to have the pleasure of presenting this young lady to you for good and all on this day next year goodbye for the present i shall see you before you go  it is painful to have to record that when arthur got outside the door and out of angelas hearing he cursed philip in his grief and anger for the space of some minutes  to linger over those last hours could only be distressing to the sympathetic reader of this history more especially if he or she has ever had the misfortune to pass through such a time in their own proper persons the day of any ones departure is always wretched but much more is it wretched when the person departing is a lover whose face will not be seen and of whom no postman will bear tidings for a whole long year  some comfort however these two took in looking forward to that joyous day when the year of probation should have been gathered to its predecessors and in making the most minute arrangements for their wedding how angela was to warn mr fraser that his services would be required where they should go to for their honeymoon and even of what flowers the wedding bouquet which arthur was to bring down from town with him should be composed  and thus the hours passed away all too quickly and each of them strove to be merry in order to keep up the spirits of the other but it is not in human nature to feel cheerful with a lump of ice upon the heart dinner was even more dismal than breakfast and pigott who had been informed of the impending misfortune and who was distrustful of philips motives though she did not like to add to the general gloom by saying so made after the manner of halfeducated people a painful and infectious exhibition of her grief  poor aleck said angela when the time drew near bending down over the dog to hide a tear as she had once before bent down to hide a blush poor aleck i shall miss you almost as much as your master  you will not miss him angela because i am going to make you a present of him if you will keep him  that is very good of you dear i shall be glad to have him for your sake  well keep him love he is a good dog he will quite have transferred his allegiance by the time i come back i hope you wont have done the same angela  oh arthur why will you so often make me angry by saying such things the sun will forget to shine before i forget you  hush love i did not mean it and he took her in his arms and so they sat there together under the oak where first they had met hand in hand and heart to heart and it was at this moment that the self reliant strength and more beautiful serenity of angelas character as compared with her lovers came into visible play for whilst as the moment of separation drew nigh he could scarcely contain his grief she on the other hand grew more and more calm strengthening his weakness with her quiet power and bidding him seek consolation in his trouble at the hands of him who for his own purposes decreed it  dearest she said in answer to his complainings there are so many things in the world that we cannot understand and yet they must be right and lead to a good end what may happen to us before this year is out of course we cannot say but i feel that all love is immortal and that there is a perfect life awaiting us if not in this world then in the next remember dear that these few years are after all but as a breath to the general air or as that dewdrop to the waters of the lake when compared with the future that awaits us there and that until we attain that future we cannot really know each other or the true meaning and purpose of our love so look forward to it without fear dear heart and if it should chance that i should pass out of your life or that other ties should spring up round you that shall forbid the outward expression of our love here arthur started and was about to interrupt but she stopped him do not start arthur who can read the future stranger things have happened and if i say such a thing should come about in our case then remember i implore you that in that future lies the answer to the puzzles of the world and turn your eyes to it as to the horizon beyond which you will find me waiting for you and not only me but all that you have ever loved only dear try to be a good man and love me always  he looked at her in wonder  angela he said what has made you so different from other women with all whom i have known love is an affair of passion or amusement of the world and the day but yours gazes towards heaven and looks to find its real utterance in the stillness of eternity to be loved by you my dear would be worth a century of sorrows  at last the moment came as all moments good and bad must come to pigott who was crying he gave a hug and a fivepound note to aleck a pat on the head to philip who could not look him in the face a shake of the hand and to angela who bravely smiled into his eyesa long last kiss  but when the cruel wheels began to crunch upon the gravel the great tears welling to her eyes blotted him from sight blindly she made her way up to her room and throwing herself upon the bed let her unrestrained sorrow loose feeling that she was indeed desolate and alone                                 chapter xxxi  when angela was still quite a child the permanent inhabitants of sherborne lane king william street in the city of london used to note a very pretty girl of small statue and modest ways passing out every evening after the city gentlemen had locked up their offices and gone homefrom the quiet of the lane into the roar and rush of the city this young girl was mildred james the only daughter of a struggling a very struggling city doctor and her daily mission was to go to the cheap markets and buy the provisions that were to last the sherborne lane household for her father lived in the same rooms that he practised in for the ensuing twentyfour hours the world was a hard place for poor mildred in those days of provision hunting when so little money had to pay for so many necessaries and to provide also for the luxuries that were necessaries to her invalid mother some years later when she was a sweet maiden of eighteen her mother died but medical competition was keen in sherborne lane and her removal did not greatly alleviate the pressure of poverty at last one evening when she was about twenty years of age a certain mr carr an old gentleman with whom her father had some acquaintance sent up a card with a pencilled message on it to the effect that he would be glad to see dr james  run mildred said her father and tell mr carr that i will be with him in a minute it will never do to see a new patient in this coat  mildred departed and gliding into the gloomy consultingroom like a sunbeam delivered her message to the old gentleman who appeared to be in some pain and prepared to return  dont go away almost shouted the aged patient i have crushed my finger in a door and it hurts most confoundedly you are something to look at in this hole and distract my attention  mildred thought to herself that this was an odd way of paying a compliment if it was meant for one but then old gentlemen with crushed fingers are not given to weighing their words  are you dr james daughter he asked presently  yes sir  ugh i have lived most of my life in sherborne lane and never saw anything half so pretty in it before confound this finger  at this moment the doctor himself arrived and wanted to dismiss mildred but mr carr who was a headstrong old gentleman vowed that no one else should hold his injured hand whilst it was dressed and so she stayed just long enough for him to fall as completely in love with her shelllike face was though he had been twenty instead of nearly seventy  now mr carr was not remarkable for good looks and in addition to having seen out so many summers had also buried two wives it will therefore be clear that he was scarcely the suitor that a lovely girl conscious of capacities for deep affection would have selected of her own free will but on the other hand he was honest and kind hearted and what was more to the point perhaps the wealthiest wine merchant in the city mildred resisted as long as she could but want is a hard master and a fathers arguments are difficult to answer and in the end she married him and what is more made him a good and faithful wife  she never had any cause to regret it for he was kindness itself towards her and when he died some five years afterwards having no children of his own he left her sole legatee of all his enormous fortune bound up by no restrictions as to remarriage about this time also her father died and she was left as much alone in the world as it is possible for a young and pretty woman possessing in her own right between twenty and thirty thousand a year to be  needless to say mrs carr was thenceforth one of the catches of her generation but nobody could catch her though she alone knew how many had tried once she made a list of all the people who had proposed to her it included amongst others a bishop two peers three members of parliament no less than five army officers an american and a dissenting clergyman  it is perfectly marvellous my dear she said to her companion agatha terry how fond people are of twenty thousand a year and yet they all said that they loved me for myself that is all except the dissenter who wanted me to help to feed his flock and i liked him the best of the lot because he was the honestest  mrs carr had a beautiful house in grosvenor square a place in leicestershire where she hunted a little a place in the isle of wight that she rarely visited and lastly a place at madeira where she lived for nearly half the year there never had been a breath of scandal against her name nor had she given cause for any as for loving she would say the only things she loved were beetles and mummies for she was a clever naturalist and a faithful student of the lore of the ancient egyptians the beetles she would explain had been the connecting link between the two sciences since beetles had led her to scarabaei and scarabaei to the human husks with which they are to be found but this statement though amusing was not strictly accurate as she had in reality contracted the taste from her late husband who had left her a large collection of egyptian antiquities  i do adore a mummy she would say i am small enough in mind and body already but it makes me feel inches smaller and i like to measure my own diminutiveness  she was not much of a reader life was she declared too short to waste in study but when she did take up a book it was generally of a nature that most women of her class would have called stiff and then she could read it without going to sleep  in addition to these occupations mrs carr had had various crazes at different stages of her widowhood which had now endured for some five years she had travelled she had gonein for art once she had speculated a little but finding that for a woman it was a losing game she was too shrewd to continue this last pastime but she always came back to her beetles and her mummies  still with all her money her places her offers of marriage and her selfmade occupations mildred carr was essentially a weary woman sunk deep in ease and sated with her life within that little frame of hers there beat a great active heart ever urging her onwards towards an unknown end she would describe herself as an ill regulated woman and the description was not without justice for she did not possess that placid even mind which is so necessary to the comfort of english ladies and which enables many of them to bury a husband or a lover as composedly as they take him she would have given worlds to be able to fall in love with some one to fill up the daily emptiness of her existence with anothers joys and griefs but she could not men passed before her in endless procession all sorts and conditions of them and for the most part were anxious to marry her but they might as well have been a string of wax dolls for aught she could care about them to her eyes they were nothing more than a succession of frockcoats and tall hats full of shine and emptiness signifying nothing for their opinion too and that of the society which they helped to form she had a most complete and wrong headed contempt she cared nothing for the ordinary laws of social life and was prepared to break through them on emergency as a wasp breaks through a spiders web perhaps she guessed that a good deal of breaking would be forgiven to the owner of such a lovely face and more than twenty thousand a year with all this she was extremely observant and possessed unknown to herself great powers of mind and great though dormant capacities for passion in short this little woman with the baby face smiling and serene as the blue sky that hides the gathering hurricane was rather odder than the majority of her sex which is perhaps saying a great deal  one day about a week before arthur departed from the abbey house agatha terry was sitting in the blue drawingroom in the house in grosvenor square when mrs carr came in almost at a run slammed the door behind her and plumped herself down in a chair with a sigh of relief  agatha give orders to pack up we will go to madeira by the next boat  goodness gracious mildred across that dreadful bay again and just think how hot it will be and the beginning of the season too  now agatha im going and theres an end of it so it is no use arguing you can stay here and give a series of balls and dinners if you like  nonsense dear me give parties indeed and you at madeira why its just as though you asked ruth to entertain the reapers without naomi ill go and give the orders but i do hope that it will be calm why do you want to go now  ill tell you lord minster has been proposing to me again and announces his intention of going on doing so till i accept him you know he has just got into the cabinet so he has celebrated the event by asking me to marry him for the third time  poor fellow perhaps he is very fond of you  not a bit of it he is fond of my good looks and my money i will tell you the substance of his speech this morning he stood like this with his hands in his pockets and said i am now a cabinet minister it is a good thing that a cabinet minister should have somebody presentable to sit at the head of his table you are presentable i appreciate beauty when i have time to think about it i observe that you are beautiful i am not very welloff for my position you on the other hand are immensely rich with your money i can in time become prime minister it is consequently evidently to my advantage that you should marry me and i have sacrificed a very important appointment in order to come and settle it  agatha laughed  and how did you answer him  in his own style lord minster i said i am for the third time honoured by your flattering proposal but i have no wish to ornament your table no desire to expose my beauty to your perpetual admiration and no ambition to advance your political career i do not love you and i had rather become the wife of a crossingsweeper that i loved than that of a member of the government for whom i have every respect but no affection  as the wife of a crossingsweeper it is probable he answered that you would be miserable as my wife you would certainly be admired and powerful and consequently happy  lord minster i said you have studied human nature but very superficially if you have not learnt that it is better for a woman to be miserable with the man she loves than admired powerful and consequently happy with one who has no attraction for her  your remark is interesting he replied but i think that there is something paradoxical about it i must be going now as i have only five minutes to get to westminster but i will think it over and answer it when we renew our conversation which i propose to do very shortly and he was gone before i could get in another word  but why should that make you go to madeira  because my dear if i dont so sure as i am a living woman that man will tire me out and marry me and i dislike him and dont want to marry him i have a strong will but his is of iron  and so it came to pass that the names of mrs carr miss terry and three servants appeared upon the passenger list of messrs donald currie  cos royal mail steamship warwick castle due to sail for madeira and the cape ports on the 14th of june                                chapter xxxii  arthur arrived in town in a melancholy condition his was a temperament peculiarly liable to suffer from attacks of depression and he had with some excuse a sufficiently severe one on him now do what he would he could not for a single hour free his mind from the sick longing to see or hear from angela that in addition to the mental distress it occasioned him amounted almost to a physical pain after two or three days of lounging about his clubfor he was in no mood for going outhe began to feel that this sort of thing was intolerable and that it was absolutely necessary for him to go somewhere or do something  it so happened that just after he had come to this decision he overheard two men who were sitting at the next table to him in the club diningroom talking of the island of madeira and speaking of it as a charming place he accepted this as an omen and determined that to madeira he would go and indeed the place would suit him as well as any other to get through a portion of his year of probation in and whilst affording a complete change of scene would not be too far from england  and so it came to pass that on the morrow arthur found himself in the office of messrs donald currie for the purpose of booking his berth in the vessel that was due to sail on the 14th there he was informed by the very affable clerk who assisted him to choose his cabin that the vessel was unusually empty and that up to the present time berths had been taken for only five ladies and two of them jewesses  however the clerk added by way of consolation this one pointing to mrs carrs name on the list is as good as a cargo and he whistled expressively  what do you mean asked arthur his curiosity slightly excited  i meanmy word here she comes  at that moment the swing doors of the office were pushed open and there came through them one of the sweetest daintiest little women arthur had ever seen she was no longer quite young she might be eight and twenty or thirty but on the other hand maturity had but added to the charms of youth she had big brown eyes that arthur thought could probably look languishing if they chose and that even in repose were full of expression a face soft and blooming as a peach and round as a babys surmounted by a quantity of nutbrown hair the very sweetest mouth the lips rather full and just showing a line of pearl and lastly what looked rather odd on such an infantile countenance a firm square and very determined if very diminutive chin for the rest it was difficult to say which was the most perfect her figure or her dress  all of which of course had little interest for arthur but what did rather startle him was her voice when she spoke from such a woman one would naturally have expected a voice of a corresponding nature namely one of the soft and murmuring order but hers on the contrary though sweet was decided and clear as a bell and with a peculiar ring in it that he would have recognized amongst a thousand others  on her entrance arthur stepped on one side  i have come to say she said with a slight bow of recognition to the clerk that i have changed my mind about my berth instead of the starboard deck cabin i should like to have the port i think that it will be cooler at this time of year and also will you please make arrangements for three horses  i am excessively sorry mrs carr the clerk answered but the port cabin is engagedin fact this gentleman has just taken it  oh in that casewith a little blushthere is an end of the question  by no means interrupted arthur it is a matter of perfect indifference to me where i go i beg that you will take it  oh thank you you are very good but i could not think of robbing you of your cabin  i must implore you to do so rather than there should be any difficulty i will go below and then addressing the clerk be so kind as to change the cabin  i owe you many thanks for your courtesy said mrs carr with a little curtsey  arthur took off his hat  then we will consider that settled good morning or perhaps i should say au revoir and bowing again he left the office  what is that gentlemans name mrs carr asked when he was gone  here it is madam on the list arthur preston heigham passenger to madeira  arthur preston heigham mrs carr said to herself as she made her way down to her carriage in fenchurch street arthur is pretty and preston is pretty but i dont much like heigham at any rate there is no doubt about his being a gentleman i wonder what he is going to madeira for he has an interesting face i think i am glad we are going to be fellowpassengers  the two days that remained to him in town arthur spent in making his preparations for departure getting money buying after the manner of young englishmen starting on a voyage to foreign parts a large and fearfully sharp huntingknife as though madeira were the home of wild beasts and laying in a stock of various other articles of a useless description such as impenetrable sunhelmets and leather coats  the boat was to sail at noon on friday and on the thursday evening he left paddington by the mail that reaches dartmouth about midnight on the pier he and one or two other fellowpassengers found a boat waiting to take them to the great vessel that painted a dull grey lay still and solemn in the harbour as they were rowed up to her very different from the active living thing that she was destined to become within the next twentyfour hours the tide ebbing past her iron sides the fresh strong smell of the sea the tall masts pointing skywards like gigantic fingers the chime of the bell upon the bridge the sleepy steward and the stuffy cabin were all a pleasant variation from the everyday monotony of existence and contributed towards the conclusion that life was still partially worth living even when it could not be lived with angela indeed so much are we the creatures of circumstance and so liable to be influenced by surroundings that arthur who a few hours before had been plunged into the depths of depression turned into his narrow berth after a tremendous struggle with the sheetswhich stewards arrange on a principle incomprehensible to landlubbers and probably only partially understood by themselveswith considerable satisfaction and a pleasurable sense of excitement  the next morning or rather the earlier part of it he devoted when he was not thinking about angela to arranging his goods and chattels in his small domain to examining the lovely scenery of dartmouth harbourthe sight of which is enough to make any outwardbound individual bitterly regret his determination to quit his native land and to inspecting the outward man of his fellowpassengers with that icy stolidity which characterizes the trueborn briton but the great event of the morning was the arrival of the mailtrain bringing the bags destined for various african ports loose letters for the passengers and a motley contingent of the passengers themselves amongst these latter he had no difficulty in recognizing the two jewesses of whom the clerk in the office had spoken who were accompanied by individuals presumably their husbands and very remarkable for the splendour of their diamond studs and the dirtiness of their nails the only other specimen of saloonpassenger womankind that he could see was a pretty blackeyed girl of about eighteen who was as he afterwards discovered going out under the captains care to be a governess at the cape and who to judge from the intense melancholy of her countenance did not particularly enjoy the prospect but with the exception of some heavy baggage that was being worked up from a cargoboat by the donkeyengine and a luxurious canechair on the deck that bore her name no signs were there of mrs carr  presently the purser sent round the headsteward a gentleman whom arthur mistook for the first mate so smart was his uniform to collect the letters and it wrung him not a little to think that he alone could send none the bell sounded to warn all not sailing to hurry to their boats but still there was nothing to be seen of his acquaintance of the office and to speak the truth he was just a little disappointed for what he had seen of her had piqued his curiosity and made him anxious to see more  i cant wait any longer he heard the captain say she must come on by the kinfauns  it was full twelve oclock and the last rope was being loosed from the moorings tingting went the engineroom bell thudthud started the great screw that would not stop again for so many restless hours the huge vessel shuddered throughout her frame like an awakening sleeper and growing quick with life forged an inch or two ahead next a quartermaster came with two men to hoist up the gangway when suddenly a boat shot alongside and hooked on amongst the occupants of which arthur had no difficulty in recognizing mrs carr who sat laughing like pleasure at the helm the other occupants of the boat who were not laughing he guessed to be her servants and the lady who figured on the passengerlist as miss terry a stout solemnlooking person in spectacles  now then agatha called out mrs carr from the sternsheets be quick and jump up  my dear mildred i cant go up there i cant indeed why the things moving  but you must go up or else be pulled up with a rope here i will show the way and moving down the boat she sprang boldly as it rose with the swell into the stalwart arms of the sailor who was waiting on the gangway landingstage and thence ran up the steps to the deck  very well i am going to madeira i dont know what you are going to do but you must make up your mind quick  cant hold on much longer mum said the boatman shes getting way on now  come on mum i wont let you in said the man of the ladder seductively  oh dear oh dear what shall i do groaned miss terry wringing the hand that was not employed in holding on  john called mrs carr to a servant who was behind miss terry and looking considerably alarmed dont stand there like a fool put miss terry on to that ladder  mrs carr was evidently accustomed to be obeyed for thus admonished john seized the struggling and shrieking miss terry and bore her to the edge of the boat where she was caught by two sailors and amidst the cheers of excited passengers fairly dragged on to the deck  oh mrs carr said the chief officer reproachfully when miss terry had been satisfactorily deposited on a bench you are late again you were late last voyage  not at all mr thompson i hate spending longer than is necessary aboard ship so when the train got in i took a boat and went for a row in the harbour i knew that you would not go without me  oh yes we should have mrs carr the skipper heard about it because he waited for you before  well here i am and i promise that i wont do it again  mr thompson laughed and passed on at this moment mrs carr perceived arthur and bowing to him they fell into conversation about the scenery through which the boat was passing on her way to the open sea before very long indeed as soon as the vessel began to rise and fall upon the swell this talk was interrupted by a voice from the seat where miss terry had been placed  mildred it said i do wish you would not come to sea i am beginning to feel ill  and no wonder if you will insist upon coming up ladders head downwards wheres john he will help you to your cabin the deck one next to mine  but john had vanished with a parcel  mildred send some one quick i beg of you remarked miss terry in the solemn tones of one who feels that a crisis is approaching  i cant see anybody except a very dirty sailor  permit me said arthur stepping to the rescue  you are very kind but she cant walk i know her ways she has got to the stage when she must be carried can you manage her  i think so replied arthur if you dont mind holding her legs and provided that the vessel does not roll and with an effort he hoisted miss terry babyfashion into his arms and staggered off with her towards the indicated cabin mrs carr as suggested holding the lower limbs of the prostrate lady presently she began to laugh  if you only knew how absurd we look she said  dont make me laugh answered arthur puffing for miss terry was by no means light or i shall drop her  if you do young man ejaculated his apparently unconscious burden with wonderful energy i will never forgive you  a remark the suddenness of which so startled him that he very nearly did  thank you now lay her quite flat please she wont get up again till we drop anchor at madeira  if i live so long murmured the invalid  arthur now made his bow and departed wondering how two women so dissimilar as mrs carr and miss terry came to be living together as it is a piece of curiosity that the reader may share perhaps it had better be explained  miss terry was a middleaged relative of mrs carrs late husband who had by a series of misfortunes been left quite destitute her distress having come to the knowledge of mildred carr she with the kind hearted promptitude that distinguished her at once came to her aid paid her debts and brought her to her own house to stay where she had remained ever since under the title of companion these two women living thus together had nothing whatsoever in common save that miss terry took some reflected interest in beetles as for travelling having been brought up and lived in the same house of the same county town until she reached the age of fortyfive it was as may be imagined altogether obnoxious to her indeed it is more than doubtful if she retained any clear impression whatsoever of the places she visited a set of foreign holes as she would call them contemptuously miss terry was in short neither clever nor strong minded but so long as she could be in the company of her beloved mildred whom she regarded with mingled reverence and affection she was perfectly happy oddly enough this affection was reciprocated and there probably was nobody in the world for whom mrs carr cared so much as her cousin by marriage agatha terry and yet it would be impossible to imagine two women more dissimilar  not long after they had left dartmouth the afternoon set in dull and towards evening the sea freshened sufficiently to send most of the passengers below leaving those who remained to be finally dispersed by the penetrating drizzle that is generally to be met with off the english coast arthur left alone on the heaving deck surveyed the scene and thought it very desolate around was a grey waste of tossing waters illumined here and there by the setting rays of an angry sun above a wild and windy sky with not even a seagull in all its space and in the far distance a white and fading line which was the shore of england  faint it grew and fainter yet and as it disappeared he thought of angela and a yearning sorrow fell upon him when he wondered sadly should he again look into her eyes and hold that proud beauty in his arms what fate awaited them in the future that stretched before them dim as the darkening ocean and more uncertain alas he could not tell he only felt that it was very bitter to be parted thus from her to whom had been given his whole hearts love to know that every fleeting moment widened a breach already far too wide and not to know if it would again be narrowed or if this farewell would be the last then he thought if it should be the last if she should die or desert him what would his life be worth to him a consciousness within him answered nothing and in a degree his conclusion was right for although it is fortunately not often in the power of any single passion to render life altogether worthless it is certain that when it strikes in youth there is no sickness so sore as that of the heart no sorrow more keen and no evil more lasting than those connected with its disappointments and its griefs for other sorrows life has salves and consolations but a noble and enduring passion is not all of this world and to cure its sting we must look to something beyond this worlds quackeries other griefs can find sympathy and expression and become absorbed little by little in the variety of loves issues but love as it is and should be understoodnot the faint ghost that arrays itself in stolen robes and says i am love but love the strong and the immortal the passkey to the happy skies the angel cipher we read but cannot understandsuch love as this and there is none other true can find no full solace here not even in its earthly satisfaction  for still it beats against its mortal bars and rends the heart that holds it still strives like a meteor flaming to its central star or a new loosed spirit seeking the presence of its god to pass hence with that kindred soul to the inner heaven whence it came there to be wholly mingled with its other life and clothed with a divine identity there to satisfy the aspirations that now vaguely throb within their fleshly walls with the splendour and the peace and the full measure of the eternal joys it knows await its coming  and is it not a firstfruit of this knowledge that the thoughts of those who are plunged into the fires of a pure devotion fly upwards as surely as the sparks nothing but the dross the grosser earthly part is purged away by their everchastening sorrow which is in truth a discipline for finer souls for did there ever yet live the man or woman who loving truly has suffered and the fires burnt out has not risen phoenixlike from their ashes purer and better and holding in the heart a bright undying hope never for these have walked barefooted upon the holy ground it is the flames from the altar that have purged them and left their own light within and surely this holds also good of those who have loved and lost of those who have been scorned or betrayed of the suffering army that cry aloud of the empty bitterness of life and dare not hope beyond they do not understand that having once loved truly it is not possible that they should altogether lose that there is to their pain and the dryrot of their hopes as to everything else in nature an end object shall the soul be immortal and its best essence but a thing of air shall the one thought by day and the one dream by night the ethereal star which guides us across lifes mirage and which will still shine serene at the moment of our fall from the precipice of time shall this alone amidst all that makes us what we are be chosen out to see corruption to be cast off and forgotten in the grave never there by the workings of a providence we cannot understand that mighty germ awaits fruition there too shall we know the wherefore of our sorrow at which sadeyed we now so often wonder there shall we kiss the rod that smote us and learn the glorious uses and pluck the glowing fruits of an affliction that on earth filled us with such sick longing and such an aching pain  let the longsuffering reader forgive these pages of speculative writing for the subject is a tempting one and full of interest for us mortals indeed it may chance that if he or she is more than fiveandtwenty these lines may even have been read without impatience for there are many who have the memory of a lost angela hidden away somewhere in the records of their past and who are fain in the breathing spaces of their lives to dream that they will find her wandering in that wide eternity where all human barriers fall all human relations end and love ceases to be a crime                                chapter xxxiii  the morning after the vessel left dartmouth brought with it lovely weather brisk and clear with a fresh breeze that just topped the glittering swell with white there was however a considerable roll on the ship and those poor wretches who for their sins are given to seasickness were not yet happy presently arthur observed the pretty blackeyed girlpoor thing she did not look very pretty nowcreep on to the deck and attempt to walk about an effort which promptly resulted in a fall into the scuppers he picked her up and asked if she would not like to sit down but she faintly declined saying that she did not mind falling so long as she could walk a littleshe did not feel so sick when she walked under these circumstances he could hardly do less than help her which he did in the only way at all practicable with one so weak namely by walking her about on his arm  in the midst of his interesting peregrinations he observed mrs carr gazing out of her deck cabin window looking he thought pale but sweetly pretty and rather cross when that lady saw that she was observed she pulled the curtain with a jerk and vanished shortly after this arthurs companion vanished too circumstances over which she had no control compelling her and arthur himself sat down rather relieved  but he was destined that day to play knighterrant to ladies in distress presently mrs carrs cabindoor opened and that lady herself emerged therefrom holding on to the siderail he had just begun to observe how charmingly she was dressed when some qualm seized her and she returned to reenter the cabin but the door had swungto with the roll of the vessel and she could not open it impelled by an agony of doubt she flew to the side and to his horror sprang with a single bound on to the broad rail that surmounted the bulwark netting and remained seated there holding only to a little rope that hung down from the awningchain the ship which was at the moment rolling pretty heavily had just reached the full angle of her windward roll and was preparing for a heavy swing to leeward arthur seeing that mrs carr would in a few seconds certainly be flung out to sea rushed promptly forward and lifted her from the rail it was none too soon for next moment down the great ship went with a lurch into a trough of the sea hurling him with her in his arms up against the bulwarks and to say truth hurting him considerably but if he expected any thanks for this exploit he was destined to be disappointed for no sooner had he set his lovely burden down than she made use of her freedom to stamp upon the deck  how could you be so foolish said he in another moment you would have been flung out to sea  and pray mr heigham she answered in a cutting and sarcastic voice is that my business or your own surely it would have been time enough for you to take a liberty when i asked you to jump over after me  arthur drew himself up to his full height and looked dignifiedhe could look dignified when he liked  i do not quite understand you mrs carr he said with a little bow what i did i did to save you from going overboard next time that such a little adventure comes in my way i hope for my own sake that it may concern a lady possessed of less rudeness and more gratitude  and then glaring defiance at each other they separated she marching off with all the dignity of an offended queen to the sweet seclusion that a cabin grants whilst he withdrew moodily to a bench comforted however not a little by the thought that he had given mrs carr a roland for her oliver  mrs carrs bound on to the bulwarks had been the last effort of that prince of demons seasickness rending her ere he left when the occasion for remaining there had thus passed away she soon tired of her cabin and of listening to the inarticulate moans of her beloved agatha who was a most faithful subject of the fiend one who would never desert his manner so long as he could roll the tiniest wave and sallying forth took up her position in the little society of the ship  but between arthur and herself there was no attempt at reconciliation each felt their wrongs to be as eternal as the rocks at luncheon they looked unutterable things from different sides of the table going in to dinner she cut him with the sweetest grace and on the following morning they naturally removed to situations as remote from each other as the cubic area of a mail steamer would allow  pretty very much so but illmannered not quite a lady i should say reflected arthur to himself with a superior smile  i detest him said mrs carr to herself at least i think i do but how neatly he put me down there is no doubt about his being a gentleman though insufferably conceited  these uncharitable thoughts rankled in their respective minds about 12 am what then was arthurs disgust on descending a little late to luncheon that day to be informed by the resplendent chiefsteward who for some undiscovered reason always reminded him of pharaohs butlerthat the captain had altered the places at table and that this alteration involved his being placed next to none other than mrs carr everybody was already seated and it was too late to protest at any rate for that meal so he had to choose between submission and going without his luncheon being extremely hungry he decided for the first alternative and reluctantly brought himself to a halt next his avowed enemy  but surprises like sorrows come in battalions a fact that he very distinctly realized when having helped himself to some chicken he heard a clear voice at his side address him by name  mr heigham said the voice i have not yet thanked you for your kindness to miss terry i am commissioned to assure you that she is very grateful since she is prevented by circumstances from doing so herself  i am much gratified he replied stiffly but really i did nothing to deserve thanks and if i had he added with a touch of sarcasm i should not have expected any  oh what a cynic you must be she answered with a rippling laugh as though women helpless as they are were not always thankful for the tiniest attention did not the pretty girl with the black eyes thank you for your attentions yesterday for instance  did the lady with the brown eyes thank me for my attentionsmy very necessary attentionsyesterday for instance he answered somewhat mollified for the laugh and the voice would have thawed a human icicle and with all his faults arthur was not an icicle  no she did not she deferred doing so in order that she might do it better it was very kind of you to help me and i daresay that you saved my life and ii beg your pardon for being so cross but being seasick always makes me cross even to those who are kindest to me do you forgive me please forgive me i really am quite unhappy when i think of my behaviour and mrs carr shot a glance at him that would have cleared the northwest passage for a manofwar  please dont apologize he said humbly i really have nothing to forgive i am aware that i took a liberty as you put it but i thought that i was justified by the circumstances  it is not generous of you mr heigham to throw my words into my teeth i had forgotten all about them but i will set your want of feeling against my want of gratitude and we kiss and be friends  i can assure you mrs carr that there is nothing in the world i should like better when shall the ceremony come off  now you are laughing at me and actually interpreting what i say literally as though the english language were not full of figures of speech by that phrase and she blushed a littlethat is her cheek took a deeper shade of corali meant that we would not cut each other after lunch  you bring me from the seventh heaven of expectation into a very prosaic world but i accept your terms whatever they are i am conquered  for exactly half an hour but let us talk sense are you going to stop at madeira  yes  for how long  i dont know till i get tired of it i suppose is it nice madeira  charming i live there half the year  ah then i can well believe that it is charming  mr heigham you are paying compliments i thought that you looked above that sort of thing  in the presence of misfortune and of beautyhere he bowedall men are reduced to the same level talk to me from behind a curtain or let me turn my back upon you and you may expect to hear workaday prosebut face to face i fear that you must put up with compliment  a neat way of saying that you have had enough of me your compliments are twoedged goodbye for the present and she rose leaving arthur well rather amused  after this they saw a good deal of each otherthat is to say they conversed together for at least thirty minutes out of every sixty during an average day of fourteen hours and in the course of these conversations she learned nearly everything about him except his engagement to angela and she shrewdly guessed at that or rather at some kindred circumstance in his career arthur on the other hand learned quite everything about her for her life was open as the day and would have borne repeating in the times newspaper but nevertheless he found it extremely interesting  you must be a busy woman he said one morning when he had been listening to one of her rattling accounts of her travels and gaieties sprinkled over as it was with the shrewd remarks and illumined by the keen insight into character that made her talk so charming  busy no one of the idlest in the world and a very worthless one to boot she answered with a little sigh  then why dont you change your life it is in your own hands if ever anybodys was  do you think so i doubt if anybodys life is in their own hands we follow an appointed course if we did not it would be impossible to understand why so many sensible clever people make such a complete mess of their existence they cant do it from choice  at any rate you have not made a mess of yours and your appointed course seems a very pleasant one  yes and the sea beneath us is very smooth but it has been rough before and will be rough againthere is no stability in the sea as to making a mess of my life who knows what i may not accomplish in that way prosperity cannot shine down fear of the future it only throws it into darker relief myself i am afraid of the futureit is unknown and to me what is unknown is not magnificent but terrible the present is enough for me i do not like speculation and i never loved the dark  and as they talked madeira in all its summer glory loomed up out of the ocean for they had passed the desertas and porto santo by night and for a while they were lost in the contemplation of one of the most lovely and verdant scenes that the world can show before they had well examined it however the vessel had dropped her anchor and was surrounded by boats full of customhouse officials boats full of diving boys of vegetables of wicker chairs and tables of parrots fruit and other articles too numerous to mention as they say in the auctioneers catalogues and they knew that it was time to go ashore  well it has been a pleasant voyage said mrs carr i am glad you are not going on  so am i  you will come and see me tomorrow will you not look there is my house and she pointed to a large white house opposite leeuw rock that had a background of glossy foliage and commanded a view of the sea if you come i will show you my beetles and if you care to come next day i will show you my mummies  and if i come the next what will you show me  so often as you may come she said with a little tremor in her voice i shall find something to show you  then they shook hands and took their respective ways shetogether with the unfortunate miss terry who looked like a resuscitated corpse on to the steamlaunch that was waiting for her and he in the boat belonging to miles hotel                                chapter xxxiv  a minute or two after the boat in which arthur was being piloted to the shore under the guidance of the manager of miles hotel had left the side of the vessel mrs carrs steamlaunch shot up alongside of them its brasswork gleaming in the sunlight like polished gold on the deck near the little wheel stood mrs carr herself and by her side her martial cloak around her lay miss terry still as any log  mr heigham said mrs carr in a voice that sounded across the water like a silver bell i forgot that you will not be able to find your way to my place by yourself tomorrow so i will send down a bullockcar to fetch you you have to travel about with bullocks here you know goodbye and before he could answer the launchs head was round and she was tearing through the swell at the rate of fourteen knots  thats her private launch said the manager of the hotel to arthur it is the quickest in the island and she always goes at full steam she must have come some way round to tell you that too theres her place over there  mrs carr comes here every year does she not  oh yes every year but she is very early this year our season does not begin yet you know she is a great blessing to the place she gives so much away to the poor peasants at first she used to come with old mr carr and a wonderful nurse they say she made to the old gentleman till he died  does she entertain much  not as a rule but sometimes she gives great balls splendid affairs and a series of dinnerparties that are the talk of the island she hardly ever goes out anywhere which makes the ladies in the place angry but i believe that they all go to her balls and dinners mostly she spends her time up in the hills collecting butterflies and beetles she has got the most wonderful collection of egyptian curiosities up at the house there too though why she keeps them here instead of in england i am sure i dont know her husband began the collection when he was a young man and collected all his life and she has gone on with it since  i wonder that she has not married again  well it cant be for want of asking if half of what they say is true for according to that every single gentleman under fifty who has been at madeira during the last five years has had a try at her but she wouldnt look at one of them but of course that is gossip and here we are at the landingplace sit steady sir those fellows will pull the boat up  had it not been for the preoccupied and uncomfortable state of his mind that took the flavour out of all that he did and persistently thrust a skeleton amidst the flowers of every landscape arthur should by rights have enjoyed himself very much at madeira  to live in one of the lofty rooms of miles hotel protected by thick walls and cool green shutters to feel that you are enjoying all the advantages of a warm climate without its drawbacks and that too however much people in england may be shiveringwhich they mostly do all the year roundis in itself a luxury and so it is if the day is hot to dine chiefly off fish and fruit and such fruit and then to exchange the diningroom for the cool portico with the seabreeze sweeping through it and pipe in hand to sink into a slumber that even the diabolical shrieks of the parrots tied by the leg in a line below are powerless to disturb or if you be energetic i speak of madeira energyyou may stroll down the little terraced walk under the shade of your landlords vines and contemplate the growing mass of greenery that in this heavenly island makes a garden you can do more than this even for having penetrated through the brilliant flowerbeds and recruited exhausted nature under a figtree you can engage in true english fashion in a game of lawn tennis which done you will again seek the shade of the creeping vines or spreading bananas and in a springy hammock take your well earned repose  all these things are the quintessence of luxury so much so that he who has once enjoyed them will long to turn lotoseater forget the painful and laborious past and live and die at miles hotel oh madeira gem of the ocean land of pineclad mountains that foolish men love to climb valleys where wise ones much prefer to rest and of smells that both alike abhor madeira of the sunny sky and azure sea land flowing with milk and honey and overflowing with population if only you belonged to the country on which you depend for a livelihood what a perfect place you would be and how poetical one could grow about you a consummation which fortunately for my readers the recollection of the open drains the illfavoured priests and portuguese officials effectually prevents  on the following morning at twelve punctually arthur was informed that the conveyance had arrived to fetch him he went down and was quite appalled at its magnificence it was sledgelike in form built to hold four and mounted on wooden runners that glided over the round pebbles with which the madeira streets are paved with scarcely a sound and as smoothly as though they ran on ice the chariot as arthur always called it afterwards was built of beautiful woods and lined and curtained throughout with satin whilst the motive power was supplied by two splendidly harnessed white oxen two native servants handsome young fellows dressed in a kind of white uniform accompanied the sledge and saluted arthur on his appearance with much reverence  it took him however some time before he could make up his mind to embark in a conveyance that reminded him of the description of cleopatras galley and smelt more sweet but finally he got in and off he started feeling that he was the observed of all observers and followed by at least a score of beggars each afflicted with some peculiar and dreadful deformity or disease and thus in triumphal guise they slid down the quaint and narrow streets squeezed in for the sake of shade between a double line of tall greenshuttered houses over the bridges that span the vast open drains past the ochrecoloured cathedral down the promenade edged with great magnoliatrees that made the air heavy with their perfume and where twice a week the band plays and the portuguese officials march up and down in all the pomp and panoply of office onward through the dip where the town lopes downwards to the sea then up again through more streets and past a stretch of dead wall after which the chariot wheels through some iron gates and he is in fairyland one each side of the carriageway there spreads a garden calculated to make english horticulturists gnash their teeth with envy through the bowers of which he could catch peeps of green turf and of the blue sea beyond  here the cabbage palm shot its smooth and lofty trunk high into the air there the bamboo waved its leafy ostrich plumes and all about and around the soil was spread like an indian shawl with many a gorgeous flower and many a splendid fruit arthur thought of the garden of eden and the isles of the blest and whilst his eyes accustomed to nothing better than our poor english roses were still fixed upon the blazing masses of pomegranate flower and his senses were filled with the sweet scent of orange and magnolia blooms the oxen halted before the portico of a stately building whitewalled and greenshuttered like all madeira houses  then the slaves of the chariot assisted him to descend whilst other slaves of the door bowed him up the steps and he stood in a great cool hall dazzling dark after the brilliancy of the sunlight and here no slave awaited him but the princess of this fair domain none other than mildred carr herself clad all in summer white and with a smile of welcome in her eyes  i am so glad that you have come how do you like madeira do you find it very hot  i have not seen much of it yet but this place is lovely it is like fairyland and i believe that you he added with a bow are the fairy queen  compliments again mr heigham well i was the sleeping beauty last time so one may as well be a queen for a change i wonder what you will call me next  let me see shall we sayan angel  mr heigham stop talking nonsense and come into the drawingroom  he followed her laughing into an apartment that from its noble proportions and beauty might fairly be called magnificent its ceiling was panelled with worked timber and its floor beautifully inlaid with woods of various hue whilst the walls were thickly covered with pictures chiefly seapieces and all by good masters he had however but little time to look about him for a door opened at the further end of the room and admitted the portly person of miss terry arrayed in a gigantic sun hat and a pair of green spectacles she seemed very hot and held in her hand a piece of brown paper inside of which something was violently scratching  ive caught him at last she said though he did avoid me all last year ive caught him  good gracious caught what asked arthur with great interest  what why him that mildred wanted she replied regardless of grammar in her excitement just look at him hes beautiful  thus admonished arthur carefully undid the brown paper and next moment started back with an exclamation and began to dance about with an enormous red beetle grinding its jaws into his finger  oh keep still do pray called miss terry in alarm dont shake him off on any account or we shall lose him for the want of a little patience as i did when he bit my finger last year if youll keep him quite still he wont leave go and ill ring for john to bring the chloroform bottle  arthur feeling that the interests of science were matters of a higher importance than the wellbeing of his finger obeyed her injunction to the letter hanging his arm and the beetle over the back of a chair and looking the picture of silent misery  quite still if you please mr heigham quite still is not the animals tenacity interesting  no doubt to you but i hope your pet beetle is not poisonous for he is gnashing his pincers together inside my finger  never mind we will treat you with caustic presently mildred dont laugh so much but come and look at him hes lovely john please be quick with that chloroform bottle  if this sort of thing happens often i dont think that i should collect beetles from choice at least not large ones groaned arthur  oh dear laughed mrs carr i never saw anything so absurd i dont know which looks most savage you or the beetle  dont make all that noise mildred you will frighten him and if once he flies we shall never catch him in this big room  here fortunately for arthur the servant arrived with the required bottle into which the ferocious insect was triumphantly stoppered by miss terry  i am so much obliged to you mr heigham you are a true collector  for the first and last time mumbled arthur who was sucking his finger  i am infinitely obliged to you too mr heigham said mrs carr as soon as she had recovered from her fit of laughing the beetle is really very rare it is not even in the british museum but come let us go in to luncheon  after that meal was over mrs carr asked her guest which he would like to see her collection of beetles or of mummies  thank you mrs carr i have had enough of beetles for one day so i vote for the mummies  very well will you come agatha  now mildred you know very well that i wont come just think mr heigham i only saw the nasty things once and then they gave me the creeps every night for a fortnight as though those horrid egyptian fellahs werent ugly enough when they were alive without going and making great skin and bone dolls of thempah  agatha persists in believing that my mummies are the bodies of people like she saw in egypt last year  and so they are mildred that last one you got is just like the boy who used to drive my donkey at cairothe one that died you knowi believe they just stuffed him and said that he was an ancient king ancient king indeed and miss terry departed in search for more beetles  now mr heigham you must follow me the museum is not in the house wait i will get a hat  in a minute she returned and led the way across a strip of garden to a detached building with a broad verandah facing the sea scarcely ten feet from this verandah and on the edge of the sheer precipice was built a low wall leaning over which arthur could hear the wavelets lapping against the hollow rock two hundred feet beneath him here they stopped for a moment to look at the vast expanse of ocean glittering in the sunlight like a sea of molten sapphires and heaving as gently as an infants bosom  it is very lovely the sea moves just enough to show that it is only asleep  yes but i like it best when it is awake when it blows a hurricane it is magnificent the whole cliff shakes with the shock of the waves and sometimes the spray drives over in sheets that is when i like to sit here it exhilarates me and makes me feel as though i belonged to the storm and was strong with its strength come let us go in  the entrance to the verandah was from the end that faced the house and to gain it they passed under the boughs of a large magnoliatree going through glass doors that opened outwards into the verandah mrs carr entered a room luxuriously furnished as a boudoir this had apparently no other exit and arthur was beginning to wonder where the museum could be when she took a tiny bramah key from her watchchain and with it opened a door that was papered and painted to match the wall exactly he followed her and found himself in a stone passage dimly lighted from above and sloping downwards that led to a doorway graven in the rock on the model of those to be seen at the entrance of egyptian temples  now mr heigham she said flinging open another door and stepping forward you are about the enter the hall of the dead  he went in and a strange sight met his gaze they were standing in the centre of one side of a vast cave that ran right and left at right angles to the passage the light poured into it in great rays from skylights in the roof and by it he could see that it was hollowed out of the virgin rock and measured some sixty feet or more in length by about forty wide and thirty high down the length of each side of the great chamber ran a line of six polished sphinxes which had been hewn out of the surrounding granite on the model of those at carnac whilst the walls were elaborately painted after the fashion of an egyptian sepulchre here osiris held his dread tribunal on the spirit of the departed here the warrior sped onward in his charging chariot here the harper swept his sounding chords and here again crowned with lotus flowers those whose corpses lay around held their joyous festivals  in the respective centres of each end of the stone chamber a colossus towered in its silent and unearthly grandeur that to the right was a statue of osiris judge of the souls of the dead seated on his judgmentseat and holding in his hand the source and the bentheaded sceptre facing him at the other end of the hall was the effigy of the mighty ramses his broad brow encircled by that kingly symbol which few in the worlds history have worn so proudly and his noble features impressing those who gaze upon them from age to age with a sense of scornful power and melancholy calm such as does not belong to the countenance of the men of their own time and all around under this solemn guardianship each upon a polished slab of marble and enclosed in a case of thick glass lay the corpses of the egyptian dead swathed in numberless wrappings as in their day the true religion that they held was swathed in symbols and in mummeries  here were to be found the highpriest of the mysteries of isis the astronomer whose lore could read the prophecies that are written in the stars the dark magician the renowned warrior the noble the musician with his cymbals by his side the fair maiden who hadso said her cedar coffinboardsdied of love and sorrow and the royal babe all sleeping the same sleep and waiting the same awakening this princess must have been well known to joseph that may have been her who rescued moses from the waters whilst the babe belongs to a dynasty of which the history was already merging into tradition when the great pyramid reared its head on egypts fertile plains  arthur stood awed at the wonderful sight  never before said he in that whisper which we involuntarily use in the presence of the dead did i realize my own insignificance  the thought was abruptly put but the words represented well what was passing in his mind what must pass in the mind of any man of culture and sensibility when he gazes on such a sight for in such presences the human mite of today fluttering in the sun and walking on the earth that these have known and walked four thousand years ago must indeed learn how infinitely small is the place that he occupies in the tale of things created and yet if to his culture and sensibility he adds religion a word of living hope hovers on those dumb lips for where are the spirits of those that lie before him in their eternal silence answer withered lips and tell us what judgment has osiris given and what has thoth written in his awful book four thousand years old human husk if thy dead carcass can last so long what limit is there to the life of the soul it held  did you collect all these asked arthur when he had made a superficial examination of the almost countless treasures of the museum  oh no mr carr spent half his long life and more money than i can tell you in getting this collection together it was the passion of his life and he had this cave hollowed at enormous cost because he thought that the air here would be less likely to injure them than the english fogs i have added to it however i got those papyri and that beautiful bust of berenice the one in black marble did you ever see such hair  arthur thought to himself that he had at that moment some not far from his heart that must be quite as beautiful but he did not say so  look there are some curious things and she opened an airtight case that contained some discoloured grains and a few lumps of shrivelled substance  what are they  this is wheat taken from the inside of a mummy and those are supposed to be hyacinth bulbs they came from the mummycase of that baby prince and i have been told that they would still grow if planted  i can scarcely believe that the principle of life must be extinct  wise people say you know that the principle of life can never become extinct in anything that has once lived though it may change its form but i do not pretend to understand these things however we will settle the question for we will plant one and if it grows i will give the flower to you choose one  arthur took the biggest lump from the case and examined it curiously  i have not much faith in your hyacinth i am sure that it is dead  ah but many things that seem more dead than that have the strangest way of suddenly breaking into life she said with a little sigh give it to me i will have it planted and then with a quick glance upward i wonder if you will be here to see it bloom  i dont think that either of us will see it bloom in this world he answered laughing and took his leave                                 chapter xxxv  had arthur been a little less wrapped up in thoughts of angela and a little more alive to the fact that being engaged or even married to one woman does not necessarily prevent complications arising with another it might have occurred to him to doubt the prudence of the course of life that he was pursuing at madeira and as it is it is impossible to acquit him of showing a want of knowledge of the world amounting almost to folly for he should have known upon general principles that for a man in his position a grizzly bear would have been a safer daily companion than a young and lovely widow and the north pole a more suitable place of residence than madeira but he simply did not think about the matter and as thin ice has a treacherous way of not cracking till it suddenly breaks so outward appearances gave him no indication of his danger  and yet the facts were full of evil promise for as time went on mildred carr fell headlong in love with him there was no particular reason why she should have done so she might have had scores of men handsomer cleverer more distinguished for the asking or rather for the waiting to be asked beyond a certain ability of mind a taking manner and a sympathetic thoughtful face with that tinge of melancholy upon it which women sometimes find dangerously interesting there was nothing so remarkable about arthur that a woman possessing her manifold attractions and opportunities should unsought and without inquiry lavish her affection upon him there is only one satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon which indeed is a very common one and that is that he was her fate the one man whom she was to love in the world for no woman worth the name ever loves two however many she may happen to marry for this curious difference would appear to exist between the sexes the man can attach himself though in varying degree to several women in the course of a lifetime whilst the woman the true purehearted woman cannot so adapt her best affection once given like the law of the medes and persians it altereth not  mildred felt when her eyes first met arthurs in donald curries office that this man was for her different from all other men though she did not put the thought in words even to herself and from that hour till she embarked on board the boat he was continually in her mind a fact which so irritated her that she nearly missed the steamer on purpose only changing her mind at the last moment and then when she had helped him to carry miss terry to her cabin their hands had accidentally met and the contact had sent a thrill through her frame such as she had never felt before the next development that she could trace was her jealousy of the blackeyed girl whom she saw him helping about the deck and her consequent rudeness  up to her present age mildred carr had never known a single touch of love she had not even felt particularly interested in her numerous admirers but now this marble galatea had by some freak of fate found a womans heart awkwardly enough without the semblance of a supplication on the part of him whom she destined to play pygmalion and when she examined herself by the light of the flame thus newly kindled she shrank back dismayed like one who peeps over the crater of a volcano commencing its fiery work she had believed her heart to be callous to all affection of this nature it had seemed as dead as the mummied hyacinth and now it was a living suffering thing and all alight with love she had tasted of a new wine and it burnt her and was bitter sweet and yet she longed for more and thus by slow and sad degrees she learnt that her life which had for thirty years flowed on its quiet way unshadowed by loves wing must henceforth own his dominion and be a slave to his sorrows and caprices no wonder that she grew afraid  but mildred was a woman of keen insight into character and it did not require that her powers of observation should be sharpened by the condition of her affections to show her that however deeply she might be in love with arthur heigham he was not one little bit in love with her knowing the almost irresistible strength of her own beauty and attractions she quickly came to the conclusionand it was one that sent a cold chill through herthat there must be some other woman blocking the path to his heart for some reason or other arthur had never spoken to her of angela either because a man very rarely volunteers information to a woman concerning his existing relationship with another of her sex knowing that to do so would be to depreciate his value in her eyes or from an instinctive knowledge that the subject would not be an agreeable one or perhaps because the whole matter was too sacred to him but she on her part was determined to probe his secret to the bottom so one sleepy afternoon when they were sitting on the museum verandah about six weeks after the date of their arrival in the island she took her opportunity  mildred was sitting or rather half lying in a canework chair gazing out over the peaceful sea and arthur looking at her thought what a lovely woman she was and wondered what it was that had made her face and eyes so much softer and more attractive of late miss terry was also there complaining of the heat but presently she moved off after an imaginary beetle and they were alone  oh bytheby mr heigham mildred said presently i was going to ask you a question if only i can remember what it is  try to remember what it is about shoes sealingwax cabbages or kings does it come under any of those heads  ah i remember now if you had added queens you would not have been far out what i wanted to ask you and she turned her large brown eyes full upon him and yawned slightly dear me agatha is right it is hot  well i am waiting to give you any information in my power  oh to be sure the question well it is a very simple one who are you engaged to  arthur nearly sprang off his chair with astonishment  what makes you think that i am engaged he asked  she broke into a merry peal of laughter ah if he could have known what that laugh cost her  what makes me think that you are engaged she answered in a tone of raillery why of course you would have been at my feet long ago if it had not been so come dont be reticent i shall not laugh at you what is she like generally a womans first question about a rival is she as goodlookingwell as i am sayfor though you may not think it i have been thought goodlooking  she is quite different from you she is very tall and fair like an angel in a picture you know  oh then there is a she and a she like an angel very different indeed from me i should think how nicely i caught you out and she laughed again  why did you want to catch me out said arthur on whose ear mrs carrs tone jarred he could not tell why  feminine curiosity and a natural anxiety to fathom the reasons of your sighs that is all but never mind mr heigham you and i shall not quarrel because you are engaged to be married you shall tell me the story when you like for i am sure there is a storyno not this afternoon the sun has given me a headache and i am going to sleep it off other peoples lovestories are very interesting to me the more so because i have reached the respectable age of thirty without being the subject of one myself and again she laughed this time at her own falsehood but when he had gone there was no laughter in her eyes nothing but tears bitter burning tears  agatha said mildred that evening i am sick of this place i want to go to the isle of wight it must be quite nice there now we will go by the next currie boat  my dear mildred replied miss terry aghast if you were going back so soon why did you not leave me behind you and just as we were getting so nicely settled here too and i shall be so sorry to say goodbye to that young heigham he is such a nice young man why dont you marry him i really thought you liked him but perhaps he is coming to the isle of wight too oh that dreadful bay  mildred winced at miss terrys allusions to arthur of whom that lady had grown extremely fond  i am very sorry dear she said hastily but i am bored to death and it is such a bad insect year so really you must begin to pack up  miss terry began to pack accordingly but when next she alluded to the subject of their departure mildred affected surprise and asked her what she meant the astonished agatha referred her to her own words and was met by a laughing disclaimer  why you surely did not think that i was in earnest did you i was only a little cross  well really mildred youve got so strange lately that i never know when you are in earnest and when you are not though for my part i am very glad to stay in peace and quiet  strange grown strange have i said mrs carr looking dreamily out of a window that commanded the carriagedrive with her hands crossed behind her yes i think that you are right i think that i have lost the old mildred somewhere or other and picked up a new one whom i dont understand  ah indeed remarked miss terry in the most matteroffact way without having the faintest idea of what her friend was driving at  how it rains i suppose that he wont come today  he whos he  why how stupid you are mr heigham of course  so you always mean him when you say he  yes of course i do if it isnt ungrammatical it is miserable this afternoon i feel wretched why actually here he comes and she tore off like a schoolgirl into the hall to meet him  ah indeed again remarked miss terry solemnly to the empty walls i am not such a fool as i look i suppose that mr heigham wouldnt come to the isle of wight  it is perhaps needless to say that mrs carr had never been more in earnest in her life than when she announced her intention of departing to the isle of wight the discovery that her suspicions about arthur had but too sure a foundation had been a crushing blow to her hopes and she had formed a wise resolution to see no more of him happy would it have been for her if she could have found the moral courage to act up to it and go away a wiser if a sadder woman but this was not to be the more she contemplated it the more did her passion which was now both wild and deeptake hold upon her heart eating into it like acid into steel and graving one name there in ineffaceable letters she could not bear the thought of parting from him and felt or thought she felt that her happiness was already too deeply pledged to allow her to throw up the cards without an effort  fortune favours the brave perhaps after all it would declare itself for her she was modest in her aspirations she did not expect that he would ever give her the love he bore this other woman she only asked to live in the sunlight of his presence and would be glad to take him at his own price or indeed at any price man she knew is by nature as unstable as water and will mostly melt beneath the eyes of more women than one as readily as ice before a fire when the sun has hid his face yes she would play the game out she would not throw away her lifes happiness without an effort after all matters might have been worse he might have been actually married  but she knew that her hand was a difficult one to lead from though she also knew that she held the great trumpsunusual beauty practically unlimited wealth and considerable fascination of manner her part must be to attract without repelling charm without alarming fascinate by slow degrees till at length he was involved in a net from which there was no escape and above all never to allow him to suspect her motives till the ripe moment came it was a hard task for a proud woman to set herself and in a manner she was proud but alas with the best of us when love comes in at the door pride reason and sometimes honour fly out the window  and so miss terry heard no more talk of the isle of wight  thenceforward under the frank and open guise of friendship mildred contrived to keep arthur continually at her side she did more she drew from him all the history of his engagement to angela and listened with words of sympathy on her lips and wrath and bitter jealousy in her heart to his enraptured descriptions of her rivals beauty and perfections so benighted was he indeed that once he went so far as to suggest that he should when he and angela were married come to madeira to spend their honeymoon and dilated on the pleasant trips which they three might take together  truly thought mildred to herself that would be delightful once too he even showed her a tress of angelas hair and strange to say she found that there still lingered in her bosom a sufficient measure of vulgar first principles to cause her to long to snatch it from him and throw it into the sea but as it was she smiled faintly and admired openly and then went to the glass to look at her own nut brown tresses never had she been so dissatisfied with them and yet her hair was considered lovely and an aesthetic hairdresser had once called it a poem  blind fool she muttered stamping her little foot upon the floor why does he torture me so  mildred forgot that all love is blind and that none was ever blinder or more headstrong than her own  and so this second calypso of a lovely isle set herself almost as unblushingly as her prototype to get our very unheroic ulysses into her toils and penelope poor penelope she sat at home and span and defied her wouldbe lovers  but as yet ulyssesi mean arthurwas conscious of none of those things he was by nature an easygoing young gentleman who took matters as he found them and asked no questions and he found them very pleasant at madeira or rather at the quinta carr for he did everything except sleep there within its precincts he was everywhere surrounded with that atmosphere of subtle and refined flattery flattery addressed chiefly to the intellect that is one of the most effective weapons of a clever woman soon the drawingroom tables were loaded with his favourite books and no songs but such as he approved were ordered from london  he discovered one evening for instance that mildred looked best at night in black and silver and next morning mr worth received a telegram requesting him to forward without delay a large consignment of dresses in which those colours predominated  on another occasion he casually threw out a suggestion about the erection of a terrace in the garden and shortly afterwards was surprised to find a small army of portuguese labourers engaged upon the work he had made this suggestion in total ignorance of the science of garden engineering and its execution necessitated the removal of vast quantities of soil and the blasting of many tons of rock the contractor employed by mrs carr pointed out how the terrace could be made equally well at a fifth of the expense but it did not happen to take exactly the direction that arthur had indicated so she would have none of it his word was law and because he had spoken the whole place was for a month overrun with dirty labourers whilst to the great detriment of miss terrys remaining nerves and even to the slight discomfort of his royal highness himself the air resounded all day long with the terrific bangs of the blasting powder  but so long as he was pleased with the progress of the improvement mildred felt no discomfort nor would she allow any one else to express any it even aggravated her to see miss terry put her hands to her head and jump whenever a particularly large piece of ordnance was discharged and she would vow that it must be affectation because she never even noticed it  in short mildred carr possessed to an extraordinary degree that faculty for blind unreasoning adoration which is so characteristic of the sex an adoration that is at once magnificent in the entirety of its own selfsacrifice and extremely selfish when she thought that she could please arthur the state of agathas nerves became a matter of supreme indifference to her and in the same way had she been an absolute monarch she would have spent the lives of thousands and shaken empires till thrones came tumbling down like apples in the wind if she had believed that she could thereby advance herself in his affections  but as it never occurred to arthur that mrs carr might be in love with him he saw nothing abnormal about all this not that he was conceited for nobody was ever less so but it is wonderful what an amount of flattery and attention men will accept from women as their simple right if the other sex possesses the faculty of admiration we in compensation are perfectly endowed with that of receiving it with careless ease and when we fall in with some goddess who is foolish enough to worship us and to whom we should be on our knees we merely label her sympathetic and say that she understands us  from all of which wise reflections the reader will gather that our friend arthur was not a hundred miles off an awkward situation                                chapter xxxvi  one day some three weeks after arthur had gone angela strolled down the tunnel walk now in the height of summer almost dark with the shade of the limetrees and settled herself on one of the stone seats under caresfoots staff  she had a book in hand but it soon became clear that she had come to this secluded spot to think rather than read for it fell unopened from her hand and her grey eyes were full of a faroff look as they gazed across the lake glittering in the sunlight away towards the hazy purple outline of the distant hills her face was quite calm but it was not that of a happy person indeed it gave a distinct idea of mental suffering all grief however acute is subject to fixed gradations and angela was yet in the second stage first there is the acute stage when the heart aches with a physical pain and the mind filled with a wild yearning or tortured by an unceasing anxiety well nigh gives beneath the abnormal strain this does not last long or it would kill or drive us to the madhouse then comes that long epoch of dull misery enduring till at last kindly nature in pity rubs off the rough extremes of our calamity and by slow but sure degrees softens agony into sorrow  this was what she was now passing through andas all highly organized natures like her own are especially in youth very sensitive to those more exquisite vibrations of pain and happiness that leave minds of a coarser fibre comparatively unmovedit may be taken for granted that she was suffering sufficiently acutely  perhaps she had never quite realized how necessary arthur had become to her how deep his love had sent its fibres into her heart and inner self until he was violently wrenched away from her and she lost all sight and knowledge of him in the darkness of the outside world still she had made no show of her sorrow but once when pigott told her some pathetic story of the death of a little child in the village she burst into a paroxysm of weeping the pity for anothers pain had loosed the floodgates of her own but it was a performance that she did not repeat  but angela had her anxieties as well as her griefs and it was over these former that she was thinking as she sat on the great stone under the oak love is a wonderful quickener of the perceptions and ignorant as she was of all the worlds ways the more she thought over the terms imposed by her father upon her engagement the more distrustful did she grow lady bellamy too had been to see her twice and on each occasion had inspired her with a lively sense of fear and repugnance during the first of these visits she had shown a perfect acquaintance with the circumstances of her engagement her flirtation with mr heigham as she was pleased to call it during the second call too she had been full of strange remarks about her cousin george talking mysteriously of a change that had come over him since his illness and of his being under a new influence nor was this all for on the very next day when she was out walking with pigott in the village she had met george himself and he had insisted upon entering into a long rambling conversation with her and on looking at her in a way that made her feel perfectly sick  oh aleck she said aloud to the dog that was sitting by her side with his head upon her knee for he was now her constant companion i wonder where your master is your master and mine aleck would to god that he were back here to protect me for i am growing afraid i dont know of what aleck and there are eleven long silent months to wait at this moment the dog raised his head listened and sprang round with an angry woof angela rose up with a flash of hope in her eyes turned and faced george caresfoot  he was still pale and shrivelled from the effects of his illness but otherwise little changed except that the lightblue eyes glittered with a fierce determination and that the features had attained that fixity and strength which sometimes come to those who are bent heart and soul upon an enterprise be it good or evil  so i have found you out at last cousin angela what are you not going to shake hands with me  angela touched his fingers with her own  my father is not here she said  thank you my dear cousin but i did not come to see your father of whom i have seen plenty in the course of my life and shall doubtless see more i came to see you of whom i can never see enough  i dont understand you said angela defiantly folding her arms across her bosom and looking him full in the face with fearless eyes for her instinct warned her that she was in danger and also that whatever she might feel she must not show that she was afraid  i shall hope to make you do so before long he replied with a meaning glance but you are not very polite you know you do not offer me a seat  i beg your pardon i did not know that you wanted to sit down i can only offer you a choice of those stones  then call that brute away and i will sit down  the dog is not a brute as you mean it but i should not speak of him like that if i were you he is sensible as a human being and might resent it  angela knew that george was a coward about dogs and at that moment as though to confirm her words aleck growled slightly  ah indeed well he is certainly a handsome dog and he sat down suspiciously wont you come and sit down  thank you i prefer to stand  do you know what you look like standing there with your arms crossed you look like an angry goddess  if you mean that seriously i dont understand you if it is a compliment i dont like compliments  you are not very friendly said george whose temper was fast getting the better of him  i am sorry i do not wish to be unfriendly  so i hear that my ward has been staying here whilst i was ill  yes he was staying here  and i am also told that there was some boyandgirl love affair between you i suppose that he indulged in a flirtation to wile away the time  angela turned upon him too angry to speak  well you need not look at me like that you surely never expect to see him again do you  if we both live i shall certainly see him again indeed i shall in any case  you will never see him again  why not  because he was only flirting and playing the fool with you he is a notorious flirt and to my certain knowledge has been engaged to two women before  i do not believe that that is true or if it is true it is not all the truth but true or untrue i am not going to discuss mr heigham with you or allow myself to be influenced by stories told behind his back  angela said george rising and seizing her hand  she turned quite pale and a shudder passed over her frame  leave my hand alone and never dare to touch me again this is the second time that you have tried to insult me  so answered george furious with outraged pride and baffled passion you set up your will against mine do you very well you shall see i will crush you to powder insult you indeed how often did that young blackguard insult you i warrant he did more than take your hand  if answered angela you mean mr heigham i shall leave you to consider whether that term is not more applicable to the person who does his best to outrage an unprotected woman and take advantage of the absent than to the gentleman against whom you have used it and darting on him one glance of supreme contempt she swept away like an angry queen  left to his meditations george shook his fist towards where she had vanished  very well my fine lady very well he said aloud you treat me as so much dirt do you you shall smart for this so sure as my name is george caresfoot only wait till you are in my power and you shall learn that i was never yet defied with impunity oh and you shall learn many other things also  from that time forward angela was for a period of two months or more subjected to an organized persecution as harassing as it was cruel george waylaid her everywhere and twice actually succeeded in entering into conversation with her but on both occasions she managed to escape from him before he could proceed any further so persistently did he hunt her that at last the wretched girl was driven to hide herself away in odd corners of the house and woods in order to keep out of his way then he took to writing her letters and sending handsome presents all of which she returned  poor angela it was hard both to lose her lover and to suffer daily from the persecutions of her hateful cousin which were now pushed forward so openly and with such pertinacity as to fill her with vague alarm what made her position worse was that she had no one in whom to confide for mr fraser had not yet returned pigott indeed knew more or less what was going on but she could do nothing except bewail arthurs absence and tell her not to mind there remained her father but with him she had never been on sufficiently intimate terms for confidence indeed as time went on the suspicion gathered strength in her mind that he was privy to georges advances and that those advances had something to do with the harsh terms imposed upon arthur and herself but at last matters grew so bad that having no other refuge she determined to appeal to him for protection  father she said boldly one day to philip as he was sitting writing in his study my cousin george is persecuting me every day i have borne it as long as i can but i can bear it no longer i have come to ask you to protect me from him  why angela i should have thought that you were perfectly capable of protecting yourself what is he persecuting you about what does he want  to marry me i suppose answered angela blushing to her eyes  well that is a very complimentary wish on his part and i can tell you what it is angela if only you could get that young heigham out of your head you might do a deal worse  it is quite useless to talk to me like that she answered coldly  well that is your affair but it is very ridiculous of you to come and ask me to protect you the woman must indeed be a fool who cannot protect herself  and so the interview ended  next day lady bellamy called again  my dear child she said to angela you are not looking well this business worries you no doubt it is the old struggle between duty and inclination that we have most of us gone through well there is one consolation nobody who ever did his or her duty regardless of inclination ever regretted it in the end  what do you mean lady bellamy when you talk about my duty  i mean the plain duty that lies before you of marrying your cousin george and of throwing up this young heigham  i recognize no such duty  my dear angela do look at the matter from a sensible point of view think what a good thing it would be for your father and remember too that it would reunite all the property if ever a girl had a clear duty to perform you have  since you insist so much upon my duty i must say that it seems to me that an honest girl in my position has three duties to consider and not one as you say lady bellamy first there is her duty to the man she loves for her the greatest duty of any in the world next her duty to herself for her happiness and selfrespect are involved in her decision and lastly her duty to her family i put the family last because after all it is she who gets married not her family  lady bellamy smiled a little  you argue well but there is one thing that you overlook though i am sorry to have to pain you by saying it young mr heigham is no better than he should be i have made inquiries about him and think that i ought to tell you that  what do you mean  i mean that his life young as he is has not been so creditable as it might have been he has been the hero of one or two little affairs i can tell you about them if you like  lady bellamy your stories are either true or untrue if true i should take no notice of them because they must have happened before he loved me if untrue they would be a mere waste of breath so i think that we may dispense with the storiesthey would influence me no more than the hum of next summers gnats  lady bellamy smiled again  you are a curious woman she said but supposing that there were to be a repetition of these little stories after he loved you what would you say then  angela looked troubled and thought awhile  he could never go far from me she answered  what do you mean  i mean that i hold the strings of his heart in my hands and i have only to lift them to draw him back to meso no other woman no living force can keep him from me if i choose to bid him come  supposing that to be so how about the selfrespect you spoke of just now could you bear to take your lover back from the hands of another woman  that would entirely depend upon the circumstances and upon what was just to the other woman  you would not then throw him up without question  lady bellamy i may be very ignorant and simple but i am neither mad nor a fool what do you suppose that my life would be worth to me if i threw arthur up if i remained single it would be an aching void as it is now and if i married any other man whilst he still lived it would become a daily and shameful humiliation such as i had rather die than endure  lady bellamy glanced up from under her heavylidded eyes a thought had evidently struck her but she did not express it  then i am to tell your cousin george that you will have absolutely nothing to do with him  yes and beg him to cease persecuting me it is quite useless if there were no arthur and no other man in the world i would not marry him i detest himi cannot tell you how i detest him  it is amusing to hear you talk so and to think that you will certainly be mrs george caresfoot within nine months  never answered angela passionately stamping her foot upon the floor what makes you say such horrible things  i reflect answered lady bellamy with an ominous smile that george caresfoot has made up his mind to marry you and that i have made up mine to help him to do so and that your will strong as it certainly is is as compared with our united wills what a straw is to a gale the straw cannot travel against the wind it must go with it and you must marry george caresfoot you will as certainly come to the altarrails with him as you will to your deathbed it is written in your face goodbye  for the first time angelas courage really gave way as she heard these dreadful words she remembered how she herself had called lady bellamy an embodiment of the spirit of power and now she felt that the comparison was just the woman was power incarnate and her words which from anybody else she would have laughed at sent a cold chill through her  she is a fine creature both in mind and body reflected lady bellamy as she stepped into her carriage really though i try to hate her i can find it in my heart to be sorry for her indeed i am not sure that i do not like her certainly i respect her but she has come in my path and must be crushedmy own safety demands it at least she is worth crushing and the game is fair for perhaps she will crush me i should not be surprised there is a judgment in those grey eyes of hersqui vivra verra home william                                chapter xxxvii  angelas appeal for protection set philip thinking  as the reader is aware his sole motive in consenting to become as it were a sleeping partner in the shameful plot of which his innocent daughter was the object was to obtain possession of his lost inheritance and it now occurred to him that even should that plot succeed which he very greatly doubted nothing had as yet been settled as to the terms upon which it was to be reconveyed to him the whole affair was excessively repugnant to him indeed he regarded the prospect of its success with little less than terror only his greed overmastered his fear  but on one point he was very clear it should not succeed except upon the very best of terms for himself his daughter should not be sacrificed unless the price paid for the victim was positively princely such guilt was not to be incurred for a bagatelle if george married angela the isleworth estates must pass back into his hands for a very low sum indeed but would his cousin be willing to accept such a sum that was the rub and that too was what must be made clear without any further delay he had no wish to see angela put to needless suffering suffering which would not bring an equivalent with it and which might on the contrary entail consequences upon himself that he shuddered to think of  curiously enough however he had of late been signally free from his superstitious fears indeed since the night when he had so astonished arthur by his outbreak about the shadows on the wall no fit had come to trouble him and he was beginning to look upon the whole thing as an evil dream a nightmare that he had at last lived down but still the nightmare might return and he was not going to run the risk unless he was very well paid for it and so he determined to offer a price so low for the property that no man in his senses would accept it and then wrote a note to george asking him to come over on the following evening after dinner as he wished to speak to him on a matter of business  there he said to himself that will make an end of the affair and i will get young heigham back and they can be married george can never take what i mean to offer if he should the egyptian will be spoiled indeed and the game will be worth the candle not that i have any responsibility about it however i shall put no pressure on angela she must choose for herself and philip went to bed quite feeling as though he had done a virtuous action  george came punctually enough on the following evening which was that of the day of lady bellamys conversation with angela a conversation which had so upset the latter that she had already gone to her room not knowing anything of her cousins proposed visit  the night was one of those dreadfully oppressive ones that sometimes visit us in the course of an english summer the day had been hot and sultry and with the fall of the evening the little breeze that stirred in the thunderladen air had died away leaving the temperature at much the same point that is to be expected in a tropical valley and rendering the heat of the house almost unbearable  how do you do george said philip hot isnt it  yes there will be a tempest soon  not before midnight i think shall we go and walk down by the lake it will be cooler there and we shall be quite undisturbed walls have ears sometimes you know  very well but where is angela  i met her on the stairs just now and she said that she was going to bedgot a headache i believe shall we start  so soon as they were well away from the house philip broke the ice  some months back i had a conversation with lady bellamy on the subject of a proposal that you made to me through her for angelas hand it is about that i wish to speak to you now first i must ask if you still wish to go on with the business  certainly i wish it more than ever  well as i intimated to lady bellamy i do not at all approve of your suit angela is already subject to my consent very suitably engaged to your late ward a young fellow whom whatever you may think about him i like very much and i can assure you that it will require the very strongest inducements to make me even allow such a thing in any case i will have nothing to do with influencing angela she is a perfectly free agent  which means i suppose that you intend to screw down the price  in wanting to marry angela went on philip you must remember that you fly high she is a very lovely woman and what is more will some day or other be exceedingly well off whilst youyou must excuse me for being candid but this is a mere matter of business and i am only talking of you in the light of a possible soninlawyou are a middleaged man not prepossessing in appearance broken in health and however well you may have kept up your reputation in these parts as you and i well know without a single shred of character left altogether not a man to who a father would marry his daughter of his own free will or one with whom a young girl is likely to find happiness  you draw a flattering picture of me i must say  not at all only a true one  well if i am all you say how is it that you are prepared to allow your daughter to marry me at all  i will tell you because the rights of property should take precedence of the interests of a single individual because my father and you between you cozened me out of my lawful own and this is the only way that i see of coming by it again  what does it matter in any case after your death the land will come back to angela and her children  no george it will not if ever the isleworth estates come into my hands they shall not pass again to any child of yours  what would you do with them then  marry and get children of my own  george whistled  well i must say that your intentions are amiable but you have not got the estates yet my dear cousin  no and never shall have most likely but let us come to the point although i do not approve of your advances i am willing to waive my objections and accept you as a soninlaw if you can win angelas consent provided that before the marriage you consent to give me clear transfer at a price of all the isleworth estates with the exception of the mansion and the pleasuregrounds  very good but now about the price that is the real point  they had taken a path that ran down through the shrubberies to the side of the lake and then turned up towards caresfoots staff before answering georges remark philip proposed that they should sit down and suiting the action to the word placed himself upon the trunk of a fallen tree that lay by the waters edge just outside the spread of the branches of the great oak and commanding a view of the area beneath them  the moon will come out again presently he said when george had followed his example she has got behind that thundercloud ah as a bright flash of lightning passed from heaven to earth i thought that we should get a storm it will be here in half an hour  all this philip said to gain time he had not quite made up his mind what price to offer  never mind the lightning what do you offer for the property inclusive of timber and with all improvementsjust as it stands in short  one hundred thousand pounds cash said philip deliberately  george sprang from his seat and sat down again before he answered  do you think that i am drunk or a fool that you come to me with such a ridiculous offer why the probate valuation was two hundred thousand and that was very low  i offer one hundred thousand and am willing to settle thirty thousand absolutely on the girl should she marry you and twenty thousand more on my death that is my offertake it or leave it  talk sense man your terms are preposterous  i tell you that preposterous or not i will not go beyond them if you dont like them well and good leave them alone and ill put myself in communication with young heigham tomorrow and tell him that he can come and marry the girl as soon as he likes for my part i am very glad to have the business settled  you ask me to sacrifice half my property groaned george  my property you mean that you stole but i dont ask you to do anything one way or the other i am to understand that you refuse my offer  give me a minute to think and george hid his face in his hand and philip looking at him with hatred gleaming in his dark eyes muttered between his teeth  i believe that my turn has come at last  when some thirty seconds had passed in silence the attention of the pair was attracted by the cracking of dead leaves that sounded quite startling in the intense stillness of the night and next second a tall figure in white glided up to the waters edge and stood still within half a dozen paces of them  involuntarily philip gripped his cousins arm but neither of them moved the sky had rapidly clouded up and the faint light that struggled from the moon only served to show that the figure appeared to be lifting its arms in another second that was gone too and the place was totally dark  wait till the moon comes out and we shall see what it is whispered george and as he spoke there came from the direction of the figure a rustling sound as of falling garments  what can it be whispered philip  they were not left long in doubt for at that instant a vivid flash from the thundercloud turned the darkness into the most brilliant day and revealed a woman standing up to her knees in the water with her arms lifted knotting her long hair it was angela for one moment the fierce light shone upon the stately form that gleamed whiter than ivorywhite as snow against the dense background of the brushwood and as it passed they heard her sink into the water softly as a swan and strike out with steady strokes towards the centre of the lake  it is only angela said philip when the sound of the strokes grew faint phew what a state she gave me  is she safe asked george in a husky voice hadnt i better get a boat  she needs no help from you she is quite capable of looking after herself especially in the water i can tell you philip answered sharply  nothing more was said till they reached the house when on entering the lighted study philip noticed that his cousins face was flushed and his hands shaking like aspen leaves  why what is the matter with you man he asked  nothingnothing i am only rather cold give me some brandy  cold on such a night as this thats curious said philip as he got the spirit from a cupboard  george drank about a wineglassful neat and seemed to recover himself  i accept your offer for the land philip he said presently  his cousin looked at him curiously and a brilliant idea struck him  you agree then to take fifty thousand pounds for the isleworth estates in the event of your marrying my daughter the sale to be completed before the marriage takes place  fifty thousand no a hundred thousandyou said a hundred thousand just now  you must have misunderstood me or i must have made a mistake what i meant is fifty thousand and you to put a thousand down as earnest moneyto be forfeited whether the affair comes off or not  george ground his teeth and clutched at his red hair proceedings that his cousin watched with a great deal of quiet enjoyment when at length he spoke it was in a low hoarse voice quite unlike his usual hard tones  damn you he said you have me at your mercy take the land for the money if you like though it will nearly ruin me that woman has turned my head i must marry her or i shall go mad  very good that is your affair remember that i have no responsibility in the matter and that i am not going to put any pressure on angela if you want to marry her you must win her within the next eight months then that is settled i suppose that you will pay in the thousand tomorrow the storm is coming up fast so i wont keep you good night and they separated george to drive homewith fever in his heart and the thunderstorm of which he heard nothing rattling round himand philip to make his way to bed with the dream of his life advanced a step nearer realization  that was a lucky swim of angelas tonight he thought fifty thousand pounds for the estate he is right he must be going mad but will he get her to marry him i wonder if he does i shall cry quits with him indeed                               chapter xxxviii  george had spoken no falsehood when he said that he felt as though he must marry angela or go mad indeed it is a striking proof of how necessary he thought that step to be to his happiness that he had been willing to consent to his cousins shylocklike terms about the sale of the property although they would in their result degrade him from his position as a large landed proprietor and make a comparatively poor man of him the danger or suffering that could induce a caresfoot to half ruin himself with his eyes open had need to be of an extraordinarily pressing nature  loves empire is this globe and all mankind the most refined and the most degraded the cleverest and the most stupid are all liable to become his faithful subjects he can alike command the devotion of an archbishop and a southsea islander of the most immaculate maiden lady whatever her age and of the savage zulu girl from the pole to the equator and from the equator to the further pole there is no monarch like love where he sets his foot the rocks bloom with flowers or the garden becomes a wilderness according to his good will and pleasure and at his whisper all other allegiances melt away like ropes of mud he is the real arbiter of the destinies of the world  but to each nature of all the millions beneath his sway love comes in a fitting guise to some as an angel messenger telling of sympathy and peace and a strange new hope to others draped in sad robes indeed but still divine thus when he visits such a one as george caresfoot it is as a potent fiend whose mission is to enter through mans lower nature to torture and destroy to scorch the heart with fearful heats and then to crush it and leave its owners bosom choked with bitter dust  and so far as george is concerned there is no doubt but what the work was done right well for under the influence of what is with doubtful propriety known as the tender passion that estimable character was rapidly drifting within a measurable distance of a lunatic asylum the checks and repulses that he had met with instead of cooling his ardour had only the effect of inflaming it to an extraordinary degree angelas scornful dislike as water thrown upon burning oil did but diffuse the flames of his passion throughout the whole system of his mind till he grew wild with its heat and violence her glorious beauty daily took a still stronger hold upon his imagination till it scorched into his very soul for whole nights he could not sleep for whole days he would scarcely eat or do anything but walk walk walk and try to devise means to win her to his side the irritation of the mind produced its natural effects upon his conduct and he would burst into fits of the most causeless fury in one of these he dismissed every servant in the house and so evil was his reputation among that class that he had great difficulty in obtaining others to take their place in another he hurled a heavy pot containing an azaleabush at the head of one of the gardeners and had to compromise an action for assault in short the lunatic asylum loomed very near indeed  for a week or so after the memorable night of his interview with philip an interview that he at least would never forget george was quite unable try as he would to get a single word with angela  at last one day when he was driving by a seldomused road past the fields near the abbey house on his way from roxham chance gave him the opportunity that he had for so long sought without success for far up a bylane that led to a turnipfield his eye caught sight of the flutter of a grey dress vanishing round a corner something in the make of which suggested to him that angela was its wearer giving the reins to the servant and bidding him drive on home he got out of the dogcart and hurried up the grassy track and on turning the corner came suddenly upon the object of his search she was standing on the bank of the hedgerow and struggling with a bough of honeysuckle from which she wished to pluck its last remaining autumn bloom so engaged was she that she did not hear his step and it was not until his hard voice grated on her ear that she knew that she was trapped  caught at last you have given me a pretty hunt angela  the violent start she gave effectually carried out her purpose as regards the honeysuckle which snapped in two under the strain of her backward jerk and she turned round upon him panting with fear and exertion the flowery bough grasped within her hand  am i then a wild creature that you should hunt me so  yes you are the loveliest and the wildest of creatures and now i have caught you you must listen to me  i will not listen to you you have nothing to say to me that can interest me i will not listen to you  george laughed a littlea threatening nervous laugh  i am accustomed to have my own way angela and i am not going to give it up now you must and you shall listen i have got my opportunity at last and i mean to use it i am sorry to have to speak so roughly but you have only yourself to thank you have driven me to it  his determination frightened her and she took refuge in an armour of calm and freezing contempt  i dont understand you she said  on the contrary you understand me very well you always avoid me i can never see you try how i will perhaps he went on still talking quite quietly if you knew what a hell there is in my heart and brain you would not treat me so i tell you that i am in torture and the muscles of the pallid face twitched in a way that went far to confirm his words  i do not understand your meaning unless indeed you are trying to frighten and insult me as you have done before answered angela  poor girl she did not know what else to say she was not of a nervous disposition but there was something about georges manner that alarmed her very much and she glanced anxiously around to see if any one was within call but the place was lonely as the grave  there is no need for you to look for help i wish neither to frighten nor insult you my suit is an honourable one enough i wish you to promise to marry me that is all you must and shall promise it i will take no refusal you were made for me and i for you it is quite useless for you to resist me for you must marry me at last i love you and by that right you belong to me i love youi love you  youlovemeyou  yes i do and why should you look at me like that i cannot help it you are so beautiful if you knew your loveliness you would understand me i love those grey eyes of yours even when they flash and burn as they do now ah they shall look softly at me yet and those sweet lips that curl so scornfully shall shape themselves to kiss me listen i loved you when i first saw you there in the drawingroom at isleworth i loved you more and more all the time that i was ill and now i love you to madness so you see angela you must marry me soon  i marry you  oh dont say you wont for gods sake dont say you wont said george with a sudden change of manner from the confident to the supplicatory look i beg you not to on my knees and he actually flung himself down on the grass roadway and grovelled before her in an abandonment of passion hideous to behold  she turned very pale and answered him in a cold quiet voice every syllable of which fell upon him like the stroke of a knife  such a thing would be quite impossible for many reasons but i need only repeat you one that you are already aware of i am engaged to mr heigham  bah that is nothing i know that but you will not throw away such a love as i have to offer for the wavering affection of a boy we can soon get rid of him write and tell him that you have changed your mind listen angela he went on catching her by the skirt of her dress he is not rich he has only got enough for a bare living i have five times the money and you shall help to spend it dont marry a young beggar like that you wont get value for yourself it will pay you ever so much better to marry me  george was convinced from his experience of the sex that every woman could be bought if only you bid high enough but as the sequel showed he could not well have used a worse argument to a person like angela or one more likely to excite the indignation that fear of him together with a certain respect for the evident genuineness of his suffering had hitherto kept in suppression she wrenched her dress free from him leaving a portion of its fabric in his hand  are you not ashamed she said her voice trembling with indignation and her eyes filled with angry tears are you not ashamed to talk to me like this you my own fathers cousin and yourself old enough to be my father i tell you that my love is already given which would have been a sufficient answer to any gentleman and you reply by saying that you are richer than the man i love do you believe that a woman thinks of nothing but money or do you suppose that i am to be bought like a beast at the market get up from the ground for since your brutality forces me to speak so plainly in my own defence i must tell you once and for all that you will get nothing by kneeling to me listen i would rather die than be your wife rather than always see your face about me i would pass my life in prison i had sooner be touched by a snake than by you you are quite hateful to me now you have your answer and i beg that you will get up and let me pass  drawn up the full height of her majestic stature her face flushed with emotion and her clear eyes flashing scornful fire whilst in her hand she still held the bough of sweet honeysuckle angela formed a strange contrast to the miserable man crouched at her feet swaying himself to and fro and moaning his hat off and his face hidden in his trembling hands  as he would not or could not move she left him there and slipping through a neighbouring gap vanished from sight when she was fairly gone he stirred and having risen and recovered his hat which had fallen off in his excitement his first action was to shake his fist in the direction in which she had vanished his next to frantically kiss the fragment of her dress that he still held in her hand  you shall marry me yet my fine lady he hissed between his teeth and if i do not repay your gentle words with interest my name is not george caresfoot and then staggering like a drunken man he made his way home  oh arthur thought angela as she crept quite broken in spirit to the solitude of her room if i only knew where you were i think that i would follow you promise or no promise there is no one to help me no one they are all in league against meeven my own father                                chapter xxxix  notwithstanding his brave threats made behind angelas back about forcing her to marry him in the teeth of any opposition that she could offer george reached home that night very much disheartened about the whole business how was he to bow the neck of this proud woman to his yoke and break the strong cord of her allegiance to her absent lover with many girls it might have been possible to find a way but angela was not an ordinary girl he had tried and lady bellamy had tried and they had both failed and as for philip he would take no active part in the matter what more could be done only one thing that he could think of he could force lady bellamy to search her finer brains for a fresh expedient acting upon this idea he at once despatched a note to her requesting her to come and see him at isleworth on the following morning  that night passed very ill for the lovelorn george angelas vigorous and imaginative expression of her entire loathing of him had pierced even the thick hide of his selfconceit and left him sore as a whipped hound altogether too sore to sleep when lady bellamy arrived on the following morning she found him marching up and down the diningroom in the worst of his bad tempers and that was a very shocking temper indeed his light blue eyes were angry and bloodshot his general appearance slovenly to the last degree and a red spot burned upon each sallow cheek  well george what is the matter you dont look quite so happy as a lover should  he grunted by way of answer  has the lady been unkind failed to appreciate your advances eh  now look here anne he answered savagely if i have to put up with things from that confounded girl i am not going to stand your jeers so stop them once and for all  it is very evident that she has been unkind supposing that instead of abusing me you tell me the details no doubt they are interesting and she settled herself in a low chair and glanced at him keenly from under her heavy eyelids  thus admonished george proceeded to giver her such a version of his melancholy tale as best suited him needless to say not a full one but his hearers imagination easily supplied the gaps and as he proceeded a slow smile crept over her face as she conjured up the suppressed details of the scene in the lane  curse you what are you laughing at you came here to listen not laugh broke out george furiously when he saw it  she made no answer and he continued his thrilling tale without comment on her part  now he said when it was finished what is to be done  there is nothing to be done you have failed to win her affections and there is an end of the matter  then you mean i must give it up  yes and a very good thing too for the ridiculous arrangement that you have entered into with philip would have halfruined you and you would be tired of the girl in a month  now look you here anne said george in a sort of hiss and standing over her in a threatening attitude i have suspected for some time that you were playing me false in this business and now i am sure of it you have put the girl up to treating me like this you treacherous snake you have struck me from behind you red indian in petticoats but look here i will be square with you you shall not have all the laugh on your side  george you must be mad  you shall see whether i am mad or not did you see what the brigands did to a fellow they caught in greece the other day for whom they wanted ransom first they sent his ear to his friends then his nose then his foot and last of all his headall by post mark you well dear anne that is just how i am going to pay you out you shall have a week to find a fresh plan to trap the bird you have frightened and if you find none first i shall post one of those interesting letters that i have yonder to your husbandanonymously you knownot a very compromising one but one that will pique his curiosity and set him making inquiries then i shall wait another week  lady bellamy could bear it no longer she sprang up from her chair pale with anger  you fiend in human form what is it i wonder that has kept me so long from destroying you and myself too oh you need not laugh i have the means to do it if i choose i have had them for twenty years  george laughed again hoarsely  quite pennydreadful i declare but i dont think you will come to that you would be afraid and if you do i dont much carei am pretty reckless i can tell you  for your threats she went on without heeding him i care nothing for as i tell you i have their antidote at hand you have known me for many years tell me did you ever see my nerve desert me do you suppose that i am a woman who would bear failure when i could choose death no george i had rather pass into eternity on the crest of the wave of my success such as it has been and let it break and grind me to powder there or else bear me to greater heights all that should have been a womans better part in the world you have destroyed in me i do not say that it was altogether your fault for an evil destiny bound me to you and it must seem odd to you when i say that knowing you for what you are i still love you and to fill up this void to trample down those surging memories i have made myself a slave to my ambition and the acquisition of another power that you cannot understand the man you married me to is rich and a knight today i made him so if i live another twenty years his wealth shall be colossal and his influence unbounded and i will be one of the most powerful women in the kingdom why do you suppose that i so fear your treachery do you think that i should mind its being known that i had thrown aside that poor figleaf virtuethe green garment that marks a coward or a fool for mark you all women or nearly all would be vicious if they dared fear and poverty of spirit restrain them not virtue why it is by their vices properly managed that women have always risen and always will rise to be really great i think that a woman must be vicious with discrimination and i respect vice accordingly no it is not that i fear i am afraid because i have a husband whose bitter resentment is justly piling up against me from year to year who only lies in wait for an opportunity to destroy me nor is he my only enemy in his skilful hands the letters you possess can as society is in this country be used so as to make me powerless yes george all the good in me is dead the mad love i have given you is hourly outraged and yet i cannot shake it off there alone my strength fails me and i am weak as a child only the power to exercise my will my sense of command over the dullards round me and a yet keener pleasure you do not know of are left to me if these are taken away what will my life be a void a waste a howling wilderness a place where i will not stay i had rather tempt the unknown even in hell there must be scope for abilities such as mine  she paused awhile as if for an answer and then went on  and as for you poor creature that you are words cannot tell how i despise you you discard me and my devotion to follow a nature in its way it is true greater even than my own representing the principle of good as i represent the principle of evil but one to which yours is utterly abhorrent can you mix light with darkness or filthy oil with water as well hope to merge your life black as it is with every wickedness with that of the splendid creature you would defile do you suppose that a woman such as she will ever be really faithless to her love even though you trap her into marriage fool her heart is as far above you as the stars and without a heart a woman is a husk that none but such miserables as yourself would own but go ondash yourself against a white purity that will in the end blind and destroy you dree your own doom i will find you expedients it is my business to obey you you shall marry her if you will and taste of the judgment that will follow be still i will bear no more of your insolence today and she swept out of the room leaving george looking somewhat scared  when lady bellamy reached rewtham house she went straight to her husbands study he received her with much politeness and asked her to sit down  i have come to consult you on a matter of some importance she said  that is indeed an unusual occurrence answered sir john rubbing his dry hands and smiling  it is not my own affair listen and she gave him a full accurate and clear account of all that had taken place with reference to georges determination to marry angela not omitting the most trivial detail sir john expressed no surprise he was a very old bird was sir john one for whom every net was spread in vain whether in or out of his sight nothing in this world provided that it did not affect his own comfort or safety could affect his bland and appreciative smile he was never surprised once or twice he put a shrewd question to elucidate some point in the narrative and that was all when his wife was finished he said  well anne you have told a very interesting and amusing little history doubly so if you will permit me to say it seeing that it is told of george caresfoot by lady bellamy but it seems that your joint efforts have failed what is it that you wish me to do  i wish to ask you if you can suggest any plan that will not fail you are very cunning in your way and your advice may be good  let me see young heigham is in madeira is he not  i am sure i do not know  but i do and he extracted a notebook from a drawer let me see i think i have an entry somewhere here ah here we are arthur p heigham esq passenger per warwick castle to madeira june 16 copied from passengerlist western daily news his second name is preston is it not lucky i kept that now the thing will be to communicate with madeira and see if he is still there i can easily do that i know a man there  have you formed any plan then  yes answered sir john with great deliberation i think i see my way but i must have time to think of it i will speak to you about it tomorrow  when lady bellamy had gone the little man rose peeped round to see that nobody was within hearing and then rubbing his dry hands with infinite zest said aloud in a voice that was quite solemn in the intensity of its satisfaction  the lord hath delivered mine enemies into mine hand                                  chapter xl  two days after sir john had been taken into confidence philip received a visit from lady bellamy that caused him a good deal of discomfort after talking to him on general subjects for awhile she rose to go  by the way mr caresfoot she said i really had almost forgotten the object of my visit you may remember a conversation we had together some time ago when i was the means of paying a debt owing to you  philip nodded  then you will not have forgotten that one of the articles of our little verbal convention was that if it should be considered to the interest of all the parties concerned your daughters old nurse was not to remain in your house  i remember  well do you know i cannot help thinking that it must be a bad thing for angela to have so much of the society of an illeducated and not very refined person like pigott i really advise you to get rid of her  she has been with me for twenty years and my daughter is devoted to her i cant turn her off  it is always painful to dismiss an old servantalmost as bad as discarding an old dress but when a dress is worn out it must be thrown away surely the same applies to servants  i dont see how i am to send her away  i can quite understand your feelings but then you see an agreement implies obligations on both sides doesnt it especially an agreement for value received as the lawyers say  philip winced perceptibly  i wish i had never had anything to do with your agreements  oh if you think it over i dont think that you will say so well that is settled i suppose she will go pretty soon i am glad to see you looking so wellvery different from your cousin i assure you i dont think much of his state of health goodbye remember me to angela by the way i dont know if you have heard that george has met with a repulse in that direction he does not intend to press matters any more at present but of course the agreement holds all the same nobody knows what the morrow may bring forth  where you and my amiable cousin are concerned i shall be much surprised if it does not bring forth villany thought philip as soon as he heard the front door close i suppose that it must be done about pigott curse that woman with her sorceress face i wish i had never put myself into her power the iron hand can be felt pretty plainly through her velvet glove  life is never altogether clouded over and that morning angelas horizon had been brightened by two big rays of sunshine that came to shed their cheering light on the grey monotony of her surroundings for of late notwithstanding its occasional spasms of fierce excitement her life had been as monotonous as it was miserable always the same anxious grief the same fears the same longing pressing hourly round her like phantoms in the mistno not like phantoms like real living things peeping at her from the dark sometimes indeed the presentiments and intangible terrors that were gradually strengthening their hold upon her would get beyond her control and arouse in her a restless desire for actionany action it did not matter whatthat would take her away out of these dull hours of unwholesome mental growth it was this longing to be doing something that drove her fevered physically with the stifling air of the summer night and mentally by thoughts of her absent lover and recollections of lady bellamys ominous words down to the borders of the lake on the evening of georges visit to her father and once there prompted her to try to forget her troubles for awhile in the exercise of an art of which she had from childhood been a mistress  the same feeling it was too that led her to spend long hours of the day and even of the night when by rights she should have been asleep immersed in endless mathematical studies and in solving or attempting to solve almost impossible problems she found that the strenuous effort of the brain acted as a counterirritant to the fretting of her troubles and though it may seem an odd thing to say mathematics alone owing to the intense application they required exercised a soothing effect upon her but as one cannot constantly sleep induced by chloral without paying for it in some shape or form angelas relief from her cares was obtained at no small cost to her health when the same brain however well developed it may be has both to study hard and suffer much there must be a waste of tissue somewhere in angelas case the outward and visible result of this state of things was to make her grow thinner and the alternate mental effect to increasingly rarefy an intellect already too ethereal for this workaday world and to plunge its owner into fits of depression which were rendered dreadful by sudden forebodings of evil that would leap to life in the recesses of her mind and for a moment cast a lurid glare upon its gloom such as at night the lightning gives to the blackness which surrounds it  it was in one of the worst of these fits her cloudy days as she would call them to pigott that good news found her as she was dressing pigott brought her a letter which recognizing lady bellamys bold handwriting she opened in fear and trembling it contained a short note and another letter the note ran as follows    dear angela   i enclose you a letter from your cousin george which contains   what i suppose you will consider good news for your own sake i   beg you not to send it back unopened as you did the last                                                            a b   for a moment angela was tempted to mistrust this enclosure and almost come to the determination to throw it into the fire feeling sure that a serpent lurked in the grass and that it was a cunningly disguised loveletter but curiosity overcame her and she opened it as gingerly as though it were infected unfolding the sheet with the handle of her hairbrush its contents were destined to give her a surprise they ran thus                                     isleworth hall september 20   my dear cousin   after what passed between us a few days ago you will perhaps be   surprised at hearing from me but if you have the patience to   read this short letter its contents will not i fear be   altogether displeasing to you they are very simple i write to   say that i accept your verdict and that you need fear no further   advances from me whether i quite deserved all the bitter words   you poured out upon me i leave you to judge at leisure seeing   that my only crime was that i loved you to most women that   offence would not have seemed so unpardonable but that is as it   may be after what you said there is only one course left for a   man who has any prideand that is to withdraw so let the past be   dead between us i shall never allude to it again wishing you   happiness in the path of life which you have chosen                         i remain                                your affectionate cousin                                               george caresfoot   it would have been difficult for any one to have received a more perfectly satisfactory letter than this was to angela  pigott she called out feeling the absolute necessity of a confidant in her joy and forgetting that that worthy soul had nothing but the most general knowledge of georges advances he has given me up just think he is going to let me alone i declare that i feel quite fond of him  and who might you be talking of miss  why my cousin george of course he is going to let me alone i tell you  which seeing how as he isnt fit to touch you with a pair of tongs is about the least as he can do miss and as for letting you alone i didnt know as he ever proposed doing anything else but that reminds me miss though i am sure i dont know why it should how as mrs hawkins as was put in to look after the vicarage while the reverend fraser was away told me last night how as she had got a telegraft the sight of which she said knocked her all faint like till she turned just as yellow as the cover to say nothing of four andsix porterage the which however she intends to recover from the reverendlord where was i  i am sure i dont know pigott but i suppose you were going to tell me what was in the telegram  yes miss thats right but my head does seem to wool up somehow so at times that i fare to lose my way  well pigott what was in the telegram  lord miss how you do hurry one begging your pardon only that the reverend frasernot but what mrs hawkins do say that it cant be true because the words warnt in his writing nor nothing like as she has good reason to know seeing that  yes but what about mr fraser pigott isnt he well  the telegraft didnt say as i remembers miss bless me i forget if it was today or tomorrow  oh pigott groaned angela do tell me what was in the telegram  why miss surely i told you that the thing said though i fancy likely to be in error  what almost shouted angela  why that the reverend fraser would be home by the midday train and would like a beefsteak for lunch not mentioning however anything about the onions which is very puzzling to mrs  oh i am glad why could you not tell me before cousin george disposed of and mr fraser coming back why things are looking quite bright again at least they would be if only arthur were here and her rejoicing ended in a sigh  as soon as she thought that he would have finished his beefsteak with or without the onions angela walked down to the vicarage and broke in upon mr fraser with something of her old gladsome warmth running up to him without waiting to be announced she seized him by both hands  and so you are back at last what a long time you have been away oh i am so glad to see you  mr fraser who it struck her looked older since his absence turned first a little red and then a little pale and said  yes angela here i am back again in the old shop it is very good of you to come so soon to see me now sit down and tell me all about yourself whilst i go on with my unpacking but bless me my dear what is the matter with you you look thin and as though you were not happy andwhere has your smile gone to angela  never mind me you must tell me all about yourself first where have you been and what have you been doing all these long months  oh i have been enjoying myself over half the civilized globe he answered with a somewhat forced laugh switzerland italy and spain have all been benefited by my presence but i got tired of it so here i am back in my proper sphere and delighted to again behold these dear familiar faces and he pointed to his ample collection of classics but let me hear about yourself angela i am tired of no 1 i can assure you  oh mine is a long story you will scarcely find patience to listen to it  ah i thought that there was a story from your face then i think that i can guess what it is about young ladies stories generally turn upon the same pivot and he laughed a little softly and sat down in a corner well out of the light now my dear i am ready to give you my best attention  angela blushed very deeply and looking studiously out of the window began with many hesitations to tell her story  well mr fraser you must understand first of alli mean you know that i must tell you that desperately that i am engaged  ah  there was a something so sharp and sudden about this exclamation that angela turned round quickly  whats the matter have you hurt yourself  yes but go on angela  it was an awkward story to tell especially the george complication part of it and to any one else she felt that she would have found it almost impossible to tell it but in mr fraser she was she knew sure of a sympathetic listener had she known too that the mere mention of her lovers name was a stab to her listeners heart and that every expression of her own deep and enduring love and each tone of endearment were new and ingenious tortures she might well have been confused  for so it was although he was fifty years of age mr fraser had not educated angela with impunity he had paid the penalty that must have resulted to any heartwhole man not absolutely a fossil who had been brought into close contact with such a woman as angela her loveliness appealed to his sense of beauty her goodness to his heart and her learning to his intellectual sympathies what wonder that he learnt by imperceptible degrees to love her the wonder would have been if he had not  the reader need not fear however he shall not be troubled with any long account of mr frasers misfortune for it never came to light or obtruded itself upon the world or even upon its object his was one of those earnest secret and selfsacrificing passions of which if we only knew it there exist a good many round about us passions which to all appearance tend to nothing and are entirely without object unless it to be make the individuals on whom they are inflicted a little less happy or a little more miserable as the case may be than he or she would otherwise have been it was to strive to conquer this passion which in his heart he called dishonourable that mr fraser had gone abroad right away from angela where he had wrestled with it and prayed against it and at last as he thought subdued it but now on his first sight of her it rose again in all its former strength and rushed through his being like a storm and he realized that such love is of those things that cannot die and perhaps it is a question if he really wished to lose it it was a poor thing indeed a very poor thing but his own there is something so divine about all true love that there lurks a conviction at the bottom of the hearts of most of us that it is better to love however much we suffer than not to love at all perhaps after all those really to be pitied are the people who are not capable of any such sensation  but what mr fraser suffered listening that autumn afternoon to angelas tale of anothers love and of her own deep return of that love no man but himself ever knew yet still he heard and was not shaken in his loyalheartedness and comforted and consoled her giving her the best advice in his power like the noble christian gentleman that he was showing her too that there was little need of anxiety and every ground for hope that things would come to a happy and successful issue the martyrs abnegation of self is not yet dead in the world  at last angela came to the letter that she had that very morning received from george mr fraser read it carefully  at any rate he said he is behaving like a gentleman now on the whole that is a nice letter you will be troubled with him no more  yes answered angela and then flushing up at the memory of georges arguments in the lane but it is certainly time that he did for he had no business oh he had no business to speak to me as he spoke and he a man old enough to be my father  mr frasers pale cheeks coloured a little  dont be hard upon him because he is old angelawhich by the way he is not he is nearly ten years my juniorfor i fear that old men are just as liable to be made fools of by a pretty face as young ones  from that moment not knowing the mans real character mr fraser secretly entertained a certain sympathy for georges sufferings arising no doubt from a fellowfeeling it seemed to him that he could understand a man going very far indeed when his object was to win angela not that he would have done it himself but he knew the temptation and what it cost to struggle against it  it was nearly dark when at length angela rising to go warmly pressed his hand and thanked him in her own sweet way for his goodness and kind counsel and then declining his offer of escort and saying that she would come and see him again on the morrow she departed on her homeward path  the first thing that met her gaze on the halltable at the abbey house was a note addressed to herself in a handwriting that she had seen in many washing bills but never before on an envelope she opened it in vague alarm it ran as follows    missyore father has just dismissed me saying that he is too   pore to keep me any longer which is a matter as i holds my own   opinion on and that i am too uneddicated to be in yore company   which is a perfect truth but miss not feeling any how ekal to   bid you goodbye in person after bringing you up by hand and doing   for you these many years i takes the liberty to write to you   miss to say goodbye and god bless you my beautiful angel and i   shall be to be found down at the old housen at the end of the   drift as my pore husband left me which is fortinately just empty   and praps you will come and see me at times miss                                     yore obedient servant                                                         pigott   i opens this again to say how as i have tied up your things a bit   afore i left leaving mine till tomorrow when if living i shall   send for them if you please miss you will find yore clean   nightshift in the left hand drawyer and sorry am i that i cant   be there to lay it out for you i shall take the liberty to send   up for your washing as it cant be trusted to any one   angela read the letter through and then sank back upon a chair and burst into a storm of tears partially recovering herself however she rose and entered her fathers study  is this true she asked still sobbing  is what true asked philip indifferently and affecting not to see her distress  that you have sent pigott away  yes yes you see angela  do you mean that she is really to stop away  of course i do i really must be allowed angela  forgive me father but i do not want to listen to your reasons and excuses her eyes were quite dry now that woman nursed my dying mother and played a mothers part to me she is as you know my only woman friend and yet you throw her away like a wornout shoe no doubt you have your reasons and i hope that they are satisfactory to you but i tell you reasons or no reasons you have acted in a way that is cowardly and cruel and casting one indignant glance at him she left the room  philip quailed before his daughters anger  thank goodness shes gone and that job is done with i am downright afraid of her and the worst of it is she speaks the truth said philip to himself as the door closed  ten days after this incident angela heard casually from mr fraser that sir john and lady bellamy were going on a short trip abroad for the benefit of the formers health if she thought about the matter at all it was to feel rather glad angela did not like lady bellamy indeed she feared her of george she neither heard nor saw anything he had also gone away                                 chapter xli  meanwhile at madeira matters were going on much as we left them there had indeed been little appreciable change in the situation  for his part our friend arthur continued to dance or rather stroll along the edge of his flowery precipice and found the view pleasant and the air bracing  and no doubt things were very nicely arranged for his satisfaction and had it not been for the everpresent thought of angelafor he did think of her a great deal and with deep longinghe should have enjoyed himself thoroughly for every day was beautiful and every day brought its amusements with it perhaps on arriving at the quinta carr about eleven oclock he would find that the steam launch was waiting for them in a little bay where the cliff on which the house stood curved inwards then a merry party of young english folks all collected together by mrs carr that morning by the dint of superhuman efforts they would scramble down the steps cut in the rock and steam off to some neighbouring islet to eat luncheon and wander about collecting shells and flowers and beetles till sunset and then steam back again through the spicy evening air laughing and flirting and making the night melodious with their songs or else the horses would be ordered out and they would wander over the lonely mountains in the interior of the island talking of mummies and all things human of angela and all things divine and sometimes in the course of these conversations arthur would in a brotherly way call mrs carr mildred while occasionally in the tone of a spinster aunt she would address him as arthur a practice that once acquired she soon found was like all other bad habits not easy to get rid of for somehow in all these expeditions she was continually at his side striving and not without success to weave herself into the substance of his life and to make herself indispensable to him till at last he grew to look upon her almost as a sister  but beyond this he never went and to her advances he was as cold as ice simply because he never noticed them and she was afraid of making them more obvious for fear that she would frighten him away he thought it the most natural thing in the world that he and mildred should live together like brother and sister and be very fond of each other as sich whilst she thought himjust what he wasthe blindest of fools and then loved him the more for his folly the sisterly relationship did not possess the same charms for mildred that it did for arthur they looked at matters from different points of view  one morning peeping through a big telescope that was fixed in the window of the little boudoir which formed an entrance lobby to the museum mrs carr saw a cloud of smoke upon the horizon presently the point of a mast poked up through the vapour as though the vessel were rising out of the ocean then two more mastheads and a red and black funnel and last of all a great grey hull  hurrah called out mrs carr with one eye still fixed to the telescope and the remainder of her little face all screwed up in her efforts to keep the other closed its the mail i can see the donald currie flag a white c on a blue ground  well i am sure mildred theres no need for you to make your face look like a monkey if it is you look just as though the corner of your mouth were changing places with your eyebrow  agatha you are dreadfully rude when the fairies took your endowments in hand they certainly did not forget the gift of plain speech i shall appeal to mr heigham do i look like a monkey mr heigham no on second thoughts i wont wait for the inevitable compliment arthur hold your tongue and i will tell you something that must be the new boat the garth castle and i want to see over her captain smithson who is bringing her out has got a box of things for me what do you say if we kill two birds with one stone go and see the vessel and get our luncheon on board  i am at your ladyships service answered arthur lazily but would you like to have the compliment apropos of the monkey i have thought of something extremely neat now  not on any account i hate compliments that are not meant and her eyes gave a little flash which put a point to her words agatha i suppose that you will come  well yes dear the bay looks pretty smooth  smooth yes you might sail across it in a paper ship yawned arthur  for goodness sake dont look so lazy mr heigham but ring the bell not that one the electric oneand let us order the launch at once the mail will be at anchor in about an hour  arthur did as he was bid and within that time they were steaming through the throng of boats already surrounding the steamer  my gracious mildred suddenly exclaimed agatha do you see who that is there leaning over the bulwarks oh hes gone but so sure as i am a living woman it was lord minster and lady florence thingumebob his sister you know the pretty one  mildred looked vexed and glanced involuntarily at arthur who was steering the launch for a moment she hesitated about going on and glanced again at arthur the look seemed to inspire her for she said nothing and presently he brought the boat deftly alongside the gangway ladder  the captain of the ship had already come to the side to meet her having recognized her from the bridge indeed there was scarcely a man in donald curries service who did not know mrs carr at any rate by sight  how do you do mrs carr are you coming on to south africa with us  no captain smithson i or rather we are coming to lunch and to see your new boat and last but not least to claim my box  mrs carr will you ever forgive me i have lost it  produce my box captain smithson or i will never speak to you again ill do more ill go over to the union line  in which case i am afraid donald currie would never speak to me again i must certainly try to find that box and he whispered an order to a quartermaster well it is very kind of you to come and lunch and i hope that you and your friends will do so with me till then goodby i must be off  as soon as they got on the quarterdeck arthur perceived a tall wellpreserved man with an eyeglass whom he seemed to know bearing down upon them followed by a charminglooking girl about threeand twenty years of age remarkable for her pleasant eyes and the humorous expression of her mouth  how do you do mrs carr said the tall man i suppose that you heard that we were coming it is very good of you to come and meet us  i had not the slightest idea that you were coming and i did not come to meet you lord minster i came to lunch answered mrs carr rather coldly  nasty one for james that very murmured lady florence hope it will do him good  i was determined to come and look you up as soon as i got time but the house sat very late however i have got a fortnight here now and shall see plenty of you  a good deal too much i daresay lord minster but let me introduce you to mr heigham  lord minster glanced casually at arthur and lifting his hat about an eighth of an inch was about to resume his conversation when arthur who was rather nettled by this treatment said  i think i have had the pleasure of meeting you before lord minster we were stopping together at the stanley foxes last autumn  stanley foxes ah quite so forgive my forgetfulness but one meets so many people you see and he turned round to where mrs carr had been but that lady had taken the opportunity to retreat lord minster at once followed her  well if my brother has forgotten you mr heigham i have not said lady florence now coming forward for the first time dont you remember when we went nutting together and i tumbled into the pond  indeed i do lady florence and i cant tell you how pleased i am to see you again are you here for long  an indefinite time an old aunt of mine mrs velley is coming out by next mail and i am going to stop with her when my brother goes back are you staying with mrs carr  oh no only i know her very well  do you admire her  immensely  then you wont like jamesi mean my brother  why not  because he also admires her immensely  we both admire the view from here very much indeed but that is no reason why you and i should not like each other  no but then you see there is a difference between lovely scenery and lovely widows  perhaps there is said arthur  at this moment lord minster returned with mrs carr  how do you do lady florence said the latter let me introduce you to mr heigham what do you already know each other  oh yes mrs carr we are old friends  oh indeed that is very charming for you  yes it is said lady florence frankly  well we must be off now florence  all right james im ready  will you both come and dine with me tonight sans facon there will be nobody else except agatha and mr heigham asked mrs carr  we shall be delighted said lord minster  au revoir then nodded lady florence to arthur and they separated  when after lunching and seeing round the ship miss terry and arthur found themselves in the steam launch waiting for mrs carr who was saying goodby to the captain and looking after her precious box arthur took the opportunity to ask his companion what she knew of lord minster  oh not much that is nothing in particular except that he is the son of a sugarbroker or something who was made a peer for some reason or other and i suppose that is why he is so stuck up because all the other peers i ever met are just like other people he is very clever too is in the government now and always hanging about after mildred he wants to marry her you know and i expect that he will at last but i hope he wont i dont like him he always looks at one as though one were dirt  the deuce he does ejaculated arthur his heart filling on the instant with envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness towards lord minster he had not the slightest wish to marry mildred himself but he boiled at the mere thought of anybody else doing so lady florence was right there is a difference between ladies and landscapes  at that moment mildred herself arrived but so disgusted was he that he would scarcely speak to her and on arriving at the landing stage he at once departed to the hotel and even tried to get out of coming to dinner that night but this was overruled  good said mildred to herself with a smile i have found out how to vex him  at dinner that evening lord minster who had of course taken his hostess in opened the conversation by asking her how she had been employing herself at madeira  better than you have at st stephens lord minster at any rate i have not been forwarding schemes for highway robbery and the national disgrace she answered laughing  i suppose that you mean the irish land act and the transvaal convention i have heard several ladies speak of them like that and i am really coming to the conclusion that your sex is entirely devoid of political instinct  what do you mean by political instinct lord minster asked arthur  by political instinct he replied i understand a proper appreciation of the science and object of government  goodness me what are they asked mrs carr  well the science of government consists roughly speaking in knowing how to get into office and remain there when once in its objects are to guess and give expression to the prevailing popular feeling or whim with the loss of as few votes as possible  according to that definition said arthur all national questions are or should be treated by those who understand the science and objects of government on a semifinancial basis i mean they should be dealt with as an investor deals with his funds in order to make as much out of them as possible not to bring real benefit to the country  you put the matter rather awkwardly but i think i follow you i will try to explain in the first place all the oldfashioned jingo nonsense about patriotism and the honour of the country has if people only knew it quite exploded it only lingers in a certain section of the landed gentry and a proportion of the upper middle class and has no serious weight with leading politicians  how about lord beaconsfield  well he was perhaps an exception but then he was a man with so large a mindi say it though i detested himthat he could actually by a sort of political prescience see into the far future and shape his course accordingly but even in his case i do not believe that he was actuated by patriotism but rather by a keener insight into human affairs than most men possess  and yet he came terribly to grief  because he outflew his age the will of the countrywhich means the will of between five hundred thousand and a million hungry fluctuating electorscould not wait for the development of his imperial schemes they wanted plunder in the present not honour and prosperity for the empire in the future the instinct of robbery is perhaps the strongest in human nature and those who would rule humanity on its present basis must pander to it or fail the party of progress means the party that can give most spoil taken from those that have to those that have not that is why mr gladstone is such a truly great man he understands better than any one of his age how to excite the greed of hungry voters and to guide it for his own ends what was the midlothian campaign but a crusade of plunder first he excited the desire then he promised to satisfy it of course that is impossible but at the time he was believed and his promises floated us triumphantly into power the same arguments apply to that body of electors whose motive power is sentimenttheir folly must be pandered to for instance the transvaal convention that mrs carr mentioned is an admirable example of how such pandering is done no man of experience can have believed that such an agreement could be wise or that it can result in anything but trouble and humiliation but the trouble and humiliation will not come just yet and in the meanwhile a sop is thrown to cerberus political memories are short and when exposure comes it will be easy to fix the blame upon the other side it is because we appreciate these facts that in the end we must prevail the liberal party or rather the radical section which is to the great liberal party what the helm is to the ship appeals to the baser instincts and more pressing appetites of the people the conservative only to their traditions and higher aspirations in the same way that religion appeals to the spirit and the worship of mammon to the senses the shibboleth of the one is selfinterest of the other national honour the first appeals to the many the second to the finer few and i must leave you to judge which will carry the day  and if ever you become prime minister shall you rule england upon these principles asked mrs carr  certainly it is because i have mastered them that i am what i am i owe everything to them consequently in my view they are the finest of all principles  then heaven help england soliloquized arthur rudely  and so say we all added lady florence who was a strong conservative  my dear young people answered lord minster with a superior smile england is quite capable of looking after herself i have to look after myself she will at any rate last my time and my motto is that one should get something out of ones country not attempt to do her services that would in all probability never be recognized or if recognized left unrewarded  arthur was about to answer with more sharpness than discretion but mrs carr interposed  well lord minster we have to thank you for a very cynical and lucid explanation of the objects of your party if they really are its objects will you give me some wine  after dinner mrs carr devoted herself almost exclusively to lord minster leaving arthur to talk to lady florence lord minster was not slow to avail himself of the opportunity  i have been thinking of your remark to me in london about the crossingsweeper he began  oh for heavens sake dont drag that wretched man out of his grave lord minster i really have forgotten what i said about him  i hope mrs carr that you have forgotten a good deal you said that day i may as well take this opportunity  no please dont lord minster she answered knowing very well what was coming i am so tired tonight  oh in that case i can easily postpone my statement i have a whole fortnight before me  mrs carr secretly determined that it should remain as much as possible at his own exclusive disposal but she did not say so  shortly after this arthur took his leave after shaking hands very coldly with her nor did he come to the quinta next day as he had conceived too great a detestation of lord minster to risk meeting him a detestation which he attributed solely to that rising member of the governments political principles which jarred very much with his own  better and better said mrs carr to herself as she took off her dress but lord minster is really odious i cannot stand him for long                                 chapter xlii  why arthur i had almost forgotten what you are like said mildred when that young gentleman at last put in an appearance at the quinta where have you been to all this time  ioh i have been writing letters said arthur  then they must have been very long ones dont tell fibs arthur you have not stopped away from here for a day and a half in order to write letters what is the matter with you  well if you must know mildred i detest your friend lord minster the mere sight of him sets my teeth on edge and i did not want to meet him i only came here today because lady florence told me that they were going up to the convent this afternoon  so you have been to see lady florence  no i met her buying fruit yesterday and went for a walk with her  in the intervals of the letterwriting  yes  well do you know i detest lady florence  that is very unkind of you she is charming  from your point of view perhaps as her brother is from mine  do you mean to tell me that you think that horrid fellow charming asked arthur in disgust  why should i not  oh for the matter of that there is no reason why you should not but i cant congratulate you either on your friend or your taste  leaving my taste out of the question why do you call lord minster my friend  because miss terry told me that he was she said that he was always proposing to you and that you would probably marry him in the end  mildred blushed faintly  she has no business to tell you but for the matter of that so have many other men it does not follow that because they choose to propose to me they are my friends  no but then they have not married you  no more has he but while we are talking of it why should i not marry lord minster he can give me position influence everything that is dear to a woman except the rarest of all giftslove  but is love so rare mildred  yes the love that it can satisfy a woman either to receive or to give especially the latter for in this we are more blessed in giving than in receiving it is but very rarely that the most fortunate of us get a chance of accepting such love as i mean and we can only give it once in our lives but you have not told me your reasons against my marrying lord minster  because he is a meanspirited selfish man if he were not he could not have talked as he did last night because you do not love him mildred you cannot love such a man as that if he were fifty times a member of the government  what does it matter to you arthur she said in a voice of indescribable softness bending her sunny head low over her work whether i love him or not my doing so would not make your heart beat the faster  i dont wish you to marry him he said confusedly  she raised her head and looked full at him with eyes which shone like stars through a summer mist  that is enough arthur she answered in a tone of gentle submission if you do not wish it i will not and rising she left the room  arthur blushed furiously at her words and a new sensation crept over him  surely he said to himself she cannot no of course she only means that she will take my advice  but though he dismissed the suspicion thus readily it left something that he could not quite define behind it he had after the manner of young men were women are concerned thought that he understood mildred thoroughly now he came to the modest conclusion that he knew very little about her  on the following afternoon when he was at the quinta talking as usual to mrs carr he saw lord minster coming up the steps of the portico dressed in much the same way and with exactly the same air as he was accustomed to assume when he mounted those of the reform or occasionally if he thought that the hungry electors wanted pandering to those of the new national club  hullo said arthur here comes lord minster in his war paint frock coat tall hat eyeglass and all goodbye  why do you go away arthur stop and protect me said mildred laughing  oh no indeed i dont want to spoil sport i would not interfere with your amusement on any account  mildred looked a little vexed  well you will come back to dinner  that depends upon what happens  i told you what would happen arthur goodbye  perhaps it is as well to get it over at once thought mildred  in the hall arthur met lord minster and they passed with a gesture of recognition so infinitesimally small that it almost faded into the nothingness of a cut so far as he could condescend to notice so low a thing at all his lordship had conceived a great dislike for arthur  how do you do lord minster said mildred cordially i hear that you went to the convent yesterday what did you think of the view  the view mrs carrwas there a view i did not notice it indeed i only went up there at all to please florence i dont like that sort of thing  if you dont like roughing it i am afraid that you did not enjoy your voyage out  well no i dont think i did and there was a low fellow on board who had been ruined by the retrocession of the transvaal and who hearing that i was in the government took every possible opportunity to tell me publicly that his wife and children were almost in a state of starvation as though i cared about his confounded wife and children he was positively brutal no certainly i did not enjoy it however i am rewarded by finding you here  i am very much flattered  lord minster fixed his eyeglass firmly in his eye planted his hands at the bottom of his trousers pockets and clearing his throat placed himself in the attitude that was so familiar to the house and began  mrs carr i told you when last i had the pleasure of seeing you that i should take the first opportunity of renewing a conversation that i was forced to suspend in order to attend if my memory serves me a very important committee meeting i was therefore surprised indeed i may almost say hurt when i found that you had suddenly flitted from london  indeed lord minster  i will not however take up the time of thisi mean your time by recapitulating all that i told you on that occasion the facts are so to speak all upon the table and i will merely touch upon the main heads of my case my prospects are these i am now a member of the cabinet and enjoy owing to the unusual but calculated recklessness of my nonofficial public utterances an extraordinary popularity with a large section of the country the hungry section to which i alluded last night it is probable that the course of the present government is pretty nearly run the country is sick of it and those who put it into power have not got enough out of it a dissolution is therefore an event of the near future the conservatives will come in but they have no power of organization and very little political talent at their backs above all they are deficient in energy probably because there is nothing that they can destroy and therefore no pickings to struggle for in short they are not capaces imperii the want of these qualities and of leaders will very soon undermine their hold upon the country always a slight one and assisted by a few other pushing men i anticipate by carefully playing into the hands of the irish party which will really rule england in the future being able as one of the leaders of the opposition to consummate their downfall then will come my opportunity and if luck goes with me i shall be first lord of the treasury within half a dozen years but now comes the difficulty though i am so popular with the country i am for some reason quite inexplicable to myself rather at ahuma discount amongst my colleagues and that influential section of society to which they belong now in order to succeed to the full extent that i have planned it is absolutely essential that i should win the countenance of this class and the only way that i can see of doing it is by marrying some woman charming enough to disarm dislike beautiful enough to command admiration rich enough to entertain profusely and clever enough to rule england those desiderata are all to a striking degree united in your person mrs carr and i have therefore much pleasure in asking you to become my wife  you have as i understand you lord minster made a very admirable statement of how desirable it is for yourself that you should marry me but it is not so clear what advantage i should reap by marrying you  why the advantages are obvious if by your help i can become prime minister you would become the wife of the prime minister  the prospect fails to dazzle me i have everything that i want why should i strive to reach a grandeur to which i was not born and which to speak the truth i regard with a very complete indifference but there is another point in all your speech you have said nothing of any affection that you have to offer not a single word of love you have been content to expatiate on the profits that a matrimonial investment would bring to yourself and by reflection to the other contracting party  love asked lord minster with an expression of genuine surprise why you talk like a character in a novel now tell me mrs carr what is love  it is difficult to define lord minster but as you ask me to do so i will try love to a woman is what the sun is to the world it is her life her animating principle without which she must droop and if the plant be very tender die except under its influence a woman can never attain her full growth never touch the height of her possibilities or bloom into the plenitude of her moral beauty a loveless marriage dwarfs our natures a marriage where love is develops them to their utmost  and what is love to a man  well i should say that nine of a mans passions are merely episodes in his career the milestones that mark his path the tenth or the first is his philosophers stone that turns all things to gold or if the charm does not work leaves his heart broken and bankrupt a cold monument of failure  i dont quite follow you and i must say that speaking for myself i never felt anything of all this said lord minster blankly  i know you do not lord minster your only passions tend towards political triumphs and personal aggrandisement we are at the two poles you see and i fear that we can never never meet upon a common matrimonial line but dont be downhearted about it you will find plenty more women who fulfil all your requirements and will be very happy to take you at your own valuation if only a woman is necessary to success you need not look far and forgive me if i say that i believe it will not make much difference to you who she is but all the same lord minster i will venture to give you a piece of advice next time you propose address yourself a little more to the ladys affections and a little less to her interests and mrs carr rose as though to show that the interview was at an end  am i then to understand that my offer is definitely refused asked lord minster stiffly  i am afraid so and i am sure that you will on reflection see how utterly unsuited we are to each other  possibly mrs carr possibly at present all that i see is that you have had a great opportunity and have failed to avail yourself of it my only consolation is that the loss will be yours and my only regret is that i have had the trouble of coming to this place for nothing however there is a ship due tomorrow and i shall sail in her  i am sorry to have been the cause of bringing you here lord minster and still more sorry that you should feel obliged to cut short your stay goodbye lord minster we part friends i hope  oh certainly mrs carr i wish you a very good morning mrs carr and his lordship marched out of mildreds life  there goes my chance of becoming the wife of a prime minister and making a figure in history said that lady as she watched his tall figure stalking stiffly down the avenue well i am glad of it i would just as soon have married a speechmaking figurehead stuffed full of the purest radical principles  on the following day arthur met lady florence again in the town  where have you been to lady florence he said  to see my brother off she answered without any signs of deep grief  what has he gone already  yes your friend mrs carr has been too many for poor james  what do you mean that he has been proposing  yes and got more than he bargained for  is he cut up  he no but his vanity is you see mr heigham it is this way my brother may be a very great man and a pillar of the state and all that sort of thing i dont say he isnt but from personal experience i know that he is an awful prig and thinks that all women are machines constructed to advance the comfort of your noble sex well he has come down a peg or two thats all and he dont like it good bye im in a hurry  lady florence was nothing if not outspoken                                chapter xliii  a week or so after the departure of lord minster mildred suggested that they should on the following day vary their amusements by going up to the convent a building perched on the hills some thousand feet above the town of funchal in palanquins or rather hammocks swung upon long poles arthur who had never yet travelled in these luxurious conveyances jumped at the idea and even miss terry when she discovered that she was to be carried made no objection the party was completed by the addition of a newlymarried couple of whom mrs carr had known something at home and who had come to madeira to spend the honeymoon lady florence also had been asked but rather to arthurs disappointment she could not come  when the long line of swinging hammocks each with its two sturdy bearers were marshalled and the adventurous voyagers had settled themselves in them they really formed quite an imposing procession headed as it was by the extrasized one that carried miss terry who complained bitterly that the thing wobbled and made her feel sick  but to arthurs mind there was something effeminate in allowing himself a strong active man to be carted up hills as steep as the side of a house by two perspiring wretches so hot as it was he to the intense amusement of his bearers elected to get out and walk the newlymarried man followed his example and for a while they went on together till presently the latter gravitated towards his wifes palanquin and overcome at so long a separation squeezed her hand between the curtains not wishing to intrude himself on their conjugal felicity arthur in his turn gravitated to the side of mrs carr who was being lightly swung along in the second palanquin some twenty yards behind miss terrys shortly afterwards they observed a signal of distress being flown by that lady whose arm was to be seen violently agitating her green veil from between the curtains of her hammock which immediately came to a dead stop  what is it cried arthur and mildred in a breath as they arrived on the scene of the supposed disaster  my dear mildred will you be so kind as to tell that man pointing to her front bearer a stout flabby individual that he must not go on carrying me i must have a cooler man it makes me positively ill to see him puffing and blowing and dripping under my nose like a fresh basted joint  miss terrys realistic description of her bearers appearance which was to say the least of it limp and moist was no exaggeration but then she herself as arthur well remembered was no featherweight especially when as in the present case she had to be carted up the side of a nearly perpendicular hill some miles long a fact very well exemplified by the condition of the bearer  my dear agatha replied mildred laughing what is to be done of course the man is hot you are not a featherweight but what is to be done  i dont know but i wont go on with him its simply disgusting he might let himself out as a wateringcart  but we cant get another here  then he must cool himself the others might come and fan him i wont go on till he is cool and thats flat  he will take hours to cool and meanwhile we are broiling on this hot road you really must come on agatha  i have it said arthur miss terry must turn herself round with her head towards the back of the hammock and then she wont see him  to this arrangement the aggrieved lady was after some difficulty persuaded to accede and the procession started again  their destination reached they picnicked as they had arranged and then separated the bride and bridegroom strolling off in one direction and mildred and arthur in another whilst miss terry mounted guard over the plates and dishes  presently arthur and mildred came to a little englishlooking grove of pine and oak that extended down a gentle slope and was bordered by a steep bank at the foot of which great ferns and beautiful madeira flowers twined themselves into a shelter from the heat here they sat down and gazed at the splendid and manytinted view set in its background of emerald ocean  what a view it is said arthur look mildred how dark the clumps of sugarcane look against the green of the vines and how pretty the red roofs of the town are peeping out of the groves of fruittrees do you see the great shadow thrown upon the sea by that cliff how deep and cool the water looks within it and how it sparkles where the sun strikes  yes it is beautiful and the pines smell sweet  i wish angela could see it he said half to himself mildred who was lying back lazily among the ferns her hat off her eyes closed so that the long dark lashes lay upon her cheek and her head resting on her arm suddenly started up  what is the matter  nothing you woke me from a sort of dream thats all  this spring i remember going with her to look at a view near the abbey house and sayingwhat i often think when i look at anything beautiful and full of lifethat it depressed one to know that all this was so much food for death and its beauty a thing that today is and tomorrow is not  and what did she say  she said that to her it spoke of immortality and that in everything around her she saw evidence of eternal life  she must be very fortunate shall i tell you of what it reminds me  what  of neither death nor immortality but of the full happy pulsing existence of the hour and of the beautiful world that pessimists like yourself and mystics like your angela think so poorly of but which is really so glorious and so rich in joy why this sunlight and those flowers and the wide sparkle of that sea are each and all a happiness and the health in our veins and the beauty in our eyes deep pleasures that we never realize till we lose them death indeed comes to us all but why add to its terrors by thinking of them whilst it is far off and as for life after death it is a faint vague thing more likely to be horrible than happy this world is our only reality the only thing that we can grasp here alone we know that we can enjoy and yet how we waste our short opportunities for enjoyment soon youth will have slipped away and we shall be too old for love roses fade fastest arthur when the sun is bright in the evening when they have fallen and the ground is red with withering petals do you not think we shall wish that we had gathered more  yours is a pleasant philosophy mildred he said struggling faintly in his own mind against her conclusions  but at this moment somehow his fingers touched her own and were presently locked fast within her little palm and for the first time in his life they sat hand in hand but happily for him he did not venture to look into her eyes and before many minutes had passed miss terrys voice was heard calling him loudly  i suppose that you must go said mildred with a shade of vexation in her voice and a good many shades upon her face or she will be blundering down here i will come too it is time for tea  on arriving at the spot whence the sounds proceeded they found miss terry surrounded by a crowd of laughing and excited bearers and pouring out a flood of the most vigorous english upon an unfortunate islander who stood a silver mug in each hand bowing and shrugging his shoulders and enunciating with every variety of movement indicative of humiliation these mystic words  mee washeeuppee signora washeeuppeee  what is the matter now agatha  matter why i woke up and found this man stealing the cups i charged him at once with my umbrella but he dodged and i fell down and the umbrella has gone over the rock there take him up at once arthur theres the stolen property on his person hand him over to justice  good gracious agatha what are you thinking about the poor man only wants to wash the things out  then i should like to know why he could not tell me so in plain english said miss terry retiring discomfited amidst shouts of laughter from the whole party including the supposed thief  after tea they all set out on a grand beetlehunting expedition and so intent were they upon this fascinating pursuit that they did not note the flight of time till suddenly mildred pulling out her watch gave a pretty cry of alarm  do you know what time it is good people halfpast six and the custances are to dine with us at a quarterpastseven it will take us a good hour to get down what shall we do  i know said arthur there are two sledges just below i saw them as we came up they will take us down to funchal in a quarter of an hour and we can get to the quinta by about seven  arthur you are invaluable the very thing come on all of you quick  now these sledges are peculiar to madeira being made on the principle of the bullock car with the difference that they travel down the smooth stonepaved roadways by their own momentum guided by two skilled conductors each with one foot naked to prevent his slipping who hold the ropes and when the sledge begins to travel more swiftly than they can follow mount upon the projecting ends of the runners and are carried with it by means of the swift and exhilarating rush of these sledges the traveller traverses the distance that it takes some hours to climb in a very few minutes indeed his journey up and down may be very well compared with that of the wellknown british sailor who took five hours to get up majuba mountain but according to his own forcibly told story came down again with an almost incredible rapidity it may therefore be imagined that sledge travelling in madeira is not very well suited to nervous voyagers  miss terry had at times seen these wheelless vehicles shoot from the top of a mountain to the bottom like a balloon with the gas out and had also heard of occasional accidents in connection with them stoutly she vowed that nothing should induce her to trust her neck to one of them  but you must agatha or else be left behind they are as safe as a church and i cant leave the custances to wait till halfpast eight for dinner come get in arthur can go in front and hold you i will sit behind  thus admonishedmiss terry entered groaning arthur taking his seat beside her and mrs carr hers in a sort of dickey behind the newly married pair who did not half like it possessed themselves of the smaller sledge determined to brave extinction in each others arms then the conductors seized the ropes and planting their one naked foot firmly before them awaited the signal to depart  stop said miss terry lifting the recovered umbrella that man has forgotten to put on his shoe and stocking on his right leg he will cut his foot and besides it doesnt look respectable to be seen flying through a place with a onelegged ragamuffin  let her go shouted arthur and they did to some purpose for in a minute they were passing down that hill like a flash of light woods and houses appeared and vanished like the visions of a dream and the soft air went singing away on either side of them as they clove it flying downwards at an angle of thirty degrees and leaving nothing behind them but the sound of miss terrys lamentations soon they neared the bottom but there was yet a dipthe deepest of them all with a sharp turn at the end of itto be traversed  away went the little connubial sled in front like a pigeon down the wind away they sped after it like an eagle in pursuit crack went the little sledge into the corner and out shot the happy pair crash went the big sledge into it and arthur became conscious of a wild yell of a green veil fluttering through the air and of a fall as on to a featherbed miss terrys superior weight had brought her to her mother earth the first and he after a higher heavenward flight had lit upon the top of her he picked her up and sat her down against a wall to recover her breath and then fished mildred dirty and bruised but as usual laughing out of a gutter the loving pair had already risen and in an agony of mutual anxiety were rubbing each others shins and then he started back with a cry for there before him surveying the disaster with an air of mingled amusement and benevolence stoodsir john and lady bellamy  had it been the prince and princess of evilif as is probable there is a princessarthur could scarcely have been more astounded somehow he had always in his thoughts regarded sir john and lady bellamy when he thought about them at all as possessing indeed individual characters and tendencies but as completely adscripti glebae of the neighbourhood of the abbey house as that house itself he would as soon have expected to see caresfoots staff rerooted in the soil of madeira as to find them strolling about funchal he rubbed his eyes perhaps he thought he had been knocked silly and was labouring under a hallucination no there was no doubt about it there they were just the same as he had seen them at isleworth except that if possible sir john looked even more like a ripe apple than usual while the sun had browned his wifes egyptian face and given her a last finish as a perfect type of cleopatra nor was the recognition on his side only for next second his hand was grasped first by sir john and then by lady bellamy  when we last met mr heigham said the gentleman with a benevolent beam i think i expressed a wish that we might soon renew our acquaintance but i little thought under what circumstances our next meeting would take place and he pointed to the overturned sledges and the prostrate sledgers  you have had a very merciful escape chimed in lady bellamy cordially with so many hard stones about affairs might have ended differently  now then mr heigham we had better set to and run that is if agatha has got a run left in her or we shall be late after all thank goodness nobody is hurt but we must find a hammock for agatha for to judge from her groans she thinks she is is my nose oh i beg your pardon and mrs carr stopped short observing for the first time that he was talking to strangers  do not let me detain you if you are in a hurry i am so thankful that nobody is hurt said lady bellamy i believe that we are stopping at the same hotel mr heigham i saw your name in the book so we shall have plenty of opportunities of meeting  but arthur felt that there was one question which he must ask before he went on whether or no it exceeded the strict letter of his agreement with philip so calling to mrs carr that he was coming he said with a blush  how was miss caresfoot whenwhen you last saw her lady bellamy  perfectly well she answered smiling  and more lovely than ever added her husband  thank you for that news it is the best i have heard for some time goodbye for the present we shall meet tomorrow at breakfast and he ran on after the others happier than he had been for months feeling that he had come again within call of angela and as though he had never sat hand in hand with mildred carr                                 chapter xliv  at breakfast on the following morning arthur as he had anticipated met the bellamys sir john came down first arrayed in true english fashion in a tourist suit of grey and presently lady bellamy followed as she entered dressed in trailing white and walked slowly up the long table every eye was turned upon her for she was one of those women who attract attention as surely and unconsciously as a magnet attracts iron arthur looking with the rest thought that he had never seen a stranger or at the same time a more imposing looking woman time had not yet touched her beauty or impaired her vigorous constitution and at forty she was still at the zenith of her charms the dark hair that threw out glinting lights of copper when the sun struck it still curled in its clustering ringlets and showed no line of grey while the mysterious heavylidded eyes and the coral lips were as full of rich life and beauty as they had been when she and hilda von holtzhausen first met at rewtham house  on her face too was the same expression of quiet power of conscious superiority and calm command that had always distinguished it arthur tried to think what it reminded him of and remembered that the same look was to be seen upon the stone features of some of the egyptian statues in mildreds museum  how splendid lady bellamy looks he said almost unconsciously to his neighbour  sir john did not answer and arthur glancing up to learn the reason saw that he also was watching the approach of his wife and that his face was contorted with a sudden spasm of intense malice and hatred whilst his little piglike eyes glittered threateningly he had not even heard the remark arthur would have liked to whistle he had surprised a secret  how do you do mr heigham i hope that you are not bruised after your tumble yesterday good morning john  arthur rose and shook hands  i never was more surprised in my life he said than when i saw you and sir john at the top of the street there may i ask what brought you to madeira  health sir health answered the little man cough catarrh influenza and all thats damnah infernal  my husband mr heigham struck in lady bellamy in her full rich tones had a severe threatening of chest disease and the doctor recommended a trip to some warmer climate unfortunately however his business arrangements will not permit of a long stay we only stop here three weeks at most  i am sorry to hear that you are not well sir john  oh it is nothing very much answered lady bellamy for him only he requires care what a lovely garden this isis it not by the way i forgot to inquire after the ladies who shared your tumble i hope that they were none the worse i was much struck with one of them the very pretty person with the brown hair whom you pulled out of the gutter  oh mrs carr yes she is pretty  after breakfast arthur volunteered to take lady bellamy round the garden with the ulterior object of extracting some more information about angela it must be remembered that he had no cause to mistrust that lady nor had he any knowledge of the events which had recently happened in the neighbourhood of the abbey house he was therefore perfectly frank with her  i suppose that you have heard of my engagement lady bellamy  oh yes mr heigham it is quite a subject of conversation in the roxham neighbourhood angela caresfoot is a sweet and very beautiful girl and i congratulate you much  you know then of its conditions  yes i heard of them and thought them ridiculous indeed i tried at angelas suggestion to do you a good turn with philip caresfoot and get him to modify them but he would not he is a curious man philip and when he once gets a thing into his head it is beyond the power of most people to drive it out again i suppose that you are spending your year of probation here  well yesi am trying to get through the time in that way but it is slow work  i thought you seemed pretty happy yesterday she answered smiling  arthur blushed  oh yes i may appear to be but tell me all about angela  i have really very little to tell she seems to be living as usual and looks well her friend mr fraser has come back but i must be going in i have promised to go out walking with sir john au revoir mr heigham  left to himself arthur remembered that he also had an appointment to keepnamely to meet mildred by the cathedral steps and go with her to choose some madeira jewellery an undertaking which she did not feel competent to carry out without his assistance  when he reached the cathedral he found her rather cross at having been kept waiting for ten minutes  it is very rude of you she said but i suppose that you were so taken up with the conversation of your friends that you forgot the time by the way who are they anybody you have told me about  in the pauses of selecting the jewellery arthur told her all he knew about the bellamys and of their connection with the neighbourhood of the abbey house the story caused mildred to open her brown eyes and look thoughtful just as they came out of the shop who should they run into but the bellamys themselves chaffering for madeira work with a woman in the street arthur stopped and spoke to them and then introduced mrs carr who after a little conversation asked them up to lunch  after this mildred and lady bellamy met a good deal the two women interested each other  one night when the bellamys had been about ten days in madeira the conversation took a personal turn sir john and arthur were sitting over their wine they were dining with mrs carr agatha terry was fast asleep on a sofa so that lady bellamy and mildred seated upon loungingchairs by a table with a light on it placed by an open window were practically alone  oh by the way lady bellamy said mildred after a pause i believe that you are acquainted with the young lady to whom mr heigham is engaged she had meant to say to be married but the words stuck in her throat  oh yes i know her well  i am so glad i am quite curious to hear what she is like one can never put much faith in lovers raptures you know  do you mean in person or in character  both  well angela caresfoot is as lovely a woman as ever i saw with a noble figure wellset head and magnificent eyes and hair  mildred turned a little pale and bit her lips  as to her character i can hardly describe it she lives in an atmosphere of her own an atmosphere that i cannot reach or at any rate cannot breathe but if you can imagine a woman whose mind is enriched with learning as profound as that of the first classical scholars of the day and tinged with an originality all her own a woman whose faith is as steady as that star and whose love is deep as the sea and as definite as its tides who lives to higher ends than those we strive for whose whole life indeed gives one the idea that it is the shadowimperfect perhaps but still the shadowof an immortal light then you will get some idea of angela caresfoot she is a woman intellectually physically and spiritually immeasurably above the man on whom she has set her affections  that cannot be said mildred softly like draws to like she must have found something in him some better part some affinity of which you know nothing  after this she fell into silence presently lady bellamy raised her eyes just now filled up with the great pupils and fixed them on mildred  you are thinking she said slowly that angela caresfoot is a formidable rival  mildred started  how can you pretend to read my thoughts  she laughed a little  i am an adept at the art dont be downhearted i should not be surprised if after all the engagement between mr heigham and angela caresfoot should come to nothing of course i speak in perfect confidence  of course  well the marriage is not altogether agreeable to the father who would prefer another and more suitable match but unfortunately there is no way of shaking the young ladys determination  indeed  but i think that with assistance a way might be found  their eyes met and this time mildred took up the parable  should i be wrong lady bellamy if i supposed that you have not come to madeira solely for pleasure  a wise person always tries to combine business and pleasure  and in this case the business combined is in connection with mr heighams engagement  exactly  and supposing that i were to tell him this  had i not known that you would on no account tell mr heigham i should not have told you  and how do you know that  i will answer your question by another did you ever yet know a woman who loved a man willingly help him to the arms of a rival unless indeed she was forced to it she added with something like a sigh  mildred carrs snowy bosom heaved tumultuously and the roseleaf hue faded from her cheeks  you mean that i am in love with arthur heigham on what do you base that belief  on a base as broad as the pyramids of which you were talking at dinner public report not nearly so misleading a guide as people think your face your voice your eyes all betray you why do you always try to get near him to touch himanswer me that i have seen you do it three times this evening once you handed him a book in order to touch his hand beneath it but there is no need to enumerate what you doubtless very well remember no nice woman mrs carr ever likes to continually touch a man unless she loves him you are always listening for his voice and step you are listening for them now your eyes follow his face as a dog does his masterswhen you speak to him your voice is a caress in itself shall i go on  i think that it is unnecessary whether you be right or not i will give you the credit of being a close observer  to observe with me is at once a task and an amusement and the habit is one that leads me to accurate conclusions as i think you will admit the conclusion i have come to in your case is that you do not wish to see arthur heigham married to another woman i spoke just now of assistance  i have none to give i will give none how could i look him in the face  you are strangely scrupulous for a woman in your position  i have always tried to behave like an honourable woman lady bellamy and i do not feel inclined to do otherwise now  perhaps you will think differently when it comes to the point but in the meanwhile remember that people who will not help themselves cannot expect to be helped  once and for all lady bellamy understand me i fight for my own hand with the weapons which nature and fortune have given me and by myself i will stand or fall i will join in no schemes to separate arthur from this woman if i cannot win him for myself by myself i will at any rate lose him fairly i will respect what you have told me but i will do no more  lady bellamy smiled as she answered  i really admire your courage it is quite quixotic hush here come the gentlemen                                 chapter xlv  a few days after the dinner at the quinta carr the bellamys visit to madeira drew to a close on the evening before their departure arthur volunteered to take lady bellamy down to the parade to hear the band play after they had walked about a while under the shade of the magnoliatrees which were starred all over with creamy cups of bloom and sufficiently inspected the gay throng of portuguese inhabitants and english visitors made gayer still by the amazingly gorgeous uniforms of the officials arthur spied two chairs in a comparatively quiet corner and suggested that they should sit down  lady bellamy he said after hesitating a while you are a woman of the world and i believe a friend of my own i want to ask your advice about something  it is entirely at your service mr heigham  well really it is very awkward  shall i turn my head so as not to see your blushes  dont laugh at me lady bellamy of course you will say nothing of this  if you doubt my discretion mr heigham do not choose me as a confidante you are going unless i am mistaken to speak to me about mrs carr  yes it is about her but how did you know that you always seem to be able to read ones thoughts before one speaks do you know sometimes i think that she has taken a fancy to me do you see and i wanted to ask you what you thought about it  well supposing that she had most young men mr heigham would not talk of such a thing in a tone befitting a great catastrophe but if i am not entering too deeply into particulars what makes you think so  well really i dont exactly know she sometimes gives me a general idea  oh then there has been nothing tangible  well yes once she took my hand or i took hers i dont know which but i dont think much of that because its the sort of thing thats always happening dont you know and nine times out of ten means nothing at all but why i ask you about it is that if there is anything of the sort i had better cut and run out of this because it would not be fair to stop either to her or to angela or myself it would be dangerous you see playing with such a woman as mildred  so you would go away if you thought that she took any warmer interest in you than ladies generally do in men engaged to be married  certainly i should  well then i think that i can set your mind at ease i have observed mrs carr pretty closely and in the way you suppose she cares for you no more than she does for your coat she is no doubt a bit of a flirt and very likely wishes to get you to fall in love with hera natural ambition on the part of a woman but as for being in love with you herself the idea is absurd women of the world do not fall in love so readily they are too much taken up with thinking about themselves to have time to think about anybody else with them it is all self self self from morning till night besides look at the commonsense side of the thing do you suppose it likely that a person of mrs carrs wealth and beauty who has only to lift her hand to have all london at her feet is likely to fix her affections upon a young man whom she knows is already engaged to be married and who forgive me if i say sohas not got the same recommendations to her favour that many of her suitors have it is of course quite possible that mrs carrs society may be dangerous to you in which case it might be wise for you to go but i really do not think that you need feel any anxiety on her account she finds you a charming companion and in some ways a useful one and that is all when you go somebody else will soon fill the vacant space  then thats all right said arthur though somehow he did not feel as wildly delighted as he should have done at hearing it so clearly demonstrated that mildred did not care a brass button about him but then that is human nature between eighteen and thirtyfive ninety per cent of the men in the world would like to centre in themselves the affections of every young and pretty woman they know even if there was not the ghost of a chance of their marrying one of them the same tendency is to be observed conversely in the other sex only in their case with a still smaller proportion of exceptions  by the way asked arthur presently how is my late guardian mr george caresfoot  not at all well i am sorry to say i am very anxious about his health he is in the south of england now for a change  i am sorry he is ill do you know i daresay you will think me absurd but you have taken a weight off my mind i always had an idea that he wanted to marry angela and sometimes i am afraid that i have suspected that philip caresfoot carted me off in order to give him a chance you see philip is uncommonly fond of money and george is rich  what an absurd idea mr heigham why george looks upon matrimony as an institution of the evil one he admires angela i knowhe always does admire a pretty face but as for dreaming of marrying a girl half his age and his own cousin into the bargain it is about the last thing that he would do  i am glad to hear it i am sure i have been uncomfortable enough thinking about him sometimes lady bellamy will you do something for me  what is that mr heigham  tell angela all about me  but would that be quite honourable mr heighamunder the conditions of your engagement i mean  you never promised not to talk about me i only promised not to attempt verbal or written communication with angela  well i will tell her that i met you and that you are well and if philip will allow me i will tell her more but of course i dont know if he will or not what ring is that you wear  it is one that angela gave me when we became engaged it was her mothers  will you let me look at it  arthur held out his hand the ring was an antique a large emerald cut like a seal and heavily set in a band of dull gold on the face of the stone were engraved some mysterious characters  what is that engraved on the stone  i am not sure but angela told me that mr fraser had taken an impression of it and forwarded it to a great oriental scholar his friend said that the stone must be extremely ancient as the character is a form of sanscrit and that he believed the word to mean for ever or eternity angela said that it had been in her mothers family for generations and was supposed to have been brought from the east about the year 1700 that is all i know about it  the motto is better suited to a weddingring than to an engagement stone said lady bellamy with one of her dark smiles  why  because engagements are like promises and piecrust made to be broken  i hope that will not be the case with ours however said arthur attempting a laugh  i hope not i am sure but never pin your faith absolutely to any woman or you will regret it always accept her oaths and protestations as you would a political statement politely and with an appearance of perfect faith but with a certain grain of mistrust womans fidelity is in the main a fiction we are faithful just as men are so long as it suits us to be so with this difference however men play false from passion or impulse women from calculation  you do not draw a pleasing picture of your own sex  when is the truth pleasing it is only when we clothe its nakedness with the rags of imagination or sweeten it with fiction that it can please of itself it is so ugly a thing that society in its refinement will not even hear it but prefers to employ a corresponding formula thus all passion however vile is called by the name of love all superstitious terror and grovelling attempts to conciliate the unseen are known as religion while selfish greed and the hungry lust for power masquerade as laudable ambition men and women especially women hate the truth because like the electric light it shows them as they are and that is vile it has grown so strange to them from disuse that like pilate they do not even know what it is i was going to say however that if you care to trust me with it i think i see how i can take a message to angela for youwithout either causing you to break your promise or doing anything dishonourable myself  how  well if you like i will take her that ring i think that is a very generous offer on my part for i do not like the responsibility  but what is the use of taking her the ring  it is something that there can be no mistake about that is all a speaking message from yourself but dont give it me if you do not like perhaps you had rather not  i dont like parting with it at all i confess but i should dearly like to send her something i suppose that you would not take a letter  you would not write one mr heigham  no of course i forget that accursed promise here take the ring and say all you can to angela with it you promise that you will  certainly i promise that i will say all i can  you are very good and kind i wish to heaven that i were going to marlshire with you if you only knew how i long to see her again i think that it would break my heart if anything happened to separate us and his lips quivered at the thought  lady bellamy turned her sombre face upon himthere was compassion in her eyes  if you bear angela caresfoot so great a love be guided by me and shake it off strangle itbe rid of it anyhow for fulfilled affection of that nature would carry a larger happiness with it than is allowed in a world planned expressly to secure the greatest misery of the greatest number there is a fate which fights against it its ministers are human folly and passion you have seen many marriages tell me how many have you known out of a novel where the people married their true loves in novels they always do it is another of societys pleasant fictions but real life is like a novel without the third volume i do not want to alarm you mr heigham but because i like you i ask you to steel your mind to disappointment so that if a blow comes it may not crush you  what do you mean lady bellamy do you know of any impending trouble  i certainly not i only talk on general principles do not be over confident and never trust a woman come let us get home  next morning when arthur came down to breakfast the bellamys had sailed the mail had come in from the cape at midnight and left again at dawn taking them with it                                 chapter xlvi  the departure of the bellamys left arthur in very low spirits his sensations were similar to those which one can well imagine an ancient greek might have experienced who having sent to consult the delphic oracle had got for his pains a very unsatisfactory reply foreshadowing evils but not actually defining them lady bellamy was in some way connected with the idea of an oracle in his mind she looked oracular her dark face and inscrutable eyes the stamp of power upon her brow all suggested that she was a mistress of the black arts her words too were mysterious and fraught with bitter wisdom and a deep knowledge distilled from the poisonous weeds of life  arthur felt with something like a shudder that if lady bellamy prophesied evil evil was following hard upon her words and in warning him not to place his whole hearts happiness upon one venture lest it should meet with shipwreck he was sure that she was prophesying with a knowledge of the future denied to ordinary mortals how earnestly too she had cautioned him against putting absolute faith in angelaso earnestly indeed that her talk had left a flavour of distrust in his mind yet how could he mistrust angela  nor was he comforted by a remark that fell from mildred carr the afternoon following the departure of the mail raising her eyes she glanced at his hand  what are you looking at he said  was not that queer emerald you wore your engagement ring  yes  what have you done with it  i gave it to lady bellamy to give to angela  what for  to show her that i am alive and well i may not write you know  you are very confiding  what do you mean  nothing at least i mean that i dont think that i should care to hand over my engagement ring so easily it might be misapplied you know  this view of the matter helped to fill up the cup of arthurs nervous anxiety and he vainly plied mildred with questions to get her to elucidate her meaning and state her causes of suspicion if she had any but she would say nothing more on the subject which then dropped and was not alluded to again between them  after the bellamys departure the time wore on at madeira without bringing about any appreciable change in the situation but mildred saw that their visit had robbed her of any advantages she had gained over arthur for they had as it were brought angelas atmosphere with them and faint though it was it sufficed to overpower her influence he made no move forward and seemed to have entirely forgotten the episode on the hills when he had gone so very near disaster on the contrary he appeared to her to grow increasingly preoccupied as time went on and to look upon her more and more in the light of a sister till at length her patience wore thin  as for her passion it grew almost unrestrainable in its confinement now she drifted like a rudderless vessel on a sea which raged continuously and knew no space of calm and so little oil was poured upon the troubled waters there were so few breaks in the stormwalls that rose black between her and the desired haven of her rest indeed she began to doubt if even her poor power of charming him as at first she had been able to do with the sparkle of her wit and the half unconscious display of her natural grace was not on the wane and if she was not near to losing her precarious foothold in his esteem and affection the thought that he might be tiring of her struck her like a freezing wind and for a moment turned her heart to ice  poor mildred higher than ever above her head bloomed that blue rose she longed to pluck would she ever reach it after all her striving even to gather one poor leaf one withered petal the path which led to it was very hard to climb and below the breakers boiled would it after all be her fate to fall down into that gulf of which the sorrowful waters could bring neither death nor forgetfulness  and so christmas came and went  one day when they were all sitting in the drawingroom some eight weeks after the bellamys had left and mildred was letting her mind run on such thoughts as these arthur who had been reading a novel got up and opened the foldingdoors at the end of the room which separated it from the second drawingroom and also the further doors between that room and the diningroom then he returned and standing at the top of the big drawingroom took a birdseye view of the whole suite  what are you doing arthur  i am reflecting mildred that with such a suite of apartments at your command it is a sin and a shame not to give a ball  i will give a ball if you like arthur will you dance with me if i do  how many times he said laughing  well i will be moderatethree times let me seethe first waltz the waltz before supper and the last galop  you will dance me off my head it is dangerous to waltz with any one so pretty he said in that bantering tone he often took with her and which aggravated her intensely  it is more likely that my own head will suffer as i dance so rarely then that is a bargain  certainly  dear me mildred how silly you are you are like a schoolgirl said miss terry  agatha is put out because you do not offer to dance three times with her  oh but i will though if she likes three quadrilles  and so the matter passed off in mutual badinage but mildred did not forget her intention on the contrary society at madeira was soon profoundly agitated by the intelligence that the lady croesus mrs carr was about to give a magnificent ball and so illnaturedor rather so given to jumping to conclusionsis society that it was freely said it was in order to celebrate her engagement to arthur heigham arthur heard nothing of this one is always the last to hear things about oneself mildred knew of it however but whether from indifference or from some hidden motive she neither took any steps to contradict it herself nor would she allow miss terry to do so  nonsense she said let them talk to contradict such things only makes people believe them the more mind now agatha not a word of this to mr heigham it would put him out  well mildred i should have thought that you would be put out too  ioh no worse things might happen and she shrugged her shoulders  at length the muchexpected evening came and the arriving guests found that the ball had been planned on a scale such as madeira had never before beheld the night was lovely and sufficiently still to admit of the illumination of the gardens by means of chinese lanterns that glowed all around in hundreds and were even hung like golden fruit amongst the topmost leaves of the lofty cabbage palms and from the tallest sprays of the bamboos within the scene was equally beautiful the suite of three receptionrooms had been thrown into one two for dancing and one for use as a sittingroom they were quite full for the madeira season was at its height and all the english visitors who were anybody were there there happened too to be a manofwar in the harbour every manjack or rather every officerjack of which with the exception of those on watchand they were to be relieved later onwas there and prepared to enjoy himself with a gusto characteristic of the british sailorman  the rooms too were by no means devoid of beauty but by far the loveliest woman in them was mrs carr herself she was simply dressed in a perfectlyfitting black satin gown looped up with diamond stars that showed off the exquisite fairness of her skin to great perfection her ornaments were also diamonds but such diamondsnot little flowers and birds constructed of tiny stones but large single gems each the size of a hazelnut on her head she wore a tiara of these eleven stones in all five on each side and surmounted over the centre of the forehead by an enormous gem as large as a small walnut which standing by itself above the level of the others flashed and blazed like a fairy star around her neck wrists and waist were similar points of concentrated light that shining against the black satin as she moved gave her a truly magnificent appearance never before had mildred carr looked so perfectly lovely for her face and form were well worthy of the gems and dress indeed most of the men there that night thought her eyes as beautiful as her diamonds  the ball opened with a quadrille but in this mrs carr did not dance being employed in the reception of her guests then followed a waltz and as its first strains struck up several applicants came to compete for the honour of her hand but she declined them all saying that she was already engaged and presently arthur looking very tall and quite the typical young englishman in his dressclothes came hurrying up  you are late mr heigham she said the music has begun  yes i am awfully sorry i was dancing with lady florence and could not find her old aunt  indeed to me mrs velley is pretty conspicuous with that green thing on her head but come along we are wasting time  putting his arm round her waist they sailed away together amidst of the murmurs of the disappointed applicants  lucky dog said one  infernal puppy muttered another  arthur enjoyed his waltz very much for the rooms though full were not crowded and mildred waltzed well still he was a little uneasy for he felt that in being chosen to dance the first waltz with the giver of this splendid entertainment over the heads of so many of his superiors in rank and position he was being put rather out of his place he did not as a rule take any great degree of notice of mildreds appearance but tonight it struck him as unusually charming  you look very beautiful tonight mildred he said when they halted for breath and what splendid diamonds you have on  she flushed with pleasure at his compliment  you must not laugh at my diamonds i know that i am too insignificant to wear such jewels i had two minds about putting them on  laugh at them indeed i should as soon think of laughing at the bank of england they are splendid  yes she said bitterly they would be splendid on your angela they want a splendid woman to carry them off  oddly enough he was thinking the same thing so having nothing to say he went on dancing presently the waltz came to an end and mildred was obliged to hurry off to receive the portuguese governor who had just put in an appearance arthur looked at his card and found that he was down for the next galop with lady florence claverley  our dance again lady florence  really mr heigham this is quite shocking if everybody did not know that you belonged body and soul to the lovely widow i should be accused of flirting with you  who was it made me promise to dance five times  i did i want to make mrs carr angry  why should my dancing five or fifty dances with you make mrs carr angry  lady florence shrugged her pretty shoulders  are you blind she said  arthur felt uncomfortable  in due course however the last waltz before supper came round and he as agreed upon danced it with his hostess as the strains of the music died away the doors of the supperroom and tent were thrown open  now arthur said mildred take me in to supper  he hesitated  the portuguese governor he began  she stamped her little foot and her eyes gave an ominous flash  must i ask you twice she said  then he yielded though the fact of being for the second time that night placed in an unnecessarily prominent position made him feel more uncomfortable than ever for they were seated at the head of the top table mildred carr was in the exact centre with himself on her right and the portuguese governor on the left to arthurs left was lady florence who took an opportunity to assure him solemnly that he really bore his blushing honours very nicely and to ask him how he liked the high places at feasts  the supper passed off as brilliantly as most successful suppers do mrs carr looked charming and her conversation sparkled like her own champagne but it seemed to him that as in the case of the wine there was too much sting in it the wine was a little too dry and her talk a little too full of suppressed sarcasm though he could not quite tell what it was aimed at any more than he could trace the source of the champagne bubbles  supper done he led her back to the ballroom the second extra was just beginning and she stood as though she were expecting him to ask her to dance it  i am sorry mildred but i must go now i am engaged this dance  indeedwho to this was very coldly said  lady florence he answered confusedly though there really was no reason why he should be ashamed  she looked at him steadily  oh i forgot for tonight you are her monopoly goodbye  a little while after this arthur thought that he had had about enough dancing for awhile and went and sat by himself in a secluded spot under the shadow of a treefern in a temporary conservatory put up outside a bowwindow the chinese lantern that hung upon the fern had gone out leaving his chair in total darkness presently a couple whom he did not recognize for he only saw their backs strayed in and placed themselves on a bench before him in such a way as to entirely cut off his retreat he was making up his mind to disturb them when they began a conversation in which the squeezing of hands and mild terms of endearment played a part fearing to interrupt lest he should disturb their equanimity he judged it best to stop where he was presently however their talk took a turn that proved intensely interesting to him it was something as follows  she have you seen the hero of the evening  he who do you mean the portuguese governor in his warpaint  she no of course not you dont call him a hero do you i mean our hostesss fiance the nicelooking young fellow who took her in to supper  he oh yes i did not think much of him lucky dog but he must be rather mean they say that he is engaged to a girl in england and has thrown her over for the widow  she ah youre jealous i know that you would like to be in his shoes come confess  he you are very unkind why should i be jealous when  she well you need not hurt my hand and will you never remember that black shows against white  he its awfully hot here lets go into the garden exuent                                chapter xlvii  arthur emerged from his hidingplace horrorstruck at hearing what was being said about him and wondering so far as he was at the moment capable of accurate thought how long this report had been going about and whether by any chance it had reached the ears of the bellamys if it had the mischief might be very serious in the confusion of his mind only two things were clear to himone was that both for mildreds and his own sake he must leave madeira at once and secondly that he would dance no more with her that night  meanwhile the ball was drawing to a close and presently he heard the strains of the last galop strike up after the band had been playing for a minute or two a natural curiosity drew him to the door of the ballroom to see if mildred was dancing with anybody else here he found lady florence looking rather disconsolate  how is it that you are not dancing she asked  he murmured something inaudible about partner  well we are in the same box what do you think i promised this galop to captain clemence and now there he is vainly trying to persuade mrs carr who wont look at him and appears to be waiting for somebody elseyou i should thinkto give him the dance i will be even with him though  just then the music reached a peculiarly seductive passage  oh come along said lady florence quite regardless of the proprieties and before arthur well knew where he was he was whirling round the room  mrs carr was standing at the top corner where the crush obliged him to slacken his pace and as he did so he caught her eye she was talking to lady florences faithless partner with a smile upon her lips but one glance at her face sufficed to tell him that she was in a royal rage and what was more with himself his partner noticed it too and was amused  unless i am mistaken mr heigham you have come into trouble look at mrs carr and she laughed  but that was not all either from sheer mischief or from curiosity to see what would happen she insisted upon stopping as the dance drew to a close by mildreds corner that lady however proved herself equal to the occasion  mr heigham she said sweetly do you know that that was our dance  oh was it he replied feeling very much a fool  yes certainly it was but with such a temptation to errorand she smiled towards lady florenceit is not wonderful that you made a mistake and as you look so contrite you shall be forgiven agatha theres a dear just ask that man to go up to the band and tell them to play another waltz la berceuse before god save the queen  arthur felt all the while though she was talking so suavely that she was in a state of suppressed rage once he glanced at her and saw that her eyes seemed to flash but her anger only made her look more lovely supplying as it did an added dignity and charm to her sweet features nor did she allow it to have full play  mildred felt that the crisis in her fortunes was far too serious to admit of being trifled with she knew how unlikely it was that she would ever have a better chance with arthur than she had now for the mirrors told her that she was looking her loveliest which was very lovely indeed in addition she was surrounded by every seductive circumstance that could assist to compel a young man however much engaged to commit himself by some act or words of folly the sound and sights of beauty the rich odour of flowers the musics voluptuous swell and last but not least the pressure of her gracious form and the glances from her eyes which alone were enough to make fools of ninetynine out of every hundred young men in europe all these things combined to help her and to them must be added her determination that concentrated strength of will employed to a single end which if there be any truth in the theories of the action of mind on mind cannot fail to influence the individual on whom it is directed  now arthur  the room was very nearly clear for it was drawing towards daylight when they floated away together oh what a waltz that was the incarnate spirit of the dance took possession of them she waltzed divinely and there was scarcely anything to check their progress on on they sped with flying feet as the music rose and fell above them and soon things began to change for arthur all sense of embarrassment and regret vanished from his mind which now appeared to be capable of holding but one idea of the simplest and yet the most soaring nature he thought that he was in heaven with mildred carr on still on now he saw nothing but her shelllike face and the large flash of the circling diamonds felt nothing but the pressure of her form and her odorous breath upon his cheek heard nothing but the soft sound of her breathing closer he clasped her there was no sense of weariness in his feet or oppression in his lungs he could have danced for ever but all too soon the music ceased with a crash and they were standing with quick breath and sparkling eyes by the spot that they had started from close by miss terry was sitting yawning  agatha say goodbye to those people for me i must get a breath of fresh air give me a glass of water please arthur  he did so and by way of composing his own nerves took a tumbler of champagne he had no longer any thought of anxiety or danger and he too longed for air they passed out into the garden and by a common consent made their way to the museum verandah which was as it proved quite deserted  the night which was drawing to its close was perfect far over the west the setting moon was sinking into the silver ocean whilst the first primrose hue of dawn was creeping up the eastern sky it was essentially a dangerous night especially after dancing and champagne a night to make people do and say regrettable things for as one of the poetsis it not byronhas profoundly remarked there is the very devil in the moon at times  they stood and gazed awhile at the softness of its setting splendours and listened to the sounds of the last departing guests fading into silence and to the murmurs of the quiet sea at last she spoke very low and musically  i was angry with you i brought you here to scold you but on such a night i cannot find the heart  what did you want to scold me about  never mind it is all forgotten look at that setting moon and the silver clouds above her and she dropped her hand from which she had slipped the glove upon his own  and now look at me and tell me how i look and how you liked the ball i gave it to please you  you look very lovely dangerously lovely and the ball was splendid let us go  do you think me lovely arthur  yes who could help it but let us go in  stay awhile arthur do not leave me yet tell me is not this necklace undone fasten it for me arthur  he turned to obey but his hand shook too much to allow him to do so her eyes shone into his own her fragrant breath played upon his brow and her bosom heaved beneath his shaking hand she too was moved light tremors ran along her limbs the colour came and went upon her neck and brow and a dreamy look had gathered in her tender eyes beneath them the sea made its gentle music and above the wind was whispering to the trees presently his hand dropped and he stood fascinated  i cannot what makes you look like that you are bewitching me  next moment he heard a sigh the next mildreds sweet lips were upon his own and she was in his arms she lay there still quite still but even as she lay there rose as it were in the midst of the glamour and confusion of his mind that made him see all things distraught and seemed to blot out every principle of right and honour another and far different scene for as in a vision he saw a dim english landscape and a grey ruin and himself within its shadows with a nobler woman in his arms dethrone me said a remembered voice desert me and i will still thank you for this hour of imperial happiness the glamour was gone the confusion made straight and clear above him shone the light of duty  mildred dear mildred this cannot be sit down i want to speak to you  she turned quite white and sank from his arms without a word  mildred you know that i am engaged  the lips moved but no sound issued from them again she tried  i know  then why do you tempt me i am only a man and weak as water in your presence do not make me dishonourable to myself and her  i love you as well as she theretake the shameful truth  yes butforgive me if i pain you for i must i must i love her  the beautiful face hid itself in the ungloved hands no answer came only the great diamond sparkled and blazed in the soft light like a hard and cruel eye  do not mildred for pitys sake involve us all in shame and ruin but let us part now if i could have foreseen how this would end but i have been a blind and selfish fool i have been to blame  she was quite calm now and spoke in her usual singularly clear voice  arthur dear i do not blame you loving her how was it likely that you should think of love from me i only blame myself i have loved you god help me ever since we metloved you with a despairing desperate love such as i hope that you may never know was i to allow your phantom angela to snatch the cup from my lips without a struggle the only happy cup i ever knew for arthur at the best of times i have not been a happy woman i have always wanted love and it has not come to me perhaps i should be but i am nota high ideal being i am as nature made me arthur a poor creature unable to stand alone against such a current as has lately swept me with it but you are quite right you must leave me we must separate you must go but oh god when i think of the future the hard loveless future  she paused awhile and then went on  i did not think to harm you or involve you in trouble though i hoped to win some small portion of your love and i had something to give you in exchange if beauty and great wealth are really worth anything but you must go dear now whilst i am brave i hope that you will be happy with your angela when i see your marriage in the paper i shall send her this tiara as a wedding present i shall never wear it again go dear go quick  he turned to leave not trusting himself to speak for the big tears stood in his eyes and his throat was choked when he had reached the steps she called him back  kiss me once before you go and i see your dear face no more i used to be a proud woman and to think that i can stoop to rob a kiss from angela thank you you are very kind and now one word you know a woman always loves a last word sometimes it happens that we put up idols and a stronger hand than ours shatters them to dust before our eyes i trust this may not be your lot i love you so well that i can say that honestly but arthur if it should be remember that in all the changes of this cold world there is one heart which will never forget you and never set up a rival to your memory one place where you will always find a home if anything should ever happen to break your life come back to me for comfort arthur i can talk no more i have played for high stakesand lost goodbye  he went without a word                                chapter xlviii  reader have you ever in the winter or early spring come from a hot house where you have admired some rich tropical bloom and then in walking by the hedgerows suddenly seen a pure primrose opening its sweet eye and looking bravely into bitter weathers face if so you will if it is your habit to notice flowers have experienced some such sensation as takes possession of my mind when i pass from the story of mildred as she was then stormtossed and loving to angela as loving indeed and yet more anxious but simpleminded as a child and not doubtful for the end they were both flowers indeed and both beautiful but between them there was a wide difference the one in the richness of her splendour gazed upon the close place where she queened it and was satisfied with the beauty round her or if not satisfied she could imagine none different the limits of that little spot formed the horizon of her mindshe knew no world beyond the other full of possibilities shed sweetness even on the blast which cut her and looked up for shelter towards the blue sky she knew endured eternally above the driving clouds  whilst sir john bellamys health was being recruited at madeira angelas daily life pursued an even and comparatively speaking a happy course she missed pigott much but then she often went to see her and by way of compensation if she had gone so had george caresfoot and lady bellamy mr fraser too had come back to fill a space in the void of her loneliness and for his presence she was very grateful indeed none but herself could know the comfort and strength she gathered from his friendship none but himself could know what it cost him to comfort her but he did not shrink from the duty indeed it gave him a melancholy satisfaction he loved her quite as dearly and with as deep a longing as mildred carr did arthur but how different were his ends of ultimately supplanting his rival he never dreamt his aim was to assist him to bring the full cup of joy untainted to his lips and so he read with her and talked with her and was sick at heart and she thanked him and consecrating all her most sacred thoughts to the memory of her absent lover and all her quick energies to selfpreparation for his coming possessed her soul in patience  and thus her young life began to bloom again with a fresh promise the close of each departing day was the signal for the lifting of a portion of her load for it brought her a day nearer to her lovers arms subtracting something from the long tale of barren hours since to her all hours seemed most barren that were not quickened by his presence indeed no arctic winter could be colder and more devoid of light and life than this time of absence was to her and had it not been for the warm splendour of her hopes shooting its beautiful promise in unreal gleams across the blackness of her horizon she felt as though she must have frozen and died for hope elusive as she is often bears a fairer outward mien than the realization to which she points and like a fond deceiver serves to keep the heart alive till the first bitterness is overpast and schooled in trouble it can know her false and yet remain unbroken  but sometimes angelas mood would change and then to her strained and sensitive mind this dead calm and cessation of events would seem to resemble that ominous moment when in tropic seas the fierce outrider of the tempest has passed howling away clothed in flying foam then comes a calm and for a space there is blue sky and the sails flap drearily against the mast and the vessel only rocks from the violence of her past plunging while the scream of the seabird is heard with unnatural clearness for there is no sound nor motion in the air intenser still grows the silence and the waters almost cease from tossing but the seaman knows that presently with a sudden roar the armies of the winds and waves will leap upon him and that a struggle for life is at hand  such fears however did not often take her for unlike arthur she was naturally of a hopeful mind and when they did mr fraser would find means to comfort her but this was soon to change  one afternoonit was christmas eveangela went down the village to see pigott now comfortably established in the house her long departed husband had left her it was a miserable december day a damp unpleasant ghost of a day and all the sky was packed with clouds while the surface of the earth was wrapped in mist rain and snow fell noiselessly by turns indeed the only sound in the air was the loud dripping of water from the trees on the dead leaves beneath the whole outlook was melancholy in the extreme while angela was in her old nurses cottage the snow fell in earnest for an hour or so and then held up again and when she came out the mist had recovered its supremacy and now the snow was melting  come miss you must be getting home or it will be dark shall i come with you a bit  no thank you pigott i am not afraid of the dark and i ought to know my way about these parts goodnight dear  the prevailing dismalness of the scene oppressed her and she made up her mind to go and see mr fraser instead of returning at present to her lonely home with this view leaving the main road that ran through rewtham bratham and isleworth to roxham she turned up a little byelane which led to the foot of the lake just as she did so she heard the deadened footfall of a fasttrotting horse accompanied by the faint roll of carriagewheels over the snow as she turned half involuntarily to see who it was that travelled so fast the creeping mist was driven aside by a puff of wind and she saw a splendid blood horse drawing an open victoria trotting past her at at least twelve miles an hour but quickly as it passed it was not too quick for her to recognize lady bellamy wrapped up in furs her dark stern face looking on straight before her as though the mist had no power to dim her sight next second the dark closed in and the carriage had vanished like a dream in the direction of isleworth  angela shivered the dark afternoon seemed to have grown darker to her  so she is back she said to herself i felt that she was back she makes me feel afraid  going on her way she came to a spot where the path forked one track leading to a plank with a handrail spanning the stream that fed the lake and the other to some steppingstones by crossing which and following the path on the other side a short cut could be made to the rectory the bridge and the steppingstones were not more than twenty yards apart but so intent was angela upon her own thoughts and upon placing her feet accurately on the stones that she did not notice a little man with a red comforter who was leaning on the handrail engaged apparently in meditation the little man however noticed her for he gave a violent start and apparently was about to call out to her when he changed his mind he was sir john bellamy  better let her go perhaps john he said addressing his own effigy in the water after all it will be best for you to let things to take their course and not to burn your own fingers or commit yourself in any way john you will trap them more securely so if you were to warn the girl now you would only expose them if you wait till he has married her you will altogether destroy them with the help of that young heigham and perhaps by that time you will have touched those compromising letters john and made a few other little arrangements and then you will be able to enjoy the sweets of revenge meted out with a quart measure not in beggarly ones or twos but you are thinking of the girleh john ah you always were a pitiful beggar but tread down the inclination decline to gratify it if you do you will spoil your own hand the girl must take her chanceoh clearly the girl must take her chance but all the same john you are very sorry for hervery come come you must be off or her ladyship and the gentle george will be kept waiting and away he went at a brisk pace cheerfully singing a verse of a comic song sir john was a merry little man  in due course angela reached the rectory and found mr fraser seated in his study reading  well my dear what brings you here what a dreary night  yes it is dreadfully damp and lonesome the people look like ghosts in the mist and their voices sound hollow a proper day for evil things to creep home and she laughed drearily  what do you mean he answered with a quick glance at her face which wore an expression of nervous anxiety  i mean that lady bellamy has come home is she not an evil thing  hush angela you should not talk so you are excited dear why should you call her evil  i dont know but have you ever noticed her have you never seen her creep creep like a tiger on its prey watch her dark face and see the bad thoughts come and peep out of her eyes as the great black pupils swell and then shrivel till they are no larger than the head of this black pin and you will know that she is evil and does evil work  my dear my dear you are upset to talk so  oh no i am not upset but did you ever have a presentiment  plenty but never one that came true  well i have a presentiment nowyes a presentimentit caught me in the mist  what is it i am anxious to hear  i dont knowi cannot say it is not clear in my mind i cannot see it but it is evil and it has to do with that evil woman  come angela you must not give way to this sort of thing you will make yourself ill sit down there is a good girl and have some tea  she was standing by the window staring out into the mist her fingers alternately intertwining and unlacing themselves whilst an unusual almost an unearthly expression played upon her face turning she obeyed him  you need not fear for me i am tough and growing used to troubles what was it you said oh tea thank you that reminds me will you come and have dinner with me tomorrow after church it is christmas day you know pigott has given me a turkey she has been fatting and i made the mincemeat myself so there will be plenty to eat if we can find the heart to eat it  but your father my dear  oh you need not be afraid i have got permission to ask you what do you think i actually talked to my father for ten whole minutes yesterday he wanted to avoid me when he saw me but i caught him in a corner he took advantage of the opportunity to try to prevent me from going to see pigott but i would not listen to him so he gave it up what did he mean by that why did he send her away what does it all mean oh arthur when will you come back arthur and to mr frasers infinite distress she burst into tears                                 chapter xlix  presentiments are no doubt foolish things and yet at the time that angela was speaking of hers to mr fraser a consultation was going on in a back study at isleworth that might almost have justified it the fire was the only light in the room and gathered round it talking very low their features thrown alternately into strong light and dark shadow were george caresfoot and sir john and lady bellamy it was evident from the strong expression of interest almost of excitement on their faces that they were talking of some matter of great importance  sir john was as usual perched on the edge of his chair rubbing his dry hands and eliciting occasional sparks in the shape of remarks but he was no longer merry indeed he looked ill at ease george his red hair all rumpled up and his long limbs thrust out towards the fire spoke scarcely at all but glued his little bloodshot eyes alternately on the faces of his companions and only contributed an occasional chuckle but the soul of this witches gathering was evidently lady bellamy she was standing up and energetically detailing some scheme the great pupils of her eyes expanding and contracting as the unholy flame within them rose and fell  then that is settled she said at last  george nodded bellamy said nothing  i suppose that silence gives consent very well i will take the first step tomorrow i do not like angela caresfoot but upon my word i shall be sorry for her before she is twentyfour hours older she is made of too fine a material to be sold into such hands as yours george caresfoot  george looked up menacingly but said nothing  i have often urged you to give this up now i urge no morethe thing is done in spirit it may as well be done in reality i told you long ago that it was a most dreadfully wicked thing and that nothing but evil can come of it do not say that i have not warned you  come stop that devils talk growled george  devils talkthat is a good word george for it is of the devils wages that i am telling you now listen i am going to prophecy a curse will fall upon this house and all within it would you like to have a sign that i speak the truth then wait she was standing up her hand stretched out and in the dim light she looked like some heathen princess urging a bloody sacrifice to her gods her forebodings terrified her hearers and by a common impulse they rose and moved away from her  at that moment a strange thing happened a gust of wind making its way from some entrance in the back of the house burst open the door of the room in which they were and entered with a cold flap as of wings next second a terrible crash resounded from the other end of the room george turned white as a sheet and sank into a chair cursing feebly bellamy gave a sort of howl of terror and shrank up to his wife almost falling into the fire in his efforts to get behind her lady bellamy alone remaining erect and undaunted laughed aloud  come one of you brave conspirators against a defenceless girl strike a light for the place is as dark as a vault and let us see what has happened i told you that you should have a sign  after several efforts george succeeded in doing as she bade him and held a candle forward in his trembling hand  come dont be foolish she said a picture has fallen that is all  he advanced to look at it and then benefited his companions with a further assortment of curses the picture on examination proved to be a large one that he had some years previously had painted of isleworth with the bellamys and himself in the foreground the frame was shattered and all the centre of the canvass torn out by the weight of its fall on to a lifesized and beautiful statue of andromeda chained to a rock awaiting her fate with a staring look of agonized terror in her eyes  an omen a very palpable omen said lady bellamy with one of her dark smiles isleworth and ourselves destroyed by being smashed against a marble girl who rises uninjured from the wreck eh john  dont touch me you sorceress replied sir john who was shaking with fear i believe that you are satan in person  you are strangely complimentary even for a husband  perhaps i am but i know your dark ways and your dealings with your master and i tell you both what it is i have done with the job i will have nothing more to do with it i will know nothing more about it  you hear what he says said lady bellamy to george john does not like omens for the last time will you give it up or will you go on  i cant give her upi cant indeed it would kill me answered george wringing his hands there is a fiend driving me along this path  not a doubt of it said sir john who was staring at the broken picture with chattering teeth and his eyes almost starting out of his head but if i were you i should get him to drive me a little straighter thats all  you are poor creatures both of you said lady bellamy but we will then decide to go on  fiat injuria ruat coelum said sir john who knew a little latin and frightened as he was could not resist the temptation to air it  and then they went and left george still contemplating the horror stricken face of the nude marble virgin whose eyes appeared to gaze upon the ruins of his picture  next morning being christmas day lady bellamy went to church as behoves a good christian and listened to the divine message of peace on earth and goodwill towards men so for the matter of that did george and so did angela after church lady bellamy went home to lunch but she was in no mood for eating so she left the table and ordered the victoria to be round in half an hour  after church too angela and mr fraser ate their christmas dinner angelas melancholy had to some extent melted beneath the genial influence of the christmastide and her mind had taken comfort from the words of peace and everlasting love that she had heard that morning and for awhile at any rate she had forgotten her forebodings the unaccustomed splendour of the dinner too had diverted her attention for she was easily pleased with such things and altogether she was in a more comfortable frame of mind than she had been on the previous evening and was inclined to indulge in a pleasant talk with mr fraser upon various subjects mostly classical and arthurian she had already cracked some filberts for him plucked by herself in the autumn and specially saved in a damp jar and was about to settle herself in a chair by the fire when suddenly she turned white and stood quite still  hark she said do you hear it  hear what  lady bellamys horsethe big black horse that trots so fast  i can hear nothing angela  but i can she is on the highroad yet she will be here very soon that horse trots fast  nonsense angela it is some other horse  but as he spoke the sound of a powerful animal trotting very rapidly became distinctly audible  it has comethe evil newsand she has brought it  rubbish dear somebody to see your father no doubt  a minute elapsed and then mrs jakes now the only servant in the house was heard shuffling along the passage followed by a firm light step  dont leave me said angela to mr fraser god give me strength to bear it she went on beneath her breath she was still standing staring vacantly towards the door pale and her bosom heaving the intensity of her anxiety had to some extent communicated itself to mr fraser for there are few things so catching as anxiety except enthusiasm he too had risen and was standing in an attitude of expectancy  lady bellamy to see yer said mrs jakes pushing her head through the halfopened door  next second she had entered  i must apologize for disturbing you at dinner angela she began hurriedly and then stopped and also stood still there was something very curious about her reception she thought both mr fraser and angela might have been cut out of stone for neither moved  standing thus in the silence of expectancy the three made a strange picture on lady bellamys face there was a look of stern determination and suppressed excitement such as became one about to commit a crime  at last she broke the silence  i come to bring you bad news angela she said  what have you to say tell me quick no stop hear me before you speak if you have come here with any evil in your heart or with the intention to deceive or betray pause before you answer i am a lonely and almost friendless woman and have no claim except upon your compassion but it is not always well to deal ill with such as i since we have at last a friend whose vengeance you too must fear so by the love of christ and by the presence of the god who made you speak to me only such truth as you will utter at his judgment now answer i am ready  at her words spoken with an earnestness and in a voice which made them almost awful a momentary expression of fear swept across lady bellamys face but it went as quickly as it came and the hard determined look returned the mysterious eyes grew cold and glittered the head erected itself at that moment lady bellamy distinctly reminded mr fraser of a hooded cobra about to strike  am i to speak before mr fraser  speak  what is the good of this highflown talk angela you seem to know my news before i give it and believe me it pains me very much to have to give it he is dead angela  the cobra had struck but as yet the poison had scarcely begun to work there was only numbness mr fraser gave a gasp and half dropped half fell into his chair the noise attracted angelas attention and pressing her hand to her forehead she turned towards him with a ghost of a laugh  did i not tell you that this evil woman would bring evil news then addressing lady bellamy but stop you forget what i said to you you do not speak the truth arthur dead how can arthur be dead and i alive how is it that i do not know he is dead oh for shame it is not true he is not dead  this seems to me to be a thankless as well as a painful task said lady bellamy hoarsely but if you will not believe me look here you know this i suppose i took it as he asked me to do from his dead hand that it might be given back to you  if mr heigham is dead said mr fraser how do you know it where did he die and what of  i know it mr fraser because it was my sad duty to nurse him through his last illness at madeira he died of enteric fever i have got a copy of his burial certificate here which i had taken from the portuguese books he seems to have had no relations living poor young man but sir john communicated with the family lawyer here is the certificate and she handed mr fraser a paper written in portuguese and officially stamped  you say broke in angela that you took this ring from his dead hand the hand on which i placed it i do not believe you you beguiled it from his living hand it cannot be that he is dead for if he were i should have felt it oh arthur and in her misery she stretched out her arms and turned her agonized eyes upwards if you are dead come to me and let me see your spirit face and hear the whisper of your wings have you no voice in the silence you see he does not come he is not dead if he were dead heaven could not hold him from my side or if it could it would have drawn me up to his  my love my love said mr fraser in a scared voice it is not gods will that the dead should come back to us thus  my poor angela why will you not believe me this is so very painful do you suppose that i want to torture you by saying what is not true about your love the idea is absurd i had meant to keep it till you were calmer but i have a letter for you read it and convince yourself  angela almost snatched the paper from her outstretched hand it ran thus in characters almost illegible from weakness    dearestgoodbye i am dying of fever lady bellamy will take   back your ring when it is over try to forget me and be happy   too weak to write more goodbye god   at the foot of this broken and almost illegible letter was scrawled the word arthur  angela read it slowly and then at length the poison did its work she did not speak wildly any more or call upon arthur she was stung back to sense but all the light went out of her eyes  it is his writing she said slowly i beg your pardon it was good of you to nurse him  then pressing the paper to her bosom with one hand with the other she groped her way towards the door  it is very dark she said  lady bellamys eyes gave a flash of triumph and then she stood watching the pitiable exhibition of human misery as curiously as ever a roman matron did an expiring gladiator when angela was near the door the letter still pressed against her heart she spoke again  the blow comes from god angela and the religion and spiritual theories which you believe in will bring you consolation most likely it is a blessing in disguisea thing that you will in time even learn to be thankful for  lady bellamy had overacted her part the words did not ring true they jarred upon mr fraser much more did they jar upon angelas torn nerves her pale cheek flushed and she turned and spoke but there was no anger in her face nothing but sorrow that dignified and unfathomable love lost in its own depths only the eyes seemed as sightless as those of one walking in her sleep  when your hour of dreadful trouble comes as it will come pray god that there may be none to mock you as you mock me and she turned like a stricken thing and went slowly out blindly groping her way along  her last words had hit the victor hard who can say what hidden string they touched or what prescience of evil they awakened but they went nigh to felling her clutching the mantelpiece lady bellamy gasped for air then recovering a little she said  thank god that is over  mr fraser scarcely saw this last incident so overwhelmed was he at the sight of angelas agony that he had covered his face with his hand when he lifted it again lady bellamy was gone and he was alone                                  chapter l  three months had passed since that awful christmas day angela was heartbroken and after the first burst of her despair turned herself to the only consolation which was left her it was not of this world  she did not question the truth of the dreadful news that lady bellamy had brought her and if ever a doubt did arise in her breast a glance at the ring and the letter effectually quelled it nor did she get brainfever or any other illness her young and healthy frame was too strong a citadel to be taken out of hand by sorrow and this to her was one of the most wonderful things in her affliction it had come and crushed her and life still went on much as before the sun of her system had fallen and yet the system was not appreciably deranged it was dreadful to her to think that arthur was dead but an added sting lay in the fact that she was not dead too oh how glad she would have been to die since death had become the gate through which she needs must pass to reach her lovers side  for it had been given to angela living so much alone and thinking so long and deeply upon these great mysteries of our being to soar to the heights of a noble faith to the intense purity of her mind a living heaven presented itself a comfortable place very different from the vague and formularised abstractions with which we are for the most part satisfied where arthur and her mother were waiting to greet her and where the great light of the godhead would shine around them all she grew to hate her life the dull barrier of the flesh that stood between her and her ends still she ate and drank enough to support it still dressed with the same perfect neatness as before still lived in short as though arthur had not died and the light and colour had not gone out of her world  one dayit was in marchshe was sitting in mr frasers study reading the shakespeare which arthur had given to her and in the woes of others striving to forget her own but the attempt proved a failure she could not concentrate her thoughts they would continually wander away into space in search of arthur  she was dressed in black from the day that she heard her lover was dead she would wear no other colour and as she gazed with her hands idly clasped before her out at the driving sleet and snow mr fraser thought that he had never seen statue picture or woman of such sweet yet majestic beauty but it had been filched from the features of an immortal the spiritlook which at times had visited her from a child now continually shone upon her face and to the sight of sinful men her eyes seemed almost awful in their solemn calm and purity she smiled but seldom now and when she did it was in those grey eyes that the radiance began her features scarcely seemed to move  what are you thinking of angela  i am thinking mr fraser that it is only fourteen weeks today since arthur died and that it is very likely that i shall live another forty or fifty years before i see him i am only twentyone and i am so strong even this shock has not hurt me  why should you want to die  because all the beauty and light has gone out of my life because i prefer to trust myself into the hands of god rather than to the tender mercies of the world because he is there and i am here and i am tired of waiting  have you no fear of death  i have never feared death and least of all do i fear it now why the veriest coward would not shrink back when the man she loved was waiting for her and i am not a coward and if i were told that i must die within an hour i could say how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace cannot you understand me if all your life and soul were wrapped up in one person and she died would you not long to go to her  mr fraser made no reply for a while but in his turn gazed out at the drifting snow surely not more immaculately pure than this woman who could love with so divine a love at length he spoke  angela do you know that it is wrong to talk so you have no right to set yourself up against the decrees of the almighty in his wisdom he is working out ends of which you are one of the instruments who are you that you should rebel  no onea grain an atom a windtossed feather but what am i to do with my life how am i to occupy all the coming years  with your abilities that is a question easy to answer work write take the place in scholastic or social literature which i have trained you to fill for you fame and fortune lie in an inkstand your mind is a golden key that will open to your sight all that is worth seeing in the world and pass you into its most pleasant places you can become a famous woman angela  she turned upon him sadly  i had such ideas for arthurs sake i wished to do something great indeed i had already formed a plan but mr fraser like many another when i lost my love i lost my ambition too both lie buried in his grave i have nothing left to work for i do not care for fame or money for myself they would only have been valuable to give to him at twentyone i seem to have done with the worlds rewards and punishments its blanks and prizes its satisfactions and desires even before i have learnt what they are my hopes are as dull and leaden as that sky and yet the sun is behind it yes that is my only hope the sun is behind it though we cannot see it do not talk to me of ambition mr fraser i am brokenspirited and my only ambition is for rest the rest he gives to his beloved  rest angela that is the cry of us all we strive for rest and here we never find it you suffer but do not think that you are alone everybody suffers in their degree though perhaps such as you with the nerves of your mind bared to the roughness of the worlds weather feel mental pain the more acutely but my dear there are few really refined men and women of sensitive organization who have not at times sent up that prayer for rest any rest even eternal sleep it is the price they pay for their refinement but they are not alone if the hearts cry of every being who endures in this great universe could be collected into a single prayer that prayer would be thou who made us in pity give us rest  yes we suffer no doubt all of us and implore a peace that does not come we must learn           how black is night when golden day is done            how drear the blindness that hath seen the sun  you can tell me that but tell me you who are a clergyman and stronger to stand against sorrow than i how can we win even a partial peace and draw the sting from suffering if you know a way however hard tell it me for do you know and she put her hand to her head and a vacant look came into her eyes i think that if i have to endure much more of the anguish which i sometimes suffer or get any more shocks i shall go mad i try to look to the future only and to rise superior to my sorrows and to a certain extent i succeed but my mind will not always carry the strain put upon it but falls heavily to earth like a winged bird then it is that deprived of its higher food and left to feed upon its own sadness and to brood upon the bare fact of the death of the man i lovedi sometimes think as men are not often lovedthat my spirit almost breaks down if you can tell me any cure anything which will bring me comfort i shall indeed be grateful to you  i think i can angela if you will no longer devote yourself to study you have only to look round to find another answer to your question as to what you are to do are there no poor in these parts for you to visit cannot your hands make clothes to cover those who have none is there no sickness that you can nurse no sorrow that you can comfort i know that even in this parish there are many homes where your presence would be as welcome as a sunbeam in winter remember angela that grief can be selfish as well as pleasure  you are right mr fraser you always are right i think i am selfish in my trouble but it is a fault that i will try to mend indeed to look at it in that light only my time is of no benefit to myself i may as well devote it to others  if you do your labour will bring its own reward for in helping others to bear their load you will wonderfully lighten your own nor need you go far to begin why do you not see more of your own father you are naturally bound to love him yet it is but rarely that you speak to him  my father you know he does not like me my presence is always a source of irritation to him he cannot even bear me to look at him  oh surely that must be your fancy probably he thinks you do not care about him he has always been a strange and wayward man i know but you should remember that he has had bitter disappointments in life and try to soften him and win him to other thoughts do this and you will soon find that he will be glad enough of your company  i will try to do as you say mr fraser but i confess i have only small hopes of any success in that direction have you any parish work i can do  nor did the matter end there as is so often the case where parish work and young ladies are concerned angela set to her charitable duties with a steady determination that made her services very valuable she undertook the sole management of a clothing club in itself a maddening thing to ordinary mortals and had an eye to the distribution of the parish coals of mothers meetings and other cheerful parochial entertainments she became the life and soul giving up her mathematics and classical reading she took to knitting babies vests and socks instead indeed the number of articles which her nimble fingers turned out in a fortnight was a pleasant surprise for the cold toes of the babies and as mr fraser had prophesied she found that her labour was of a sort which brought a certain reward                                  chapter li  on one point however angelas efforts failed completely she could make no headway with her father he shrank more than ever from her society and at last asked her to oblige him by allowing him to follow his own path in peace of arthurs death he had never spoken to her or she to him but she knew that he had heard of it  philip had heard of it thus on that christmas afternoon he had been taking his daily exercise when he met lady bellamy returning from the abbey house the carriage stopped and she got out to speak to him  have you been to the abbey house to pay a christmas visit he asked it is very kind of you to come and see us so soon after your return  i am the bearer of bad news so i did not loiter  bad news what was it  mr heigham is dead she answered watching his face narrowly  dead impossible  he died of enteric fever at madeira i have just been to break the news to angela  oh indeed she will be pained she was very fond of him you know  lady bellamy smiled contemptuously  did you ever see any one put to the extremest torture if you have you can guess how your daughter was pained  philip winced  well i cant help it it is no affair of mine goodbye and then as soon as she was out of hearing i wonder if she lies or if she has murdered him george must have been putting on the screw  into the particulars of arthur heighams death or supposed death he never inquired why should he it was no affair of his he had long ago washed his hands of the whole matter and left things to take their chance if he was dead well and good he was very sorry for him if he was alive well and good also in that case he would no doubt arrive on the appointed date to marry angela  but notwithstanding all this unanswerable reasoning he still found it quite impossible to look his daughter in the face her eyes still burnt him ay even more than ever did they burn for her widowed dress and brow were agony to him and rent his heart not with remorse but fear but still his greed kept the upper hand though death by mental torture must result yet he would glut himself with his desire more than ever he hungered for those wide lands which if only things fell out right would become his at so ridiculous a price decidedly arthur heighams death was no affair of his  about six weeks before angelas conversation with mr fraser which ended in her undertaking parish work a rumour had got about that george caresfoot had been taken ill very seriously ill it was said that a chill had settled on his lungs which had never been very strong since his fever and that he had in short gone into a consumption  of george angela had neither seen nor heard anything for some time not since she received the welcome letter in which he relinquished his suit she had indeed with that natural readiness of the human mind to forget unpleasant occurrences thought but little about him of late since her mind had been more fully occupied with other and more pressing things still she vaguely wondered at times if he was really so ill as her father thought  one day she was walking home by the path round the lake after paying a visit to a sick child in the village when she suddenly came face to face with her father she expected that he would as usual pass on without addressing her and drew to one side of the path to allow him to do so but to her surprise he stopped  where have you been angela  to see ellen mim she is very ill poor child  you had better be careful you will be catching scarlet fever or somethingthere is a great deal about  i am not at all afraid  yes but you never think that you may bring it home to me  i never thought that there was any likelihood of my bringing anything to you we see so little of each other  well well i have been to isleworth to see your cousin george he is very ill  you told me that he was ill some time back what is it that is really the matter with him  galloping consumption he cannot last long  poor man why does he not go to a warmer climate  i dont knowthat is his affair but it is a serious matter for me if he dies under present circumstances all the isleworth estates which are mine by right must pass away from the family forever  why must they pass away  because your grandfather with a refined ingenuity made a provision in his will that george was not to leave them back to me as he was telling me this afternoon he is anxious to do if he were to die now with a will in my favour or without any will at all they would all go to some far away cousins in scotland  he died of heartdisease did he notmy grandfather i mean  philips face grew black as night and he shot a quick glance of suspicion at his daughter  i was saying he went on without answering her question that george may sell the land or settle it but must not leave it to me or you nor can i take under an intestacy  angela did not understand these legal intricacies and knew about as much about the law of intestacy as she did of egyptian inscriptions  well she said consolingly i am very sorry but it cant be helped can it  the girl is a born fool muttered philip beneath his breath and passed on  a week or so afterwards just when the primroses and lentlilies were at the meridian of their beauty and all the air was full of song angela heard more about her cousin george mr fraser was one day sent for to isleworth lady bellamy brought him the message saying that george was in such a state of health that he wished to see a clergyman  i never saw a worse case he said to angela on his return he does not leave the house but lies in a darkened room coughing and spitting blood he is i should say going off fast but he refuses to see a doctor his frame of mind however is most christian and he seems to have reconciled himself to the prospect of a speedy release  poor man said angela sympathetically he sent and asked to see you did he not  wellyes but when i got there he talked more about the things of this world than of the next he is greatly distressed about your father i daresay you have heard how your cousin george supplanted your father in the succession to the isleworth estates your grandfather disinherited him you know because of his marriage with your mother now that he is dying he sees the injustice of this but is prevented by the terms of your grandfathers will from restoring the land to your branch of the family so it must pass to some distant cousinsat least so i understand the matter  you always told me that it is easy to drive a coach and four through wills and settlements and legal things if he is so anxious to do so can he not find a way out of the difficultyi mean some honourable way  no i believe not except an impossible one and mr fraser smiled a rather forced smile  what is that asked angela carelessly  well that he shouldshould marry you before he dies at least you know he says that that is the only way in which he could legally transfer the estates  angela started and turned pale  then i am afraid the estates will never be transferred how would that help him  well he says he could then enter into a nominal sale of the estates to your father and settle the money on you  and why could he not do this without marrying me  i dont know i dont understand much about these things i am not a business man but it is impossible for some reason or another but of course it is absurd good night my dear dont overdo it in the parish  another week passed without any particular news of georges illness except that he was getting weaker when one day lady bellamy appeared at the abbey house where she had not been since that dreadful christmas day angela felt quite cold when she saw her enter and her greeting was as cold as herself  i hope that you bring me no more bad news she said  no angela except that your cousin george is dying but that is scarcely likely to distress you  i am sorry  are you there is no particular reason why you should be you do not like him  no i do not like him  it is a pity though because i have come to ask you to marry him  upon my word lady bellamy you seem to be the chosen messenger of everything that is wretched last time you came to this house it was to tell me of dear arthurs death and now it is to ask me to marry a man whom i detest i thought that i had told both you and him that i will not marry him i have gone as near marrying as i ever mean to in this world  really angela you are most unjust to me do you suppose that it was any pleasure to me to have such a sad duty to perform however it is refreshing to hear you talk so vigorously clearly the loss of your lover has not affected your spirits  angela winced beneath the taunt but made no reply  but if you will condescend to look at the matter with a single grain of commonsense you will see that circumstances have utterly changed since you refused to marry george then mr heigham was alive poor fellow and then too george wanted to marry you as a wife now he is merely anxious to marry you that he may be enabled to make reparation to your father he is a fastdying man you would never be his wife except in name the grave would be his only marriagebed do you not understand the difference  perfectly but do you not understand that whether in deed or in name i cannot outrage my dead arthurs memory by being for an hour the wife of that man do you not know that the marriage service requires a woman to swear to love honour and obey till death parts whether it be a day or a lifetime away can i even as a mere form swear to love when i loathe honour when i despise obey when my whole life would rise in rebellion against obedience what are these estates to me that i should do such violence to my conscience and my memories estates of what use are they to one whose future lies in the wards of a hospital or a sisterhood i will have nothing to do with this marriage lady bellamy  well i must say angela you do not make much ado about ruining your father to gratify your own sentimental whims it must be a comfortable thing to have children to help one in ones old age  angela reflected on mr frasers words about her duty to her father and for the second time that day she winced beneath lady bellamys taunt but as she returned no answer her visitor had no alternative but to drop the subject and depart  before she went however she had a few words with philip urging the serious state of georges health and the terms of his grandfathers will which prevented him from leaving the estates to himself as a reason why he should put pressure on angela somewhat but not altogether to her surprise he refused in these terms  i dont know to what depths you have gone in this business and it is no affair of mine to inquire but i have kept to my share of the bargain and i expect you to keep to yours if you can bring about the marriage with george well or ill on the terms i have agreed upon with him i shall throw no obstacle in the way but as for my trying to force angela into it i should never take the responsibility of doing so nor would she listen to me if she speaks to me on the subject i shall point out how the family will be advantaged and leave the matter to her further i will not go                                 chapter lii  three days after her conversation with lady bellamy angela received the following letter                                    isleworth hall roxham may 2   dear cousin angela   my kind and devoted friend lady bellamy has told me that she has   spoken to you on a subject which is very near to my heart and   that you have distinctly declined to have anything to do with it   of course i know that the matter lies entirely within your own   discretion but i still venture to lay the following points before   you there have i am aware been some painful passages between us   passages which under present circumstances had much better be   forgotten so first i ask you to put them quite out of your   mind and to judge of what i have to propose from a very different   point of view   i write angela to ask you to marry me it is true since   unfortunately my health will not allow me to ask you in person   but it is a very different offer from that which i made you in the   lane when you so bitterly refused me now i am solely anxious that   the marriage should take place in order that i may be enabled to   avoid the stringent provisions of your grandfathers will which   whilst forbidding me to leave these estates back to your father or   his issue fortunately does not forbid a fictitious sale and the   settlement of the sum or otherwise but i will not trouble you   with these legal details   in short i supplanted your father in youth and i am now anxious   to make every reparation in my power and at present i am quite   unable to make any independently of this it pains me to think of   the estate passing away from the old stock and i should like to   know that you who have been the only woman whom i have felt true   affection for will one day come into possession of it of course   as you understand the marriage would be nothing but a form and   if as i am told you object to its being gone through with the   ceremonies of the church it could be made equally legal at a   registry office   but please understand angela that i do not wish to press you it   is for you to judge only you must judge quickly for i am a fast   dying man and am anxious to get this matter off my mind one way   or other in order that i may be able to give it fully to the   consideration of subjects of more vital importance to one in my   condition than marrying and giving in marriage                       ever dear cousin angela                                  affectionately yours                                               george caresfoot   psremember you have your father to consider in this matter as   well as yourself   the receipt of this letter plunged angela into the greatest distress of mind it was couched in a tone so courteous and so moderate that it carried with it conviction of its sincerity and truth if she only had been concerned she would not long have hesitated but the idea of her duty to her father rose up before her like a cloud what was her true duty under the circumstances there was the rub  she took the letter to mr fraser and asked his advice he read it carefully and thought a long while before he answered the idea of angela being united to anybody in marriage even as a matter of form was naturally abominable to him but he was far too honourable and conscientious a man to allow his personal likes or dislikes to interfere with whatever he considered to be his duty but in the end he found it impossible to give any fixed opinion  my dear he said all that i can suggest is that you should take it to your father and hear what he has got to say after all it is he who must have your true welfare most at heart it was into his hands that i heard your mother in peculiarly solemn words consign you and your interests take it to your father dear there is no counsel like that of a father  had mr fraser been the father this would doubtless have been true enough but though he had known him for so many years and was privy to much of his history he did not yet understand philip caresfoot his own open and guileless nature did not easily suspect evil in another more especially when that other was the father of her whom he looked upon as the earthly incarnation of all that was holy and pure  angela sighed and obeyedsighed from doubt obeyed from duty she handed the letter to philip without a wordwithout a word he read it  i want your opinion father she said i wish to do what is right you know how painful what has happened has been for me you knowor if you do not know you must have guessedhow completely shattered my life is as for this marriage the whole thing is repugnant to me personally i had rather sacrifice fifty properties than go through it but i know that i ought to think of others mr fraser tells me that it is my duty to consult you that you will naturally have my interest most at heart that it was into your hands and to your care that my mother consigned me on her deathbed fatherand she clasped her hands and looked him full in the face with her earnest eyesmr fraser is right it must be for you to decide i will trust you entirely and leave the burden of decision to your honour and generosity only i say spare me if you can  philip rose and went to look out of the window that he might hide the evident agitation of his face and the tremor of his limbs he felt that the crucial moment had come all his poor sophistry all his miserable shuffling and attempts to fix the responsibility of his acts on others had recoiled upon his own head she had come to him and laid the burden on his heart what should he answer for a moment the shadesfor with him they were only shadesof good angels gained the upper hand and he was about to turn and look her in the facefor then he felt he could have looked her in the faceand bid her have nothing to do with george and his proposals but even in the act of turning to obey the impulse his eyes fell upon the roof of isleworth hall which standing on an eminence could easily be seen from the abbey house and his mind quicker than the eye flew to the outlook place upon that roof where he had so often climbed as a boy and surveyed the fair champaign country beyond it meadow and wood fallow and cornland all of which were for him involved in that answer he did not stop turning butso quick is the working of the mindhe changed the nature of his answer the real presence of the demon of greed chased away the poor angelic shadows  it would not be much of a sacrifice for you angela to go through this form he is a dying man and you need not even change your name the lands are mine by right and will be yours it will break my heart to lose them after all these years of toiling to save enough to buy them but i do not wish to force you in short i leave the matter to your generosity as you would have left it to mine  and suppose that i were to marry my cousin george and he were not to die after all what would be my position then you must clearly understand that to save us all from starvation i would never be his wife  you need not trouble yourself with the question he is a dead man in two months time he will be in the family vault  she bowed her head and left himleft him with his hot and glowing greed behind which crept a terror  next morning george caresfoot received the following letter                                             bratham abbey may 5   dear cousin george   in reply to your letter i must tell you that i am willing to go   through the form of marriage with youat a registryoffice not   in churchin order to enable you to carry out the property   arrangements you wish to make you must however clearly   understand that i do not do this on my own account but simply   and solely to benefit my father who has left the matter to my   generosity i must ask you as a preliminary step to make a copy   of and sign the enclosed letter addressed to me our lives are in   the hand of god and it is possible that you might be restored to   health in such an event however improbable it may seem it   cannot be made too plain that i am not and have never in any   sense undertaken to be your wife                                          truly yours                                               angela caresfoot   the enclosure ran as follows    i george caresfoot hereby solemnly promise before god that under   no possible circumstance will i attempt to avail myself of any   rights over my cousin angela caresfoot and that i will leave her   as soon as the formal ceremony is concluded and never again   attempt to see her except by her own wish the socalled marriage   being only contemplated in order to enable me to carry out certain   business arrangements which in view of the failing state of my   health i am anxious to enter into   this letter and its curious enclosure surely the oddest marriage contract which was ever penned george trembling with excitement thrust into the hands of lady bellamy she read them with a dark smile  the bird is springed she said quietly it has been a close thing but i told you that i should not fail as i have warned you of what will follow your success sign this paperthis wastepaperand return it                                 chapter liii  by return of post angela received her strange agreement duly copied and signed and after this the preparations for the marriage went on rapidly but where such a large transaction is concerned as the sale of between three and four thousand acres of land copyhold and freehold together with sundry rentcharges and the lordship of six manors things cannot be done in a minute  both george and philip and their respective lawyerssir john would have nothing to do with the matterdid their best to expedite matters but unfortunately some legal difficulty arose in connection with the transfer and who can hurry the ponderous and capricious machinery of the law  at length it became clear to all concerned except angela that it would be impossible for the marriage to take place before the eighth of june and it also became clear that that was the last possible day on which it could take place george begged philip by letter being too ill to come and see him to allow the marriage to be gone through with at once and have the business transactions finished afterwards but to this philip would not consent the titledeeds he said must be in his possession before it took place otherwise he would have no marriage george had therefore no option but to accept his terms  when angela was told of the date fixed for the ceremonyshe would not allow the word marriage to be mentioned in connection with itshe at first created considerable consternation by quietly announcing that she would not have it performed until the tenth of june at last however when matters were growing serious and when she had treated all the pressure that it was possible to put upon her with quiet indifferencefor as usual her father declined to interfere but contented himself with playing a strictly passive partshe suddenly of her own mere motion abolished the difficulty by consenting to appear before the registrar on the eighth of june as george wished  her reasons for having objected to this date in the first instance will be easily guessed it was the day before the anniversary of arthurs departure an anniversary which it was her fancy to dedicate solely to his memory but as the delay appearedthough she could not altogether understand whyto put others to great inconvenience and as georges state of health had become such as to render postponement even for a couple of days of doubtful expediency and as moreover she decided on reflection that she could better give her thoughts to her dead lover when she had gone through with the grim farce that hung over her she suddenly changed her mind  occasionally they brought her documents to sign and she signed them without a question but on the whole she treated the affair with considerable apathy the truth being that it was repugnant to her mind which she preferred to occupy with other and very different thoughts so she let it go she knew that she was going to do a thing which was dreadful to her because she believed it to be her duty but she comforted herself with the reflection that she was amply secured against all possible contingencies by her previous agreement with george angelas knowledge of the marriagelaw of her country and of what constituted a legal document was not extensive  for this same reason because it was distasteful she had never said anything of her contemplated marriage to pigott and it was quite unknown in the neighbourhood since the miss lee scandal and his consequent disinheritance nobody had visited philip caresfoot and those who took interest in him or his affairs were few indeed the matter had been kept a dead secret but on the seventh of june being the day previous to the ceremony angela went down to her nurses cottage and told her what was about to be done suppressing however from various motives all mention of her agreement with george it added to her depression to find that pigott was unaccountably disturbed at the news  well miss she saidlord to think that i shant be able to call you that no longeri havent got nothing in particular to say agin it seeing that sure enough the mans adying as i has on good authority from my own aunts cousin her that does the servants washing up at the hall and mighty bad she does it begging of her pardon for the disparagement and so he wont trouble you for long and somehow it do seem as though you hadnt got no choice left in the matter just as though everybody and everything was aquietly pushing you into it but miss somehow i dont like it to be plain a marriage as aint no marriage aint altogether natural like and in an office too along with a man as you would not touch with a pair of tongs and that man on his last leg im right down sorry if i makes you feel uncomfortable dearie but bless me i dont know how it is but when a thing sticks in my mind im as bound to hawk it up as though it were a bone in my throat  i dont like it any more than you do nurse but perhaps you dont understand all about the property being concerned and about its having to pass away from my father if i dont do this i care nothing about the property but he left it to my generosity arthur is dead and he left it to my generosity nurse what could i do  well miss youre acting according to what you thinks right and due to your father which is more nor i does and poor dead mr arthur up in heaven there will make a note of that there aint no manner of doubt and somehow it do seem that things cant be allowed to go wrong with you my dear seeing how youre asacrificing of yourself and of your wishes to benefit others  this conversation did not tend to put angela into better spirits but she felt that it was now too late to recede  whilst angela was talking to pigott sir john and lady bellamy were paying a call at isleworth they found george lying on the sofa in the diningroom in which though it was the first week in june a fire was burning on the hearth he bore all the signs of a man in the last stage of consumption the hollow cough the emaciation and the hectic hue upon his face all spoke with no uncertain voice  well caresfoot you scarcely look like a bridegroom i must say said little sir john looking as pleased as though he had made an eminently cheerful remark  no but i am stronger than i look marriage will cure me  humph will it then you will be signally fortunate  dont croak bellamy i am happy todaythere is fire dancing along my veins just think this time tomorrow angela will be my legal wife  well you appear to have given a good price for the privilege if what anne tells me is correct to sell the isleworth estates for fifty thousand is to sell them for a hundred and fifty thousand less than they are worth consequently the girl costs you a hundred and fifty thousand poundsa long figure that for one girl  bah you are a coldblooded fellow bellamy cant you understand that there is a positive delight in ruining oneself for the woman one loves and then think how she will love me when she comes to understand what she has cost me i can see her now she will come and kiss memind you kiss me of her own free willand say george you are a noble fellow george you are a lover that any woman may be proud of no price was too heavy for you yes that is what she will say that sort of thing you know  sir johns merry little eye twinkled with inexpressible amusement and his wifes full lips curled with unutterable contempt  you are counting your kisses before they are paid for she said does philip come here this afternoon to sign the deeds  yes they are in the next room will you come and see them  yes i will will you come john  no thank you i dont wish to be treated to any more of your ladyships omens i have long ago washed my hands of the whole business i will stop here and read the times  they went out george leaning on lady bellamys arm  no sooner had they gone than sir john put down the times and listened intently then he rose and slipped the bolt of that door which opened into the hall thereby halving his chances of interruption next listening at every step his round face which was solemn enough now stretched forward and looking for all the world like that of some whiskered puss advancing on a creamjug he crept on tiptoe to the iron safe in the corner of the room arrived there he listened again and then drew a little key from his pocket and inserted it in the lock it turned without difficulty  beautiful murmured sir john but now comes the rub taking another key he inserted it in the lock of the subdivision it would not turn one more chance he said as he tried a second ah and open came the lid rapidly he extracted two thick bundles of letters they were in lady bellamys handwriting then he relocked the subdivision and the safe itself and put the keys away in his trousers and the packets in his coattail pockets one in each that they might not bulge suspiciously next he unbolted the door and returning gave way to paroxysms of exultation too deep for words  at last he said stretching his fat little fist towards the room where george was with lady bellamy at last after twenty years of waiting you are in my power my lady time has brought its revenge and if before you are fortyeight hours older you do not make acquaintance with a bitterness worse than death then my name is not john bellamy i will repay you every jot and with interest too my lady  then he calmed himself and ringing a bell told the servant to tell lady bellamy that he had walked on home when an hour and a half later she reached rewtham house she found that her husband had been suddenly summoned to london on a matter of business    that night in her desolation angela cast herself upon the floor with outstretched arms and wept for her dead lover and for the shame which overshadowed her and the moon travelling up the sky struck her shining coldly on her snowy robe and rounded formglinting on the stormy gold of her loosed hairflooding all the room with light till the white floor gleamed like a silver shrine and she lay there a weeping saint then she rose and crept to such rest as utter weariness of body and mind can give    all that night too george caresfoot paced hungryeyed up and down up and down the length of his great room his gaze fixed on the windows which commanded bratham like that of some caged tiger on a desired prey  tomorrow he kept muttering till the first ray of the rising sun fell bloodred upon his wasted form and then bathing his thin hands in its beams he sank down exhausted crying exultingly not tomorrow but today    that night lady bellamy sat at an open window rising continually to turn her dark eyes upon the starry heavens above her  it is of no use she said at last my knowledge fails me my calculations are baffled by a quantity i cannot trace i am face to face with a combination that i cannot solve let me try once more ah supposing that the unknown quantity is a directing will which at the crisis shatters laws and overrides even the immutability of the unchanging stars i have heard of such a thing let me change the positions of our opposing planets and then see it would all be clear as day george vanishes that i knew before she sails triumphant through overshadowing influences towards a silver sky and i is it death that awaits me no but some great change there the pale light of my fading star would fall into her bright track bah my science fails i can no longer prophesy my knowledge only tells me of great events of what use is such knowledge as that well come what may fate will find one spirit that does not fear him as for this and she pointed towards the symbols and calculations i have done with it henceforth i will devote myself to the only real powers which can enlighten us yet there is humiliation in failure after so many years of study it is folly to follow a partial truth of which we miss the keynote though we sometimes blunder on its harmonies                                 chapter liv  the arrangement for the morrow was that angela and her father were to take a fly to roxham where the registry office was and whither george was also to be conveyed in a close carriage that the ceremony was then to be gone through after which the parties were to separate and return to their respective homes mr fraser had been asked to attend but had excused himself from doing so  in pursuance of this programme angela and her father left the abbey house about ten oclock and drove in silence to the town strange as it may seem angela had never been in a town before and in the curious condition of her mind the new sight of busy streets interested her greatly and served to divert her attention till they reached the door of the office she alighted and was shown with philip into a waitingroom and here for some unexplained reason a great fear took hold of her a terror of this ceremony which now loomed large and lifelike before her  father she said suddenly after a moment of irresolution i am going home i will not go on with this business  what can you mean angela  i mean what i say i never realized how dreadful it all was till now it has come upon me like a revelation come i am going  angela dont be a fool you forget that george will be here in a minute and that the settlements are all signed  then he can go back again and the settlements can be torn up i will not go on with it  philip was by this time almost beside himself with anxiety after having thus with thought and toil and by the aid of a blessed chance lifted this delicious cup to his lips was it to be dashed from him were the sweet dreams so near approaching to realization in which he had been wrapped for so many days all to be dissipated into thin air was he to lose the land after all after he had fingeredoh how lovinglythe yellow titledeeds for alas the sale depended on the marriage it could not be neither fate nor angela could be so cruel he turned upon her with the boldness of despair  angela you must not go on like this after having agreed to the thing of your own free will think of what it involves for me if you refuse to marry him now at the last moment i shall lose the isleworth estates heavens to think that so much property should be dependent upon the mere whim of a girl cannot you have a little consideration for others beside yourself do you really mean to sacrifice the hopes of my whole life to throw away the only opportunity i can ever have of righting my wrongs in order to gratify a sentimental whim for gods sake think a little first before you sacrifice me you promised to do it  never before had angela seen her father so strongly excited he was positively shaking with agitation she looked at him steadily and with such contempt that even in his excitement he quailed before her  very well then i will carry out my promise dreadful as it is to me but remember that it is only because you beg it and that the responsibility of its consequences must always remain with you now are you satisfiedyou will get your land  philips dark face assumed a look of fervent gratitude but before he had time to reply a messenger came to say that the gentleman was waiting  her resolve once taken angela followed him with an untroubled face into the room where the registrar a gentleman neatly dressed in black was sitting at a sort of desk here the first thing her glance fell upon was the person of george caresfoot although it was now the second week in june he wore a respirator over his mouth and a scarf round his neck and coughed very much these were the first things she noticed the next was that he was much thinner so thin that the cheekbones stood out from the level of his face whilst the little bloodshot eyes seemed to protrude giving to his general appearance even with the mouth his worst feature hidden by the respirator an unusually repulsive look he was leaning on the arm of lady bellamy who greeted angela with a smile which the latter fancied had something of triumph in it  with the exception of the messenger who played the part of clerk in this civil ceremony there was nobody else in the room no greetings were interchanged and in another moment angela was standing dressed in her funeral black by georges side before the registrar and the ceremony had begun  but from that moment although her beautiful face preserved its composure she scarcely saw or heard anything of what was going on it was as though all the streams of thought in her brain had burst their banks and mingled in a great and turbulent current she was filled with thought but could seize upon no one idea whilst within her mind she heard a sound as of the continuous whirring of broken machinery  objects and individuals real and imagined presented themselves before her mental vision expanded till they filled the heavens with their bulk and then shrank and shrank and vanished into nothing the word wife struck upon her ears and seemed to go wailing away wife wife wife through all the illimitable halls of sound till they were filled with echoes and sound itself fell dead against the silence of the stars    it was done she awoke to find herself a married woman lady bellamy stepped forward with the same halftriumphant smile with which she had greeted angela hovering about her lips  let me congratulate you mrs caresfoot she said indeed i think i am privileged to do so for if i remember right i was the first to prophesy this happy event and then dropping her voice so that angela alone could hear her do you not remember that i told you that you would as certainly come to the altar rails within nine months with george caresfoot as you would to your deathbed i said that nine months ago today  angela started as though she had been stung  events have been too strong for me she murmured but all this is nothing but a form a form that can now be forgotten  again lady bellamy smiled as she answered  oh of course mrs caresfoot nothing but a form  angelas eye fell upon the ring on her finger she tore it off  take this back she said i have done with it  a married woman must wear a ring mrs caresfoot  she hurled it upon the floor  just then george and philip returned from a little backroom where they had been with the registrar who still remained behind to sign the certificate george advanced upon his wife with a dreadful smile on his features removing the respirator as he came his object was to kiss her but she divined it and caught her father by the arm  father she said protect me from this man  protect you angela why he is your husband  my husband have you all agreed to drive me mad  lady bellamy saw that if something were not done quickly there would be a shocking scene which was the last thing she wanted so she seized george and whispered in his ear after which he followed her sulkily turning round from time to time to look at angela  on her way from roxham lady bellamy stopped her carriage at the telegraph office and went in and wrote a telegram  i respect that woman and she shall have her chance she said as she reread it previous to handing it to the clerk  three hours later mildred carr received the following message at madeira    from a b to mrs carr quinta carr madeira   angela c married her cousin g c this morning   that night lady bellamy dined at isleworth with george caresfoot the dinner passed over in almost complete silence george was evidently plunged in thought and could not eat though he drank a good deal lady bellamy ate and thought too after the servants had gone she began to speak  i want my price george she said  what do you mean  i mean what i say you are now angela caresfoots husband give me back those letters as you promised i am impatient to break my chains he hesitated george she said in a warning voice do not dare to play with me i warn you that your power over me is not what it used to be give me back those letters i have done your wicked work for you and will have my pay  all right anne and so you shall when will you have them  now this instant  but i have not got my keys  you forget your keys are on your watchchain  ah to be sure so they are you wont turn round on me when you get them will you anne  why should i turn on you i wish to get the letters and if i can to have done with you  he went with a somewhat hesitating step to the iron safe in the corner of the room and opened it the he opened the subdivision and rummaged about there for a while at last he looked up  it is very curious anne he said in a halffrightened voice but i cant find them  george give me those letters  i cant find them anne i cant find them if you dont believe me come and look for yourself somebody must have taken them  she advanced and did as he said it was evident that the letters were not there  once before when you were ill you hid them where have you hidden them now  i havent hidden them anne i havent indeed  she turned slowly and looked him full in the eyes her own face was ashy pale with fury but she said never a word her silence was more terrible than words then she raised her hands and covered her eyes for a while presently she dropped them and said in a singularly soft voice  it is over now  what do you mean he asked fearfully for she terrified him  i mean a great deal george caresfoot i mean that something has snapped the bond which bound me to you i mean that i no longer fear you that i have done with you use your letters if you will you can harm me no more i have passed out of the region of your influence out of the reach of your revenge i look on you now and wonder what the link was between us for there was a mysterious link that i cannot tell but this i can tell you i have let go your hand and you are going to fall down a great precipice george a precipice of which i cannot see the foot yes it is right that you should cower before me now i have cowered before you for more than twenty years you made me what i am i am going into the next room now till my carriage comes i did not order it till halfpast ten do not follow me but before i go i will tell you something and you know i do not make mistakes you will never sleep under this roof again george caresfoot and we shall not meet again alive you have had a long day but your hour has struck  who told you that woman he asked furiously  last night i read it in the stars tonight i read it in your face  and again she looked at him long and steadily as he crouched in the chair before her and then slowly left the room  after awhile he roused himself and began to drink wine furiously  curse her he said as the fumes mounted into his brain curse her she is trying to frighten me with her infernal magic but she shant i know what she is at but i will be beforehand with her and staggering under the mingled influence of drink and excitement he rose and left the house  lady bellamy sat in the drawingroom and waited for her carriage at last she heard the wheels upon the gravel then she rose and rapidly did something to the great lamp upon the paperstrewn table as she shut the door she turned  that will do she said  in the hall she met the servant coming to announce the carriage  is your master still in the diningroom she asked  no my lady  she laughed a little and civilly bade the man goodnight                                  chapter lv  outside the door of the registryoffice angela and her father had to make their way through a crowd of small boys who had by some means or other found out that a wedding was going on inside and stood waiting there animated by the intention of cheering the bride and the certain hope of sixpences but when they saw angela her stately form robed in black and her sweet face betraying the anguish of her mind the sight shocked their sense of the fitness of things and they slipped off without a word indeed a butchers boy with a turn for expressive language remarked in indignation to another of his craft so soon as they had recovered their spirits  call that a weddin bill why its more like afuneral with the plumes off and as for the gal though shes a clipper her face was as pale as a long uns  angela never quite knew how she got back to the abbey house she only remembered that she was by herself in the fly her father preferring to travel on the box alone with the coachman nor could she ever quite remember how she got through the remainder of that day she was quite mazed but at length it passed and the night came and she was thankful for the night  about nine oclock she went up to her bedroom at the top of the house it had served as a nursery for many generations of caresfoots indeed during the last three centuries hundreds of little feet had pattered over the old wormeaten boards but the little feet had long since gone to dust and the only signs of childrens play and merriment left about the place were the numberless scratches nicks and letters cut in the old panelling and even on the beams which supported the low ceiling  it was a lonesome room for a young girl or indeed for anybody whose nerves were not of the strongest nobody slept upon that floor or in the rooms beneath it philip occupying a little closet which joined his study on the ground floor all the other rooms were closed and tenanted only by rats that made unearthly noises in their emptiness as for jakes and his wife the only servants on the place they occupied a room over the washhouse which was separate from the main building angela was therefore practically alone in a great house and might have been murdered a dozen times over without the fact being discovered for hours this did not however trouble her much simply because she paid no heed to the noises in the house and was singularly free from fear of any kind  on reaching her room she sat down and began to think of arthur and as she thought her mind grew clearer and more at peace indeed it seemed to her that her dead lover was near and as though she could distinguish pulsations of thought which came from him impinging on her system and bringing his presence with them it is a common sensation and occurs to many people of sensitive organization when asleep or thinking on some one with whom they are in a high state of sympathy and doubtless indicates some occult communication but as it chanced it had never before visited angela in this form and she abandoned herself to its influence with delight it thrilled her through and through  how long she sat thus she could not tell but presently the communication whatever it was stopped as suddenly as though the connecting link had been severed the currents directed by her will would no longer do her bidding they could not find their object or frighted by some adverse influence recoiled in confusion on her brain several times she tried to renew this subtle intercourse that was so palpable and real and yet so different from anything else in the world but failed then she rose feeling very tired for those who thus draw upon the vital energies must pay the penalty of exhaustion she took her bible and read her nightly chapter and then undressed and said her prayers praying with unusual earnestness that it might please the almighty in his wisdom to take her to where her lover was her prayers done she rose put on a white dressing wrapper and seating herself before the glass unloosed her hair then she began to brush it pausing presently to think how arthur had admired its colour and the ripples on it she had been much more careful of her hair since then and smiled sadly to herself at her folly for being so  thinking thus she fell into a reverie and sat so still that a great grey rat came noiselessly out of his hole in a corner of the room and advancing into the circle of light round the dressingtable sat up on his hind legs to see if he was alone suddenly he turned and scuttled back to his hole in evident alarm and at the same second angela thought that she heard a sound of a different character from those she was accustomed to in the old housea sound like the creaking of a boot it passed however but left an indefinable dread creeping over her and chilling the blood in her veins she began to expect something she knew not what and was fascinated by the expectation she would have risen to lock the door but all strength seemed to have left her she was paralysed by the near sense of evil then came a silence as intense as it was lonely  it was a ghastly moment  her back was towards the doorway for her dressingtable was immediately opposite the door which was raised some four feet above the level of the landing and approached by as many steps  gradually her eyes became riveted on the glass before her for in it she thought that she saw the door move next second she was sure that it was moving very slowly the hinges took an age to turn what could be behind it at last it was open and in the glass angela saw framed in darkness the head and shoulders of george caresfoot at first she believed that her mind deceived her that it was an apparition no there was no mistake but the respirator the hollow cough and decrepitude of the morningwhere were they  with horror in her heart she turned and faced him seeing that he was observed he staggered into the room with a step which was half drunken and half jaunty but which belied the conflict of passions written on his brow he spokehis voice sounded hoarse and hollow and was illtuned to his words  you did not expect me perhapswonder how i got here jakes let me in he has got a proper respect for marital rights has jakes you looked so pretty i could not make up my mind to disturb you quite a romantic meeting is it not  you are a dying man how did you come here  dying my dear wife not a bit of it i am no more dying than you are i have been ill it is true but that is only because you have fretted me so the dying was only a little ruse to get your consent all is fair in love and war you know and of course you never really believed in that precious agreement that was nothing but a bit of maidenly shyness eh  angela stood still as a stone a look of horror on her face  then you dont know what you have cost me your fathers price was a hundred and fifty thousand at least that is what it came to the old shark it isnt every man who would come down like for a girl now is it it shows a generous mind doesnt it  still she uttered not a syllable  angela he said changing his tone to one of hoarse earnestness dont look at me like that because even if you are a bit put out at the trick i have played you just think it was because i loved you so much angela i couldnt help it i couldnt really it is not every man who would go through all that i have gone through for you it is no joke to sham consumption for three months i can tell you but we will have many a laugh over that why dont you answer me instead of standing there just like the andromeda in my study  the simile was an apt one the statue of the girl awaiting her awful fate wore the same hopeless helpless look of vacant terror which was upon angelas face now but its mention recalled lady bellamy and the ominous incident in which that statue had figured and he hastened to drown recollection in action  come he said you will forgive me wont you it was all done for love of you and he moved towards her  as he came she seemed to collect her energies the fear left her face and in its stead there shone a great and awful blaze of indignation  her brush was still in her hand and as he drew near she dashed it full into his face it was but a light thing and only staggered him but it gave her time to pass him and reach the still open door bare footed she fled like the wind down the passages and down the stairs uttering an oath he followed her but as she went she remembered that she could not run upon the gravel with her naked feet and with this in her mind she turned to bay by a large window that gave light to the firstfloor landing immediately opposite which was the portrait of devil caresfoot it was unbolted and with a single movement of the hand she flung it open and stood panting by it in the full light of the moon in another moment he was upon her furious at the blow and his face contorted with passion  stop she cried and listen to me before i will allow you to touch me with a single finger i will spring from here i would rather thrust myself into the hands of providence than into yours monster and perjured liar that you are  he stopped as she bade him and commenced to pace round and round her in a semicircle glaring at her with wild eyes  if you jump from there he said you will only break your limbs it is not high enough to kill you you are my wife dont you understand you are my legal wife the law is on my side no one can help you no one you are mine in the sight of the whole world  but not yours in the sight of god it is to him that i now appeal get back  she stretched out her arm and with her golden hair glimmering in the moonlight her white robes and the anger on her face looked like some avenging angel driving a fiend to hell he shrank away from her and there came a pause and save for their heavy breathing stillness again fell upon the house whilst the picture that hung above them seemed in the half light to follow them with its fierce eyes as though it were a living thing  the landing where they stood looked upon the hall below at the end of which was philips study suddenly its door burst open and philip himself passed through it grasping a candlestick in one hand and some parchments in the other his features were dreadful to see resembling those of a dumb thing in torture his eyes protruded his livid lips moved but no sound came from them he staggered across the hall with terror staring from his face  father father called angela but he took no noticehe did not even seem to hear  presently they heard the candlestick thrown with a clash upon the hall pavement then the front door slammed and he was gone and at that moment a great ruddy glow shot up the western sky then a tongue of flame then another and another  see said angela with a solemn laugh i did not appeal for help in vain  isleworth hall was in flames                                 chapter lvi  arthur did not delay his departure from madeira the morning following mildreds ball he embarked on board a portuguese boat a very dirty craft which smelt of garlic and rancid oil and sailed for lisbon he arrived there safely and mooned about that city for a while himself a monument of serious reflections and then struck across into spain where he spent a month or so inspecting the historical beauties of that fallen country thence he penetrated across the pyrenees into southern france which was pleasant in the spring months here he remained another month meeting with no adventures worthy of any note and improving his knowledge of the french language tiring at last of this he travelled to paris and went to the theatres but found his own thoughts too absorbing to allow of his taking any keen interest in their sensationalisms so after a brief stay he made his way up to brittany and normandy and went in for inspecting old castles and cathedrals and finally ended up his continental travels by spending a week on the island rock of saint michel  this place pleased him more than any he had visited he liked to wander about among the massive granite pillars of that noble ecclesiastical fortress and at night to watch the phosphoric tide come rushing in with all the speed of a racehorse over the wide sands which separate it from the mainland there the thirtyfirst day of may found him and he bethought him that it was time to return to london and see about getting the settlements drawn and ordering the wedding bouquet to speak the truth he thought more about the bouquet than the settlements  he arrived in london on the first of june and went to see his family lawyer a certain mr borley who had been solicitor to the trust during his minority  bless me heigham how like your father you have grown said that legal gentleman as soon as arthur was ensconced in the clients chair a chair that had it been endowed with the gift of speech could have told some surprising stories it seems only the other day that he was sitting there dictating the terms of his will and yet that was before the crimean war more than twenty years ago well my boy what is it  arthur thus encouraged entered into a rather blundering recital of the circumstances of his engagement  mr borley did not say much but from his manner and occasional comments it was evident that he considered the whole story very odd regarding it indeed with some suspicion  i must tell you frankly mr heigham he said at last i dont quite understand this business the young lady no doubt is charming young ladies looking at them from my clients point of view always arebut i cant say i like your story about her father why did you not tell me all this before i might then have been able to give you some advice worth having or at any rate to make a few confidential he laid great emphasis on the word confidentialinquiries  arthur replied that it had not occurred to him to do so  umph pitygreat pity but there is no time for that sort of thing now if you think you are going to get married on the tenth so i suppose the only thing to do is to go through with it and await the upshot what do you wish done  arthur explained his views which apparently included settling all his property on his bride in the most absolute fashion possible to this mr borley forcibly objected and in the end arthur had to give way and make such arrangements as the old gentleman thought proper arrangements differing considerably from those proposed by himself  this interview over he had other and pleasanter duties to perform such as ordering his wedding clothes making arrangements with a florist for the bridal bouquet and last but not least having his mothers diamonds reset as a present for his bride  but still the days went very slowly there seemed to be no end to them he had no relations to go and see and in his present anxious excited state he preferred to avoid his friends and club acquaintances fifth sixth seventh never did a schoolboy await the coming of the day that marked the advent of his holidays with such intense anxiety  at length the eighth of june arrived months before he had settled what his programme should be on that day his promise as the reader may remember forbade him to see angela till the ninth that is at any hour after twelve on the night of the eighth or practically as early as possible on the following morning now the earliest train would not get him down to roxham till eleven oclock which would involve a wicked waste of four or five hours of daylight that might be spent with angela so he wisely resolved to start on the evening of the eighth by a train leaving paddington at six oclock and reaching roxham at nine  the day he spent in signing the settlements finally interviewing the florist and giving him directions as to forwarding the wedding bouquet which was to be composed of orangeblossoms lilies of the valley and stephanois and in getting the marriagelicense but notwithstanding these manifold employments he managed to be three quarters of an hour before his train the longest fortyfive minutes he ever spent  he had written to the proprietor of the inn at rewtham where he had slept a year ago the night after he had left isleworth to send a gig to meet him at the station and on arriving at roxham a porter told him that a trap was waiting for him on emerging from the station even in the darkness he was able to recognize the outlines of the identical vehicle which had conveyed him to the abbey house some thirteen months ago whilst the sound of an ancient quavering voice informed him that the jehu was likewise the same his luggage was soon bundled up behind and the steadygoing old nag departed into the darkness  well sam do you remember me  well no sir i cant rightly say how i do wait a bit beant you the gemman as travels in the dry line and as i seed akissing the chambermaid  no i dont travel at present and i have not kissed a chambermaid for some time do you remember driving a gentleman over to the abbey house a year or so ago  why yes in course i does lord now and be you he and we seed old devils caresfoots granddaughter ah manys the time that he has damned me and all so soft and pleasant like but it was his eyes that did the trick they was awful just awful and you gave me halfa crown you did but somehow i thought i heard summat about you sir but i cant rightly remember what it be my head not being so good as it used to  perhaps you heard what i was going to be married  no i dont think how as it was that neither  well never mind me have you seen miss caresfootthe young lady you saw the day you drove me to the abbey houseanywhere about lately  arthur waited for the old mans lingering answer with all his heart upon his lips  lor yes sir that i have i saw her this morning driving through the roxham marketplace  and how did she look  a bit pale i thought sir but well enough and wonnerful handsome  arthur gave a sigh of relief he felt like a man who has just come scatheless through some horrible crisis and once more knows the sweet sensation of safety what a load the old mans words had lifted from his mind in his active imagination he had pictured all sorts of evils which might have happened to angela during his year of absence lovers are always prone to such imaginings and not altogether without reason for there would seem to be a special power of evil that devotes itself to the derangement of their affairs and the ingenious disappointment of their hopes but now the vague dread was gone angela was not spirited away or dead and to know her alive was to know her faithful  as they drove along the old ostler continued to volunteer various scraps of information which fell upon his ears unheeded till presently his attention was caught by the name caresfoot  what about him he asked quickly  he be adying they do say  which of them  why the redhaired one him as lives up at the hall yonder  poor fellow said arthur feeling quite fond of george in his happiness  they had by this time reached the inn where he had some supper for old sams good news had brought back his appetite which of late had not been quite up to par and then went straight to his room that faced towards the abbey house it was he noticed the same in which he had slept the year before and looking at the bed he remembered his dream and smiled as he thought that the wood was passed and before him lay nothing but the flowery meadows mildred carr too crossed his mind but of her he did not think much not that he was by any means heartlessindeed what had happened had pained him acutely the more so because his own conscience told him he had been a fool he was very sorry but love being here below one of the most selfish of the passions he had not time to be sorry just then  for just on the horizon he could distinguish a dense mass which was the trees surrounding the abbey house and between the trees there glimmered a faint light which might proceed from some rising star or from angelas window he preferred to believe it was the latter the propinquity made him very happy what was she doing he wondered sitting by her window and thinking of him he would ask her on the morrow it was worth while going through that year of separation in order to taste the joy of meeting it seemed like a dream to think that within sixandthirty hours he would probably be angelas husband and how nobody in the world would be able to take her away from him he stretched out his arms towards her  my darling my darling he cried aloud into the still night my darling my darling the echo answered sadly                                 chapter lvii  that night arthur dreamed no evil dreams but he thought he heard a sound outside his door and some one speak of fire hearing nothing more he turned and went to sleep again waking in the early dawn he felt ere yet his senses fully came a happy sense of something he knew not what a rosy shadow of coming joy such as will only with more intensity fall upon our quickened faculties when death ended our souls begin to stir as we awaken to eternity  he sprang from his bed and his eye fell on a morocco case upon the dressingtable it contained the diamonds which he had had reset as a wedding present to angela they were nothing compared with mildred carrs but still extremely handsome their beauty being enhanced by the elegance of the setting which was in the shape of a snake with emerald head and ruby eyes so constructed as to clasp tightly round angelas shapely throat  the sight of the jewellery at once recalled his present circumstances and he knew that the long hour of trial was passedhe was about to meet angela having dressed himself as quickly as he could he took up the jewelcase but finding it too large to stow away he opened it and taking out the necklace crammed it into his pocket thus armed he slipped down the stairs past the open common room where the light shone through the cracks in the shutters on a dismal array of sticky beermugs and spirit glasses down the sanded passage into the village street  it was full daylight now and the sun never looked upon a lovelier morning the air was warm but there was that sharp freshness in it which is needful to make summer weather perfect and which we always miss by breakfasting at nine oclock the sky was blue just flecked with little clouds the dewdrops sparkled upon every leaf and blade of grass touches of mist clung about the hollows and the sweet breath of the awakened earth was full of the perfect scent of an english june which is in its way even more delicious than the spicy odours of the tropics it was a morning to make sick men well and men happy and atheists believers in a creative hand how much more than did it fire arthurs pulses already bounding with youth and health with an untold joy  he felt like a child again so free from care so happy except that his heart swelled with a love beyond the knowledge of children his quick temperament had rebounded from the depths of unequal depression into which it so often fell to the heights of a happy assurance the tantalus cup was at his lips at last and he would drink his full be sure his eyes flashed and sparkled his foot fell light and quick as an antelopes his brown cheek glowednever had he looked so handsome angela would not forget her promise she would be waiting for him by the lake he was sure of that and thither he made his way through the morning sunshine they were happy moments  presently he passed into the parish of bratham and his eye fell upon a neat red brick cottage a garden planted with sunflowers and a bright gravel path running to the rustic gate he thought the garden charmingly oldfashioned and had just entered a mental note to ask angela who lived there when the door opened and figure he knew emerged bearing a mat in one hand and a mopstick in the other he was some way off and at first could not quite distinguish who it was but before she had come to the gate he recognized pigott by this time she had stepped into the road and was making elaborate preparations to dust her mat so that she did not see him till he spoke to her  how are you pigott what may you be doing down here why are you not up at the abbey  she gave a cry and the mat and mopstick fell from her hands  mr heigham she said in an awed voice that chilled his blood what has brought you back and why do you come to me i never wronged you  what are you talking about i have come to marry angela of course we are going to be married tomorrow  oh then its really you sir and she married yesterdayoh good god  dont laugh at me nurseplease dont laugh itit upsets me why do you shake so what do you mean  meani mean that my angela married her cousin george caresfoot at roxham yesterday heaven forgive me for having to tell it you  reader have you ever mortally wounded a head of large game you hear your bullet thud upon the living flesh and see the creature throw up its head and stagger for a moment and then plunge forward with desperate speed crashing through bush and reeds as though they were meadowgrass follow him awhile and you will find him standing quite still breathing in great sighs his back humped and his eye dim the gore trickling from his nostrils he is dyingbut be careful he means mischief before he dies  any great shock mental or physical is apt to reduce man to the level of his brother beasts arthur for instance behaved very much like a wounded buffalo as soon as the stun of the blow passed away and the rending pain began to make itself felt for a few seconds he gazed before him stupid and helpless then his face turned quite grey the eyes and nostrils gaped wide and a curious rigidity took possession of his muscles  the road he was following led to a branching lane the same that angela was turning up that misty christmas eve when she saw lady bellamy glide past in her carriage this lane had in former ages no doubt to judge from its numerous curves been an ancient forestpath and it ran to the little bridge over the stream that fed the lakea point that by travelling as the crow flies from pigotts cottage might be reached in half the time this fact arthur seemed at that dreadful moment to suddenly realize more probably from natural instinct than from any particular knowledge of the lay of the land he did not speak again to pigott and she was too frightened at his face to speak to him he only looked at her but she never forgot that look so long as she lived then he turned like a mad thing and went crash through the thick fence that hedged the road and ran at full speed towards the lake diverging neither to the right nor to the left but breaking his way without the slightest apparent difficulty through everything that opposed him  very soon he came to the little bridge and here struck by some new instinct he halted he did not appear to be out of breath but he leaned on the rail of the bridge and groaned like a dying man his ghastly face made a blot in the mimic scenery of the place which was really very pretty the bridge commanded no view for the little creek it spanned and into which the stream ran gave a turn before it grew into the neck of the lake but it was hedged in by greenery and the still pool beneath it was starred with waterlilies turning their innocent eyes up to the blue sky and looking as peaceful as though there were no stormy winds or waters in the world to toss them amongst these waterlilies a moorhen had built her nest and presently she came clucking out right under arthurs feet followed by ten or a dozen little hurrying black balls each tipped with sealingwax red she looked very happy with her broodas happy as the lilies and the blue skyand the sight made him savage he took up a large stone that lay by him and threw it at her it hit her on the back and killed her and arthur laughed loud as he watched her struggle and then lie still while the motherless chicks hurried frightened away and yet since he was a boy he had never till now wantonly injured any living creature  presently the dead waterhen floated out of sight and he roused himself straightened his clothes which had been somewhat torn and deranged and with a steady step and a fixed smile upon his lips went forward no longer at a run but walking quietly up the path that led to the big oak and shaded glen in five minutes he was there  again he paused and looked there was something to see on one of the stone seats dressed in black her face deathly pale her head resting on her hand and trouble in her eyes sat angela on the other was her constant companion the dog which he had given her he remembered how a little more than a year before she had surprised him in the same way and he had looked upon her and loved her he could even smile at the strange irony of fate that had under such curiously reversed circumstances brought him back to surprise her to look upon her and hate her  she moved uneasily and glanced round but he was hidden by a bush then she half rose paused irresolutely and as though struggling against something foolish sat determinedly down again when arthur had done smiling he came forward a few steps into the open feeling that his face was all drawn and changed as indeed it was it was the face of a man of fifty his eyes were fire and his heart was ice  she turned her head and looked up with a shrinking in her eyes as though she feared to see something hatefula shrinking which turned first to wonder then to dread then to a lively joy and then again to awe she rose mechanically with a great gasp her lips parted as though to speak but no words came the dog too saw him and growled then ran up and sniffed and leaped upon him with a yelp of joy he waved it down and there was something in the gesture that frightened the beast it shrank behind him then he spoke in a clear hard tonenot his own voice she thought  angela is this true are you married  oh no and her voice came stealing to his senses like half forgotten music that is yes alas but is it really you oh arthur my darling have you come back to me and she moved towards him with outstretched arms  already they were closing round him and he could feel her breath upon his cheek when the charm broke and he wrenched himself free  get back do not dare to touch me do you know what you are the poor lost girl is not fallen so low as you she must get her bread but at any rate i could have given you bread what fresh from your husbands arms and ready to throw yourself into mine shame upon you were you not married yesterday  oh arthur have pity you do not understand oh merciful god  have pity what need for pity were you not married yesterday and he laughed bitterly i comei come from far to congratulate the new made wife it is a little odd though i thought to marry you myself see here was my wedding present and he tore the diamond necklace from his pocket a snake you see a good emblem away with it its use is gone  the diamonds went flashing through the sunlight and fell with a little splash into the lake  what are you not sorry to see so much valuable property wasted you have a keen appreciation of property  angela sank down on her knees before him like a broken lily her looks grew faint and despairing the stately head bowed itself to his feet and all the golden weight of hair broke loose but he did not pause or spare her he ground his teeth no one could have recognized in this maddened passioninspired man the pleasant easytempered arthur of an hour before his nature was stirred to its depths and they were deep  you miserable woman do not kneel to me if it were not unmanly i could spurn you with my foot do you know girl you who swore to love me till time had passedyes and for all eternity you who do love me at this momentand therein lies your shamethat you have killed me you have murdered my heart i trusted you angela i trusted you i gave you all my life all that was best in me and now in reward degraded as you arei must always love you as much as i despise you even now i feel that i cannot hate you and forget you i must love you and i must despise you  she gazed up at him like a dumb beast at its butcher she could not speak her voice had gone  and yet when i think of it i have something to thank you for you have cleared my mind of illusions you have taught me what a womans purity is worth you did the thing well too you did not crush me by inches with platitudes bidding me forget you and not think of you any more as though forgetfulness were possible and thought a tangible thing that one could kill you struck home in silence once and for all thank you for that angela what are you crying go back to the brute whom you have chosen the brute whose passion or whose money you could prefer to me tell him that they are tears of happiness and let him kiss them quite away  oh arthurcruelarthur and nature gave way she fell fainting on the grass  then when he saw that she could not understand or feel any more his rage died and he too broke down and sobbed great gasping sobs and the frightened dog crept up and licked first her face and then his hand  kneeling down arthur raised her in his arms and strained her to his heart kissing her thrice upon the foreheadthe lips he could not touch then he placed her on the seat leaning her weight against the tree and motioning back the dog he went his way                                chapter lviii  arthur took the same path by which he had comeall paths were alike to him nowbut before he had gone ten yards he saw the figure of george caresfoot who appeared to have been watching him in georges hand was a ridingwhip for he had ridden from the scene of the fire and was all begrimed with smoke and dirt but this arthur did not notice  hullo he began what and then he hesitated there was a look in arthurs eyes which he did not like  but if george hesitated arthur did not he sprang at him like a wild cat and in a second had him by the throat and shoulder for a moment he held him there for in his state of compressed fury george was like a child in his hands and as he held him a fierce and almost uncontrollable desire took possession of him to kill this man to throw him down and stamp the life out of him he conquered it however and loosed the grip on his throat  let me go shrieked george as soon as he could get breath  arthur cut short his clamours by again compressing his windpipe  listen he said a second ago i was very near killing you but i remember now that after all it is she not you who are chiefly to blame you only followed your brutal nature and nothing else can be expected of a brute very likely you put pressure on her like the cad that you are but that does not excuse her for if she could not resist pressure she is a fool in addition to being what she is i look at you and think that soon she will come down to your level the level of my successful rival to be mated to a man like you would drag an angel down that will be punishment enough now go you cur  he swung him violently from him his fall was broken by a bramble bush it was not exactly a bed of roses but george thought it safer to lie there till his assailants footsteps had grown fainthe did not wish to bring him back again then he crept out of the bush smarting all over indeed his frame of mind was altogether not of the most amiable to begin with he had just seen his housewhich as luck would have it was the only thing he had not sold to philip and which was also at the moment uninsured owing to the confusion arising from the transfer of the propertyentirely burnt down all its valuable contents too including a fine collection of pictures and private papers he by no means wished to lose were irretrievably destroyed  nor was his mood improved by the recollection of the events of the previous night or by the episode of the bramblebush illuminated as it was by arthurs vigorous language or by what he had just witnessed for he had arrived in time to see though from a distance the last act of the interview between arthur and angela  he had seen him lift her in his arms kiss her and place her on the stone seat but he did not know that she had fainted the sight had roused his evil passions until they raged like the fire he had left then arthur came out upon him and he made acquaintance with the bramblebush as already described but he was not going to be cheated out of his revenge the woman was still left for him to wreak it on  by the time he reached angela her faculties were reawakening but though insensibility had yielded sense had not returned she sat upon the stone seat upright indeed but rigid and grasping its angles with her hands the dog had gone in the undecided way common to dogs when two people to whom they are equally attached separate it had at that moment taken it into its head to run a little way after arthur  george marched straight up to her livid with fury  so this is how you go on when your husband is away is it i saw you kissing that young blackguard though i am not good enough for you what wont you answer then it is time that i taught you obedience  swish went the heavy whip through the air and fell across her fair cheek  will that wake you eh or must i repeat the dose  the pain of the blow seemed to rouse her she rose her loosed hair falling round her like a golden fleece and a broad blue stripe across her ghastly face she stretched out her hands she opened her great eyes and in them blazed the awful light of madness  he was standing whip in hand with his back to the lake she faced him a breathing beautiful vengeance and in a whisper so intense that the air was full of it commenced a rambling prayer  oh god she said bless my dear arthur oh almighty father avenge our wrongs  she paused and fixed her eyes upon him and they held him so that he could not stir then in strange contrast to the hissing whisper there broke from her lips a ringing and unearthly laugh that chilled him to the marrow so they stood for some seconds  the sound of angry voices had brought the bulldog back at full speed and at the sight of georges threatening attitude it halted it had always hated him and now it straightway grew more like a devil than a dog the innate fierceness of the great brute awoke it bristled with fury till each separate hair stood out in knots against the skin and saliva ran from its twitching jaws  george did not know that it was near him but angelas wild eye fell upon it slowly raising her hand she pointed at it  look behind you she cried  the sound of her voice broke the spell that was upon him  come give me no more of your nonsense he said and then as much from vague fear and rampant brutality as from any other reason again struck her with the whip  next second he was aware of a tremendous shock the dog had seen the blow and had instantly launched itself with all the blind courage of its race straight at the strikers throat it missed its aim however only carrying away a portion of georges underlip he yelled with pain and struck at it with the whip and then began a scene which in its grotesque horror beggars all description again and again the dog flew at him its perfect silence contrasting strangely with georges shrieks of terror and the shrill peals of horrible laughter that came hurrying from angelas lips as she watched the struggle  at last the dog gripped the man by the forearm and sinking its great teeth into the flesh hung its weight upon it in vain did george maddened by the exquisite pain dash himself and the dog against the ground in vain did he stagger round and round the glen tearing at its throat with his uninjured hand the brute hung grimly on presently there came an end as he reeled along howling for help and dragging his fierce burden with him george stumbled over a dead bough which lay upon the bank of the lake and fell backwards into the water exactly at the spot where the foundations of the old boathouse wall rose to within a few inches of the surface his head struck heavily against the stonework and he and the dog who would not loose his grip lay on it for a moment then they rolled off together into the deep pool the man dragging the dog with him there were a few ripples stained with little red filaments a few airbubbles that marked the exhalation of his last breath and georges spirit had left its enclosing body and gonewhither ay reader whither had it gone    the outcry brought philip and old jakes running down to the lake they found angela standing alone on the brink and laughing her wildest  see she cried as they came panting up the bridegroom cometh from his chamber and at that moment some unreleased air within the body brought it up for an instant to the surface so that the torn and ghastly face and head emerged for a second as though to look at them then it sank again  the brave dog holds him wellha ha ha he cannot catch me nowha ha ha nor you judas who sold me judas judas judas and turning she fled with the speed of the wind  mr fraser had but just come down and was walking in his garden when he saw this dreadful figure come flying towards him with streaming hair  betrayed she cried in a voice which rang like the wail of a lost soul and fell on her face at his feet  when she came back to life they found that she was mad                                 chapter lix  the news of george caresfoots tragic death was soon common property and following as it did so hard upon his marriage which now was becoming known and within a few hours of the destruction of his house by fire it caused no little excitement it cannot be said that the general feeling was one of very great regret it was not george caresfoot had commanded deference as a rich man but he certainly had not won affection still his fate excited general interest and sympathy though some people were louder in their regrets over the death of such a plucky dog as aleck than over that of the man he killed but then these had a personal dislike of george when however it came to be rumoured that the dog had attacked george because george had struck the dogs mistress general sympathy veered decidedly towards the dog byandby as some of the true facts of the case came out namely that angela caresfoot had gone mad that her lover who was supposed to be dead had been seen in rewtham on the evening of the wedding that the news of mr heighams death had been concocted to bring about the marriage and last but not least that the isleworth estates had passed into the possession of philip caresfoot public opinion grew very excited and the dog aleck was well spoken of  when sir john bellamy stepped out on the platform at roxham on his return from london that day his practised eye saw at once that something unusual had occurred a group of county magistrates returning from quarter sessions were talking excitedly together whilst waiting for their train he knew them all well but at first they seemed inclined to let him pass without speaking to him presently however one of them turned and spoke to him  have you heard about this bellamy  no what  george caresfoot is dead killed by a bulldog or something they say he was thrashing the girl he married yesterday his cousins daughter with a whip and the dog made for him and they both fell into the water together and were drowned the girl has gone mad  good heavens you dont say so  yes i do though and ill tell you what it is bellamy they say that you and your wife went to madeira and trumped up a story about her lovers death in order to take the girl in i tell you this as an old friend  what i certainly went to madeira and i saw young heigham there but i never trumped up any story about his death i never mentioned him to angela caresfoot for two reasons first because i have not come across her and secondly because i understood that philip caresfoot did not wish it  well i am glad to hear it for your sake but i have just seen fraser and he tells me that lady bellamy told the girl of this young heighams death in his own presence and what is more he showed me a letter they found in her dress purporting to have been written by him on his deathbed which your wife gave her  of what lady bellamy has or has not said or done i know nothing i have no control over her actions  well i should advise you to look into the business because it will all come out at the inquest and they separated  sir john drove homewards thoughtful but by no means unhappy the news of georges agonizing death was balm to him he only regretted that he had not been theresomewhere well out of the way of the dog up a tree for instanceto see it  as soon as he got home he sent a message to lady bellamy to say he wished to speak to her then he seated himself at his writingdesk and waited presently he heard his wifes firm step upon the stairs he rubbed his dry hands and smiled a half frightened wicked little smile  at last he said and now for revenge  she entered the room looking rather pale but calm and commanding as ever  so you have come back she said  yes have you heard the news your flame george caresfoot is dead  i knew that he was dead how did he die  who told you he was dead  no one i knew it i told him he would die last night and i felt him die this morning did she kill him or did arthur heigham  neither that bulldog flew at him and he fell into the lake  oh i suppose angela set it on i told him that she would win you remember the picture falling in the study at isleworth it has been a true omen you see  angela is mad the story is all over the country and travelling like wildfire the letter you forged has been found heigham was down here this morning and has gone again and you lady bellamy are a disgraced and ruined woman  she did not flinch a muscle  i know it it is the result of pitting myself against that girl but pray sir john what are you was it not you who devised the scheme  you are right i did to trap two fools anne i have waited twenty years but you have met your master at last  lady bellamy made a slight exclamation and relapsed into silence  my plot has worked well already one of you is dead and for you a fate is reserved that is worse than death you are henceforth a penniless outcast left at fortytwo to the tender mercies of the wide world  explain yourself a little  with pleasure for years i have submitted to your contumely longing to be revenged waiting to be revenged you thought me a fool i know and compared with you i am but you do not understand what an amount of hatred even a fool is capable of for twenty years lady bellamy i have hated you you will never know how much though perhaps what i am going to say may give you some idea i very well knew what terms you were on with george caresfoot you never took any pains to hide them from me you only hid the proofs i soon discovered indeed that your marriage to me was nothing but a blind that i was being used as a screen forsooth but your past i could never fathom i dont look like a revengeful man but for all that i have for years sought many ways to ruin you both yet from one thing and another they all failed till a blessed chance made that brutes blind passion the instrument of his own destruction and put you into my hands you little thought when you told me all that story and begged my advice how i was revelling in the sense that proud woman as you are it must have been an agony of humiliation for you to have to tell it it was an instructive scene that it assured me of what i suspected before that george caresfoot must have you bound to him by some stronger ties than those of affection that he must hold you in a grip of iron it made me think too that if by any means i could acquire the same power i too should be able to torture you  for the first time lady bellamy looked up  am i tiring you he said politely or shall i go on  go on  with your permission i will ring for a glass of sherryno claret the day is too hot for sherry and he rang  the claret was brought and he drank a glass remarking with an affectation of coolness that it was a sound wine for a pound a dozen then he proceeded  the first thing i have to call your attention to is this arthur heigham plot at first it may appear that i am involved with you i am not there is not now that george caresfoot is dead one tittle of evidence against me except your own and who will believe you you are inculpated up to the eyes you delivered the forged letter i can prove that you cozened the ring out of heigham and you told philip there is no escape for you and i have already taken an opportunity to renounce any responsibility for your acts at the inquest i shall appear to give evidence against you and then i shall abandon you to your fate  is that all  no woman i have your letters  she sprang up with a little scream and stood over him with dilated eyes sir john leaned back in his chair rubbed his hands and watched her tortured face with evident satisfaction  yes you may well scream he said for i not only possess them but i have read and reread them i know all your story the name of the husband you deserted and of the child who died of your neglect i have even sent an agent to identify the localities yes you may well scream for i have read them all and really they are most instructive documents and romantic enough for a novel such fire such passionate invective such wild despair but since i learnt how and why you married me i will tell you what i have made up my mind to do i am going after the inquest to turn you out of this house and give you a pittance to live on so long as you remain here i wish you to become a visible moral a walking monument of disgrace in the neighbourhood you ruled should you attempt to escape me the payment will be stopped should you obtain employment your character shall be exposed at every turn you shall be struck down till you learn to kiss the hand that strikes you and beg for pity on your knees my revenge anne shall be to break your spirit  and are you not perhaps afraid that i may turn upon you you know me to be a woman of strong will and many resources some of which you do not even understand  no i am not afraid because i still have a reserve force i still hold the letters that i stole two days ago and even should you murder me i have left directions that will ensure your exposure  a pause ensued  have you nothing more to say he said at last  nothing  supposing anne that i were to tell you that i have been trying to frighten you and that if you were to go down on your knees before me now and beg my forgiveness i would forgive youno not forgive you but let you off with easier termswould you do it  no john i would not once i went on my knees to a man and i have not forgotten the lesson he taught me do your worst  then you understand my terms and accept them  understand them yes i understand that you are a littleminded man and like all littleminded men cruel and desirous of exacting the uttermost farthing in the way of revenge forgetting that you owe everything to me i do not wish to exculpate myself mind you looking at the case from your point of view and in your own petty way i can almost sympathize with you but as for accepting your termsdo you know me so little as to think that i could do so have you not learnt that i may break but shall never bend and if i chose now to face the matter out i should beat you even now when you hold all the cards in your hand but i am weary of it all especially weary of you and your little ways and i do not choose you will injure me enough to make the great success i planned for us both impossible and i am tired of everything except the success which crowns a struggle well i have ways of escape you know nothing of do your worst i am not afraid of you and she leaned back easily in her chair and looked at him with wearied and indifferent eyes  little sir john ground his teeth and twisted his pippenlike face into a scowl that looked absurdly out of place on anything so jovial  curse you he said even now you dare to defy me do you know you woman fiend that at this moment i almost think i love you  of course i know it if you did not love me you would not take all this trouble to try to crush me but this conversation is very long shall we put an end to it  sir john sat still a moment thinking and gazing at the splendid sphinxbrowed creature before him with a mixture of hatred and respect then he rose and spoke  anne you are a wonderful woman i cannot do it i cannot utterly ruin you you must be exposedi could not help that if i wouldand we must separate but i will be generous to you i will allow you five hundred a year and you shall live where you like you shall not starve  she laughed a little as she answered  i am starving now it is long past luncheon time as for your five hundred a year that you will give me out of the three or four thousand i have given you i care nothing for it i tell you i am tired of it all and i never felt more superior to you than i do now in the moment of your triumph it wants a stronger hand than yours to humble me i may be a bad woman i daresay i am but you will find too late that there are few in the world like me for years you have shone with a reflected light when the light goes out you will go out too get back into your native mud the mental slime out of which i picked you contemptible creature that you are and when you have lost me learn to measure the loss by the depths to which you will sink i reject your offers i mock at your threats for they will recoil on your own head i despise you and i have done with you john bellamy good bye and with a proud curtsey she swept from the room    that evening it was rumoured that sir john bellamy had separated from his wife owing to circumstances which had come to his knowledge in connection with george caresfoots death                                  chapter lx  that same afternoon lady bellamy ordered out the victoria with the fast trotting horse and drove to the abbey house she found philip pacing up and down the gravel in front of the grey old place which had that morning added one more to the long list of human tragedies its walls had witnessed his face was pale and contorted by mental suffering and as soon as he recognized lady bellamy he made an effort to escape she stopped him  i suppose it is here mr caresfoot  it what  the body  yes  i wish to see it  philip hesitated a minute and then led the way to his study the corpse had been laid upon the table just as it had been taken from the water indeed the wet still fell in heavy drops from the clothes on to the ground it was to be removed to roxham that evening to await the inquest on the morrow the shutters of the room had been closed lest the light should strike too fiercely on the ghastly sight but even in the twilight lady bellamy could discern every detail of its outline clearly marked by the wet patches on the sheet which was thrown loosely over it on a chair by the side of the table above the level of which its head rose giving it the appearance of being in the act of climbing on to it lay the carcass of the dog its teeth still firmly set in the dead mans arm they had been unable to unlock the savage grip without hacking its jaws asunder and this it was not thought advisable to do till after the inquest  at the door philip paused as though he did not mean to enter  come in said lady bellamy surely you are not afraid of a dead man  i fear the dead a great deal more than i do the living he muttered but came in and shut the door  as soon as her eyes had grown accustomed to the light lady bellamy went up to the body and drawing off the sheet gazed long and steadily at the mutilated face on the lips of which the bloody froth still stood  i told him last night she said presently to philip that we should never meet again alive but i did not think to see him so soon like this do you know that i once loved that thing that shattered brain directed the only will to which i ever bowed but the love went out for ever last night the chain snapped and now i can look upon this sight without a single sigh or a regret with nothing but loathing and disgust there lies the man who ruined medid you know it i do not care who knows it nowruined me with his eyes open not caring anything about me there lies the hard taskmaster whom i served through so many years the villain who drove me against my will into this last crime which has thus brought its reward the dog gave him his just due look its teeth still hold him as fast perhaps as the memories of his crimes will hold him where he has gone regret him sorrow for him no oh no i can curse him as he lies villain monster devil that he was  she paused and even in the dim light philip could see her bosom heave and her great eyes flash with the fierceness of her excitement  you should not talk so of the dead he said  you are right she answered he has gone beyond the reach of my words but the thought of all the misery i have suffered at his hands made me for a moment mad cover it up again the vile frame which held a viler soul to the earth with the one to undreamed of sorrow with the other each to its appointed place how does it runthe wages of sin is death yes that is right he is dead the blow fell first on him that was right and i am about to die and youwhat will happen to you the judas of the plot eh you do not think that you will enjoy your bloodmoney in peace do you  what do you mean asked philip nervously her wild way frightened him  mean why that you are the sorriest knave of all this man was at least led on to crime by passion bellamy entered into it to work out a secret revenge poor fool i acted because i couldnt help myself at first and then for the sake of the game itself for when i take a thing in my hand i will succeed but you philip caresfoot you sold your own flesh and blood for money or moneys worth and you are the worst of allworse than george for even a brutal love is a nobler thing than avarice like yours well as the sin is so will the punishment be  it is a lie i thought that he was dead  you thought that arthur heigham was deadthen i read your thoughts very wrongly when we met upon the road on christmas day you wished to think that he was dead but you did not think it even now your conscience is making a coward of you and as you said just now for you the silence of the dead is more terrible than the accusations of the living i know a little about you philip do you not see shadows on your walls and do not departed voices come to haunt you in your sleep i know you do and i will tell you thisthe things which you have suffered from at times shall henceforth be your continual companions if you can pray pray with all your strength that your daughter may not die for if she does her shadow will always be there to haunt you with the rest why do you tremble so at the mere mention of a spirit stand still and i will show you one i can if i like  philip could stand it no longer with a curse he burst out of the room presently she followed him and found him standing in front of the house wiping the cold perspiration from his forehead  you accursed woman he said go and never come near this house again  i never shall come to this house again she answered ah here is my carriage goodbye philip caresfoot you are a very wealthy man nowworth i do not know how many thousands a year you have been singularly fortunateyou have accomplished your ends few people can do that may the accomplishment bring happiness with it if you wish it to do so stifle your conscience and do not let your superstitions affect you but by the way you know french do you not then here is a maxim that in parting i recommend to your attentionit has some truth in it il y a une page effrayante dans le livre des destinees humaines on y lit en tete ces mots les desirs accomplis and she was gone  i owed him a debt for tempting george on in that business thought lady bellamy to herself as she rolled swiftly down the avenue of giant walnuts but i think that i have repaid it the thorn i have planted will fester in his flesh till he dies of the sore superstition run wild in his weak mind will make the world a hell for him and that is what i wish  presently she stopped the carriage and walked to the top of a little knoll commanding what had been isleworth hill but was now a black smoking blot on the landscape the white front of the house was still standing though riven from top to bottom and through its empty windowplaces the westering sun poured great streams of fire which looked like flame shining through the eyesockets of a gigantic skull  i did that well she said and yet how blind i was i should have known that he spoke the truth when he said the letters were not there my skill failed meit always does fail at need i thought the fire would reach them somehow  when she arrived at rewtham house she found that sir john had left taking luggage with him and stating that he was going to put up at an inn at roxham on the halltable too lay a summons to attend the inquest on the body of george caresfoot which was to take place on the morrow she tore it across then she went up and dressed herself for dinner with such splendour that her maid thought it necessary to remind her that there was no company coming  no she said with a strange smile but i am going out tonight give me my sapphire necklace  she sat through dinner and afterwards went into the drawingroom and opening a despatchbox read and burnt a great number of papers  there go the keys to my knowledge she said aloud as they flickered and fell into ashes no one shall reap the fruits of my labours and yet it is a pityi was on the right track and though i could never have succeeded another might i had the key though i could not find the lock i must go through with it now i cannot live deprived both of success and of my secret power and i could never begin and climb that stair again  then from a secret drawer in the despatchbox she extracted a little phial tightly stoppered and sealingwaxed she examined it closely and looked at the liquid in it against the light  my medicine has taken no harm during this twenty years she thought it still looks what it isstrong enough to kill a giant and subtle enough to leave little trace upon a child then she shut up the despatchbox and put it away and going to the open window looked up at the stars and then down at the shadows flung by the clouds as they swept across the moon  shadows she mused below and gleams of light between the shadows that is like our life light abovepure clear eternalthat is like the wider life and between the twothe night and above them boththe stars  in the immensity where shall i find my place oh that i might sleep eternally yes that would be best of allto sink into sleep never ending unbroken and unbreakable to be absorbed into the cool vastness of the night and lie in her great arms for ever oh night whom i have ever loved you bring your sleep to wearied millions bring me sleep eternal but no the stars are above the night and above the stars iswhat yes the hour i dread like every other mortal with my body and yet dare to long for with my spirit has come i am about to cast off time and pass into eternity to spring from the giddy heights of space into the uncertain arms of the infinite yet a few minutes and my essence my vital part will start upon its endless course and passing far above those stars will find the fount of that knowledge of which it has already sipped and drink and drink till it grows like a god and can look upon the truth and not be blinded such are my high hopes and yetif there be a hell my life has been evil my sins many what if there be an avenging power waiting as some think to grind me into powder and then endow each crushed particle with individual sense of endless misery what if there be a hell in a few minutes or what will seem but a few minutes for surely to the disembodied spirit time cannot exist though it sleep a billion years it will be as a breathi shall have solved the problem i shall know what all the panicstricken millions madly ask and ask in vain yes i shall know if there is a hell well if there be then i shall rule there for power is native to my soul let me hesitate no longer but go and solve the problem before i grow afraid afraidi am not afraid i have immortal longings in me who was it said that oh cleopatra was cleopatra more beautiful than i am i wonder i am sure that she was not so great for had i been her antony should have driven caesar out of egypt oh if i could have loved with a pure and perfect love as other women may and intertwined my destiny with that of some great mansome being of a nature kindred to my owni should have been good and happy and he should have ruled this country but fate and fortune grown afraid of what i should do linked my life to a soulless brute and alas like him i have fallenfallen irretrievably  she closed the window and coming into the room rang the bell  bring me some wine she said to the servant i do not feel well  what wine my lady  champagne  the wine was brought and stood uncorked upon the table  that will do she said tell my maid not to sit up for me it will be late before i go to bed tonight  the man bowed and went and she poured out some of the sparkling wine and then taking the little phial opened it with difficulty and emptied its contents into the glass the wine boiled up furiously turned milkwhite and then cleared again but the poison had destroyed its sparkleit was dead as ditchwater  that is strange she said i never saw that effect before next she took the phial and powdered it into a pinch of tiny dust with a whales tooth that lay upon the table the dust she took to the window and threw out a little at a time lady bellamy wished to die as she had lived a mystery then she came and stood over the deadly draught she had compounded and thought sometimes aloud and sometimes to herself  i have heard it said that suicides are cowards let those who say it stand as i stand tonight with death lying in the little circle of a glass before them and they will know whether they are cowards or if they are spirits of a braver sort than those who can bear to drudge to the bitter end of life it is not yet too late i can throw that stuff away i can leave this place and begin life anew in some other country my jewels will give me the means and for the matter of that i can always win as much money as i want but no then i must begin again and for that i have not the patience or the time besides i long to know to solve the mystery come let me make an end i will chance it spirits like my own wear their life only while it does not gall them if it begins to fret they cast it from them like a halfworn dress scorning to wrap it round them till it drops away in rags  she raised the glass  how lonely this place is and how still and yet it may well be that there are millions round me watching what i do why does he come into my mind now that good man and the child i bore him shall i see them presently will they crush me with their reproaches andhave my nerves broken downis it fancy or does that girls pale face with warning in her eyes float between me and the wall well i will drink to her for her mind could even overtop my own she was at least my equal and i have driven her mad let me taste this stuff  lifting the glass to her lips she drank a little and set it down the effect was almost magical her eyes blazed a new beauty bloomed upon her cheek her whole grand presence seemed to gain in majesty the quick drug for a moment burnt away the curtain between the seen and the unseen and yet left her living  ah she cried in the silence of the room how it runs along my veins i hear the rushing of the stars i see strange worlds my soul leaps through infinite spaces the white light of immortality strikes upon my eyes and blinds me come life unending i have conquered death  seizing the poison she swallowed what remained of it and dashed the glass down beside her then she fell heavily on her face once she struggled to her knees then fell again and lay still                                 chapter lxi  after throwing george caresfoot into the bramblebush arthur walked steadily back to the inn where he arrived quite composed in manner at about halfpast seven old sam the ostler was in the yard washing a trap he went up to him and asked when the next train started for london  there is one as leaves roxham at nine oclock sir and an uncommon fast one im told but you beant agoing yet be you sir  yes have the gig ready in time to catch the train  very good sir been to the fire i suppose sir he went on dimly perceiving that arthurs clothes were torn it were a fine place it wore and it did blaze right beautiful  no what fire  bless me sir didnt you see it last nightwhy isleworth hall to be sure it wore burnt right out and all as was in it  oh how did it come to get burnt  cant say sir but i did hear say how as lady bellamy was adining there last night along with the squire the squire he went out somewhere my lady she goes home and the footman he goes to put out the lamp and finds the drawingroom a roaring fiery furnace like as parson tells us on but i dont know how that can be for i heard how as the squire was adying so taint likely that he was agoing out but lord sir folk in these parts do lie that uncommon taint as it be when i was a boy as like as no hes no more dying than you are anyhow sir it all burned like tinder and the only thing so im told as was saved was a naked stone statty of a girl with a chain round her wrists as jim blakes our constable being in liquor brought out in his arms thinking how as it was alive and tried to rewive it with cold water  at that moment sams story was interrupted by the arrival of a farmers cart  how be you sam  well i thank yer for seventytwo that is not particular ill  have you a gentleman of the name of heigham staying here  i am he said arthur do you want me  no sir only the stationmaster at roxham asked me to drop this here as it was marked immediate and he handed arthur a box  arthur thanked him and taking it went up to his room leaving old sam delighted to find a new listener to his story of the fire  it was from the florist and contained the bouquet he had meant to give angela on her weddingday it had cost him a good deal of thought that bouquet to say nothing of five guineas of the coin of the realm and he felt a certain curiosity to look at it though to do so gave him something of the same sensation that we experience in reading a letter written by some loved hand which we know grew cold before the lines it traced could reach us he took the box to his room and opened it the bouquet was a lovely thing and did credit even to covent garden and the masses of stephanois and orangebloom relieved here and there by rising sprays of liliesofthevalley filled the whole room with fragrance  he drew it from the zincwell in which it was packed in moss and cottonwool and wondered what he should do with it he could not leave such a thing about nor would he take it away suddenly an idea struck him and he repacked it in its case as carefully as he could in the original moss and cottonwool and then looked about for the sheet of tissuepaper that should complete the covering he had destroyed it and had to search for a substitute in so doing his eye fell upon a long envelope on his dressingtable and he smiled it contained his marriage licence and he bethought him that it was a very fair substitute for tissuepaper and quite as worthless he extracted it and placing it over the flowers closed up the box then he carefully directed it to mrs george caresfoot abbey house and ringing the bell desired the boots to find a messenger to take it over  when he had done all this he sat down and wondered what could have come to him that he could take pleasure in doing a cruel action only worthy of a jealous woman  perhaps of all the bitter cups which are held to our lips in this sad world there is none more bitter than that which it was his lot to drink of now to begin with the blow fell in youth when we love or hate or act with an ardour and an entire devotion that we give to nothing in afterlife it is then that the heart puts forth its most tender and yet its most lusty shoots and if they are crushed the whole plant suffers and sometimes bleeds to death arthur had to an extent quite unrealized by himself until he lost her centred all his life in this woman and it was no exaggeration to say as he had said to her that she had murdered his heart and withered up all that was best in it she had done more she had inflicted the most cruel injury upon him that a woman can inflict upon a man she had shaken his belief in her sex at large  he felt sitting there in his desolation that now he had lost angela he could never be the same man he would otherwise have been her cruel desertion had shattered the tinted glass through which youth looks at the world and he now before his day saw it as it is grim and hard and full of coarse realities and did not yet know that time would again soften down the sharpest of the rough outlines and throw a garment of its own over the nakedness of life he was a generous hearted man and not a vain one and had he thought that angela had ceased to care for him and loved this other man he could have found it in his heart to forgive her and even to sympathize with her but he could not think this something told him that it was not so she had contracted herself into a shameful loveless marriage and to gain ends quite foreign to all love had raised a barrier between them which had no right to exist and yet one that in this world could he thought never be removed  misfortunes rain upon us from every quarter of the sky but so long as they come from the sky we can bear them for they are beyond the control of our own volition and must be accepted as we accept the gale or the lightning it is the troubles which spring from our own folly and weakness or from that of those with whom our lives are intertwined which really crush us now arthur knew enough of the world to be aware that there is no folly to equal that of a woman who of her own free will truly loving one man whom she can marry if she will sit deliberately gives herself to another it is not only a folly it is a crime and like most crimes for this life an irretrievable mistake  long before he got back to london the first unwholesome exaltation of mind that always follows a great misfortune and which may perhaps be compared with the excitement that for awhile covers the shameful sense of defeat in an army had evaporated and he began to realize the crushing awfulness of the blow which had fallen on him and to fear lest it should drive him mad he looked round his little horizon for some straw of comfort at which to catch and could find none nothing but dreadful thoughts and sickening visions  and then suddenly just as he was sinking into the dulness of despair there came like the fist gleam of light in chaotic darkness the memory of mildred carr truly she had spoken prophetically his idol had been utterly cast down and crushed to powder by a hand stronger than his own he would go to her in his suffering perhaps she could find means to comfort him  when he reached town he took a hansom and went to look for some rooms he would not return to those he had left on the previous afternoon for the sympathetic landlord had helped him to pack up the wedding clothes and had admired the wedding gift arthur felt that he could not face him again he found some to suit him in duke street st james and left his things there thence he drove to fenchurch street and took a passage to madeira the clerk the same one who had given him his ticket about a year before remembered him perfectly and asked him how he got on with mrs carr but when his passage was taken he was disgusted to find that the mail did not sail for another five days he looked at his watch it was only halfpast one oclock he could scarcely believe what had happened had only occurred that morning only seven hours ago it seemed to him that he had stood face to face with angela not that morning but years ago and miles away on some desolate shore which lay on the other side of a dead ocean of pain and yet it was only seven hours if the hours went with such heavy wings how would the days pass and the months and the years  what should he do with himself in his condition perpetual activity was as necessary to him as air he must do something to dull the sharp edge of his suffering or the sword of madness which hung over him by such a slender thread would fall suddenly he bethought him of a man whom he had known slightly up at cambridge a man of wealth and evil reputation this man would he felt be able to put him in a way of getting through his time he knew his address and thither he drove    four days later a figure shrunk shaky and looking prematurely old with the glaze of intoxication scarcely faded from his eye walked into mr borleys office that respectable gentleman looked and looked again  good heavens he said at length it isnt arthur heigham  yes it is though said an unequal voice ive come for some money ive got none left and i am going to madeira tomorrow  my dear boy what has happened to you you look so very strange i have been expecting to see your marriage in the paper why its only a few days ago that you left to be married  a few days a few years you mean ive been jilted thats all nothing to speak of you know but i had rather not talk about it if you dont mind im like a nag with a flayed back dont like the sight of the saddle at present and poor arthur mentally and physically exhausted put his head down on his arm and gulped  the old lawyer took in the situation at a glance  hard hit he said to himself and gone on to the burst and then aloud well well that has happened to many a man in fact you mightnt believe it but it once happened to me and i dont look much the worse do i but we wont talk about it the less said of a bad business the better thats my maxim and so you are going abroad again have you got any friends at madeira  arthur nodded  and you want some more money let me see i sent you 200 pounds last week  that was for my wedding tour ive spent it now you can guess how i have spent it pleasant contrast isnt it gives rise to moral reflections  come come heigham you must not give way like that these things happen to most men in the course of their lives and if they are wise it teaches them that gingerbread isnt all gilt and to set down women at their proper value and appreciate a good one if it pleases providence to give them one in course of time dont you go making a fool of yourself over this girls pretty face handsome is as handsome does these things are hard to bear i know but you dont make them any better by pitching your own reputation after a girls want of stability  i know that you are quite right and i am much obliged to you for your kind advice but we wont say anything more about it i suppose that you can let me have some money  oh yes if you want it though i think we shall have to overdraw what do you want two hundred here is the cheque  i am anxious about that young fellow said mr borley to himself in the pause between arthurs departure and the entry of the next client i hope his disappointment wont send him to the dogs he is not of the sort who take it easy like i did for instance dear me that is a long while ago now i wonder what the details of his little affair were and who the girl married captain shuffle yes show him in                                 chapter lxii  next morning arthur cashed his cheque and started on his travels he had no very clear idea why he was going back to madeira or what he meant to do when he got there but then at this painful stage of his existence none of his ideas could be called clear though he did not realize it what he was searching for was sympathy female sympathy of course for in trouble members of either sex gravitate instinctively to the other for comfort perhaps they do not quite trust their own or perhaps they are afraid of being laughed at  arthurs was not one of those natures that can lock their griefs within the bosom and let them lie there till in process of time they shrivel away except among members of the peerage as pictured in current literature these stern proud creatures are not common man whether he figures in the world as a peer or a hedgecarpenter is as a matter of fact mentally as well as physically gregarious and adverse to loneliness either in his joys or sorrows  decidedly too the homoeopathic system must be founded on great natural facts and there is philosophy born of the observation of human nature in the somewhat vulgar proverb that recommends a hair of the dog that bit you otherwise nine men out of every ten who have been badly treated or think that they have been badly treated by a woman would not at once rush headlong for refuge to another a proceeding which also in nine cases out of ten ends in making confusion worse confounded  arthur though he was not aware of it was exemplifying a natural law that has not yet been properly explained but even if he had known it it is doubtful if the knowledge would have made him any happier for it is irritating to reflect that we are the slaves of natural laws that our action is not the outcome of our own volition but of a vague force working silently as the gulf streamsince such knowledge makes a man measure his weakness and so strikes at his tenderest point his vanity  but whilst we have been reflecting together my reader and i arthur was making his way to madeira so we may as well all come to a halt off funchal  very shortly after the vessel had dropped her anchor arthur was greeted by his friend the manager of miles hotel  glad to see you sir though i cant say that you look well i scarcely expected to find anybody for us at this time of year business is very slack in the summer  yes i suppose that madeira is pretty empty  there is nobody here at all sir  is mrs carr gone then asked arthur in some alarm  no she is still here she has not been away this year but she has been very quiet no parties or anything which makes people think that she has lost money  by this time the boat was rising on the roll of the last billow to be caught next moment by a dozen hands and dragged up the shingle it was evening or rather verging that way and from under the magnolia trees below the cathedral there came the sound of the band summoning the inhabitants of funchal to congregate chatter and flirt  i think said arthur that i will ask you to take my things up to the hotel i will come byandby i should like the same room i had before if it is empty  very good mr heigham you will have the place nearly all to yourself now  having seen his baggage depart arthur turned and resisting the importunities of beggars guides and parrotsellers who had not yet recognized him as an old hand made his way towards the quinta carr how well he knew the streets and houses even to the withered faces of the women who sat by the doors and yet he seemed to have grown old since he had seen them ten minutes of sharp walking brought him to the gates of the quinta and he paused before them and thought how a few months ago he had quitted them miserable at the grief of another now to reenter them utterly crushed by his own  he walked on through the beautiful gardens to the house the halldoor stood open he did not wait to ring but driven by some impulse entered after the glare of the sun which at that time of the year was powerful even in its decline the carefully shaded hall seemed quite dark but by degrees his eyes adapted themselves to the altered light and began to distinguish the familiar outline of the furniture next they travelled to the door of the drawingroom where another sight awaited them for there herself a perfect picture standing in the doorway for a frame her hands outstretched in welcome and a loving smile upon her lips was mildred  i was waiting for you she said gently i thought that you would come  mildred my idol has been cast down and as you told me to do i have come back to you  dear she answered you are very welcome  and then came miss terry pleased with all her honest heart to see him and utterly ignorant of the fierce currents that swept under the smooth surface of their little social sea miss terry was not by nature a keen observer  dear me mr heigham who would have thought of seeing you again so soon you are brave to cross the bay so often her thoughts ran a great deal on the bay of biscay but i dont think you look quite well you have such black lines under your eyes and i declare theres a grey hair  oh i assure you your favourite bay was enough to turn anybodys hair grey miss terry  and so talking cheerfully they went in to the pleasant little dinner mildred leaning over so slightly on his arm and gazing into his sad face with full and happy eyes after all that he had gone through it seemed to arthur as though he had dropped into a haven of rest  see here said mildred when they rose from table a wonder has come to pass since you deserted us look sceptic that you are and she led him to the window and lifting a glass shade which protected a flowerpot showed him a green spike peeping from the soil  what is that  what is itwhy it is the mummy hyacinth which you declared that we should never see blossom in this world it has budded whether or not it will blossom who can say  it is an omen he said with a little laugh and for the first time that evening their eyes met  come into the garden and you can smoke on the museum verandah it is pleasant there these hot nights  it is dangerous your garden  she laughed softly you have proved yourself superior to danger  then they passed out together the evening was still and very sultry not a breath stirred the silence of the night the magnolia the moon flower and a thousand other blooms poured out their fragrance upon the surrounding air where it lay in rich patches like perfume thrown on water a thin mist veiled the sea and the little wavelets struck with a sorrowful sound against the rock below  tell me all about it arthur  she had settled herself upon a long low chair and as she leant back the starlight glanced white upon her arms and bosom  there is not much to tell it is a common storyat least i believe so she threw me over and the day before i should have married her married another man  well  well i saw her the morning following her marriage i do not remember what i said but i believe i spoke what was in my mind she fainted and i left her  ah you spoke harshly perhaps  spoke harshly now that i have had time to think of it i wish that i could have had ten imaginations to shape my thoughts and ten tongues to speak them with do you understand what this woman has done she has sold herself to a bruteoh mildred such a bruteshe has deserted me for a man who is not even a gentleman  perhaps she was forced into it  forcednonsense we are not in the middle ages a good woman should have been forced to drown herself before she consented to commit such a sacrilege against herself as to marry a man she hated but she my love my dove my undefiledshe whom i thought whiter than the snow she could do this and do it deliberately i had rather have seen her dead and myself dead with her  dont you take a rather exaggerated view arthur dont you think perhaps that some of the fault lies with you for overrating women believe me so far as my experience goes and i have seen a good many the majority of them do not possess the exalted purity of mind you and many very young men attribute to them they are on the contrary for the most part quite ready to exercise a wise discretion in the matter of marriage even when the feeble tendencies which represent their affections point another way a little pressure goes a long way with them they are always glad to make the most of it it is the dust they throw up to hide their retreat your angela for instance was no doubt and probably still is very fond of you you are a charming young man with nice eyes and a taking way with women and she would very much have liked to marry you but then she also liked her cousins estates she could not have both and being forced to choose she chose the latter you should take a commonsense view of the matter you are not the first who has suffered women especially young women who do not understand the value of affection must be very much in love before they submit to the selfsacrifice that is supposed to be characteristic of them and what men talk of as stains upon them they do not consider as such they know if they know nothing else that a good income and an establishment will make them perfectly clean in the opinion of their own small worlda little world of shams and forms that cares nothing for the spirit of the moral law provided the letter is acted up to it is by this that they mark their standard of personal virtues not by the high rule you men imagine for them there is no social fullers soap so effectual as money and position  you speak like a book and give your own sex a high character tell me then would you do such a thing  i arthur how can you ask me i had rather be torn to pieces by wild horses i spoke of the majority of the women not of them all  ah and yet she could do it and i thought her better than you  i do not think that you should speak bitterly of her arthur i think that you should be sorry for her  sorry for her why  because from what i have gathered about her she is not quite an ordinary young woman however badly she may have treated you she is a person of refined feelings and susceptibilities is it not so  without a doubt  well then you should pity her because she will bitterly expiate her mistake for myself i do not pity her much because i will not waste my sympathy on a fool for to my mind the woman who could do what she has done and deliberately throw away everything that can make life really worth living to us women is a most contemptible fool but you love her and therefore you should be sorry for her  but why  because she is a woman who at oneandtwenty has buried all the higher part of life who has of her own act for ever deprived herself of joys that nothing else can bring her love true love is almost the only expression of which we women are capable of all the nobler instincts and vague yearnings after what is higher and better than the things we see and feel around us when we love most and love happily then we are at our topmost bent and soar further above the earth than anything else can carry us consequently when a woman is faithless to her love which is the purest and most honourable part of her the very best thing to which she can attain she clips her wings and can fly no more but must be tossed like a crippled gull hither and thither upon the stormy surface of her little sea of course i speak of women of the higher stamp many perhaps most will feel nothing of all this in a little while they will grow content with their dull round and the alien nature which they have mated with and in their children and their petty cares and dissipations will forget that they possess a higher part if indeed they do possess it like everything else in the world they find their level but with women like your angela it is another thing for them time only serves to increasingly unveil the medusaheaded truth till at last they see it as it is and their hearts turn to stone backed with a sick longing to see a face that is gone from them they become lost spirits wandering everlastingly in the emptiness they have chosen and finding no rest even her children will not console her  arthur uttered a smothered exclamation  dont start arthur you must accustom yourself to the fact that that woman has passed away from you and is as completely the personal property of another man as that chair is mine but there the subject is a painful one to you shall we change it  it is one that you seem to have studied pretty deeply  yes because i have realized its importance to a woman for some years i have longed to be able to fall in love and when at last i did so arthur and here her voice grew very soft it was with a man who could care nothing for me such has been my unlucky chance that a woman herself beloving and herself worthily beloved could throw her blessed opportunity away is to me a thing inconceivable and that arthur is what your angela has done                                chapter lxiii  then you will not marry now mildred said arthur after a pause  no arthur  no one  no one arthur  he rose and leaning over the railing of the verandah looked at the sea the mist that hid it was drifting and eddying hither and thither before little puffs of wind and the clear sky was clouding up  there is going to be a storm he said presently  yes i think so the air feels like it  he hesitated a while and looked down at her she seemed very lovely in the half lights as indeed she was she too looked up at him inquiringly at last he spoke  mildred you said just now that you would not marry anybody will you make an exceptionwill you marry me  it was her turn to pause now  you are very good she murmured  no i am not at all good you know how the case stands you know that i still love angela and that i shall in all probability always love her i cannot help that but if you will have me mildred i will try to be a good husband to you and to make you happy will you marry me dear  no arthur  why not have you then ceased to care for me  no dear i love you more than ever you cannot dream how much i do love you  then why will you not marry me is it because of this business  no and raising herself in the low chair she looked at him with intense earnestness that is not the reason i will not marry you because i have become a better woman since you went away because i do not wish to ruin your life you ask me to do so now in all sincerity but you do not know what you ask you come from the scene of as bitter a disappointment as can befall a man and you are a little touched by the contrasting warmth of your reception here a little moved by my evident interest and perhaps a little influenced by my good looks though they are nothing much supposing that i consented supposing i said arthur i will put my hand in yours and be your wife and that we were married tomorrow do you think when the freshness of the thing had worn off that you would be happy with me i do not you would soon get horribly tired of me arthur for the little leaven that leavens the whole lump is wanting you do not love me and the redundance of my affection would weary you and for my part i should find it difficult to continually struggle against an impalpable rival though indeed i should be very willing to put up with that  i am sorry you think so  yes arthur i do think so but you do not know what it costs me to say it i am deliberately shutting the door which bars me from my heaven i am throwing away the chance i strove so hard to win that will tell you how much i think it do you know i must be a strange contradiction when i knew you were engaged to another woman i strained my every nerve to win you from her while the object was still to be gained i felt no compunction i was fettered by no scruples i wanted to steal you from her and marry you myself but now that all this is changed and that you of your own free will come and offer to make me your wife i for the first time feel how wrong it would be of me to take advantage of you in a moment of pique and disappointment and bind you for life to a nature which you do not really understand to a violent and a jealous woman too late when your life was hampered and your future spoiled you would discover that you hated me arthur dear i will not consent to bind you to me by any tie that cannot be broken  hush mildred you should not say such things about yourself if you are as violent and jealous as you say you are also a very noble hearted woman for none other would so sacrifice herself perhaps you are right i do not know but whether you are right or wrong i cannot tell you how you have made me respect you  dear those are the most comfortable words i have ever heard after what has passed between us i scarcely thought to win your respect  then you will not marry me mildred  no  that is your fixed determination  it is  ah well he sighed i suppose that i had better top my boom again  do what  i mean i had better leave madeira  why should you leave madeira  he hesitated a little before replying  well because if i do not marry you and still come here people will talk they did before you know  are you afraid of being talked about then  i oh dear no what can it matter to me now  and supposing i were to tell you that what people say with or without foundation is as much a matter of indifference to me as the blowing of next summers breezes would you still consider it necessary to leave madeira  i dont know  he again rose and leant over the verandah rail  it is going to be a wild night he said presently  yes the wind will spoil all the magnolias pick me that bud it is too good to be wasted  he obeyed and just as he stepped back on to the verandah a fierce rush of wind came up from the sea and went howling away behind them  i love a storm she murmured as he brought the flower to her it makes me feel so strong and she stretched out her perfect arms as though to catch the wind  what am i to do with this magnolia  give it to me i will pin it in my dressno do you fasten it for me  the chair in which she was lounging was so low that to do as she bade him arthur was forced to kneel beside her kneeling thus the sweet upturned face was but just beneath his own the breath from the curved lips played amongst his hair and again there crept over him that feeling of fascination of utter helplessness that he had once before resisted but this time he did not attempt to resist and no vision came to save him slowly drawn by the beauty of her tender eyes he yielded to the spell and soon her lips were pressed upon his own and the white arms had closed around his neck whilst the crushed magnolia bloom shed its perfume round them  fiercer swept the storm the lightning flashed and the gale catching the crests of the rising waves dashed them in spray to where they sat  dear he said presently you must not stop here the spray is wetting you  i wish that it would drown me she answered almost fiercely i shall never be so happy again you think that you love me now i should like to die before you learn to hate me come let us go in                                 chapter lxiv  when mildred received lady bellamys telegram she was so sure that it would prove the forerunner of arthurs arrival at madeira that she had at once set about making arrangements for his amusement  it so happened that there was at the time a very beautiful seagoing steam yacht of about two hundred and fifty tons burden lying in the roadstead she belonged to a nobleman who was suddenly recalled to england by mailsteamer and through a series of chances mildred was enabled to buy her a bargain the crew of the departed nobleman also continued in her service  the morning after the storm broke sweet and clear and except that the flowers were somewhat shattered all nature looked the fresher for its violent visitation arthur who had come up early to the quinta mildred and miss terry were all seated at breakfast in a room that looked out to the sea which although the wind had died away still ran rather high they made a pretty picture as they sat round the englishlooking breakfasttable with the light pouring in upon them from the open windows miss terry with her usual expression of good humoured solemnity pouring out the tea and mildred and arthur who sat exactly opposite to each other drinking it never had the former looked more lovely than she did that morning  my dear said agatha to her what have you done to yourself you look beautiful  do i dear then it is because i am happy  agatha was quite right thought arthur she did look beautiful there was such depth and rest in her clear eyes such a wealth of happy triumph written on her features she might have sat that morning as a study of the venus victrix her talk too was as bright as herself she laughed and shone and sparkled like the raindrops on the bamboo sprays that rocked in the sunshine and whenever she addressed herself to arthur which was often enough every sentence seemed wrapped in tender meaning her whole life went out towards him a palpable thing she waited on his words and basked in his smile mildred carr did nothing by halves  arthur was the least cheerful of the three though at times he tried his best to join in mildreds merriment any one who knew him well could have told that he was suffering from one of his fits of constitutional melancholy and a physiognomist looking at the somewhat dreamy eyes and pensive face would probably have added that he neither was nor ever would be an entirely happy man  by degrees however he seemed to get the better of his thoughts whatever they might be  now arthur if you are quite awake began or rather went on mildred perhaps you will come to the window i have something to show you  here i am at your service what may it be  good now look do you see that little vessel in the bay beneath there to the right of leeuw rock  yes and uncommonly pretty she is what of her  what of her why she is my yacht  your yacht  goodness gracious mildred you dont mean to say that youve been buying a yacht and told me nothing about it just think well i call that sly  yes my dear agatha i have a yacht and a readymade crew and the very prettiest saloon in the world and sleepingcabins that you will think it an honour to be seasick in and a cooks galley with bright copper fittings and a cook with a white cap and steamsteering gear if you care to use it and  for goodness sake dont overwhelm us and what are you going to do with your white elephant now that you have got it  do with it why ride on it of course ladies and gentlemen or rather lady and gentleman attention you will both be in marching or rather in sailing order by four this afternoon for at five we start for the canaries now no remarks im a skipper and i expect to be obeyed or ill put you in irons  youve done that already said arthur sotto voce  mildred i wont go and thats flat  my dear you mean that you are afraid of being flat but agatha seriously you must come nobody is sick in those semitropical waters and if you wont i suppose it would not be quite the thing for arthur and i to go alone and then my dear just think what a splendid place the canaries must be for insects  why asked agatha solemnly  because of all the little birds it has to support  but i thought they lived on hempseed  oh nonot in their native land  well i suppose i must go but i really believe that you will kill me with your mania for seavoyages mildred i suppose you will take to ballooning next  that is by no means a bad idea i should like to see you in a balloon agatha  mildred i know where to draw the line into a balloon i will never go i have been into a madeira sledge and that is quite enough for me i always dream about it twice a week  well my dear i promise never to ask you when i want to go ballooning arthur and i will go by ourselves it would be a grand opportunity for a teteatete and now go and see about getting the things readytheres a dear and arthur do you send john down to miles for your portmanteau  hadnt i better go and see about it myself  certainly not i want you to help me and come down and talk to the skipper for he will be under your orders you know he is such a delightful sailorman perfect down to his quid and always says ay ay in the orthodox fashion certainly you must not go i will not trust you out of my sightyou might run away and leave me alone and then what should i do  arthur laughed and acquiesced sitting down he wrote a note asking the manager of the hotel to send his things up to the quinta carr together with his account as he was leaving madeira for the present  the rest of the morning was spent by everybody in busy preparation boxes were packed and provisions shipped sufficient to victual an arctic expedition at last everything was ready and at a little after three they went down the steps leading to the tiny bay and embarking on the smart boat that was waiting for them were conveyed in safety to the evening star for such was the yachts name arthur suggested that it should be changed to the mildred carr and got snubbed for his pains  the evening star was a beautiful craft built on fine lines but for all that a wonderful boat in a heavy sea she was a threemasted schooner squarerigged forward of large beam her fittings below were perfect down to the painted panels after watteau in the saloon and the electric bells and she was rigged either to sail or steam as might be most convenient on the present occasion as there was not the slightest hurry and no danger of a leeshore it was determined that they should not avail themselves of the steampower so the propeller was hoisted up and everything got ready for that most delightful thing a long cruise under canvas  arthur was perfectly charmed with everything he saw and so was agatha terry until they got under way when she discovered that a mail steamer was a joke compared with the yacht in the matter of motion in short the unfortunate agatha was soon reduced to her normal condition of torpor mildred always declared that she hibernated on board ship like a dormouse or a bear she was not very seasick she simply lay and slept eating very little and thinking not at all  by the way said arthur as they sailed out of the bay i never gave any directions about my letters  oh that will not matter answered mildred carelessly for they were leaning over the taffrail together they will keep them for you at miles hotel but my dear boy do you know what time it is ten minutes to seven that dreadful bell with be going in a minute and the soup will be spoiled run and get ready do                                 chapter lxv  when dinner was overmiss terry would have nonethey went and sat upon the moonlit deck the little vessel was under all her canvas for the breeze was light and skimmed over the water like a gull with its wings spread in the low light madeira was nothing but a blot on the skyline the crew were forward with the solitary exception of the man steering the vessel from his elevated position on the bridge and sitting as they were abaft the deckcabin the two were utterly alone between the great silence of the stars and of the sea she looked into his face and it was tender towards herthat night was made for loversand tears of happiness stood in her eyes she took his hand in hers and her head nestled upon his breast  i should like to sail on for ever so quite alone with you i never again wish to see the land or the sun or any other sea than this or any other eyes than yours to hear any more of the things that i have known to learn to know any fresh things if i could choose i would ask that i might now glide gently from your arms into those of eternal sleep oh arthur i am so happy nowso happy that i scarcely dare to speak for fear lest i should break the spell and i feel so goodso much nearer heaven when i think of all my past life it seems like a stupid dream full of little nothings of which i cannot recall any memory except that they were empty and without meaning but the future is worse than the past because it looks fair and snakes always hide in flowers it makes me afraid how do i know what the future will bring i wish that the presentthe pleasant certain present that i hold with my handcould last for ever  who does know mildred if the human race could see the pleasant surprises in store for it individually i believe that it would drown itself en masse who has not sometimes caught at the skirt of today and cried stay a littledo not let tomorrow come yet you know the lines          o temps suspends ton vol et vous heures propices           suspendez votre cours           laissez nous savourer les rapides delices           des plus beaux de nos jours  lamartine only crystallized a universal aspiration when he wrote that  oh arthur i tell you of love and happiness wide as the great sea round us and you talk of universal aspirations it is the first cold breath from that greyskied future that i fear oh dear i wonderyou do not know how i wonderif should you ask me again i shall ever with a clear conscience be able to say arthur i will marry you  my dear i asked you to be my wife last night and what i said then i say again now in any case until you dismiss me i consider myself bound to you but i tell you frankly that i should myself prefer that you would marry me for both our sakes  how cold and correct you are how clearly you realize the position in which i am likely to be put and in what a gentlemanlike way you assure me that your honour will always keep you bound to me that is a weak thread arthur in matters of the heart let angela reappear as my rivalwould honour keep you to my side honour forsooth it is like a nurses bogey in the cupboardit is a shibboleth men use to frighten naughty women with which for themselves is almost devoid of meaning even in this light i can see your face flush at her name what chance shall i ever have against her  do not speak of her mildred let her memory be dead between us she who belonged to me before god and whom i believed in as i believe in my god she offered me the most deadly insult that a woman can offer to a man she lovesshe sold herself what do i care what the price was whether it were money or position or convenience or the approbation of her surroundings the result is the same never mention her name to me again i tell you that i hate her  what a tirade there is warmth enough about you now i shall be careful how i touch on the subject again but your very energy shows that you are deceiving yourself i wish i could hear you speak of me like that because then i should know you loved me oh if she only knew itshe has her revenge for all your bitter words you are lashed to her chariotwheels arthur you do not hate her on the contrary you still long to see her face it is still your secret and most cherished hope that you will meet her again either in this or another world you love her as much as ever if she were dead you could bear it but the sharpest sting of your suffering lies in the humiliating sense that you are forced to worship a god you know to be false and to give your own pure love to a woman whom you see debased  he put his hands to his face and groaned aloud  you are right he said i would rather have known her dead than know her as she is but there is no reason why i should bore you with all this  arthur you are nothing if not considerate and i do not pretend that this is a very pleasant conversation for me but i began it so i suppose i must endure to see you groaning for another woman you say she went on with a sudden flash of passion that you should like to see her dead i say that i should like to kill her for she has struck me a double blowshe has injured you whom i love and she has beggared me of your affection oh arthur she continued changing her voice and throwing a caressing arm about his neck have you no heart left to give me is there no lingering spark that i can cherish and blow to flame i will never treat you so dear learn to love me and i will marry you and make you happy make you forget this faithless woman with the angel face i will here her voice broke down in sobs and in the starlight the great tears glistened upon her coraltinted face like dewdrops on a pomegranates blushing rind  there there dear i will try to forget dont cry and he touched her on the forehead with his lips  she stopped and then said with just the faintest tinge of bitterness in her voice if it had been angela who cried you would not be so cold you would have kissed away her tears  who can say what hidden chord of feeling those words touched or what memories they awoke but their effect upon arthur was striking he sprang up upon the deck his eyes blazing and his face white with anger  how often he said must i forbid you to mention the name of that woman to me do you take a pleasure in torturing me curse her may she eat out her empty heart in solitude and find no living thing to comfort her may she suffer as she makes me suffer till her life becomes a hell  be quiet arthur it is shameful to say such things  he stopped and after the sharp ring of his voice that echoed like the cry wrung from a person in intense pain the loneliness and quiet of the night were very deep and then an answer came to his mad unmanly imprecations for suddenly the air round them was filled with the sound of his own name uttered in such wild despairing accents as once heard were not likely to be forgotten accents which seemed to be around them and over them and heard in their own brains and yet to come travelling from immeasurable distances across the waste of waters  arthur arthur  the sound that had sprung from nothing died away into nothingness again and the moonlight glanced and the waters heaved and gave no sign of the place of its birth it had come and gone awful untraceable and in the place of its solemnity reigned silence absolute  they looked at each other with scared eyes  as i am a living man that voice was angelas  this was all he said                                 chapter lxvi  dr williamson was a rising young practitioner at roxham and what is more a gentleman and a doctor of real ability  on the night that lady bellamy took the poison he sat up very late till the dawn in fact working up his books of reference with a view to making himself as much the master as possible of the symptoms and most approved treatment in such cases of insanity as appeared to resemble angela caresfoots he had been called in to see her by mr fraser and had come away intensely interested from a medical point of view and very much puzzled  at length he shut up his books with a sighfor like most books though full of generalities they did not tell him muchand went to bed before he had been asleep very long however the surgery bell was violently rung and having dressed himself with the rapidity characteristic of doctors and schoolboys he descended to find a frightened footman waiting outside from whom he gathered that something dreadful had happened to lady bellamy who had been found lying apparently dead upon the floor of her drawingroom providing himself with some powerful restoratives and a portable electric battery he drove rapidly over to rewtham house  here he found the patient laid upon a sofa in the room where she had been found and surrounded by a mob of terrified and halfdressed servants at first he thought life was quite extinct but presently he fancied that he could detect a faint tremor of the heart he applied the most powerful of his restoratives and administered a sharp current from the battery and after a considerable time was rewarded by seeing the patient open her eyesbut only to shut them again immediately directing his assistant to continue the treatment he tried to elicit some information from the servants as to what had happened but all he could gather was that the maid had received a message not to sit up this made him suspicious of an attempt at suicide and just then his eye fell upon a wineglass that lay upon the floor broken at the shank he took it up in the bowl there was still a drop or two of liquid he smelt it then dipped his finger in and tasted it with the result that his tongue was burnt and became rough and numb then his suspicions were confirmed  presently lady bellamy opened her eyes again and this time there was intelligence in them she gazed round her with a wondering air next she spoke  where am i  in your own drawingroom lady bellamy be quiet now you will be better presently  she tried first to move her head then her arm then her lower limbs but they would not stir by this time her faculties were wide awake  are you the doctor she said  yes lady bellamy  then tell me why cannot i move my arms  he lifted her hand it fell again like a lump of leadand dr williamson looked very grave then he applied a current of electricity  do you feel that he asked  she shook her head  why cannot i move do not trifle with me tell me quick  dr williamson was a young man and had not quite conquered nervousness in his confusion he muttered something about paralysis  how is it that i am not dead  i have brought you back to life but pray do not talk  you fool why could you not let me die you mean that you have brought my mind to life and left my body dead i feel now that i am quite paralysed  he could not answer her what she said was only too true and his look told her so she gazed steadily at him for a moment as he bent over her and realized all the horrors of her position and for the first time in her life her proud spirit absolutely gave way for a few seconds she was silent and then without any change coming over the expression of her featuresfor the wild gaze with which she had faced eternity was for ever frozen thereshe broke out into a succession of the most heartrending shrieks that it had ever been his lot to listen to at last she stopped exhausted  kill me she whispered hoarsely kill me  it was a dreadful scene  as the doctors afterwards concluded rightly or wrongly a very curious thing had happened to lady bellamy either the poison she had takenand they were never able to discover what its exact nature was nor would she enlighten themhad grown less deadly during all the years that she had kept it or she had partially defeated her object by taking an overdose or as seemed more probable there was some acid in the wine in which it had been mixed that had had the strange effect of rendering it to a certain degree innocuous its result however was as she guessed to render her a hopeless paralytic for life  at length the patient sank into the coma of exhaustion and dr williamson was able to leave her in the care of a brother practitioner whom he had sent for and in that of his assistant sir john had been sent for but had not arrived it was then eleven oclock and at one the doctor was summoned as a witness to attend the inquest on george caresfoot he had therefore two hours at his disposal and these he determined to utilise by driving round to see angela who was still lying at mr frasers vicarage  mr fraser heard him coming and met him in the little drive he briefly told him what he had just seen and what in his opinion lady bellamys fate must beone of living death the clergymans remark was characteristic  and yet he said there are people in the world who say that there is no god  how is mrs caresfoot asked the doctor  she had a dreadful fit of raving this morning and we had to tie her down in bed she is quieter now poor dear there listen  at that moment through the open window of the bedroom they heard a sweet though untrained voice beginning to sing it was angelas and she was singing snatches of an oldfashioned sailorsong one of several which arthur had taught her        fare ye well and adieu to all you spanish ladies       fare ye well and adieu to ye ladies of spain       for weve received orders to return to old england       but we hope in a short time to see you again                                       we hove our ship to with the wind at souwest my boys       we hove our ship to for to strike soundings clear       it was fortyfive fathom and a grey sandy bottom       then we filled our main topsail and up channel did steer                                       the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor       all in the downs that night for to meet       so cast off your shankpainter let go your catstopper       hawl up your clewgarnets let fly tack and sheet   without waiting to hear any more they went up the stairs and entered the bedroom the first person they saw was pigott who had been sent for to nurse angela standing by the side of the bed and a trained nurse at a little table at the foot mixing some medicine on the bed itself lay angela shorn of all her beautiful hair her face flushed as with fever except where a blue weal bore witness to the blow from her husbands cruel whip her head thrown back and a strange light in her wild eyes she was tied down in the bed with a broad horsegirth stretched across her breast but she had wrenched one arm free and with it was beating time to her song on the bedclothes she caught sight of mr fraser at once and seemed to recognize him for she stopped her singing and laughed  thats a pretty old song isnt it she said somebody taught it me who was it somebodya long while ago but i know anotheri know another youll like it you are a clergyman you know and she began again             says the parson one day as i cursed a jew            now do you not know that that is a sin            of you sailors i fear there are but a few            that st peter to heaven will ever let in            says i mr parson to tell you my mind            few sailors to knock were ever yet seen            those who travel by land may steer against wind            but we shape a course for fiddlers green   suddenly she stopped and her mind wandered off to the scene of two days previous with arthur by the lake and she began to quote the words wrung from the bitterness of his heart  you miserable woman do you know what you are shame upon you were you not married yesterday it is quite true arthuroh yes quite true say what you like of me arthuri deserve it all but oh arthur i love you so dont be hard upon mei love you so dear kill me if you like dear but dont talk to me so i shall go madi shall go mad and she broke into a flood of weeping  poor dear she has been going on like that off and on all night it clean broke my heart to see it and thats the holy truth and pigott looked very much as though she were going to cry herself  by this time angela had ceased weeping and was brooding sullenly with her face buried in the pillow  there is absolutely nothing to be done said the doctor we can only trust to her fine constitution and youth to pull her through she has received a series of dreadful mental shocks and it is very doubtful if she will ever get over them it is a pity to think that such a splendid creature may become permanently insane is it not you must be very careful pigott that she does not do herself an injury she is just in the state that she may throw herself out of the window or cut her throat and now i must be going i will call in again tonight  mr fraser accompanied him down to the gate where he had left his trap before they got out of the front door angela had roused herself again and they could hear her beginning to quote homer and then breaking out into snatches of her sailorsongs                    high aloft amongst the rigging                    sings the loud exulting gale  thats like me i sing too and then followed peal upon peal of mad laughter  a very sad case she has a poor chance i fear  mr fraser was too much affected to answer him                                chapter lxvii  public feeling in marlshire was much excited about the caresfoot tragedy and when it became known that lady bellamy had attempted to commit suicide the excitement was trebled it is not often that the dullest and most highly respectable part of an eminently dull and respectable county gets such a chance of cheerful and interesting conversation as these two events gave rise to we may be sure that the godsend was duly appreciated indeed the whole story is up to this hour a favourite subject of conversation in those parts  of course the members of the polite society of the neighbourhood of roxham were divided into two camps the men all thought that angela had been shamefully treated the elder and most intensely respectable ladies for the most part inclined to the other side of the question it not being their habit to look at matters from the same point of view in which they present themselves to a mans nicer sense of honour they could see no great harm in george caresfoots stratagems a man so rich they argued was perfectly entitled to buy his wife the marriage had been arranged like their own on the soundest property basis and the woman who rose in rebellion against a husband merely because she loved another man or some such romantic nonsense deserved all she got gone mad had shewell it was a warning and these aristocratic matrons sniffed and turned up their noses they felt that angela by going mad and creating a public excitement had entered a mute protest against the recognized rules of marriage sale andbarter as practised in this countryand zululand having daughters to dispose of they resented this and poor angela was for years afterwards spoken of among them as that immoral girl  but the lower and more human strata of society did not sympathize with this feeling on the contrary they were all for angela and the dog aleck who was supposed to have chocked that carroty warmint george  the inquest on georges body was held at roxham and was the object of the greatest possible interest indeed the public excitement was so great that the coroner was perhaps insensibly influenced by it and allowed the inquiry to travel a little beyond its professed object of ascertaining the actual cause of death with the result that many of the details of the wicked plot from which angela had been the principal sufferer became public property needless to say that they did not soothe the feelings of an excited crowd when philip after spending one of the worst halfhours of his life in the witnessbox at length escaped with such shreds of reputation as he had hitherto possessed altogether torn off his back his greeting from the mob outside the court may fairly be described as a warm one as the witnesses door closed behind him he found himself at one end of a long lane that was hedged on both sides by faces not without a touch of ferocity about them and with difficulty kept clear by the available force of the five roxham policemen  who sold his daughter shouted a great fellow in his ear  let me come theres a dear man and have a look at judas said a skinny little woman with a squint to an individual who blocked her view  the crowd caught at the word judas it shouted go and hang yourself judas judas  how philip got out of that he never quite knew but he did get out somehow  meanwhile sir john bellamy was being examined in court and notwithstanding the almost aggressive innocence of his appearance he was not having a very good time it chanced that he had fallen into the hands of a rival lawyer who hated him like poison and had good reason to hate him it is wonderful by the way how enemies do spring up round a man in trouble like dogs who bite a wounded companion to death and on the same principle he is defenceless this gentleman would insist on conducting the witnesses examination on the basis that he knew all about the fraud practised with reference to the supposed death of arthur heigham now it will be remembered that sir john in his last interview with lady bellamy had declared that there was no tittle of evidence against him and that it would be impossible to implicate him in the exposure that must overtake her to a certain extent he was right but on one point he had overshot himself for at that very inquest mr fraser stated on oath that he mr fraser had spoken of arthur heighams death in the presence of sir john bellamy and had not been contradicted  in vain did sir john protest that mr fraser must be mistaken both the jury and the public looked at the probabilities of the matter and though his protestations were accepted in silence when he left the witnessbox there was not a man in court but was morally certain that he had been privy to the plot and so far as reputation was concerned he was a ruined man and yet legally there was not a jot of evidence against him but public opinion required that a scapegoat should be found and it was now his lot to figure as that unlucky animal  by the time he reached the exit into the street the impression that he had had a hand in the business had in some mysterious way communicated itself to the mob outside many a member of which had some old grudge to settle with lawyer bellamy if only chance put an opportunity in their way as he stepped through the door utterly ignorant of the greeting which awaited him his ears were assailed by an awful yell followed by a storm of hoots and hisses  sir john turned pale and looked for a means of escape but the policeman who had let him out had locked the door behind him and all round him was the angry mob  here comes the  that started the swim roared a voice as soon as there was a momentary lull  gentlemen piped sir john with all the pippin hue gone from his cheeks and rubbing his white hands together nervously  yah he poisoned his own poor wife shouted a woman with a baby  ladies went on sir john in agonized tones  pelt him yelled a sweet little boy of ten or so suiting the action to the word and planting a rotten egg full upon sir johns imposing brow  no no said the woman who had nicknamed philip judas why dont you drop him in the pond theres only two feet of water and its soft falling on the mud you can pelt him afterwards  the idea was received with acclamation and notwithstanding his own efforts to the contrary backed as they were by those of the five policemen before he knew where he was sir john found himself being hustled by a lot of sturdy fellows towards the filthy duckpond like an aristocrat to the guillotine they soon arrived and then followed the most painful experience of all his life one of which the very thought would ever afterwards move him most profoundly two strong men utterly heedless of his yells and lamentations took him by the heels and two yet stronger than they caught him by his plump and tender wrists and then under the directions of the woman with the squint they began to swing him from side to side as soon as the lady directress considered that the impetus was sufficient she said now and away he went like a swallow only to land when his flying powers were exhausted plump in the middle of the duckpond  some ten seconds afterwards a pillar of slimy mud arose and staggered towards the bank where a crowd of little boys each holding something offensive in his right hand were eagerly awaiting its arrival the squinteyed woman contemplated the figure with the most intense satisfaction  he sold me up once she murmured but were quits now thats it lads let him have it  but we will drop a veil over this too painful scene sir john bellamy was unwell for some days afterwards when he recovered he shook the dust of roxham off his shoes for ever                                chapter lxviii  a fortnight or so afterwards when the public excitement occasioned by the caresfoot tragedy had been partially eclipsed by a particularly thrilling childmurder and suicide a change for the better took place in angelas condition one night after an unusually violent fit of raving she suddenly went to sleep about twelve oclock and slept all that night and all the next day about halfpast nine on the following evening the watchers in her roomnamely pigott mr fraser and dr williamson who was trying to make out what this deep sleep meant were suddenly astonished at seeing her sit up in her bed in a listening attitude as though she could hear something that interested her intensely for the webbing that tied her down had been temporarily removed and then cry in a tone of the most living anguish and yet with a world of passionate remonstrance in her voice  arthur arthur  then she sank down again for a few minutes it was the same night that mildred and arthur sat together on the deck of the evening star presently she opened her eyes and the doctor saw that there was no longer any madness in them only great trouble her glance first fell upon pigott  run she said run and stop him he cannot have gone far bring him back to me quick or he will be gone  who do you mean dear  arthur of coursearthur  hush angela said mr fraser he has been gone a long time you have been very ill  she did not say anything but turned her face to the pillow and wept apparently as much from exhaustion as from any other cause and then dropped off to sleep again  her reason is saved said dr williamson as soon as they were outside the door  thanks be to providence and you doctor  thanks to providence alone it is a case in which i could do little or nothing it is a most merciful deliverance all that you have to do now is to keep her perfectly quiet and above all do not let her father come near her at present i will call in and tell him lady bellamy oh about the same she is a strange woman she never complains and rarely speaksthough twice i have heard her break out shockingly there will never be any alternation in her case till the last alteration goodbye i will look round tomorrow  after this angelas recovery was comparatively speaking rapid though of course the effects of so severe a shock to the nervous system could not be shaken off in a day though she was no longer mad she was still in a disturbed state of mind and subject to strange dreams or visions one in particular that visited her several nights in a succession made a great impression upon her  first it would seem to her that she was wide awake in the middle of the night and there would creep over her a sense of unmeasured space infinite silence and intense solitude she would think that she was standing on a dais at the end of a vast hall down which ran endless rows of pillars supporting an inky sky which was the roof there was no light in the hall yet she could clearly see there was no sound but she could hear the silence only a soft radiance shone from her eyes and brow she was not afraid though lonely but she felt that something would presently come to make an end of solitude and so she stood for many years or agesshe could not tell whichtrying to fathom the mystery of that great place and watching the light that streamed from her forehead strike upon the marble floor and pillars or thread the darkness like a shooting star only to reveal new depths of blackness beyond those it pierced at length there came softly falling from the skyroof which never stirred to any passing breeze a flake of snow larger than a doves wing but it was bloodred and in its centre shone a wonderful light that made its passage through the darkness a track of glory as it passed gently downwards without sound she thought that it threw the shadow of a human face it lit upon the marble floor and the red snow melted there and turned to blood but the light that had been its heart shone on pure and steady  looking up again she saw that the vault above her was thick with thousands upon thousands of these flakes each glowing like a crimson lamp and each throwing its own shadow one of the shadows was like george and she shuddered as it passed and ever as they touched the marble pavement the flakes melted and became blood and some of the lights went out but the most part burnt on till at length there was no longer any floor but a deadsea of blood on which floated a myriad points of fire  and then it all grew clear to her for a voice in her mind spoke and said that this was one of gods storehouses for human souls that the light was the soul and the red in the snow which turned to blood was the sin which had during its earthly passage stained its first purity the sea of blood before her was the sum of the scarlet wickedness of her age from every soul there came some to swell its awful waters  at length the red snow ceased to fall and a sound that was not a voice but yet spoke pealed through the silence asking if all were ready the voice that had spoken in her mind answered no he has not come who is to see then looking upwards she saw miles on miles away a bright being with halfshut wings flashing fast towards her and she knew that it was arthur and the loneliness left her he lit a breathing radiance by her side and again the great sound pealed let in the living waters and cleanse away the sins of this generation  it echoed and died away and there followed a tumult like the flow of an angry sea a mighty wind swept past her and after it an ocean of molten crystal came rushing through the illimitable hall the sea and the wind purged away the blood and put out the lamps leaving behind them a glow of light like that upon her brow and where the lamps had been stood myriads of seraphic beings whilst from ten thousand tongues ran forth a paean of celestial song    then everything vanished and deep gloom that was not however dark to her settled round them taking arthur by the hand she spread her white wings and circled upwards far far they sailed till they reached a giant peak that split space in twain here they alighted and watched the masses of cloud tearing through the gulfs on either side of them and looking beyond and below gazed upon the shining worlds that peopled space beneath them  from the clouddrifts to the right and left came a noise as of the soughings of many wings but they did not know what caused it till presently the vapours lifted and they saw that alongside of and beneath them two separate streams of souls were passing on outstretched pinions one stream that to their left proceeding to their earthly homes and one that to the right returning from them those who went wore grief upon their shadowy faces and had sad coloured wings but those who returned seemed for the most part happy and their wings were tipped with splendour  the neverending stream that came flowed from a faroff glory and that which returned having passed the dividing cliff on which they stood was changed into a multitude of the red snowflakes with the glowing hearts and dropped gently downwards  so they stood in happy peace never tiring from millennium to millennium they watched new worlds collecting out of chaos they saw them speed upon their high aerial course till grown hoary their foundationrocks crumbling with age they wasted away into the vastness whence they had gathered to be replaced by fresh creations that in their turn took form teemed with life waxed waned and vanished  at length there came an end and the soughing of wings was silent for ever no more souls went downwards and none came up from the earths then the distant glory from which the souls had come moved towards them with awful mutterings and robed in lightning and space was filled with spirits one of whom sweeping past them cried with a loud voice children time is dead now is the beginning of knowledge and she turned to arthur who had grown more radiant than the star which gleamed upon his forehead and kissed him  then she would wake    time passed on and gradually health and strength came back to angela till at last she was as powerful in mind andif that were possible except that she was shorn of her lovely hair more beautiful in body than she had been before her troubles overwhelmed her of arthur she thought a great dealindeed she thought of little else but it was with a sort of hopelessness that precluded action nobody had mentioned his name to her as it was thought wiser not to do so though pigott and mr fraser had in as gentle terms as they could command told her of the details of the plot against her and of the consequences to the principal actors in it nor had she spoken of him it seemed to her that she had lost him for good that he could never come back to her after she had passed that he must hate her too much she supposed that in acting as he did he was aware of all the circumstances of her marriage and could find no excuses for her she did not even know where he was and in her ignorance of the uses of private detectives and advertisements had no idea how to find out and so she suffered in silence and only saw him in her dreams  she still stopped at the vicarage with pigott nor had there as yet been any talk of her returning to the abbey house indeed she had not seen her father since the day of her marriage but now that she had recovered she felt that something must be done about it wondering what it should be she one afternoon walked to the churchyard where she had not been since her illness and once there made her way naturally to her mothers grave she was moving very quietly and had almost reached the tree under which hilda caresfoot lay when she became aware that there was already somebody kneeling by the grave with his head rested against the marble cross  it was her father her shadow falling upon him he turned and saw her and they stood looking at each other she was shocked at the dreadful alteration in his face it was now that of an old man nearly worn out with suffering he put his hand before his eyes and said  angela how can i face you least of all here  for a moment the memory of her bitter wrongs swelled in her heart for she now to a great extent understood what her fathers part in the plot had been and she regarded him in silence  father she said presently i have been in the hands of god and not in yours and though you have helped to ruin my life and have very nearly driven me into a madhouse i can still say let the past be the past but why do you look so wretched you should look happy you have got the landmy price you know and she laughed a little bitterly  why do i look wretched because i am given over to a curse that you cannot understand and i am not alone where are those who plotted against you george dead bellamy gone lady bellamy paralysed hand and foot and myselfalthough i did not plot i only let them be accursed but if you can forget the past why do you not come back to my house of course i cannot force you you are free and rich and can suit yourself  i will come for a time if you wishif i can bring pigott with me  you may bring twenty pigotts for all i careso long as you will pay for their board he added with a touch of his old miserliness but what do you mean for a time  i do not think i shall stop here long i think that i am going into a sisterhood  oh well you are your own mistress and must do as you choose  then i will come tomorrow and they parted                                 chapter lxix  and so on the following day angela and pigott returned to the abbey house but they both felt that it was a sad homecoming indeed if there had been no other cause for melancholy the sight of philips face was enough to excite it in the most happyminded person not that angela saw much of him however for they still kept to their old habit of not living together all day her father was shut up in his room transacting business that had reference to the accession of his property and the settlement of georges affairs for his cousin had died intestate so he took his personalty and wound up the estate as heiratlaw at night however he would go out and walk for miles and in all weathershe seemed to dread spending the dark hours at home  when angela had been back about a month in the old place she accidentally got a curious insight into her fathers mental sufferings  it so happened that one night finding it impossible to sleep and being much oppressed by sorrowful thoughts she thought that she would read the hours away but the particular book she wanted to find was downstairs and it was two oclock in the morning and chilly in the passages however anything is better than sleeplessness and the tyranny of sad thoughts and empty longings so throwing on her dressinggown she took a candle and set off thinking as she went how she had in the same guise fled before her husband  she got her book and was returning when she saw that there was still a light in her fathers study and that the door was ajar at that moment it so happened that an unusually sharp draught coming down one of the passages of the rambling old house caught her candle and extinguished it making her way to the studydoor she pushed it open to see if anybody was there previous to asking for a light at first she could see nobody on the table which was covered with papers there stood two candles a brandybottle and a glass she was just moving to the candle to get a light when her eye fell on what she at first believed to be a heap of clothes huddled together on the floor in the corner of the room further examination showed that it was a manshe could distinctly see the backs of his hands her first ideas was that she had surprised a thief and she stopped feeling frightened and not knowing what to do just then the bundle straightened itself a little and dropped its hands revealing to her wondering gaze her own fathers face which wore the same awful look of abject fear which she had seen upon it when he passed through the hall beneath her just before isleworth broke into flame on the night of her marriage the eyes appeared to be starting from the sockets in an effort to clearly realize an undefinable horror the hair now daily growing greyer was partially erect and the pallid lips half opened as though to speak words that would not come he saw her too but did not seem surprised at her presence covering up his eyes again with one hand he shrank further back into his corner and with the other pointed to a large leather armchair in which pigott had told her her grandfather had died  look there he whispered hoarsely  where father i see nothing  there girl in the chairlook how it glares at me  angela stood aghast she was alarmed in defiance of her own reason and began to catch the contagion of superstition  this is dreadful she said for heavens sake tell me what is the matter  philips ghastly gaze again fixed itself on the chair and his teeth began to chatter  great god he said it is coming  and uttering a smothered cry he fell on his face in a half faint the necessity for action brought angela to herself seizing the waterbottle she splashed some water into her fathers face he came to himself almost instantly  where am i he said ah i remember i have not been quite well you must not think anything of that what are you doing down here at this time of night pass me that bottle and he took nearly half a tumbler of raw brandy there i am quite right again now i had a bad attack of indigestion that is all good night  angela went without a word she understood now what her father had meant when he said that he was accursed but she could not help wondering whether the brandy had anything to do with his indigestion  on the following day the doctor came to see her it struck angela that he came oftener than was necessary the fact being that he would gladly have attended her gratis all year round a doctor does not often get the chance of visiting such a patient  you do not look quite so well today he said  no she answered with a little smile i had bad dreams last night  ah i thought so you should try to avoid that sort of thing you are far too imaginative already  one cannot run away from ones dreams murder will out in sleep  well i have a message for you  who from  lady bellamy you know that she is paralysed  yes  well she wants you to go and see her shall you go  angela thought a little and answered  yes i think so  you must be prepared for some bitter language if she speaks at all very likely she will beg you to get her some poison to kill herself with i have been obliged to take the greatest precautions to prevent her from obtaining any i am not very sensitive but once or twice she has positively made me shiver with the things she says  she can never say anything more dreadful to me than she has said already dr williamson  perhaps not go if you like if you were revengefulwhich i am sure you are notyou would have good reason to be satisfied at what you will see medically speaking it is a sad case  accordingly that every afternoon angela accompanied by pigott started off for rewtham house where lady bellamy still lived or rather existed it was her first outing since the inquest on george caresfoot had caused her and her history to become publicly notorious and as she walked along she was surprised to find that she was the object of popular sympathy every man she met touched or took off his hat according to his degree and as soon as she had passed turned round and stared at her some fine folks whom she did not know indeed she knew no one though it had been the fashion to send and inquire during her illnessdrove past in an open carriage and pair and she saw a gentleman on the front seat whisper something to the ladies bringing round their heads towards her as simultaneously as though they both worked on a single wire even the children coming out of the village school set up a cheer as she passed  good gracious pigott what is it all about she asked at last  well you see miss they talk of you in the papers as the abbey house heroineand heroines is rare in these parts  overwhelmed with so much attention angela was thankful when at last they reached rewtham house  pigott went into the housekeepers room and angela was at once shown up into the drawingroom the servant announced her name to a black robed figure lying on a sofa and closed the door  come here angela caresfoot said a wellknown voice and see how fate has repaid the woman who tried to ruin you  she advanced and looked at the deathly face still as darkly beautiful as ever on which was fixed that strange look of wild expectancy that it had worn when its owner took the poison  yes look at me think what i was and then what i am and learn how the spirit of evil pays those who serve him i thought to kill myself but death was denied me and now i live as you see me i am an outcast from the society of my kindnot that i ever cared for that except to rule it i cannot stir hand or foot i cannot write i can scarcely read i cannot even die my only resource is the bitter sea of thought that seethes eternally in this stricken frame like fire pent in the womb of a volcano yes angela caresfoot and like the fire too sometimes it overflows and then i can blaspheme and rave aloud till my voice fails that is the only power which is left to me  angela uttered an exclamation of pity  pitydo not pity me i will not be pitied by you mock me if you will it is your turn now you prophesied that it would come now it is here  at any rate you are still comfortable in your own house said angela nervously anxious to change the subject and not knowing what to say  oh yes i have money enough if that is what you mean my husband threatened to leave me destitute but fear of public opinionand i hear that he has run away and is not well thought of nowor perhaps of myself cripple as i am caused him to change his mind but do not let us talk of that poor creature i sent for you here for a purpose where is your lover  angela turned pale and trembled  what do you not know or are you tired of him  tired of him i shall never be tired of him but he has gone  shall i tell you where to find him  you would not if you could you would deceive me again  no oddly enough i shall not i have no longer any object in doing so when i was bent upon marrying you to george caresfoot i lashed myself into hating you now i hate you no longer i respect you indeed i have done so all along  then why did you work me such a bitter wrong  because i was forced to believe me or not as you will i am not going to tell you the storyat any rate not now i can only repeat that i was forced to  where is arthur  in madeira do you remember once telling me that you had only to lift your handsoah i forgot i cannot lift mineto draw him back to you that no other woman in the world could keep him from you if you chose to bid him come  yes i remember  then if you wish to get him back you had better exercise your power for he has gone to another woman  who is she what is she like  she is a young widowa mrs carr she is desperately in love with himvery beautiful and very rich  beautiful how do you mean tell me exactly what she is like  she has brown eyes brown hair a lovely complexion and a perfect figure  angela glanced rapidly at her own reflection in the glass and sighed  then i fear that i shall have no chance against hernone  you are a fool if you were alone in the same room with her nobody would see her for looking at you  angela sighed again this time from relief  but there is worse than that very possibly he has married her  ah then it is all over  why if he loves you as much as you think you can bring him back to you married or unmarried  perhaps yes i think i could but i would not  why if he loves you and you love him you have a right to him among all the shams and fictions that we call laws there is only one true the law of nature by virtue of which you belong to each other  no there is a higher lawthe law of duty by means of which we try to curb the impulses of nature the woman who has won him has a right to consideration  then to gratify a foolish prejudice you are prepared to lose him forever  no lady bellamy if i thought that i was to lose him for ever i might be tempted to do what is wrong in order to be with him for a time but i do not think that i only lose him for a time that i may gain him for ever in this world he is separated from me in the worlds to come my rights will assert themselves and we shall be together and never part any more  lady bellamy looked at her wonderingly for her eyes could still express her emotions  you are a fine creature she said and if you believe that perhaps it will be true for you since faith must be the measure of realization but after all he may not have married her that will be for you to find out  how can i find out  by writing to him of courseto the care of mrs carr madeira that is sure to find him  thank you how can i thank you enough  it seems to me that you owe me few thanks you are always foolish about what tends to secure your own happiness or you would have thought of this before  there was a pause and then angela rose to go  are you going yes go i am not fit company for such as you perhaps we shall not meet again but in thinking of all the injuries that i have done you remember that my punishment is proportionate to my sin they tell me that i may live for years  angela gazed at the splendid wreck beneath her and an infinite pity swelled in her gentle heart stooping she kissed her on the forehead a wild astonishment filled lady bellamys great dark eyes  child child what are you doing you do not know what i am or you would not kiss me  yes lady bellamy she said quietly i do that is i know what you have been but i want to forget that perhaps you will one day be able to forget it too i do not wish to preach but perhaps after all this terrible misfortune may lead you to something better thank god there is forgiveness for us all  her words touched some forgotten chord in the stricken womans heart and two big tears rolled down the frozen cheeks they were the first anne bellamy had wept for many a day  your voice she said has a music that awakes the echoes from a time when i was good and pure like you but that time has gone for ever  surely lady bellamy the heart that can remember it can also strive to reach another like it if you have descended the cliff whence those echoes spring into a valley however deep there is still another cliff before you that you may climb  it is easy to descend but we need wings to climb look at me angela my body is not more crippled and shorn of power than my dark spirit is of wings how can i climb  angela bent low beside her and whispered a few words in her ear then rose with a shy blush upon her face lady bellamy shut her eyes presently she opened them again  do not speak any more of this to me now she said i must have time the instinct of years cannot be brushed away in a day if you knew all the sins i have committed perhaps you would think too that for such as i am there is no forgiveness and no hope  whilst there is life there is hope and as i once heard mr fraser say the real key to forgiveness is the desire to be forgiven  again lady bellamy shut her eyes and thought and when she drew up their heavy lids angela saw that there was something of a peaceful look about them  stand so she said to angela there where the light falls upon your face that will do now shall i tell you what i read there on your forehead sit resolute power to grasp and almost measureless capacity to imagine in your eyes there is a sympathy not to be guessed by beings of a coarser fibre those eyes could look at heaven and not be dazzled your whole face speaks of a purity and singlemindedness which i can read but cannot understand your mind rejects the glittering bubbles that men follow and seeks the solid truth your spirit is in tune with things of light and air it can float to the extremest heights of our mental atmosphere and thence can almost gaze into the infinite beyond pure but not cold thirsting for a wider knowledge and at times breathing the air of a higher world resolute but patient proud and yet humble to learn holy but aspiring conscious of gifts you do not know how to use girl you rise as near to what is divine as a mortal may i have always thought so now i am sure of it  lady bellamy  hush i have a reason for what i say i do not ask you to waste time by listening to senseless panegyrics listen i will tell you what i have never told to a living soul before for years i have been a student of a lore almost forgotten in this countrya lore which once fully acquired will put the powers that lie hid in nature at the command of its possessor that will even enable him to look beyond nature and perhaps so far as the duration of existence is concerned for awhile to triumph over it that lore you can learn though it baffled me my intellect and determination enabled me to find the cues to it and to stumble on some of its secrets but i could not follow them too late i learnt that only the good and pure can do that much of the result of years of toil i destroyed the other night but i still know enough to empower you to reconstruct what i annihilated you can learn more in one year than i learnt in ten i am grateful to you and if you wish it i will show you the way  angela listened openeyed lady bellamy was right she was greedy of knowledge and the power that springs from knowledge  but would it not be wrong she said  there can be nothing wrong in what the ruling wisdom allows us to acquire without the help of what is evil but do not be deceived such knowledge and power as this is not a thing to be trifled with to obtain a mastery over it you must devote your life to it you must give it           allegiance whole not strained to suit desire  no earthly passion must come to trouble the fixed serenity of your aspirations that was one but only one of the reasons of my failure you must leave your arthur to mrs carr and henceforward put him as much out of your mind as possible and this that you may be able to separate yourself from earthly bonds and hopes and fears troubled waters reflect a broken image  i must then choose between this knowledge and my love  yes and you will do well if you choose the knowledge for before you dieif indeed you do not in the end for a certain period overcome even deathyou will be more of an angel than a woman on the one hand then this proud and dizzy destiny awaits you on the other everyday joys and sorrows shared by all the world and an ordinary attachment to a man against whom i have indeed nothing to say but who is not your equal and who is at the best full of weaknesses that you should despise  but lady bellamy his weaknesses are a part of himself and i love him all just as he is weakness needs love more than what is strong  perhaps but in return for your love i offer you no empty cup i do not ask you to follow fantastic theoriesof that i will soon convince you shall i show you the semblance of your arthur and mrs carr as they are at this moment  no lady bellamy no i have chosen you offer after years of devotion to make me almost like an angel the temptation is very great and it fascinates me but i hope if i can succeed in living a good life to become altogether an angel when i die why then should i attempt to filch fragments of a knowledge that will one day be all my ownif indeed it is right to do so whilst i am here arthurs love is more to me than such knowledge can ever be if he is married i may learn to think differently and try to soothe my mind by forcing it to run in these hidden grooves till then i choose arthur and my petty hopes and fears for after all they are the natural heritage of my humanity  lady bellamy thought for awhile and answered  i begin to think that the great power who made us has mixed even his most perfect works with an element of weakness lest they should soar too high and see too far the prick of a pin will bring a balloon to earth and an earthly passion angela will prevent you from soaring to the clouds so be it you have had your chance it is only one more disappointment                                 chapter lxx  angela went home very thoughtful the next three days she spent in writing first she wrote a clear and methodical account of all the events that had happened since arthurs first departure more than a year ago and attached to it copies of the various documents that had passed between herself and george including one of the undertaking that her husband had signed before the marriage this account was in the form of a statement which she signed and taking it to mr fraser read it to him and got him to sign it too it took her two whole days to write and when it was done she labelled it to be read first on the third day she wrote the following letter to go with the statement  for the first time in my life arthur i take up my pen to write to you and in truth the difficulty of the task before me as well as my own want of skill tends to bewilder me and though i have much upon my mind to say i scarcely know if it will reach youif indeed this letter is ever destined to lie open in your handsin an intelligible form  the statement that i enclose however willin case you do not already know themtell you all the details of what has happened since you left me more than a year ago from it you will learn how cruelly i was deceived into marrying george caresfoot believing you dead oh through all eternity never shall i forget that fearful night nor cease to thank god for my merciful escape from the fiend whom i had married and then came the morning and brought youthe deadalive before my eyes and whilst i stood in the first tumult of my amaze forgetful of everything but that it was you my own my beloved arthur no spirit but you in flesh and bloodwhilst i yet stood thus stricken to silence by the shock of an unutterable joyyou broke upon me with those dreadful words so that i choked feeling how just they must seem to you and could not answer  and yet it sometimes fills me with wonder and indignation to think of them wonder that you could believe me so mad as to throw away the love of my life and indignation that you could deem me so lost as to dishonour it they drove me mad those words and from that moment forward i remember nothing but a chaos of the mind heaving endlessly like the sea but all this has passed and i am thankful to say that i am quite well again now  still i should not have written to you arthur i did not even know where you were and i never thought of recovering you after what has passed i looked upon you as altogether lost to me for this world but a few days ago i went at her own request to see lady bellamy all she said to me i will not now repeat lest i should render this letter too wearisome to read though a great deal of it was strange enough to be well worth repetition in the upshot however she said that i had better write to you and told me where to write and so i write to you dear there was also another thing that she told me of sad import for myself but which i must not shrink to face she said that there lived at madeira where you are a lady who is in love with you and is herself both beautiful and wealthy to whom you would have gone for comfort in your trouble and in all probability have married  now arthur i do not know if this is the case but if so i hasten to say that i do not blame you you smarted under what must have seemed to you an intolerable wrong and you went for consolation to her who had it to offer in a man that is perhaps natural though it is not a womans way if it be so i say from my heart be as happy as you can but remember what i told you long ago and do not fall into any delusions on the matter do not imagine because circumstances have shaped themselves thus therefore i am to be put out of your mind and forgotten for this is not so i cannot be forgotten though for a while i may be justly discarded it is possible that for this world you have passed out of my reach but in the next i shall claim you as my own  yes arthur i have made up my mind to lose you for this life as a fitting reward for my folly but do not think that i do so without a pang for believe me since my mind emerged stronger and clearer from the storms through which it has passed bringing back to me the full life and strength of my womanhood i have longed for you with an ever increasing longing i am not ashamed to own that i would give worlds to feel your arms about me and your kiss upon my lips why should i be am i not yours body and soul  but dear it has been given to me perhaps as a compensation for all i have undergone and that is still left for me to undergo to grasp a more enduring end than that of earthly ecstasy for i can look forward with a confident assurance to the day when we shall embrace upon the threshold of the infinite do not call this foolish imagination or call it imagination if you willfor what is imagination is it not the connecting link between us and our souls and recalling memories of our home imagination what would our higher life be without it it is what the mind is to the body it is the souls thought  so in my imaginationsince i know no better termi foresee that heavenly hour and i am not jealous for the earthly moment nor indeed have i altogether lost you for at times in the stillness of the night when the earthly part is plunged in sleep and my spirit is released from the thraldom of the senses it at indefinite periods has the power to summon your beloved form to its presence and in this communion nature vindicates her faithfulness thus through the long night rest comes upon me with your presence  and at last there will come a greater rest at lasthaving lived misunderstoodwe shall die alone and then the real life or lives will begin it is not always night for the dawn is set beyond the night and through the gates of dawn we shall journey to the day it is not always night even in the womb of darkness throbs the promise of the morning i often wonder arthur how and what this change will be shall we be even as we are but still through unnumbered ages growing slowly on to the divine or casting off the very semblance of mortality shall we rise at one wide sweep to the pinnacle of fulfilled time there to learn the purposes and mark the measure of all being  how can i know but this i believe that whatever the change however wide and deep the darkness which stretches between what is and what is not yet we cannot lose ourselves therein identity will still be ours and memory the janusheaded will still pursue us calling to our minds the enacted evil and that good which having been must always be for we are immortal and though we put off the mortal dress yes though our forms become as variable as the clouds and assume proportions of which we cannot dreamyet shall memory companion us and identity remain for we are each fashioned apart for ever and built about with such an iron wall of individual life that all the force of time and change cannot so much as shake it and while i am myself and yet in any shape endure of this be certainthe love that is a part of me will endure also oh herein is set my hopenay not my hope for hope upon the tongue whispers doubt within the heart but the most fixed unchanging star of all my heaven it is not always night for the dawn is set beyond the night and oh my hearts beloved at daybreak we shall meet again  oh arthur even now i long for the purer air and flashing sympathies of that vast hereafter when the strong sense of knowledge shall scarcely find a limit ere it overleaps it when visible power shall radiate from our being and living on together through countless existences periods and spheres we shall progress from majesty to evergrowing majesty oh for the day when you and i messengers from the seat of power shall sail high above these darkling worlds and seeing into each others souls shall learn what loves communion is  do not think me foolish dear for writing to you thus i do not wish to make you the victim of an outburst of thought that you may think hysterical but perhaps i may never be able to write to you again in this way your wife if you are married may be jealous or other things may occur to prevent it i feel it therefore necessary to tell you my inmost thoughts now whilst i can so that you may always remember them during the long coming years and especially when you draw near to the end of the journey i hope dearest arthur that nothing will ever make you forget them and also that for the sake of the pure love you will for ever bear me you will always live up to your noblest and your best for in this way our meeting will be made more perfect  of course it is possible that you may still be free and after you know that i am not quite so much to blame as you may have thought still willing to give your name to me it is a blessed hope but i scarcely dare to dwell upon it  the other day i was reading a book mr fraser lent me which took my fancy very much it was so full of contradictions the unexpected always happened in it and there was both grief and laughter in its pages it did not end quite well or quite badly or rather it had no end and deep down underneath the plotless story only peeping up now and again when the actors were troubled there ran a vein of real sorrow and sad unchanging love there was a hero in this odd book which was so like lifewho by the way was no hero at all but a curious restless creature who seemed to have missed his mark in life and went along looking for old truths and new ideas with his eyes so fixed upon the stars that he was always stumbling over the pebbles in his path and thinking that they were rocks he was a sensitive man too and as weak as he was sensitive and often fell into pitfalls and did what he should not and yet for all that he had a quaint and gentle mind and there was something to like in himat least so thought the women in that book there was a heroine too who was all that a heroine should be very sweet and very beautiful and she really had a heart only she would not let it beat and of course the hero and heroine loved each other of course too they both behaved badly and things went wrong or there would have been no book  but i tell you this story because once in a rather touching scene this hero who made such a mess of things set forth one of the ideas that he had found and thought new but which was really so very old he told the heroine that he had read in the stars that happiness has only one key and that its name is love that amidst all the mutabilities and disillusions of our life the pure love of a man and woman alone stands firm and beautiful alone defies change and disappointment that it is the heavensent salve for all our troubles the remedy for our mistakes the magic glass reflecting only what is true and good but in the end her facts overcame his theories and he might have spared himself the trouble of telling and for all his stargazing this hero had no real philosophy but in his grief and unresting pain went and threw himself into the biggest pitfalls that he could find and would have perished there had not a good angel come and dragged him out again and brushed the mud off his clothes and taking him by the hand led him along a safer path and so for awhile he drops out of the story which says that when he is not thinking of the lost heroine he is perhaps happier than he deserves to be  now arthur i think that this foolish hero was right and the sensible heroine he worshipped so blindly wrong  if you are still unmarried and still care to put his theories to the test i believe that we also can make as beautiful a thing of our lives as he thought that he and his heroine could and ourselves supremely happy in each others perfect love may perhaps be able to add to the happiness of some of our fellowtravellers that is i think as noble an end as a a man and woman can set before themselves  but if on the other hand you are tied to this other woman who loves you by ties that cannot be broken or that honour will not let you break or if you are unforgiving and no longer wish to marry me as i wish to marry you then till that bright hour of immortal hope farewell yes arthur farewell till the gate of time has closed for ustill in the presence of god our father i shall for ever call you mine  alas i am so weak that my tears fall as i write the word perhaps i may never speak or write to you again so once more my dearest my beloved my earthly treasure and my heavenly hope farewell may the blessing of god be as constantly around you as my thoughts and may he teach you that these are not foolish words but rather the faint shadow of an undying light  i send back the ring that was used to trick me with perhaps whatever happens you will wear it for my sake it is you know a symbol of eternity                                                     angela caresfoot                                 chapter lxxi  just as angela was engaged in finishing her long letter to arthur surely one of the strangest ever written by a girl to the man she lovedmr fraser was reading an epistle which had reached him by that afternoons post we will look over his shoulder and see what was in it  it was a letter dated from the vicarage of one of the poorest parishes in the great dock district in the east of london it began    dear sir   i shall be only too thankful to entertain your proposal for an   exchange of livings more especially as at first sight it would   seem that all the advantage is on my side the fact is that the   incessant strain of work here has at last broken down my health to   such a degree that the doctors tell me plainly i must choose   between the comparative rest of a country parish or the certainty   of passing to a completer quiet before my time also now that my   children are growing up i am very anxious to remove them from the   sights and sounds and tainted moral atmosphere of this poverty   stricken and degraded quarter   but however that may be i should not be doing my duty to you if   i did not warn you that this is no parish for a man of your age to   undertake unless for strong reasons for i see by the clergy list   that you are a year or so older than myself the work is   positively ceaseless and often of a most shocking and thankless   character and there are almost no respectable inhabitants for   nobody lives in the parish except those who are too poor to live   elsewhere the stipend too is as you are aware not large   however if in face of these disadvantages you still entertain   the idea of an exchange perhaps we had better meet      the letter then entered into details  i think that will suit me very well said mr fraser aloud to himself as he put it down it will not greatly matter if my health does break down and i ought to have gone long ago positively ceaseless he says the work is well ceaseless work is the only thing that can stifle thought and yet it will be hard coming up by the roots after all these years ah me this is a queer world and a sad one for some of us i will write to the bishop at once  from which it will be gathered that things had not been going well with mr fraser  meanwhile angela put her statement and the accompanying letter into a large envelope then she took the queer emerald ring off her finger and as there was nobody looking she kissed it and wrapped it up in a piece of cottonwool and stowed it away in the letter and sealed it up next she addressed it in her clear miniature handwriting to               arthur p heigham esq                                care of mrs carr                                                madeira   as lady bellamy had told her and calling to pigott to come with her started off to the postoffice to register and post her precious packet for the madeira mail left southampton on the morrow  she had just time to reach the office affix the three shillings worth of stamps that the letter took and register it when the postman came up and she saw it stamped and bundled into his bag with the others just as though it were nothing instead of her whole life depending on it and away it went on its journey as much beyond recall as yesterdays sins  and so you have been awriting to him miss said pigott as soon as they were out of the office  yes pigott and she told her what lady bellamy had said she listened attentively with a shrewd twinkle in her eyes  im thinking dearie that its a pity you didnt post yourself thats the best letter it cant make no mistakes nor fall into the hands of them it isnt meant for  what can you mean  im thinking miss that change of air is a wonderful good thing after sickness especially seaair answered pigott oracularly  i dont in the least understand you really pigott you drive me wild with your parables  lord dear for all youre so clever you never could see half an inch into a brick wall and that with my meaning as clear as a haystick in a thunderstorm  this last definition quite finished angela why she wondered should a haystack be clearer in a thunderstorm than at any other time she looked at her companion helplessly and was silent  bless me what i have been telling as plain as plain can be is why dont you go to this madmadwhats the namei never can think of them foreign names im like jakes and the flowers he says the smaller and footier they are the longer the name they sticks on to them just to puzzle a body who  madeira suggested angela with the calmness of despair  yes thats itmadeiry well why dont you go to madeiry along with your letter to look after mr arthur like enough he is in a bit of a mess there so far as i know anything about their ways young men always are in a general sort of way for everlasting acaterwauling after some one or other for all the world like a tom on the tiles more especial if they are in love with somebody else but dear me a sensible woman dont bother her head about that she just goes and hooks them out of it and then she knows where they are and keeps them there  oh pigott never mind all these reflections though im sure i dont know how you can think of such things the idea of comparing poor dear arthur with a tomcat but tell me how can i go to madeira supposing that he is married  well then you would learn all about it for yourself and no gammoning and thered be an end to it one way or the other  but would it be quite modest to run after him like that  modest indeed and why shouldnt a young lady travel for her health i have heard say that this madeiry is a wonderful place for the stomach  the lungs pigottthe lungs  well then the lungs but it dont matter they aint far off each other  but pigott who could i go with i could not go alone  go with why me of course  i can hardly fancy you at sea pigott  and why not miss i dare say i shall do as well as other folks there and if i do go to the bottom as seems likely theres plenty of room for a respectable person there i should hope look here dear youll never be happy unless you marry mr arthur so dont you go and throw away a chance just out of foolishness and for fear of what folks say thats how dozens of women make a mess of it folks say one thing today and another tomorrow but youll remain you for all that maybe hes married and if so its a bad business and theres an end of it but maybe too he isnt as for that letter as likely as not the other one will put it in the fire i should i doubt if i were in her shoes so dont you lose any time for if he isnt married its like enough he soon will be  angela felt that there was sense in what her old nurse said though the idea was a new one to her and it made her thoughtful  ill think about it she said presently i wonder what mr fraser would say about it  perhaps one thing and perhaps another hes good and kind but he hasnt got much head for these sort of things hes always thinking of something else just look what a fool squire george may he twist and turn in his grave made of him you ask him if you like but you be guided by yourself dearie your head is worth six reverend frasers when you bring it to a thing but i must be off and count the linen  that evening after tea angela went down to mr frasers he was directing an envelope to the lord bishop of his diocese when she entered but he hurriedly put it away in the blottingpaper  well angela did you get your letter off  yes mr fraser it was just in time to catch the mail tomorrow but do you know that is what i want to speak to you about pigott thinks that under all the circumstanceshere angela hesitated a littleshe and i had better go to madeira and find out how things stand and i almost think that she is right  certainly answered mr fraser rising and looking out of the window you have a great deal at stake  you do not think that it would be immodest  my dear angela when in such a case as this a woman goes to seek the man she loves and whom she believes loves her i do not myself see where there is room for immodesty  no nor do i and i do love him so very dearly he is all my life to me  mr fraser winced visibly  what is the matter have you got a headache  nothing only a twinge here and he pointed to his heart  angela looked alarmed she took a womanly interest in anybodys ailments  i know what it is she said widow james suffers from it you must take it in hand at once or it will become chronic after meals as hers is  mr fraser smiled grimly as he answered  i am afraid that i have neglected it too longit has become chronic already but about madeira have you then made up your mind to go  yes i think that i shall go if heis married you knowi can always come back again and perhaps pigott is right the letter might miscarry and there is so much at stake  when shall you go then  by the next steamer i suppose they go every week i think i will tell my father that i am going tomorrow  ah you will want money i suppose  no i believe that i have plenty of money of my own now  oh yes under your marriage settlement no doubt well my dear i am sure i hope that your journey will not be in vain did i tell you i have also written to mr heigham by this mail and told him all i knew about the matter  that is very kind and thoughtful of you it is just like you answered angela gently  not at all not at all but you have never told me how you got on with lady bellamythat is except what she told you about mr heigham  oh it was a strange interview what do you think she wanted to teach me  i have not the faintest idea  magic  nonsense  yes she did she told me that she could read all sorts of things in my face and offered if i would give myself up to it to make me more than human  pshaw it was a bit of charlatanism she wanted to frighten you  no i think she believed what she said and i think that she has some sort of power she seemed disappointed when i refused and do you know it if it had not been for arthur i do not think that i should have refused i love power or rather knowledge but then i love arthur more  and why is he incompatible with knowledge  i do not know but she said that to triumph over the mysteries she wished to teach me i must free myself from earthly love and cares i told her that if arthur is married i would think of it  well angela to be frank i do not believe in lady bellamys magic and if its practice brings people to what she is i think it is best left alone indeed i expect that the whole thing is a delusion arising from her condition but i think she is right when she told you that to become a mistress of her artor indeed of any noble art you must separate yourself from earthly passions i owe your arthur a grudge as well as lady bellamy i hoped angela to see you rise like a star upon this age of insolence and infidelity i wanted you to be a great woman but that dream is all over now  why mr fraser  because my dear both history and observation teach us that great gifts like yours partake of the character of an accident in a woman they are not natural to her and she does not wear such jewels easily they put her outside of her sex it is something as though a man were born into the world with wings at first he would be very proud of them and go sailing about in the sky to the admiration of the crowds beneath him but byandby he would grow tired of flying alone and after all it is not necessary to fly to transact the ordinary business of the world and perhaps at last he would learn to love somebody without wings somebody who could not fly and he would always want to be with her down on the homely earth and not alone up in the heavenly heights if a woman had all the genius of plato or all the learning of solomon it would be forgotten at the touch of a babys fingers  well well we cannot fight against human nature and i daresay that in a few years you will forget that you can read greek as well as you can english and were very near finding out a perfect way of squaring the circle perhaps it is best so lady bellamy may have read a great many fine things in your face shall i tell you what i read there i read that you will marry your arthur and become a happy wife and a happier mother that your life will be one long story of unassuming kindness and that when at last you die you will become a sacred memory in many hearts that is what i read the only magic you will ever wield angela will be the magic of your goodness  who knows we cannot read the future she answered  and so you are going to madeira next week then this will be the last time that we shall meetbefore you go i meanfor i am off to london tomorrow for a while on some business when next we meet if we do meet again angela you will be a married woman do not start dear there is nothing shocking about that but perhaps we shall not meet any more  oh mr fraser why do you say such dreadful things  there is nothing dreadful about it angela i am getting on in life and am not so strong as i was and you are both young and strong and must in the ordinary course of things outlive me for many years but whatever happens my dear i know that you always keep a warm corner in your memory for your old master and as for me i can honestly say that to have known and taught you has been the greatest privilege of a rather lonely life  here angela began to cry  dont cry my dear there is thank god another meetingplace than this and if i reach the shore of that great future before you i shallbut there my dear it is time for you to be going home you must not stop here to listen to this melancholy talk go home angela and think about your lover i am busy tonight give me a kiss dear and go  presently she was gone and he heard the frontdoor close behind her he went to the window and watched the tall form gradually growing fainter in the gloaming till it vanished altogether  then he came back and sitting down at his writingtable rested his grizzled head upon his hand and thought presently he raised it and there was a sad smile flickering round the wrinkles of the nervous mouth  and now for hard labour at the london docks he said aloud                                chapter lxxii  nothing occurred to mar the prosperity of the voyage of the evening star that beautiful little vessel declined to simplify the course of this history by going to the bottom with mildred and arthur as the imaginative reader may have perhaps expected she did not even get into a terrific storm in order to give arthur the opportunity of performing heroic feats and the writer of this history the chance of displaying a profound knowledge of the names of ropes and spars on the contrary she glided on upon a sea so still that even miss terry was persuaded to arouse herself from her torpor and come upon deck till at last one morning the giant peak of teneriffe soaring high above its circling clouds broke upon the view of her passengers  here they stopped for a week or so enjoying themselves very much in their new surroundings till at length arthur grew tired of the islands which was of course the signal for their departure so they returned reaching madeira after an absence of close upon a month as they dropped anchor in the little bay mildred came up to arthur and touching him with that gentle deference which she always showed towards him asked him if he was not glad to be home again  home he said i have no home  oh arthur she answered why do you try to pain me is not my home yours also  so soon as they landed he started off to miles hotel to see if any letters had come for him during his absence and returned looking very much put out  what is the matter arthur asked miss terry once again happy at feeling her feet upon solid soil  why those idiots at the hotel have returned a letter sent to me by my lawyer they thought that i had left madeira for good and the letter was marked if left return to messrs borley and son with the address and the mail went out this afternoon into the bargain so it will be a month before i can get it back again  had arthur known that this letter contained clippings of the newspaper reports of the inquest on george caresfoot of whose death even he was in total ignorance he would have had good reason to be put out  never mind arthur said mildreds clear voice at his elbowshe was rarely much further from him than his shadow lawyers letters are not as a rule very interesting i never yet had one that would not keep come and see if your pavilionisnt that a grand nameis arranged to your liking and then let us go to dinner for agatha here is dying of hungershe has to make up for her abstinence at sea  i was always told broke in that lady that yachting was charming but i tell you frankly i have never been more miserable in my life than i was on board your evening star  never mind dear you shall have a nice long rest before we start for the coast of spain  and so arthur soon settled down again into the easy tenor of madeira life he now scarcely made a pretence of living at the hotel since during their cruise mildred had had a pavilion which stood in the garden luxuriously set up for his occupation here he was happy enough in a dull numb way and as the days went on something of the old light came back to his eyes and his footfall again grew quick and strong as when it used to fall in the corridors of the abbey house of the past he never spoke nor did mildred ever allude to angela after that conversation at sea which had ended so strangely she contented herself with attempting to supplant her and to a certain extent she was successful no man could have for very long remained obdurate to such beauty and such patient devotion and it is not wonderful that he grew in a way to love her  but there was this peculiarity about the affairnamely that the affection which he bore her was born more of her stronger will than of his own feelings as was shown by the fact that so long as he was actually with her and within the circle of her influence her power over him was predominant but the moment that he was out of her sight his thoughts would fall back into their original channels and the old sores would begin to run however much too he might be successful in getting the mastery of this troubles by day at night they would assert themselves and from the constant and tormenting dreams which they inspired he could find no means of escape  for at least four nights out of every seven from the moment that he closed his eyes till he opened them again the morning it would seem to him that he had been in the company of angela under every possible variety of circumstance talking to her walking with her meeting her suddenly or unexpectedly in crowded places or at dinnerparties always her and no one elsetill at last poor arthur began to wonder if his spirit took leave of his body in sleep and went to seek her and what is more found her or was it nothing but a fantasy he could not tell but at any rate it was a fact and it would have been hard to say if it distressed or rejoiced him most  occasionally too he would fall into a fit of brooding melancholy that would last him for a day or two and which mildred would find it quite impossible to dispel indeed when he got in that way she soon discovered that the only thing to do was to leave him alone he was suffering acutely there was no doubt about that and when any animal suffers including man it is best left in solitude a sick or wounded beast always turns out of the herd to recover or die  when mildred saw him in this state of mental desolation she would shake her head and sigh for it told her that she was as far as ever from the golden gate of her eldorado as has been said hers was the strongest will and even if he had not willed it she could have married him any day she wished but odd as it may seem she was too conscientious she had determined that she would not marry him unless she was certain that he loved her and to this resolution as yet she firmly held whatever her faults may have been mildred carr had all the noble unselfishness that is so common in her sex for herself and her own reputation she cared comparatively speaking nothing whilst for arthurs ultimate happiness she was very solicitous  one eveningit was one of arthurs black days when he had got a fit of what mildred called angela feverthey were walking together in the garden arthur in silence with his hands in his pockets and his pipe in his mouth and mildred humming a little tune by way of amusing herself when they came to the wall that edged the precipice arthur leant over it and gazed at the depths below  dont dear you will tumble over said mildred in some alarm  i think it would be a good thing if i did he answered moodily  are you then so tired of the worldand me  no dear i am not tired of you forgive me mildred but i am dreadfully miserable i know that it is very ungracious and ungrateful of me but it is the fact  you are thinking of her again arthur  yes i have got a fit of it i suppose that she has not been out of my mind for an hour altogether during the last fortyeight hours talk of being haunted by a dead person it is infinitely worse being haunted by a living one  i am very sorry for you dear  do you suppose mildred that this will go on for all my life that i shall always be at the mercy of these bitter memories and thoughts  i dont know arthur i hope not  i wish i were deadi wish i were dead he broke out passionately she has destroyed my life all that was happy in me is dead only my body lives on i am sure i dont know mildred how you can care for anything so worthless  she kissed him and answered  dearest i had rather love you as you are than any other man alive time does wonders perhaps in time you will get over it oh arthur when i think of what she has made you and what you might have been if you had never known her i long to tell that woman all my mind but you must be a man dear it is weak to give way to a mad passion such as this is now try to think of something else work at something  i have no heart for it mildred i dont feel as though i could work and if you cannot make me forget i am sure i do not know what will  mildred sighed and did not answer though she spoke hopefully about it to him she had little faith in his getting over his passion for angela now either she must marry him as he was or else let him go altogether but which the struggle between her affection and her idea of duty was very sore and as yet she could come to no conclusion  one thing there was that troubled her considerably and this was that though madeira was almost empty there were enough people in it to get up a good deal of gossip about herself and arthur now it would have been difficult to find anybody more entirely careless of the judgments of society than mildred more especially as her great wealth and general popularity protected her from slights but for all her oddities she was a thorough woman of the world and she knew none better that in pursuance of an almost invariable natural law there is nothing that lowers a woman so much in the estimation of a man as the knowledge that she is talked about even though he himself is the cause of the talk this may be both illogical and unjust but it is none the less true  but if mildred still hesitated arthur did not he was very anxious that they should be married indeed he almost insisted on it the position was one that was far from being agreeable to him for all such intimacies must from their very nature necessitate a certain amount of false swearing they are throughout an acted lie and when the lie is acted it must sometimes be spoken now this is a state of affairs that is repugnant to an honourable man and one that not unfrequently becomes perfectly intolerable many is the loveaffair that comes to a sudden end because the man finds it impossible to permanently constitute himself a peregrinating falsehood but oddly enough it has been found difficult to persuade the other contracting party of the validity of the excuse and however unjust it may be one has known of men who have seen their defection energetically set down to more vulgar causes  arthur was no exception to this rule he found himself in a false position and he hated it indeed he determined before long he would place it before mildred in the light of an alternative that he should either marry her or that an end should be put to their existing relations                                chapter lxxiii  as the autumn came on a great southwest gale burst over madeira and went sweeping away up the bay of biscay it blew for three days and nights and was one of the heaviest on record when it first began the english mail was due but when it passed there were still no signs of her and prophets of evil were not wanting who went to and fro shaking their heads and suggesting that she had probably foundered in the bay  two more days went by and there were still no signs of her though the telegraph told them that she had left southampton docks at the appointed time and date by this time people in madeira could talk of nothing else  well arthur no signs of the roman said mildred on the fifth day  no the garth castle is due in today perhaps she may have heard something of her  yes said miss terry absently she may have fallen in with some of the wreckage  i must say that is a cheerful suggestion answered arthur she is an awful old tub and i daresay ran before the gale for vigo that is all  let us hope so said mildred doubtfully what is it john  the housemaid wishes to speak to you please maam  very good i will come  it has been hinted that agatha terry was looking absent on the morning in question there was a reason for it for some time past there had been growing up in the bosom of this excellent lady a consciousness that things were not altogether as they should be miss terry was not clever indeed it may be said that she was dense but still she could not but see that there was something odd in the relations between arthur and mildred for instance it struck her as unusual that two persons who were not married nor even so far as she knew engaged should habitually call each other dear and even sometimes dearest  but on the previous evening when engaged in a search after that species of beetle that loves the night she chanced to come across the pair standing together on the museum verandah and to her horror she saw even in that light that mildreds arm was round arthurs neck and her head was resting on his heart standing aghast she saw more for presently mildred raised her hand and drawing arthurs head down to the level of her own kissed him upon the face  there was no doubt about it it was a most deliberate kissa kiss without any extenuating circumstances he was not even going away and agatha could only come to one conclusion that they were either going to be marriedor they ought to be  she sought no more beetles that evening but on the following morning when mildred departed to see the housemaid leaving arthur and herself together on the verandah she thought it was her duty to seek a little information  arthur she said with a beating heart i want to ask you something are you engaged to mildred  he hesitated and then answered  no i suppose not miss terry  nor married to her  no why do you ask  because i think you ought to be  i quite agree with you i suppose that you have noticed something  yes i have i saw her kissing you arthur  he blushed like a girl  oh arthur she went on bursting into tears dont let this sort of thing go on or poor mildred will lose her reputation and you must know what a dreadful thing that is for any woman why dont you marry her  because she refused to marry me  and yetand yet she kisses youlike that added miss terry as the peculiar fervour of the embrace in question came back to her recollection ah i dont know what to think  best not think about it at all miss terry it wont bear reflection  oh arthur how could you  he looked very uncomfortable as he answered  i know that i must seem a dreadful brute to you i daresay i am but miss terry it would under all the circumstances be much more to the point if you insisted on mildreds marrying me  i dare not you do not know mildred she would never submit to it from me  then i must and what is more i will do it now  thank you arthur thank you i cannot tell you how grateful i am to you  there is no need to be grateful to the author of this mischief  and supposing she refuseswhat will you do then  then i think that i shall go away at once hush here she comes  well arthur what are you and agatha plotting together you both look serious enough  nothing mildredthat is only another seavoyage  mildred glanced at him uneasily she did not like the tone in his voice  i have a bit of bad news for you arthur that fool that idiot janeand she stamped her little foot upon the pavementhas upset the mummy hyacinthpot and broken the flower off just as it was coming into bloom i have given her a quarters wages and her passage back to england and packed her off  why mildred remonstrated miss terry what a fuss to make about a flower  she turned on her almost fiercely  i had rather have broken my arm or anything short of my neck than that she should have broken that flower arthur planted it and now the clumsy girl has destroyed it and mildred looked as though she were going to cry  as there was nothing more to be said miss terry went away as soon as she was gone mildred turned to arthur and said  you were right arthur we shall never see it bloom in this world  never mind about the flower dear it cannot be helped i want to speak to you of something more important miss terry saw you kiss me last night and she not unnaturally is anxious to know what it all means  and did you tell her  yes  it was mildreds turn to blush now  mildred you must listen to me this cannot go on any more either you must marry me or  or what  or i must go away at present our whole life is a lie  do you really wish me to marry you arthur  i not only wish it i think it necessary  have you nothing more to say than that  yes i have to say that i will do my best to make you a good and faithful husband and that i am sure you will make me a good wife  she dropped her face upon her hands and thought  just then miss terry came hurrying up  oh arthur she said just think the roman is in after all but all her boats are gone and they say that half of her passengers and crew are washed overboard do go down and see about it  he hesitated a little  go dear whispered mildred i want time to think i will give you my answer this afternoon  mildred sat still on the verandah thinking but she had not been there many minutes before a servant came with her english letters that had been brought by the unfortunate roman and at the same time informed her that the garth castle had been sighted and would anchor in a few hours mildred reflected that it was not often they got two english mails in one day she began idly turning over the packet before her of late letters had lost much of their interest for mildred  presently however her hand made a movement of almost electric swiftness and the colour left her face as she seized a stout envelope directed in a hand of peculiar delicacy to arthur heigham esq care of mrs carr madeira mildred knew the handwriting she had seen it in arthurs pocketbook it was angela caresfoots next to it there was another letter addressed to arthur in a hand that she did not know but bearing the same postmarks bratham and roxham she put them both aside and then took up the thick letter and examined it it had two peculiaritiesfirst it was open having come unsealed in transit and been somewhat roughly tied up with a piece of twine and secondly it contained some article of jewellery indeed by dint of a little pressing on the outside paper she was able to form a pretty accurate opinion as to what it was it was a ring if she had turned pale before when she saw the letter she was paler still now  heavens she thought why does she send him a ring has anything happened to her husband if she is a free woman i am lost  mildred looked at the letter lying open before her and a terrible temptation took possession of her she took it up and put it down again and then again she took it up wiping the cold perspiration from her forehead  my whole life is at stake she thought  then she hesitated no longer but taking the letter slipped off the piece of twine and drew its contents from the envelope the first thing to fall out wrapped in a little cottonwool was the ring she looked at it and recognized it as arthurs engagement ring the same that lady bellamy had taken with her then putting aside the statement she deliberately unfolded the letter and read it  do not think too hardly of her my reader the temptation was very sore but when one yields to temptation retribution is not unfrequently hard upon its track and it would only have been necessary to watch mildreds face to see that if she had sinned the sin went hand in hand with punishment in turn it took an expression of astonishment grief awe and despair she read the letter to the last word then she took the statement and glanced through it smiling once or twice as she read next she replaced everything in the envelope and taking it together with the other letter addressed to arthur unbuttoned the top of her loosebodied white dress and placed them in her bosom  it is over she said to herself i can never marry him now that woman is as far above me as the stars and sooner or later he would find it all out he must go ah god he must go to marry her why should i not destroy these letters and marry him tomorrow bind him to me by a tie that no letters can ever break what purchase his presence at the price of his daily scorn oh such water is too bitter for me to drink i have sinned against you arthur but i will sin no more goodbye my dear goodbye  and she laid her throbbing head upon the rail of the verandah and wept bitterly                                chapter lxxiv  about three oclock that afternoon arthur returned to the quinta having lunched on board the roman he found mildred sitting in her favourite place on the museum verandah she was very pale and if he had watched her he would have seen that she was trembling all over but he did not observe her particularly  well he said it is all nonsense about half the crew being drowned only one man was killed by the fall of a spar poor chap they ran into vigo as i thought the other mail is just coming in but what is the matter mildred you look pale  nothing dear i have a good deal to think of that is all  ah yes well my love have you made up your mind  why did i refuse to marry you before for your sake or mine arthur  you saidabsurdly i thoughtfor mine  and what i said i meant and what i meant i mean look me in the face dear and tell me upon your honour as a gentleman that you love me really love me and i will marry you tomorrow  i am very fond of you mildred and i will make you a good and true husband  precisely that is what i expected but it is not enough for me there was a time when i thought that i could be well satisfied if you would only look kindly upon me but i suppose that lappetit vient en mangeant for now you do that i am not satisfied i long to reign alone but that is not all i will not consent to tie you who do not love me to my apronstrings for life believe me the time is very near when you would curse me if i did you sayand she rose and stretched out her armthat you will either marry me or go i have made my choice i will not beat out my heart against a stone i will not marry you go arthur go  a great anxiety came into his face  do you fully understand what you are saying mildred such ties as exist between us cannot be lightly broken  but i will break them and my own heart with them before they become chains so heavy that you cannot bear them arthurand she came up to him and put her hands upon his shoulders looking with wild and sorrowful eyes straight into his facetell me now deardo not palter or put me off with any courteous falsehoodtell me as truly as you will speak upon the judgmentday do you still love angela caresfoot as much as ever  mildred you should not ask me such painful questions it is not right of you  it is right and you will soon know that it is answer me  then if you must have it i do  her face became quite hard slowly she took her hands from his shoulders  and you have the effrontery to ask me to marry you with one breath and to tell me this with the next arthur you had better go do not consider yourself under any false obligation to me go and go quickly  for gods sake think what you are doing mildred  oh i have thoughti have thought too much there is nothing left but to say goodbye yes it is a very cruel word do you know that you have passed over my life like a hurricane and wrenched it up by the roots  really mildred you mystify me i dont understand you what can be the meaning of all this  she looked at him for a few seconds and then answered in a quiet matteroffact voice  i forgot arthur here are your english letters and she drew them from her bosom and gave them to him perhaps they will explain things a little meanwhile i will tell you something angela caresfoots husband is dead indeed she was never really married to him and then she turned and slowly walked towards the entrance of the museum in the boudoir however her strength seemed to fail her and she sank on a chair  arthur took the letter written by the woman he loved and warm from the breast of the woman he was about to leave and stood speechless his heart stopped for a moment and then sent the blood bounding through his veins like a flood of joy the shock was so great that for a second or two he staggered and nearly fell presently however he recovered himself and another and very different thought overtook him  putting the letters into his pocket he followed mildred into the boudoir she was sitting looking very faint upon a chair her arms hanging down helplessly by her side  mildred he said hoarsely  she looked up with a faint air of surprise  what are you not gone  mildred beyond what you have just said i know nothing of the contents of these letters but whatever they may be here and now before i read them i again offer to marry you i owe it to you and to my own sense of what is right that i should marry you  he spoke calmly and with evident sincerity  do you know that i read your letter just now and had half a mind to burn it that i am little better than a thief  i guessed that you had read it  and do you understand that your angela is unmarried that she was never really married at alland that she asks nothing better than to marry you  i understand  and you still offer to make me your wife  i do what do you say  a flood of light filled mildreds eyes as she rose and confronted him  i say arthur that you are a very noble gentleman and that though from this day i must be a miserable woman i shall always be proud to have loved you listen my dear when i read that letter i felt that your angela towered over me like the alps her snowy purity stained only by the reflected lights of heaven i felt that i could not compete with such a woman as this that i could never hope to hold you from one so calmly faithful so dreadfully serene and i knew that she had conquered robbing me for time and as i fear leaving me beggared for eternity in the magnificence of her undying power in the calm certainty of her command she flings me your life as though it were nothing take it she says he will never love youhe is mine but i can afford to wait i shall claim him before the throne of god but now look you arthur if you can behave like the generous hearted gentleman you are i will show you that i am not behind you in generosity i will not marry you i have done with you or to be more correct and she gave a hard little laugh you have done with me go back to angela the beautiful woman with inscrutable grey eyes who waits for you clothed in her eternal calm like a mountain in its snows i shall send her that tiara as a weddingpresent it will become her well go back arthur but sometimes when you are cloyed with unearthly virtue and perfection remember that a woman loved you there i have made you quite a speech you will always think of me in connection with fine words why dont you go  arthur stood utterly confused  and what will you do mildred  i she answered with the same hard laugh oh dont trouble yourself about me i shall be a happy woman yet i mean to see life nowgo in for pleasure power ritualism whatever comes first perhaps when we meet again i shall be lady minster or some other great lady and shall be able to tell you that i am very very happy a woman always likes to tell her old lover that you know though she would not like him to believe it perhaps tooand here her eyes grew soft and her voice broke into a sobi shall have a consolation you know nothing of  he did not know what she meant indeed he was halfdistracted with grief and doubt  for a moment more they stood facing each other in silence and then suddenly she flung her arms above her head and uttering a low cry of grief turned and ran swiftly down the stone passage into the museum arthur hesitated for a while and then followed her  a painful sight awaited him in that silent chamber for there stretched on the ground before the statue of osiris like some hopeless sinner before an inexorable justice with her brown hair touched to gold by a ray of sunlight from the rooflay mildred as still as though she were dead he went to her and tried to raise her but she wrenched herself loose and in an abandonment of misery flung herself upon the ground again  i thought it was over she said and that you were gone go dear or this will drive me mad perhaps sometimes you will write me  he knelt beside her and kissed her and then he rose and went  but for many a year was he haunted by that scene of human misery enacted in the weird chamber of the dead never could he forget the sight of mildred lying in the sunlight with the marble face of mocking calm looking down upon her and the mortal frames of those who in their day had suffered as she suffered and ages since had found the rest that she in time would reach scattered all aroundfit emblems of the fragile vanity of passions which suck their strength from earth alone                                 chapter lxxv  when arthur got out of the gates of the quinta carr he hurried to the hotel with the intention of reading the letters mildred had given him and passing through the diningroom seated himself upon the stoep which overlooked the garden in order to do so at this time of year it was generally speaking a quiet place enough but on this particular day scarcely had arthur taken the letter from his pocket andhaving placed the ring that it contained upon his trembling finger and repudiating the statement marked to be read first on account of its businesslike appearanceglanced at the two first lines of angelas own letter when the sound of hurrying feet and many chattering voices reminded him that he could expect no peace anywhere in the neighbourhood of the hotel the second english mail was in and all the crowd of passengers who were at this time pouring out to the cape to escape the english winter had come rejoicing ashore to eat drink be merry and buy parrots and wicker chairs while the vessel coaled  he groaned and fled in his hurry leaving the statement on the bench on which he was seated  some halfmile or so away to the left of the town where the sea had encroached a little upon the shore of the island there was a nook of peculiar loveliness here the giant hand of nature had cleft a ravine in the mountains that make madeira down which a crystal streamlet trickled to the patch of yellow sand that edged the sea its banks sloped like a natural terrace and were clothed with masses of maidenhair ferns interwoven with feathery grasses whilst up above among the rocks grew aloes and every sort of flowering shrub  behind clothed in forest lay the mass of mountains varied by the rich green of the vineclad valleys and in front heaved the endless ocean broken only by one lonely rock that stood grimly out against the purpling glories of the evening sky this spot arthur had discovered in the course of his rambles with mildred and it was here that he bent his steps to be alone to read his letters scarcely had he reached the place however when he discovered to his intense vexation that he had left the enclosure in angelas letter upon the verandah at the hotel but luckily it chanced that within a few yards of the spot where he had seated himself there was a native boy cutting walkingsticks from the scrub he called to him in portuguese of which he had learnt a little and writing something on a card told him to take it to the manager of the hotel and to bring back what he would give him delighted at the chance of earning sixpence the boy started at a run and at last he was able to begin to read his letter    had arthur not been in quite such a hurry to leave the hotel he might have seen something which would have interested him namely a very lovely womanso lovely indeed that everybody turned their heads to look at her as she passed accompanied by another woman clad in a stiff black gown not at all lovely and rather ancient but for all that wellfavoured and pleasant to look on being duly convoyed to their room in the hotel by his friend the manager  well thank my stars here we be at last said the elderly stout person with a gasp as the door of the room closed upon the pair and its my opinion that here i shall stop till my dying day for as for getting on board one of those beastly ships again i couldnt do it and thats flat now look here dearie dont you sit there and look frightened but just set to and clean yourself up a bit im off downstairs to see if i can find out about things everybodys sure to know everybody elses business in a place like this because you see the gossip cant get out of a bit of an island it must travel round and round till it ewaporates i shall soon know if he is married or not and if he is why whats done cant be undone and its no use crying over spilt milk and well be off home though i doubt i shant live to get there and if he isnt why so much the better  oh nurse do stop talking and go quickly cant you see that i am in an agony of suspense i must get it over one way or the other  hurry no mans cattle my dear or i shall make a mess of it now miss angela just you keep cool it aint no manner of use flying into a state ill be back presently  but as soon as she was gone poor angela flew into a considerable state for flinging herself upon her knees by the bed she broke into hysterical prayers to her maker that arthur might not be taken from her poor girl alternately racked by sick fears and wild hopes hers was not a very enviable position during the apparently endless ten minutes that followed  meanwhile pigott had descended to the cool hall round which were arranged rows of hammocks and was looking out for some one with whom to enter into conversation a portuguese waiter approached her but she majestically waved him away under the impression that he could not speak english though as a matter of fact his english was purer than her own  presently a pretty little woman leading a baby by the hand came up to her  pray do you want anything i am the wife of the manager  yes maam i want a little informationat least theres another that does did you ever happen to hear of a mr heigham  mr heigham indeed yes i know him well he was here a few minutes since  then perhaps maam you can tell me if he is married to a mrs carr that lives on this island  not that i know of she answered with a little smile but there is a good deal of talk about thempeople say that though they are not married they ought to be you know  thats the best bit of news i have heard for many a day as for the talk i dont pay no manner of heed to that if he aint married to her he wont marry her now ill go bail thank you kindly maam  at that moment they were interrupted by the entrance of a little ragged boy into the hall who timidly held out a card to the lady to whom pigott was talking  do you want to find mr heigham she said because if so this boy will show you where he is he has sent here for a paper that he left i found it on the verandah just now and wondered what it was perhaps you would take it to him if you go i dont like trusting this boyas likely as not he will lose it  that will just suit just you tell the boy to wait while i fetch my young lady and we will go with him is this the paper and in her writing too well i never there ill be back in no time  pigott went upstairs far too rapidly for a person of her size and years with the result that when she reached their room where angela was waiting half dead with suspense she could only gasp  well said angela be quick and tell me  oh lord them stairs gasped pigott  for pitys sake tell me the worst  now miss do give a body time and dont be a foolbegging pardon for  oh pigott you are torturing me  well miss you muddle me sobut i am coming to it i went down them dratted stairs and there i see a wonderful nicelooking party with a baby  for gods sake tell meis arthur married  why no dearieof course not i was just agoing to say  but whatever valuable remark pigott was going to make was lost to the world for ever for angela flung her arms round her neck and began kissing her  oh oh thank godthank god oh oh oh  whereupon pigott being a very sensible person took her by the shoulders and tried to shake her but it was no joke shaking a person of her height angela stood firm and pigott oscillatedthat was the only visible result  now then miss she said giving up the shaking as a bad job no highstrikes if you please just you put on your hat and come for a bit of a walk in this queer place with me i havent brought you up by hand this twoandtwenty year or thereabouts to see you go off in highstrikes like a housemaid as has seen a ghost  angela stopped and did as she was bid                                chapter lxxvi  arthur read his letter and his heart burnt with passionate love of the true woman he had dared to doubt then he flung himself upon the grass and looked at the ocean that sparkled and heaved before him and tried to think but as yet he could not the engines of his mind were reversed full speed whilst his mind itself with quick shudders and confusion still forged ahead upon its former course he rose and cast upon the scene around him that long look we give to the place where a great happiness has found us  the sun was sinking fast behind the mountains turning their slabbed sides and soaring pinnacles to giant shields and spears of fire beneath their mass shadowsforerunners of the nightcrept over the forests and the crested rollers whilst further from him the ocean heaved in a rosy glow above the everchanging vault of heaven was of a beauty that no brush could paint on a groundwork of burning red were piled height upon height deep ridges of purples and of crimsons nearer the horizon the colours brightened to a dazzling gold till at length they narrowed to the white intensity of the half hidden eye of the sun vanishing behind the mountains whilst underlying the steady splendour of the upper skies flushed soft and melting shades of rose and lilac blue space above him was broken up by fantastic clouds that floated all on fire and glowed like molten metal the reflection too of all these massed and varied lights in the azure of the eastern skies was full of sharp contrasts and soft surprises and a travelling eagle sailing through space before them seemed to gather all their tints upon his vivid wings and as he passed away to leave a rainbow track of broken light  but such a glory was too bright to last the sun sank swiftly the celestial fires paled the purples grew faint and died and where they had been night trailed her sombre plumes across the sea and sky  but still the quiet glow of evening lingered and presently a line of light was shot athwart it cutting a track of glory across the shadowed sea so weird and sudden that it might well have been the first ray of a resurrection morn breaking in upon the twilight of the dead  he gazed almost in awe till the majestic sight stilled the tumult of his heart and his thoughts went up in thanks to the creator for the pure love he had found again and which had not betrayed him then he looked up and there stately and radiant standing out clear against the shadows her face illumined by that soft yet vivid light her trembling arms outstretched to clasp himwas his lost angela  he saw her questioning glances fall upon him and the red blood waver on her cheek he saw the lovelights gather in her eyes and then he saw no more for she was in his arms murmuring sweet broken words  happy are those who thus shall find their angela whether it be here oron the further shore of yonder solemn sea    and mildred she lay there before the stone symbol of inexorable judgment and sobbed till the darkness covered her and her heart broke in the silence
