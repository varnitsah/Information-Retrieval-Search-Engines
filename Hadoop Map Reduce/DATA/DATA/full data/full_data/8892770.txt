8892770	a traveler from altruria  romance  by w d howells  author of the coast of bohemia the quality of mercy a hazard of new fortunes etc  harper  brothers publishers new york and london 1908     a traveler from altruria   i   i confess that with all my curiosity to meet an altrurian i was in no hospitable mood toward the traveler when he finally presented himself pursuant to the letter of advice sent me by the friend who introduced him it would be easy enough to take care of him in the hotel i had merely to engage a room for him and have the clerk tell him his money was not good if he tried to pay for anything but i had swung fairly into my story its people were about me all the time i dwelt amid its events and places and i did not see how i could welcome my guest among them or abandon them for him still when he actually arrived and i took his hand as he stepped from the train i found it less difficult to say that i was glad to see him than i expected in fact i was glad for i could not look upon his face without feeling a glow of kindness for him i had not the least trouble in identifying him for he was so unlike all the americans who dismounted from the train with him and who all looked hot worried and anxious he was a man no longer young but in what we call the heyday of life when our own people are so absorbed in making provision for the future that they may be said not to live in the present at all this altrurians whole countenance and especially his quiet gentle eyes expressed a vast contemporaneity with bounds of leisure removed to the end of time or at least this was the effect of something in them which i am obliged to report in rather fantastic terms he was above the middle height and he carried himself vigorously his face was sunburned or seaburned where it was not bearded and although i knew from my friends letter that he was a man of learning and distinction in his own country i should never have supposed him a person of scholarly life he was so far from sicklied over with anything like the pale cast of thought when he took the hand i offered him in my halfhearted welcome he gave it a grasp that decided me to confine our daily greetings to something much less muscular  let me have your bag i said as we do when we meet people at the train and he instantly bestowed a rather heavy valise upon me with a smile in his benignant eyes as if it had been the greatest favor have you got any checks i asked  yes he said in very good english but with an accent new to me i bought two he gave them to me and i passed them to our hotel porter who was waiting there with the baggagecart then i proposed that we should walk across the meadow to the house which is a quarter of a mile or so from the station we started but he stopped suddenly and looked back over his shoulder oh you neednt be troubled about your trunks i said the porter will get them to the house all right theyll be in your room by the time we get there  but hes putting them into the wagon himself said the altrurian  yes he always does that hes a strong young fellow hell manage it you neednt i could not finish saying he need not mind the porter he was rushing back to the station and i had the mortification of seeing him take an end of each trunk and help the porter toss it into the wagon some lighter pieces he put in himself and he did not stop till all the baggage the train had left was disposed of  i stood holding his valise unable to put it down in my embarrassment at this eccentric performance which had been evident not to me alone but to all the people who arrived by the train and all their friends who came from the hotel to meet them a number of these passed me on the tallyho coach and a lady who had got her husband with her for over sunday and was in very good spirits called gayly down to me your friend seems fond of exercise  yes i answered dryly the sparkling repartee which ought to have come to my help failed to show up but it was impossible to be vexed with the altrurian when he returned to me unruffled by his bout with the baggage and serenely smiling  do you know he said i fancied that good fellow was ashamed of my helping him i hope it didnt seem a reflection upon him in any way before your people i ought to have thought of that  i guess we can make it right with him i dare say he felt more surprised than disgraced but we must make haste a little now your train was half an hour late and we shall not stand so good a chance for supper if we are not there pretty promptly  no said the altrurian why  well i said with evasive lightness first come first served you know thats human nature  is it he returned and he looked at me as one does who suspects another of joking  well isnt it i retorted but i hurried to add besides i want to have time after supper to show you a bit of our landscape i think youll enjoy it i knew he had arrived in boston that morning by steamer and i now thought it high time to ask him well what do you think of america anyway i ought really to have asked him this the moment he stepped from the train  oh he said im intensely interested and i perceived that he spoke with a certain reservation as the most advanced country of its time ive always been very curious to see it  the last sentence raised my dashed spirits again and i said confidently you must find our system of baggagechecks delightful i said this because it is one of the first things we brag of to foreigners and i had the habit of it bytheway i ventured to add i suppose you meant to say you brought two checks when i asked you for them at the train just now but you really said you bought them  yes the altrurian replied i gave half a dollar apiece for them at the station in boston i saw other people doing it he explained noting my surprise isnt it the custom  im happy to say it isnt yet on most of our roads they were tipping the baggageman to make sure that he checked their baggage in time and put it on the train i had to do that myself when i came up otherwise it might have got along here some time next day but the system is perfect  the poor man looked quite worn out said the altrurian and i am glad i gave him something he seemed to have several hundred pieces of baggage to look after and he wasnt embarrassed like your porter by my helping him put my trunks into the car may i confess that the meanness of the station its insufficient facilities its shabby waitingrooms and its whole crowded and confused appearance gave me rather a bad impression  i know i had to own its shameful but you wouldnt have found another station in the city so bad  ah then said the altrurian i suppose this particular road is too poor to employ more baggagemen or build new stations they seemed rather shabby all the way up  well no i was obliged to confess its one of the richest roads in the country the stock stands at about 180 but im really afraid we shall be late to supper if we dont get on i broke off though i was not altogether sorry to arrive after the porter had disposed of the baggage i dreaded another display of active sympathy on the part of my strange companion i have often felt sorry myself for the porters of hotels but i have never thought of offering to help them handle the heavy trunks that they manage  the altrurian was delighted with the hotel and in fact it did look extremely pretty with its branching piazzas full of welldressed people and its green lawns where the children were playing i led the way to the room which i had taken for him next my own it was simply furnished but it was sweet with matting fresh linen and pure whitewashed walls i flung open the windowblinds and let him get a glimpse of the mountains purpling under the sunset the lake beneath and the deeply foliaged shores  glorious glorious he sighed  yes i modestly assented we think thats rather fine he stood tranced before the window and i thought i had better say well now i cant give you much time to get the dust of travel off the diningroom doors close at eight and we must hurry down  ill be with you in a moment he said pulling off his coat  i waited impatiently at the foot of the stairs avoiding the question i met on the lips and in the eyes of my acquaintance the fame of my friends behavior at the station must have spread through the whole place and everybody wished to know who he was i answered simply he was a traveler from altruria and in some cases i went further and explained that the altrurians were peculiar  in much less time than it seemed my friend found me and then i had a little compensation for my suffering in his behalf i could see that whatever people said of him they felt the same mysterious liking at sight of him that i had felt he had made a little change in his dress and i perceived that the women thought him not only goodlooking but welldressed they followed him with their eyes as we went into the diningroom and i was rather proud of being with him as if i somehow shared the credit of his clothes and good looks the altrurian himself seemed most struck with the headwaiter who showed us to our places and while we were waiting for our supper i found a chance to explain that he was a divinity student from one of the freshwater colleges and was serving here during his summer vacation this seemed to interest my friend so much that i went on to tell him that many of the waitresses whom he saw standing there subject to the order of the guests were country schoolmistresses in the winter  ah that is as it should be he said that is the kind of thing i expected to meet with in america  yes i responded in my flattered national vanity if america means anything at all it means the honor of work and the recognition of personal worth everywhere i hope you are going to make a long stay with us we like to have travelers visit us who can interpret the spirit of our institutions as well as read their letter as a rule europeans never quite get our point of view now a great many of these waitresses are ladies in the true sense of the wordselfrespectful intelligent refined and fit to grace  i was interrupted by the noise my friend made in suddenly pushing back his chair and getting to his feet whats the matter i asked youre not ill i hope  but he did not hear me he had run half down the dininghall toward the slender young girl who was bringing us our supper i had ordered rather generously for my friend had owned to a good appetite and i was hungry myself with waiting for him so that the tray the girl carried was piled up with heavy dishes to my dismay i saw rather than heard at that distance the altrurian enter into a polite controversy with her and then as if overcoming all her scruples by sheer strength of will possess himself of the tray and make off with it toward our table the poor child followed him blushing to her hair the headwaiter stood looking helplessly on the guests who at that late hour were fortunately few were simply aghast at the scandal the altrurian alone seemed to think his conduct the most natural thing in the world he put the tray on the sidetable near us and in spite of our waitresss protests insisted upon arranging the little birdbath dishes before our plates then at last he sat down and the girl flushed and tremulous left the room as i could not help suspecting to have a good cry in the kitchen she did not come back and the headwaiter who was perhaps afraid to send another in her place looked after our few wants himself he kept a sharp eye on my friend as if he were not quite sure he was safe but the altrurian resumed the conversation with all that lightness of spirits which i noticed in him after he helped the porter with the baggage i did not think it the moment to take him to task for what he had just done i was not even sure that it was the part of a host to do so at all and between the one doubt and the other i left the burden of talk to him  what a charming young creature he began i never saw anything prettier than the way she had of refusing my help absolutely without coquetry or affectation of any kind she is as you said a perfect lady and she graces her work as i am sure she would grace any exigency of life she quite realizes my ideal of an american girl and i see now what the spirit of your country must be from such an expression of it  i wished to tell him that while a country schoolteacher who waits at table in a summer hotel is very much to be respected in her sphere she is not regarded with that high honor which some other women command among us but i did not find this very easy after what i had said of our esteem for labor and while i was thinking how i could hedge my friend went on  i liked england greatly and i liked the english but i could not like the theory of their civilization or the aristocratic structure of their society it seemed to me iniquitous for we believe that inequality and iniquity are the same in the last analysis  at this i found myself able to say yes there is something terrible something shocking in the frank brutality with which englishmen affirm the essential inequality of men the affirmation of the essential equality of men was the first point of departure with us when we separated from them  i know said the altrurian how grandly it is expressed in your glorious declaration  ah you have read our declaration of independence then  every altrurian has read that answered my friend  well i went on smoothly and i hoped to render what i was going to say the means of enlightening him without offence concerning the little mistake he had just made with the waitress of course we dont take that in its closest literality  i dont understand you he said  why you know it was rather the political than the social traditions of england that we broke with in the revolution  how is that he returned didnt you break with monarchy and nobility and ranks and classes  yes we broke with all those things  but i found them a part of the social as well as the political structure in england you have no kings or nobles here have you any ranks or classes  well not exactly in the english sense our ranks and classes such as we have are what i may call voluntary  oh i understand i suppose that from time to time certain ones among you feel the need of serving and ask leave of the commonwealth to subordinate themselves to the rest of the state and perform all the lowlier offices in it such persons must be held in peculiar honor is it something like that  well no i cant say its quite like that in fact i think id better let you trust to your own observation of our life  but im sure said the altrurian with a simplicity so fine that it was a long time before i could believe it quite real that i shall approach it so much more intelligently with a little instruction from you you say that your social divisions are voluntary but do i understand that those who serve among you do not wish to do so  well i dont suppose they would serve if they could help it i replied  surely said the altrurian with a look of horror you dont mean that they are slaves  oh no oh no i said the war put an end to that we are all free now black and white  but if they do not wish to serve and are not held in peculiar honor for serving  i see that my word voluntary has misled you i put in it isnt the word exactly the divisions among us are rather a process of natural selection you will see as you get better acquainted with the workings of our institutions that there are no arbitrary distinctions here but the fitness of the work for the man and the man for the work determines the social rank that each one holds  ah that is fine cried the altrurian with a glow of enthusiasm then i suppose that these intelligent young people who teach school in winter and serve at table in the summer are in a sort of provisional state waiting for the process of natural selection to determine whether they shall finally be teachers or waiters  yes it might be stated in some such terms i assented though i was not altogether easy in my mind it seemed to me that i was not quite candid with this most candid spirit i added you know we are a sort of fatalists here in america we are great believers in the doctrine that it will all come out right in the end  ah i dont wonder at that said the altrurian if the process of natural selection works so perfectly among you as you say but i am afraid i dont understand this matter of your domestic service yet i believe you said that all honest work is honored in america then no social slight attaches to service i suppose  well i cant say that exactly the fact is a certain social slight does attach to service and that is one reason why i dont quite like to have students wait at table it wont be pleasant for them to remember it in afterlife and it wont be pleasant for their children to remember it  then the slight would descend  i think it would one wouldnt like to think ones father or mother had been at service  the altrurian said nothing for a moment then he remarked so it seems that while all honest work is honored among you there are some kinds of honest work that are not honored so much as others  yes  why  because some occupations are more degrading than others  but why he persisted as i thought a little unreasonably  really i said i think i must leave you to imagine  i am afraid i cant he said sadly then if domestic service is degrading in your eyes and people are not willing servants among you may i ask why any are servants  it is a question of breadandbutter they are obliged to be  that is they are forced to do work that is hateful and disgraceful to them because they cannot live without  excuse me i said not at all liking this sort of pursuit and feeling it fair to turn even upon a guest who kept it up isnt it so with you in altruria  it was so once he admitted but not now in fact it is like a waking dream to find ones self in the presence of conditions here that we outlived so long ago  there was an unconscious superiority in this speech that nettled me and stung me to retort we do not expect to outlive them we regard them as final and as indestructibly based in human nature itself  ah said the altrurian with a delicate and caressing courtesy have i said something offensive  not at all i hastened to answer it is not surprising that you did not get our point of view exactly you will byandby and then i think you will see that it is the true one we have found that the logic of our convictions could not be applied to the problem of domestic service it is everywhere a very curious and perplexing problem the simple old solution of the problem was to own your servants but we found that this was not consistent with the spirit of our free institutions as soon as it was abandoned the anomaly began we had outlived the primitive period when the housekeeper worked with her domestics and they were her help and were called so and we had begun to have servants to do all the household work and to call them so this state of things never seemed right to some of our purest and best people they fancied as you seem to have done that to compel people through their necessities to do your hateful drudgery and to wound and shame them with a name which every american instinctively resents was neither republican nor christian some of our thinkers tried to mend matters by making their domestics a part of their families and in the life of emerson youll find an amusing account of his attempt to have his servant eat at the same table with himself and his wife it wouldnt work he and his wife could stand it but the servant couldnt  i paused for this was where the laugh ought to have come in the altrurian did not laugh he merely asked why  well because the servant knew if they didnt that they were a whole world apart in their traditions and were no more fit to associate than newenglanders and newzealanders in the mere matter of education  but i thought you said that these young girls who wait at table here were teachers  oh i beg your pardon i ought to have explained by this time it had become impossible as it now is to get american girls to take service except on some such unusual terms as we have in a summer hotel and the domestics were already ignorant foreigners fit for nothing else in such a place as this it isnt so bad it is more as if the girls worked in a shop or a factory they command their own time in a measure their hours are tolerably fixed and they have one anothers society in a private family they would be subject to order at all times and they would have no social life they would be in the family out not of it american girls understand this and so they wont go out to service in the usual way even in a summer hotel the relation has its odious aspects the system of giving fees seems to me degrading to those who have to take them to offer a student or a teacher a dollar for personal serviceit isnt right or i cant make it so in fact the whole thing is rather anomalous with us the best that you can say of it is that it works and we dont know what else to do  but i dont see yet said the altrurian just why domestic service is degrading in a country where all kinds of work are honored  well my dear fellow i have done my best to explain as i intimated before we distinguish and in the different kinds of labor we distinguish against domestic service i dare say it is partly because of the loss of independence which it involves people naturally despise a dependant  why asked the altrurian with that innocence of his which i was beginning to find rather trying  why i retorted because it implies weakness  and is weakness considered despicable among you he pursued  in every community it is despised practically if not theoretically i tried to explain the great thing that america has done is to offer the race an opportunitythe opportunity for any man to rise above the rest and to take the highest place if he is able i had always been proud of this fact and i thought i had put it very well but the altrurian did not seem much impressed by it  he said i do not see how it differs from any country of the past in that but perhaps you mean that to rise carries with it an obligation to those below if any is first among you let him be your servant is it something like that  well it is not quite like that i answered remembering how very little our selfmade men as a class had done for others every one is expected to look out for himself here i fancy that there would be very little rising if men were expected to rise for the sake of others in america how is it with you in altruria i demanded hoping to get out of a certain discomfort i felt in that way do your risen men generally devote themselves to the good of the community after they get to the top  there is no rising among us he said with what seemed a perception of the harsh spirit of my question and he paused a moment before he asked in his turn how do men rise among you  that would be rather a long story i replied but putting it in the rough i should say that they rose by their talents their shrewdness their ability to seize an advantage and turn it to their own account  and is that considered noble  it is considered smart it is considered at the worst far better than a dead level of equality are all men equal in altruria are they all alike gifted or beautiful or short or tall  no they are only equal in duties and in rights but as you said just now that is a very long story are they equal in nothing here  they are equal in opportunities  ah breathed the altrurian i am glad to hear that  i began to feel a little uneasy and i was not quite sure that this last assertion of mine would hold water everybody but ourselves had now left the diningroom and i saw the headwaiter eying us impatiently i pushed back my chair and said im sorry to seem to hurry you but i should like to show you a very pretty sunset effect we have here before it is too dark when we get back i want to introduce you to a few of my friends of course i neednt tell you that there is a good deal of curiosity about you especially among the ladies  yes i found that the case in england largely it was the women who cared most to meet me i understand that in america society is managed even more by women than it is in england  its entirely in their hands i said with the satisfaction we all feel in the fact we have no other leisure class the richest men among us are generally hard workers devotion to business is the rule but as soon as a man reaches the point where he can afford to pay for domestic service his wife and daughters expect to be released from it to the cultivation of their minds and the enjoyment of social pleasures its quite right that is what makes them so delightful to foreigners you must have heard their praises chanted in england the english find our men rather stupid i believe but they think our women are charming  yes i was told that the wives of their nobility were sometimes americans said the altrurian the english think that you regard such marriages as a great honor and that they are very gratifying to your national pride  well i suppose that is so in a measure i confessed i imagine that it will not be long before the english aristocracy derives as largely from american millionaires as from kings mistresses not i added virtuously that we approve of aristocracy  no i understand that said the altrurian i shall hope to get your point of view in this matter more distinctly byandby as yet im a little vague about it  i think i can gradually make it clear to you i returned    ii  we left the hotel and i began to walk my friend across the meadow toward the lake i wished him to see the reflection of the afterglow in its still waters with the noble lines of the mountainrange that glassed itself there the effect is one of the greatest charms of that lovely region the sojourn of the sweetest summer in the world and i am always impatient to show it to strangers  we climbed the meadow wall and passed through a stretch of woods to a path leading down to the shore and as we loitered along in the tender gloom of the forest the music of the hermitthrushes rang all round us like crystal bells like silver flutes like the drip of fountains like the choiring of stilleyed cherubim we stopped from time to time and listened while the shy birds sang unseen in their covert of shadows but we did not speak till we emerged from the trees and suddenly stood upon the naked knoll overlooking the lake  then i explained the woods used to come down to the shore here and we had their mystery and music to the waters edge but last winter the owner cut the timber off it looks rather ragged now i had to recognize the fact for i saw the altrurian staring about him over the clearing in a kind of horror it was a squalid ruin a graceless desolation which not even the pitying twilight could soften the stumps showed their hideous mutilation everywhere the brush had been burned and the fires had scorched and blackened the lean soil of the hillslope and blasted it with sterility a few weak saplings withered by the flames drooped and straggled about it would be a century before the forces of nature could repair the waste  you say the owner did this said the altrurian who is the owner  well it does seem too bad i answered evasively there has been a good deal of feeling about it the neighbors tried to buy him off before he began the destruction for they knew the value of the woods as an attraction to summerboarders the city cottagers of course wanted to save them and together they offered for the land pretty nearly as much as the timber was worth but he had got it into his head that the land here by the lake would sell for building lots if it was cleared and he could make money on that as well as on the trees and so they had to go of course one might say that he was deficient in public spirit but i dont blame him altogether  no the altrurian assented somewhat to my surprise i confess  i resumed there was no one else to look after his interests and it was not only his right but his duty to get the most he could for himself and his own according to his best light that is what i tell people when they fall foul of him for his want of public spirit  the trouble seems to be then in the system that obliges each man to be the guardian of his own interests is that what you blame  no i consider it a very perfect system it is based upon individuality and we believe that individuality is the principle that differences civilized men from savages from the lower animals and makes us a nation instead of a tribe or a herd there isnt one of us no matter how much he censured this mans want of public spirit but would resent the slightest interference with his property rights the woods were his he had the right to do what he pleased with his own  do i understand you that in america a man may do what is wrong with his own  he may do anything with his own  to the injury of others  well not in person or property but he may hurt them in taste and sentiment as much as he likes cant a man do what he pleases with his own in altruria  no he can only do right with his own  and if he tries to do wrong or what the community thinks is wrong  then the community takes his own from him before i could think of anything to say to this he went on but i wish you would explain to me why it was left to this mans neighbors to try and get him to sell his portion of the landscape  why bless my soul i exclaimed who else was there you wouldnt have expected to take up a collection among the summerboarders  that wouldnt have been so unreasonable but i didnt mean that was there no provision for such an exigency in your laws wasnt the state empowered to buy him off at the full value of his timber and his land  certainly not i replied that would be rank paternalism  it began to get dark and i suggested that we had better be going back to the hotel the talk seemed already to have taken us away from all pleasure in the prospect i said as we found our way through the rich balsamscented twilight of the woods where one joyhaunted thrush was still singing you know that in america the law is careful not to meddle with a mans private affairs and we dont attempt to legislate personal virtue  but marriage he saidsurely you have the institution of marriage  i was really annoyed at this i returned sarcastically yes i am glad to say that there we can meet your expectation we have marriage not only consecrated by the church but established and defended by the state what has that to do with the question  and you consider marriage he pursued the citadel of morality the fountain of all that is pure and good in your private life the source of home and the image of heaven  there are some marriages i said with a touch of our national humor that do not quite fill the bill but that is certainly our ideal of marriage  then why do you say that you have not legislated personal virtue in america he asked you have laws i believe against theft and murder and slander and incest and perjury and drunkenness  why certainly  then it appears to me that you have legislated honesty regard for human life regard for character abhorrence of unnatural vice good faith and sobriety i was told on the train coming up by a gentleman who was shocked at the sight of a man beating his horse that you even had laws against cruelty to animals  yes and i am happy to say that they are enforced to such a degree that a man cannot kill a cat cruelly without being punished for it the altrurian did not follow up his advantage and i resolved not to be outdone in magnanimity come i will own that you have the best of me on those points i must say youve trapped me very neatly too i can enjoy a thing of that kind when its well done and i frankly knock under but i had in mind something altogether different when i spoke i was thinking of those idealists who want to bind us hand and foot and render us the slaves of a state where the most intimate relations of life shall be penetrated by legislation and the very hearthstone shall be a tablet of laws  isnt marriage a rather intimate relation of life asked the altrurian and i understood that gentleman on the train to say that you had laws against cruelty to children and societies established to see them enforced you dont consider such laws an invasion of the home do you or a violation of its immunities i imagine he went on that the difference between your civilization and ours is only one of degree after all and that america and altruria are really one at heart  i thought his compliment a bit hyperbolical but i saw that it was honestly meant and as we americans are first of all patriots and vain for our country before we are vain for ourselves i was not proof against the flattery it conveyed to me civically if not personally  we were now drawing near the hotel and i felt a certain glow of pleasure in its gay effect on the pretty knoll where it stood in its artless and accidental architecture it was not unlike one of our immense coastwise steamboats the twilight had thickened to dusk and the edifice was brilliantly lighted with electrics story above story which streamed into the gloom around like the lights of saloon and stateroom the corner of wood making into the meadow hid the station there was no other building in sight the hotel seemed riding at anchor on the swell of a placid sea i was going to call the altrurians attention to this fanciful resemblance when i remembered that he had not been in our country long enough to have seen a fall river boat and i made toward the house without wasting the comparison upon him but i treasured it up in my own mind intending some day to make a literary use of it  the guests were sitting in friendly groups about the piazzas or in rows against the walls the ladies with their gossip and the gentlemen with their cigars the night had fallen cool after a hot day and they all had the effect of having cast off care with the burden of the week that was past and to be steeping themselves in the innocent and simple enjoyment of the hour they were mostly middleaged married folk but some were old enough to have sons and daughters among the young people who went and came in a long wandering promenade of the piazzas or wove themselves through the waltz past the open windows of the great parlor the music seemed one with the light that streamed far out on the lawn flanking the piazzas every one was welldressed and comfortable and at peace and i felt that our hotel was in some sort a microcosm of the republic  we involuntarily paused and i heard the altrurian murmur charming charming this is really delightful  yes isnt it i returned with a glow of pride our hotel here is a type of the summer hotel everywhere its characteristic in not having anything characteristic about it and i rather like the notion of the people in it being so much like the people in all the others that you would feel yourself at home wherever you met such a company in such a house all over the country north and south wherever you find a group of hills or a pleasant bit of water or a stretch of coast youll find some such refuge as this for our weary toilers we began to discover some time ago that it would not do to cut open the goose that laid our golden eggs even if it looked like an eagle and kept on perching on our banners just as if nothing had happened we discovered that if we continued to kill ourselves with hard work there would be no americans pretty soon  the altrurian laughed how delightfully you put it how quaint how picturesque excuse me but i cant help expressing my pleasure in it our own humor is so very different  ah i said what is your humor like  i could hardly tell you im afraid ive never been much of a humorist myself  again a cold doubt of something ironical in the man went through me but i had no means of verifying it and so i simply remained silent waiting for him to prompt me if he wished to know anything further about our national transformation from bees perpetually busy into butterflies occasionally idle and when you had made that discovery he suggested  why were nothing if not practical you know and as soon as we made that discovery we stopped killing ourselves and invented the summer resort there are very few of our business or professional men now who dont take their four or five weeks vacation their wives go off early in the summer and if they go to some resort within three or four hours of the city the men leave town saturday afternoon and run out or come up and spend sunday with their families for thirtyeight hours or so a hotel like this is a nest of happy homes  that is admirable said the altrurian you are truly a practical people the ladies come early in the summer you say  yes sometimes in the beginning of june  what do they come for asked the altrurian  what for why for rest i retorted with some little temper  but i thought you told me awhile ago that as soon as a husband could afford it he relieved his wife and daughters from all household work  so he does  then what do the ladies wish to rest from  from care it is not work alone that kills they are not relieved from household care even when they are relieved from household work there is nothing so killing as household care besides the sex seems to be born tired to be sure there are some observers of our life who contend that with the advance of athletics among our ladies with boating and bathing and lawntennis and mountainclimbing and freedom from care and these long summers of repose our women are likely to become as superior to the men physically as they now are intellectually it is all right we should like to see it happen it would be part of the national joke  oh have you a national joke asked the altrurian but of course you have so much humor i wish you could give me some notion of it  well it is rather damaging to any joke to explain it i replied and your only hope of getting at ours is to live into it one feature of it is the confusion of foreigners at the sight of our mens willingness to subordinate themselves to our women  oh i dont find that very bewildering said the altrurian it seems to me a generous and manly trait of the american character im proud to say that it is one of the points at which your civilization and our own touch there can be no doubt that the influence of women in your public affairs must be of the greatest advantage to you it has been so with us  i turned and stared at him but he remained insensible to my astonishment perhaps because it was now too dark for him to see it our women have no influence in public affairs i said quietly after a moment  they havent is it possible but didnt i understand you to imply just now that your women were better educated than your men  well i suppose that taking all sorts and conditions among us the women are as a rule better schooled if not better educated  then apart from the schooling they are not more cultivated  in a sense you might say they were they certainly go in for a lot of things art and music and browning and the drama and foreign travel and psychology and political economy and heaven knows what all they have more leisure for it they have all the leisure there is in fact our young men have to go into business i suppose you may say our women are more cultivated than our men yes i think theres no questioning that they are the great readers among us we poor devils of authors would be badly off if it were not for our women in fact no author could make a reputation among us without them american literature exists because american women appreciate it and love it  but surely your men read books  some of them not many comparatively you will often hear a complacent ass of a husband and father say to an author my wife and daughters know your books but i cant find time for anything but the papers nowadays i skim them over at breakfast or when im going in to business on the train he isnt the least ashamed to say that he reads nothing but the newspapers  then you think that it would be better for him to read books  well in the presence of four or five thousand journalists with drawn scalpingknives i should not like to say so besides modesty forbids  no but really the altrurian persisted you think that the literature of a book is more carefully pondered than the literature of a daily newspaper  i suppose even the four or five thousand journalists with drawn scalpingknives would hardly deny that  and it stands to reason doesnt it that the habitual reader of carefully pondered literature ought to be more thoughtful than the readers of literature which is not carefully pondered and which they merely skim over on their way to business  i believe we began by assuming the superior culture of our women didnt we youll hardly find an american that isnt proud of it  then said the altrurian if your women are generally better schooled than your men and more cultivated and more thoughtful and are relieved of household work in such great measure and even of domestic cares why have they no part in your public affairs  i laughed for i thought i had my friend at last for the best of all possible reasons they dont want it  ah thats no reason he returned why dont they want it  really i said out of all patience i think i must let you ask the ladies themselves and i turned and moved again toward the hotel but the altrurian gently detained me  excuse me he began  no no i said   the feast is set the guests are met     mayst hear the merry din come in and see the young people dance  wait he entreated tell me a little more about the old people first this digression about the ladies has been very interesting but i thought you were going to speak of the men here who are they or rather what are they  why as i said before they are all business men and professional men people who spend their lives in studies and countingrooms and offices and have come up here for a few weeks or a few days of wellearned repose they are of all kinds of occupations they are lawyers and doctors and clergymen and merchants and brokers and bankers theres hardly any calling you wont find represented among them as i was thinking just now our hotel is a sort of microcosm of the american republic  i am most fortunate in finding you here where i can avail myself of your intelligence in making my observations of your life under such advantageous circumstances it seems to me that with your help i might penetrate the fact of american life possess myself of the mystery of your national joke without stirring beyond the piazza of your hospitable hotel said my friend i doubted it but one does not lightly put aside a compliment like that to ones intelligence and i said i should be very happy to be of use to him he thanked me and said then to begin with i understand that these gentlemen are here because they are all overworked  of course you can have no conception of how hard our business men and our professional men work i suppose there is nothing like it anywhere else in the world but as i said before we are beginning to find that we cannot burn the candle at both ends and have it last long so we put one end out for a little while every summer still there are frightful wrecks of men strewn all along the course of our prosperity wrecks of mind and body our insane asylums are full of madmen who have broken under the tremendous strain and every country in europe abounds in our dyspeptics i was rather proud of this terrible fact there is no doubt but we americans are proud of overworking ourselves heaven knows why  the altrurian murmured awful shocking but i thought somehow he had not really followed me very attentively in my celebration of our national violation of the laws of life and its consequences i am glad he went on that your business men and professional men are beginning to realize the folly and wickedness of overwork shall i find some of your other weary workers here too  what other weary workers i asked in turn for i imagined i had gone over pretty much the whole list  why said the altrurian your mechanics and day laborers your ironmoulders and glassblowers your miners and farmers your printers and milloperatives your trainmen and quarryhands or do they prefer to go to resorts of their own    iii  it was not easy to make sure of such innocence as prompted this inquiry of my altrurian friend the doubt whether he could really be in earnest was something that i had already felt and it was destined to beset me as it did now again and again my first thought was that of course he was trying a bit of cheap irony on me a mixture of the feeble sarcasm and false sentiment that makes us smile when we find it in the philippics of the industrial agitators for a moment i did not know but i had fallen victim to a walking delegate on his vacation who was employing his summer leisure in going about the country in the guise of a traveler from altruria and foisting himself upon people who would have had nothing to do with him in his real character but in another moment i perceived that this was impossible i could not suppose that the friend who had introduced him to me would be capable of seconding so poor a joke and besides i could not imagine why a walking delegate should wish to address his clumsy satire to me particularly for the present at least there was nothing for it but to deal with this inquiry as if it were made in good faith and in the pursuit of useful information it struck me as grotesque but it would not have been decent to treat it as if it were so i was obliged to regard it seriously and so i decided to shirk it  well i said that opens up rather a large field which lies somewhat outside of the province of my own activities you know i am a writer of romantic fiction and my time is so fully occupied in manipulating the destinies of the good oldfashioned hero and heroine and trying always to make them end in a happy marriage that i have hardly had a chance to look much into the lives of agriculturists or artisans and to tell you the truth i dont know what they do with their leisure im pretty certain though you wont meet any of them in this hotel they couldnt afford it and i fancy they would find themselves out of their element among our guests we respect them thoroughly every american does and we know that the prosperity of the country rests with them we have a theory that they are politically sovereign but we see very little of them and we dont associate with them in fact our cultivated people have so little interest in them socially that they dont like to meet them even in fiction they prefer refined and polished ladies and gentlemen whom they can have some sympathy with and i always go to the upper classes for my types it wont do to suppose though that we are indifferent to the working classes in their place their condition is being studied a good deal just now and there are several persons here who will be able to satisfy your curiosity on the points you have made i think i will introduce you to them  the altrurian did not try to detain me this time he said he should be very glad indeed to meet my friends and i led the way toward a little group at the corner of the piazza they were men whom i particularly liked for one reason or another they were intelligent and openminded and they were thoroughly american one was a banker another was a minister there was a lawyer and there was a doctor there was a professor of political economy in one of our colleges and there was a retired manufactureri do not know what he used to manufacture cotton or iron or something like that they all rose politely as i came up with my altrurian and i fancied in them a sensation of expectancy created by the rumor of his eccentric behavior which must have spread through the hotel but they controlled this if they had it and i could see as the light fell upon his face from a spray of electrics on the nearest pillar that sort of liking kindle in theirs which i had felt myself at first sight of him  i said gentlemen i wish to introduce my friend mr homos and then i presented them severally to him by name we all sat down and i explained mr homos is from altruria he is visiting our country for the first time and is greatly interested in the working of our institutions he has been asking me some rather hard questions about certain phases of our civilization and the fact is that i have launched him upon you because i dont feel quite able to cope with him  they all laughed civilly at this sally of mine but the professor asked with a sarcasm that i thought i hardly merited what point in our polity can be obscure to the author of glove and gauntlet and airs and graces  they all laughed again not so civilly i felt and then the banker asked my friend is it long since you left altruria  it seems a great while ago the altrurian answered but it is really only a few weeks  you came by way of england i suppose  yes there is no direct line to america said the altrurian  that seems rather odd i ventured with some patriotic grudge  oh the english have direct lines everywhere the banker instructed me  the tariff has killed our shipbuilding said the professor no one took up this firebrand and the professor added your name is greek isnt it mr homos  yes we are of one of the early hellenic families said the altrurian  and do you think asked the lawyer who like most lawyers was a lover of romance and was well read in legendary lore especially that there is any reason for supposing that altruria is identical with the fabled atlantis  no i cant say that i do we have no traditions of a submergence of the continent and there are only the usual evidences of a glacial epoch which you find everywhere to support such a theory besides our civilization is strictly christian and dates back to no earlier period than that of the first christian commune after christ it is a matter of history with us that one of these communists when they were dispersed brought the gospel to our continent he was cast away on our eastern coast on his way to britain  yes we know that the minister intervened but it is perfectly astonishing that an island so large as altruria should have been lost to the knowledge of the rest of the world ever since the beginning of our era you would hardly think that there was a space of the oceans surface a mile square which had not been traversed by a thousand keels since columbus sailed westward  no you wouldnt and i wish the doctor suggested in his turn that mr homos would tell us something about his country instead of asking us about ours  yes i coincided im sure we should all find it a good deal easier at least i should but i brought our friend up in the hope that the professor would like nothing better than to train a battery of hard facts upon a defenceless stranger since the professor had given me that little stab i was rather anxious to see how he would handle the desire for information in the altrurian which i had found so prickly  this turned the laugh on the professor and he pretended to be as curious about altruria as the rest and said he would rather hear of it but the altrurian said i hope you will excuse me sometime i shall be glad to talk of altruria as long as you like or if you will come to us i shall be still happier to show you many things that i couldnt make you understand at a distance but i am in america to learn not to teach and i hope you will have patience with my ignorance i begin to be afraid that it is so great as to seem a little incredible i have fancied in my friend here he went on with a smile toward me a suspicion that i was not entirely single in some of the inquiries i have made but that i had some ulterior motive some wish to censure or satirize  oh not at all i protested for it was not polite to admit a conjecture so accurate we are so well satisfied with our condition that we have nothing but pity for the darkened mind of the foreigner though we believe in it fully we are used to the english tourist  my friends laughed and the altrurian continued i am very glad to hear it for i feel myself at a peculiar disadvantage among you i am not only a foreigner but i am so alien to you in all the traditions and habitudes that i find it very difficult to get upon common ground with you of course i know theoretically what you are but to realize it practically is another thing i had read so much about america and understood so little that i could not rest without coming to see for myself some of the apparent contradictions were so colossal  we have everything on a large scale here said the banker breaking off the ash of his cigar with the end of his little finger and we rather pride ourselves on the size of our inconsistencies even i know something of the state of things in altruria and to be frank with you i will say that it seems to me preposterous i should say it was impossible if it were not an accomplished fact but i always feel bound to recognize the thing done you have hitched your wagon to a star and you have made the star go there is never any trouble with wagons but stars are not easily broken to harness and you have managed to get yours well in hand as i said i dont believe in you but i respect you i thought this charming myself perhaps because it stated my own mind about altruria so exactly and in terms so just and generous  pretty good said the doctor in a murmur of satisfaction at my ear for a bloated bondholder  yes i whispered back i wish i had said it what an american way of putting it emerson would have liked it himself after all he was our prophet  he must have thought so from the way we kept stoning him said the doctor with a soft laugh  which of our contradictions asked the banker in the same tone of gentle bonhomie has given you and our friend pause just now  the altrurian answered after a moment i am not sure that it is a contradiction for as yet i have not ascertained the facts i was seeking our friend was telling me of the great change that had taken place in regard to work and the increased leisure that your professional people are now allowing themselves and i was asking him where your workingmen spent their leisure  he went over the list of those he had specified and i hung my head in shame and pity it really had such an effect of mawkish sentimentality but my friends received it in the best possible way they did not laugh they heard him out and then they quietly deferred to the banker who made answer for us all  well i can be almost as brief as the historian of iceland in his chapter on snakes those people have no leisure to spend  except when they go out on a strike said the manufacturer with a certain grim humor of his own i never heard anything more dramatic than the account he once gave of the way he broke up a labor union i have seen a good many of them at leisure then  yes the doctor chimed in and in my younger days when i necessarily had a good deal of charity practice i used to find them at leisure when they were laid off it always struck me as such a pretty euphemism it seemed to minify the harm of the thing so it seemed to take all the hunger and cold and sickness out of the fact to be simply laid off was so different from losing your work and having to face beggary or starvation  those people said the professor never put anything by they are wasteful and improvident almost to a man and they learn nothing by experience though they know as well as we do that it is simply a question of demand and supply and that the day of overproduction is sure to come when their work must stop unless the men that give them work are willing to lose money  and ive seen them lose it sometimes rather than shut down the manufacturer remarked lose it hand over hand to keep the men at work and then as soon as the tide turned the men would strike for higher wages you have no idea of the ingratitude of those people he said this toward the minister as if he did not wish to be thought hard and in fact he was a very kindly man  yes replied the minister that is one of the most sinister features of the situation they seem really to regard their employers as their enemies i dont know how it will end  i know how it would end if i had my way said the professor there wouldnt be any labor unions and there wouldnt be any strikes  that is all very well said the lawyer from that judicial mind which i always liked in him as far as the strikes are concerned but i dont understand that the abolition of the unions would affect the impersonal process of laying off the law of demand and supply i respect as much as any oneits something like the constitution but all the same i should object extremely to have my income stopped by it every now and then im probably not so wasteful as a workingman generally is still i havent laid by enough to make it a matter of indifference to me whether my income went on or not perhaps the professor has the professor did not say and we all took leave to laugh the lawyer concluded i dont see how those fellows stand it  they dont all of them said the doctor or their wives and children dont some of them die  i wonder the lawyer pursued what has become of the good old american fact that there is always work for those who are willing to work i notice that wherever five thousand men strike in the forenoon there are five thousand men to take their places in the afternoonand not men who are turning their hands to something new but men who are used to doing the very thing the strikers have done  that is one of the things that teach the futility of strikes the professor made haste to interpose as if he had not quite liked to appear averse to the interests of the workman no one likes to do that if there were anything at all to be hoped from them it would be another matter  yes but that isnt the point quite said the lawyer  bytheway what is the point i asked with my humorous lightness  why i supposed said the banker it was the question how the working classes amused their elegant leisure but it seems to be almost anything else  we all applauded the neat touch but the altrurian eagerly entreated no no never mind that now that is a matter of comparatively little interest i would so much rather know something about the status of the workingman among you  do you mean his political status its that of every other citizen  i dont mean that i suppose that in america you have learned as we have in altruria that equal political rights are only means to an end and as an end have no value or reality i meant the economic status of the workingman and his social status  i do not know why we were so long girding up our loins to meet this simple question i myself could not have hopefully undertaken to answer it but the others were each in their way men of affairs and practically acquainted with the facts except perhaps the professor but he had devoted a great deal of thought to them and ought to have been qualified to make some sort of response but even he was silent and i had a vague feeling that they were all somehow reluctant to formulate their knowledge as if it were uncomfortable or discreditable the banker continued to smoke quietly on for a moment then he suddenly threw his cigar away  i like to free my mind of cant he said with a short laugh when i can afford it and i propose to cast all sorts of american cant out of it in answering your question the economic status of the workingman among us is essentially the same as that of the workingman all over the civilized world you will find plenty of people here especially about election time to tell you differently but they will not be telling you the truth though a great many of them think they are in fact i suppose most americans honestly believe because we have a republican form of government and manhood suffrage and so on that our economic conditions are peculiar and that our workingman has a status higher and better than that of the workingman anywhere else but he has nothing of the kind his circumstances are better and provisionally his wages are higher but it is only a question of years or decades when his circumstances will be the same and his wages the same as the european workingmans there is nothing in our conditions to prevent this  yes i understood from our friend here said the altrurian nodding toward me that you had broken only with the political tradition of europe in your revolution and he has explained to me that you do not hold all kinds of labor in equal esteem but  what kind of labor did he say we did hold in esteem asked the banker  why i understood him to say that if america meant anything at all it meant the honor of work but that you distinguished and did not honor some kinds of work so much as others for instance domestic service or personal attendance of any kind  the banker laughed again oh he drew the line there did he well we all have to draw the line somewhere our friend is a novelist and i will tell you in strict confidence that the line he has drawn is imaginary we dont honor any kind of work any more than any other people if a fellow gets up the papers make a great ado over his having been a woodchopper or a bobbinboy or something of that kind but i doubt if the fellow himself likes it he doesnt if hes got any sense the rest of us feel that its infra dig and hope nobody will find out that we ever worked with our hands for a living ill go further said the banker with the effect of whistling prudence down the wind and i will challenge any of you to gainsay me from his own experience or observation how does esteem usually express itself when we wish to honor a man what do we do  ask him to dinner said the lawyer  exactly we offer him some sort of social recognition well as soon as a fellow gets up if he gets up high enough we offer him some sort of social recognition in fact all sorts but upon condition that he has left off working with his hands for a living we forgive all you please to his past on account of the present but there isnt a workingman i venture to say in any city or town or even large village in the whole length and breadth of the united states who has any social recognition if he is still working at his trade i dont mean merely that he is excluded from rich and fashionable society but from the society of the average educated and cultivated people im not saying he is fit for it but i dont care how intelligent and agreeable he might beand some of them are astonishingly intelligent and so agreeable in their tone of mind and their original way of looking at things that i like nothing better than to talk with themall of our invisible fences are up against him  the minister said i wonder if that sort of exclusiveness is quite natural children seem to feel no sort of social difference among themselves  we can hardly go to children for a type of social order the professor suggested  true the minister meekly admitted but somehow there is a protest in us somewhere against these arbitrary distinctionssomething that questions whether they are altogether right we know that they must be and always have been and always will be and yetwell i will confess iti never feel at peace when i face them  oh said the banker if you come to the question of right and wrong that is another matter i dont say its right im not discussing that question though im certainly not proposing to level the fences i should be the last to take my own down i say simply that you are no more likely to meet a workingman in american society than you are to meet a colored man now you can judge he ended turning directly to the altrurian how much we honor labor and i hope i have indirectly satisfied your curiosity as to the social status of the workingman among us  we were all silent  perhaps the others were occupied like myself in trying to recall some instance of a workingman whom they had met in society and perhaps we said nothing because we all failed  the altrurian spoke at last  you have been so very full and explicit that i feel as if it were almost unseemly to press any further inquiry but i should very much like to know how your workingmen bear this social exclusion  im sure i cant say returned the banker a man does not care much to get into society until he has something to eat and how to get that is always the first question with the workingman  but you wouldnt like it yourself  no certainly i shouldnt like it myself i shouldnt complain of not being asked to peoples houses and the workingmen dont you cant do that but i should feel it an incalculable loss we may laugh at the emptiness of society or pretend to be sick of it but there is no doubt that society is the flower of civilization and to be shut out from it is to be denied the best privilege of a civilized man there are society womenwe have all met themwhose graciousness and refinement of presence are something of incomparable value it is more than a liberal education to have been admitted to it but it is as inaccessible to the workingman aswhat shall i say the thing is too grotesquely impossible for any sort of comparison merely to conceive of its possibility is something that passes a joke it is a kind of offence  again we were silent  i dont know the banker continued how the notion of our social equality originated but i think it has been fostered mainly by the expectation of foreigners who argued it from our political equality as a matter of fact it never existed except in our poorest and most primitive communities in the pioneer days of the west and among the goldhunters of california it was not dreamed of in our colonial society either in virginia or pennsylvania or new york or massachusetts and the fathers of the republic who were mostly slaveholders were practically as stiffnecked aristocrats as any people of their day we have not a political aristocracy that is all but there is as absolute a division between the orders of men and as little love in this country as in any country on the globe the severance of the man who works for his living with his hands from the man who does not work for his living with his hands is so complete and apparently so final that nobody even imagines anything else not even in fiction or how is that he asked turning to me do you fellows still put the intelligent highspirited handsome young artisan who wins the millionaires daughter into your books i used sometimes to find him there  you might still find him in the fiction of the weekly storypapers but i was obliged to own he would not go down with my readers even in the storypaper fiction he would leave off working as soon as he married the millionaires daughter and go to europe or he would stay here and become a social leader but he would not receive workingmen in his gilded halls  the others rewarded my humor with a smile but the banker said then i wonder you were not ashamed of filling our friend up with that stuff about our honoring some kinds of labor it is true that we dont go about openly and explicitly despising any kind of honest toilpeople dont do that anywhere now but we contemn it in terms quite as unmistakable the workingman acquiesces as completely as anybody else he does not remain a workingman a moment longer that he can help and after he gets up if he is weak enough to be proud of having been one it is because he feels that his low origin is a proof of his prowess in rising to the top against unusual odds i dont suppose there is a man in the whole civilized worldoutside of altruria of coursewho is proud of working at a trade except the shoemaker tolstoy and is a count and he does not make very good shoes  we all laughed again those shoes of count tolstoys are always such an infallible joke  the altrurian however was cocked and primed with another question he instantly exploded it but are all the workingmen in america eager to rise above their condition is there none willing to remain among the mass because the rest could not rise with him and from the hope of yet bringing labor to honor  the banker answered i never heard of any no the american ideal is not to change the conditions for all but for each to rise above the rest if he can  do you think it is really so bad as that asked the minister timidly  the banker answered bad do you call that bad i thought it was very good but good or bad i dont think youll find it deniable if you look into the facts there may be workingmen willing to remain so for other workingmens sake but i have never met anyperhaps because the workingman never goes into society  the unfailing question of the altrurian broke the silence which ensued are there many of your workingmen who are intelligent and agreeableof the type you mentioned a moment since  perhaps said the banker i had better refer you to one of our friends here who has had a great deal more to do with them than i have he is a manufacturer and he has had to do with all kinds of workpeople  yes for my sins the manufacturer assented and he added they are often confoundedly intelligent though i havent often found them very agreeable either in their tone of mind or their original way of looking at things  the banker amiably acknowledged his thrust and the altrurian asked ah they are opposed to your own  well we have the same trouble here that you must have heard of in england as you know now that the conditions are the same here you wont be surprised at the fact  but the conditions the altrurian pursueddo you expect them always to continue the same  well i dont know said the manufacturer we cant expect them to change of themselves and i shouldnt know how to change them it was expected that the rise of the trusts and the syndicates would break the unions but somehow they havent the situation remains the same the unions are not cutting one anothers throats now any more than we are the war is on a larger scalethats all  then let me see said the altrurian whether i clearly understand the situation as regards the workingman in america he is dependent upon the employer for his chance to earn a living and he is never sure of this he may be thrown out of work by his employers disfavor or disaster and his willingness to work goes for nothing there is no public provision of work for him there is nothing to keep him from want nor the prospect of anything  we are all in the same boat said the professor  but some of us have provisioned ourselves rather better and can generally weather it through till we are picked up the lawyer put in  i am always saying the workingman is improvident returned the professor  there are the charities the minister suggested  but his economical status the altrurian pursued is in a state of perpetual uncertainty and to save himself in some measure he has organized and so has constituted himself a danger to the public peace  a very great danger said the professor  i guess we can manage him the manufacturer remarked  and socially he is nonexistent  the altrurian turned with this question to the banker who said he is certainly not in society  then said my guest if the workingmans wages are provisionally so much better here than in europe why should they be discontented what is the real cause of their discontent  i have always been suspicious in the company of practical men of an atmosphere of condescension to men of my calling if nothing worse i fancy they commonly regard artists of all kinds as a sort of harmless eccentrics and that literary people they look upon as something droll as weak and soft as not quite right i believed that this particular group indeed was rather abler to conceive of me as a rational person than most others but i knew that if even they had expected me to be as reasonable as themselves they would not have been greatly disappointed if i were not and it seemed to me that i had put myself wrong with them in imparting to the altrurian that romantic impression that we hold labor in honor here i had really thought so but i could not say so now and i wished to retrieve myself somehow i wished to show that i was a practical man too and so i made answer what is the cause of the workingmans discontent it is very simple the walking delegate    iv  i suppose i could not have fairly claimed any great originality for my notion that the walking delegate was the cause of the labor troubles he is regularly assigned as the reason of a strike in the newspapers and is reprobated for his evil agency by the editors who do not fail to read the workingmen many solemn lessons and fervently warn them against him as soon as the strike begins to go wrongas it nearly always does i understand from them that the walking delegate is an irresponsible tyrant who emerges from the mystery that habitually hides him and from time to time orders a strike in mere rancor of spirit and plenitude of power and then leaves the workingmen and their families to suffer the consequences while he goes off somewhere and rolls in the lap of luxury careless of the misery he has created between his debauches of vicious idleness and his accesses of baleful activity he is employed in poisoning the mind of the workingmen against his real interests and real friends this is perfectly easy because the american workingman though singularly shrewd and sensible in other respects is the victim of an unaccountable obliquity of vision which keeps him from seeing his real interests and real friendsor at least from knowing them when he sees them  there could be no doubt i thought in the mind of any reasonable person that the walking delegate was the source of the discontent among our proletariate and i alleged him with a confidence which met the approval of the professor apparently for he nodded as if to say that i had hit the nail on the head this time and the minister seemed to be freshly impressed with a notion that could not be new to him the lawyer and the doctor were silent as if waiting for the banker to speak again but he was silent too the manufacturer to my chagrin broke into a laugh im afraid he said with a sardonic levity which surprised me youll have to go a good deal deeper than the walking delegate hes a symptom he isnt the disease the thing keeps on and on and it seems to be always about wages but it isnt about wages at the bottom some of those fellows know it and some of them dont but the real discontent is with the whole system with the nature of things i had a curious revelation on that point the last time i tried to deal with my men as a union they were always bothering me about this and about that and there was no end to the bickering i yielded point after point but it didnt make any difference it seemed as if the more i gave the more they asked at last i made up my mind to try to get at the real inwardness of the matter and i didnt wait for their committee to come to mei sent for their leading man and said i wanted to have it out with him he wasnt a bad fellow and when i got at him man to man that way i found he had sense and he had ideasits no use pretending those fellows are fools he had thought about his side of the question anyway i said now what does it all mean do you want the earth or dont you when is it going to end i offered him something to take but he said he didnt drink and we compromised on cigars now when is it going to end said i and i pressed it home and wouldnt let him fight off from the point do you mean when is it all going to end said he yes said i all im sick of it if theres any way out id like to know it well said he ill tell you if you want to know its all going to end when you get the same amount of money for the same amount of work as we do  we all laughed uproariously the thing was deliciously comical and nothing i thought attested the altrurians want of humor like his failure to appreciate this joke he did not even smile in asking and what did you say  well returned the manufacturer with cosey enjoyment i asked him if the men would take the concern and run it themselves we laughed again this seemed even better than the other joke but he said no they would not like to do that and then i asked him just what they would like if they could have their own way and he said they would like to have me run the business and all share alike i asked him what was the sense of that and why if i could do something that all of them put together couldnt do i shouldnt be paid more than all of them put together and he said that if a man did his best he ought to be paid as much as the best man i asked him if that was the principle their union was founded on and he said yes that the very meaning of their union was the protection of the weak by the strong and the equalization of earnings among all who do their best  we waited for the manufacturer to go on but he made a dramatic pause at this point as if to let it sink into our minds and he did not speak until the altrurian prompted him with the question and what did you finally do  i saw there was only one way out for me and i told the fellow i did not think i could do business on that principle we parted friends but the next saturday i locked them out and smashed their union they came back most of themthey had tobut ive treated with them ever since as individuals  and theyre much better off in your hands than they were in the union said the professor  i dont know about that said the manufacturer but im sure i am  we laughed with him all but the minister whose mind seemed to have caught upon some other point and who sat absently by  and is it your opinion from what you know of the workingman generally that they all have this twist in their heads the professor asked  they have until they begin to rise then they get rid of it mighty soon let a man save somethingenough to get a house of his own and take a boarder or two and perhaps have a little money at interestand he sees the matter in another light  do you think he sees it more clearly asked the minister  he sees it differently  what do you think the minister pursued turning to the lawyer you are used to dealing with questions of justice  rather more with questions of law im afraid the other returned pleasantly putting his feet together before him and looking down at them in a way he had but still i have a great interest in questions of justice and i confess that i find a certain wild equity in this principle which i see nobody could do business on it strikes me as idyllicits a touch of real poetry in the roughandtumble prose of our economic life  he referred this to me as something i might appreciate in my quality of literary man and i responded in my quality of practical man theres certainly more rhyme than reason in it  he turned again to the minister  i suppose the ideal of the christian state is the family  i hope so said the minister with the gratitude that i have seen people of his cloth show when men of the world conceded premises which the world usually contests it has seemed to me pathetic  and if that is the case why the logic of the postulate is that the prosperity of the weakest is the sacred charge and highest happiness of all the stronger but the law has not recognized any such principle in economics at least and if the labor unions are based upon it they are outlaw so far as any hope of enforcing it is concerned and it is bad for men to feel themselves outlaw how is it the lawyer continued turning to the altrurian in your country we can see no issue here if the first principle of organized labor antagonizes the first principle of business  but i dont understand precisely yet what the first principle of business is returned my guest  ah that raises another interesting question said the lawyer of course every business man solves the problem practically according to his temperament and education and i suppose that on first thoughts every business man would answer you accordingly but perhaps the personal equation is something you wish to eliminate from the definition  yes of course  still i would rather not venture upon it first said the lawyer professor what should you say was the first principle of business  buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest the professor promptly answered  we will pass the parson and the doctor and the novelist as witnesses of no value they cant possibly have any cognizance of the first principle of business their affair is to look after the souls and bodies and fancies of other people but what should you say it was he asked the banker  i should say it was an enlightened conception of ones own interests  and you  the manufacturer had no hesitation in answering the good of number one first last and all the time there may be a difference of opinion about the best way to get at it the long way may be the better or the short way the direct way or the oblique way or the purely selfish way or the partly selfish way but if you ever lose sight of that end you might as well shut up shop that seems to be the first law of nature as well as the first law of business  ah we mustnt go to nature for our morality the minister protested  we were not talking of morality said the manufacturer we were talking of business  this brought the laugh on the minister but the lawyer cut it short well then i dont really see why the tradesunions are not as businesslike as the syndicates in their dealings with all those outside of themselves within themselves they practise an altruism of the highest order but it is a tribal altruism it is like that which prompts a sioux to share his last mouthful with a starving sioux and to take the scalp of a starving apache how is it with your tradesunions in altruria he asked my friend  we have no tradesunions in altruria he began  happy altruria cried the professor  we had them formerly the altrurian went on as you have them now they claimed as i suppose yours do that they were forced into existence by the necessities of the case that without union the workingman was unable to meet the capitalist on anything like equal terms or to withstand his encroachments and oppressions but to maintain themselves they had to extinguish industrial liberty among the workingmen themselves and they had to practise great cruelties against those who refused to join them or who rebelled against them  they simply destroy them here said the professor  well said the lawyer from his judicial mind the great syndicates have no scruples in destroying a capitalist who wont come into them or who tries to go out they dont club him or stone him but they undersell him and freeze him out they dont break his head but they bankrupt him the principle is the same  dont interrupt mr homos the banker entreated i am very curious to know just how they got rid of labor unions in altruria  we had syndicates too and finally we had the reductio ad absurdumwe had a federation of labor unions find a federation of syndicates that divided the nation into two camps the situation was not only impossible but it was insupportably ridiculous  i ventured to say it hasnt become quite so much of a joke with us yet  isnt it in a fair way to become so asked the doctor and he turned to the lawyer what should you say was the logic of events among us for the last ten or twenty years  theres nothing so capricious as the logic of events its like a womans reasoningyou cant tell what its aimed at or where its going to fetch up all that you can do is to keep out of the way if possible we may come to some such condition of things as they have in altruria where the faith of the whole nation is pledged to secure every citizen in the pursuit of happiness or we may revert to some former condition and the master may again own the man or we may hitch and joggle along indefinitely as we are doing now  but come now said the banker while he laid a caressing touch on the altrurians shoulder you dont mean to say honestly that everybody works with his hands in altruria  yes certainly we are mindful as a whole people of the divine lawin the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread  but the capitalists im anxious about number one you see  we have none  i forgot of course but the lawyers the doctors the parsons the novelists  they all do their share of handwork  the lawyer said that seems to dispose of the question of the workingman in society but how about your minds when do you cultivate your minds when do the ladies of altruria cultivate their minds if they have to do their own work as i suppose they do or is it only the men who work if they happen to be the husbands and fathers of the upper classes  the altrurian seemed to be sensible of the kindly scepticism which persisted in our reception of his statements after all we had read of altruria he smiled indulgently and said you mustnt imagine that work in altruria is the same as it is here as we all work the amount that each one need do is very little a few hours each day at the most so that every man and woman has abundant leisure and perfect spirits for the higher pleasures which the education of their whole youth has fitted them to enjoy if you can understand a state of things where the sciences and arts and letters are cultivated for their own sake and not as a means of livelihood  no said the lawyer smiling im afraid we cant conceive of that we consider the pinch of poverty the highest incentive that a man can have if our gifted friend here he said indicating me were not kept like a toad under the harrow with his nose on the grindstone and the poorhouse staring him in the face  for heavens sake i cried out dont mix your metaphors so anyway  if it were not for that and all the other hardships that literary men undergo    toil envy want the patron and the jail  his novels probably wouldnt be worth reading  ah said the altrurian as if he did not quite follow this joking and to tell the truth i never find the personal thing in very good taste you will understand then how extremely difficult it is for me to imagine a condition of things like yoursalthough i have it under my very eyeswhere the money consideration is the first consideration  oh excuse me urged the minister i dont think thats quite the case  i beg your pardon said the altrurian sweetly you can see how easily i go astray  why i dont know the banker interposed that you are so far out in what you say if you had said that money was always the first motive i should have been inclined to dispute you too but when you say that money is the first consideration i think you are quite right unless a man secures his financial basis for his work he cant do his work its nonsense to pretend otherwise so the money consideration is the first consideration people here have to live by their work and to live they must have money of course we all recognize a difference in the qualities as well as in the kinds of work the work of the laborer may be roughly defined as the necessity of his life the work of the business man as the means and the work of the artist and scientist as the end we might refine upon these definitions and make them closer but they will serve for illustration as they are i dont think there can be any question as to which is the highest kind of work some truths are selfevident he is a fortunate man whose work is an end and every business man sees this and owns it to himself at least when he meets some man of an aesthetic or scientific occupation he knows that this luckier fellow has a joy in his work which he can never feel in business that his success in it can never be embittered by the thought that it is the failure of another that if he does it well it is pure good that there cannot be any competition in itthere can be only a noble emulation as far as the work itself is concerned he can always look up to his work for it is something above him and a business man often has to look down upon his business for it is often beneath him unless he is a pretty low fellow  i listened to all this in surprise i knew that the banker was a cultivated man a man of university training and that he was a reader and a thinker but he had always kept a certain reserve in his talk which he now seemed to have thrown aside for the sake of the altrurian or because the subject had a charm that lured him out of himself well now he continued the question is of the money consideration which is the first consideration with us all does it or doesnt it degrade the work which is the life of those among us whose work is the highest i understand that this is the misgiving which troubles you in view of our conditions  the altrurian assented and i thought it a proof of the bankers innate delicacy that he did not refer the matter so far as it concerned the aesthetic life and work to me i was afraid he was going to do so but he courteously proposed to keep the question impersonal and he went on to consider it himself well i dont suppose any one can satisfy you fully but i should say that it put such men under a double strain and perhaps that is the reason why so many of them break down in a calling that is certainly far less exhausting than business on one side the artist is kept to the level of the workingman of the animal of the creature whose sole affair is to get something to eat and somewhere to sleep this is through his necessity on the other side he is exalted to the height of beings who have no concern but with the excellence of their work which they were born and divinely authorized to do this is through his purpose between the two i should say that he got mixed and that his work shows it  none of the others said anything and since i had not been personally appealed to i felt the freer to speak if you will suppose me to be speaking from observation rather than experience i began  by all means said the banker go on and the rest made haste in various forms to yield me the word  i should say that such a man certainly got mixed but that his work kept itself pure from the money consideration as it were in spite of him a painter or actor or even a novelist is glad to get all he can for his work and such is our fallen nature he does get all he knows how to get but when he has once fairly passed into his work he loses himself in it he does not think whether it will pay or not whether it will be popular or not but whether he can make it good or not  well that is conceivable said the banker but wouldnt he rather do something he would get less for if he could afford it than the thing he knows he will get more for doesnt the money consideration influence his choice of subject  oddly enough i dont believe it does i answered after a moments reflection a man makes his choice once for all when he embraces the aesthetic life or rather it is made for him no other life seems possible i know there is a general belief that an artist does the kind of thing he has made go because it pays but this only shows the prevalence of business ideals if he did not love to do the thing he does he could not do it well no matter how richly it paid  i am glad to hear it said the banker and he added to the altrurian so you see we are not so bad as one would think we are illogically better in fact  yes the other assented i knew something of your literature as well as your conditions before i left home and i perceived that by some anomaly the one was not tainted by the other it is a miraculous proof of the divine mission of the poet  and the popular novelist the lawyer whispered in my ear but loud enough for the rest to hear and they all testified their amusement at my cost  the altrurian with his weak sense of humor passed the joke it shows no signs of corruption from greed but i cant help thinking that fine as it is it might have been much finer if the authors who produced it had been absolutely freed to their work and had never felt the spur of need  are they absolutely freed to it in altruria asked the professor i understood you that everybody had to work for his living in altruria  that is a mistake nobody works for his living in altruria he works for others living  ah that is precisely what our workingmen object to doing here said the manufacturer in that last interview of mine with the walking delegate he had the impudence to ask me why my men should work for my living as well as their own  he couldnt imagine that you were giving them the work to dothe very means of life said the professor  oh no thats the last thing those fellows want to think of  perhaps the altrurian suggested they might not have found it such a hardship to work for your living if their own had been assured as it is with us if you will excuse my saying it we should think it monstrous in altruria for any man to have anothers means of life in his power and in our condition it is hardly imaginable do you really have it in your power to take away a mans opportunity to earn a living  the manufacturer laughed uneasily it is in my power to take away his life but i dont habitually shoot my fellowmen and i never dismissed a man yet without good reason  oh i beg your pardon said the altrurian i didnt dream of accusing you of such inhumanity but you see our whole system is so very different that as i said it is hard for me to conceive of yours and i am very curious to understand its workings if you shot your fellowman as you say the law would punish you but if for some reason that you decided to be good you took away his means of living and he actually starved to death  then the law would have nothing to do with it the professor replied for the manufacturer who did not seem ready to answer but that is not the way things fall out the man would be supported in idleness probably till he got another job by his union which would take the matter up  but i thought that our friend did not employ union labor returned the altrurian  i found all this very uncomfortable and tried to turn the talk back to a point that i felt curious about but in altruria if the literary class is not exempt from the rule of manual labor where do they find time and strength to write  why you must realize that our manual labor is never engrossing or exhausting it is no more than is necessary to keep the body in health i do not see how you remain well here you people of sedentary occupations  oh we all take some sort of exercise we walk several hours a day or we row or we ride a bicycle or a horse or we fence  but to us returned the altrurian with a growing frankness which nothing but the sweetness of his manner would have excused exercise for exercise would appear stupid the barren expenditure of force that began and ended in itself and produced nothing we shouldif you will excuse my saying solook upon as childish if not insane or immoral    v  at this moment the lady who had hailed me so gayly from the top of the coach while i stood waiting for the altrurian to help the porter with the baggage just after the arrival of the train came up with her husband to our little group and said to me i want to introduce my husband to you he adores your books she went on much longer to this effect while the other men grinned round and her husband tried to look as if it were all true and her eyes wandered to the altrurian who listened gravely i knew perfectly well that she was using her husbands zeal for my fiction to make me present my friend but i did not mind that and i introduced him to both of them she took possession of him at once and began walking him off down the piazza while her husband remained with me and the members of our late conference drifted apart i was not sorry to have it broken up for the present it seemed to me that it had lasted quite long enough and i lighted a cigar with the husband and we strolled together in the direction his wife had taken  he began apparently in compliment to literature in my person yes i like to have a book where i can get at it when were not going out to the theatre and i want to quiet my mind down after business i dont care much what the book is my wife reads to me till i drop off and then she finishes the book herself and tells me the rest of the story you see business takes it out of you so well i let my wife do most of the reading anyway she knows pretty much everything thats going in that line we havent got any children and it occupies her mind shes up to all sorts of thingsshes artistic and shes musical and shes dramatic and shes literary well i like to have her women are funny anyway  he was a goodlooking goodnatured average american of the moneymaking type i believe he was some sort of a broker but i do not quite know what his business was as we walked up and down the piazza keeping a discreet little distance from the corner where his wife had run off to with her capture he said he wished he could get more time with her in the summer but he supposed i knew what business was he was glad she could have the rest anyway she needed it  bytheway he asked who is this friend of yours the women are all crazy about him and its been an even thing between my wife and miss groundsel which would fetch him first but ill bet on my wife every time when it comes to a thing like that hes a goodlooking fellowsome kind of foreigner i believe pretty eccentric too i guess where is altruria anyway  i told him and he said oh yes well if we are going to restrict immigration i suppose we shant see many more altrurians and wed better make the most of this one heigh  i do not know why this innocent pleasantry piqued me to say if i understand the altrurians my dear fellow nothing could induce them to emigrate to america as far as i can make out they would regard it very much as we should regard settling among the eskimos  is that so asked my new acquaintance with perfect good temper why  really i cant say and i dont know that ive explicit authority for my statement  they are worse than the english used to be he went on i didnt know that there were any foreigners who looked at us in that light now i thought the war settled all that  i sighed there are a good many things that the war didnt settle so definitely as weve been used to thinking im afraid but for that matter i fancy an altrurian would regard the english as a little lower in the scale of savagery than ourselves even  is that so well thats pretty good on the english anyway said my companion and he laughed with an easy satisfaction that i envied him  my dear his wife called to him from where she was sitting with the altrurian i wish you would go for my shawl i begin to feel the air a little  ill go if youll tell me where he said and he confided to me never knows where her shawl is onequarter of the time  well i think i left it in the office somewhere you might ask at the desk or perhaps its in the rack by the diningroom dooror maybe up in our room  i thought so said her husband with another glance at me as if it were the greatest fun in the world and he started amiably off  i went and took a chair by the lady and the altrurian and she began at once oh im so glad youve come i have been trying to enlighten mr homos about some of the little social peculiarities among us that he finds so hard to understand he was just now the lady continued wanting to know why all the natives out here were not invited to go in and join our young people in the dance and ive been trying to tell him that we consider it a great favor to let them come and take up so much of the piazza and look in at the windows  she gave a little laugh of superiority and twitched her pretty head in the direction of the young country girls and country fellows who were thronging the place that night in rather unusual numbers they were well enough looking and as it was saturday night they were in their best i suppose their dress could have been criticised the young fellows were clothed by the readymade clothingstore and the young girls after their own devices from the fashion papers but their general effect was good and their behavior was irreproachable they were very quietif anything too quiet they took up a part of the piazza that was yielded them by common usage and sat watching the hop inside not so much enviously i thought as wistfully and for the first time it struck me as odd that they should have no part in the gayety i had often seen them there before but i had never thought it strange they should be shut out it had always seemed quite normal but now suddenly for one baleful moment it seemed abnormal i suppose it was the talk we had been having about the workingmen in society which caused me to see the thing as the altrurian must have seen it but i was nevertheless vexed with him for having asked such a question after he had been so fully instructed upon the point it was malicious of him or it was stupid i hardened my heart and answered you might have told him for one thing that they were not dancing because they had not paid the piper  then the money consideration enters even into your social pleasures asked the altrurian  very much doesnt it with you  he evaded this question as he evaded all straightforward questions concerning his country we have no money consideration you know but do i understand that all your social entertainments are paid for by the guests  oh no not so bad as that quite there are a great many that the host pays for even here in a hotel the host furnishes the music and the room free to the guests of the house  and none are admitted from the outside  oh yes people are welcome from all the other hotels and boardinghouses and the private cottages the young men are especially welcome there are not enough young men in the hotel to go round you see in fact we could see that some of the pretty girls within were dancing with other girls halfgrown boys were dangling from the waists of tall young ladies and waltzing on tiptoe  isnt that rather droll asked the altrurian  its grotesque i said and i felt ashamed of it but what are you to do the young men are hard at work in the cities as many as can get work there and the rest are out west growing up with the country there are twenty young girls for every young man at all the summer resorts in the east  but what would happen if these young farmersi suppose they are farmerswere invited in to take part in the dance asked my friend  but that is impossible  why  really mrs makely i think i shall have to give him back to you i said  the lady laughed i am not sure that i want him back  oh yes the altrurian entreated with unwonted perception of the humor i know that i must be very trying with my questions but do not abandon me to the solitude of my own conjectures they are dreadful  well i wont said the lady with another laugh and i will try to tell you what would happen if those farmers or farmhands or whatever they are were asked in the mammas would be very indignant and the young ladies would be scared and nobody would know what to do and the dance would stop  then the young ladies prefer to dance with one another and with little boys  no they prefer to dance with young men of their own station they would rather not dance at all than dance with people beneath them i dont say anything against these natives here they are very civil and decent but they have not the same social traditions as the young ladies they would be out of place with them and they would feel it  yes i can see that they are not fit to associate with them said the altrurian with a gleam of commonsense that surprised me and that as long as your present conditions endure they never can be you must excuse the confusion which the difference between your political ideals and your economic ideals constantly creates in me i always think of you politically first and realize you as a perfect democracy then come these other facts in which i cannot perceive that you differ from the aristocratic countries of europe in theory or practice it is very puzzling am i right in supposing that the effect of your economy is to establish insuperable inequalities among you and to forbid the hope of the brotherhood which your policy proclaims  mrs makely looked at me as if she were helpless to grapple with his meaning and for fear of worse i thought best to evade it i said i dont believe that anybody is troubled by those distinctions we are used to them and everybody acquiesces in them which is a proof that they are a very good thing  mrs makely now came to my support the americans are very highspirited in every class and i dont believe one of those nice farmboys would like being asked in any better than the young ladies you cant imagine how proud some of them are  so that they suffer from being excluded as inferiors  oh i assure you they dont feel themselves inferior they consider themselves as good as anybody there are some very interesting characters among them now there is a young girl sitting at the first window with her profile outlined by the light whom i feel it an honor to speak to thats her brother standing there with herthat tall gaunt young man with a roman face its such a common type here in the mountains their father was a soldier and he distinguished himself so in one of the last battles that he was promoted he was badly wounded but he never took a pension he just came back to his farm and worked on till he died now the son has the farm and he and his sister live there with their mother the daughter takes in sewing and in that way they manage to make both ends meet the girl is really a firstrate seamstress and so cheap i give her a good deal of my work in the summer and we are quite friends shes very fond of reading the mother is an invalid but she reads aloud while the daughter sews and youve no idea how many books they get through when she comes for sewing i like to talk with her about them i always have her sit down its hard to realize that she isnt a lady im a good deal criticised i know and i suppose i do spoil her a little it puts notions into such peoples heads if you meet them in that way theyre pretty free and independent as it is but when im with lizzie i forget that there is any difference between us i cant help loving the child you must take mr homos to see them mr twelvemough theyve got the fathers sword hung up over the head of the mothers bed its very touching but the poor little place is so bare  mrs makely sighed and there fell a little pause which she broke with a question she had the effect of having kept back  there is one thing i should like to ask you too mr homos is it true that everybody in altruria does some kind of manual labor  why certainly he answered quite as if he had been an american  ladies too or perhaps you have none  i thought this rather offensive but i could not see that the altrurian had taken it ill perhaps we had better try to understand each other clearly before i answer that question you have no titles of nobility as they have in england  no indeed i hope we have outgrown those superstitions said mrs makely with a republican fervor that did my heart good it is a word that we apply first of all to the moral qualities of a person  but you said just now that you sometimes forgot that your seamstress was not a lady just what did you mean by that  mrs makely hesitated i meanti suppose i meantthat she had not the surroundings of a lady the social traditions  then it has something to do with social as well as moral qualitieswith ranks and classes  classes yes but as you know we have no ranks in america the altrurian took off his hat and rubbed an imaginable perspiration from his forehead he sighed deeply it is all very difficult  yes mrs makely assented i suppose it is all foreigners find it so in fact it is something that you have to live into the notion of it cant be explained  well then my dear madam will you tell me without further question what you understand by a lady and let me live into the notion of it at my leisure  i will do my best said mrs makely but it would be so much easier to tell you who was or who was not a lady however your acquaintance is so limited yet that i must try to do something in the abstract and impersonal for you in the first place a lady must be above the sordid anxieties in every way she need not be very rich but she must have enough so that she need not be harassed about making both ends meet when she ought to be devoting herself to her social duties the time is past with us when a lady could look after the dinner and perhaps cook part of it herself and then rush in to receive her guests and do the amenities she must have a certain kind of house so that her entourage wont seem cramped and mean and she must have nice frocks of course and plenty of them she neednt be of the smart set that isnt at all necessary but she cant afford to be out of the fashion of course she must have a certain training she must have cultivated tastes she must know about art and literature and music and all those kind of things and though it isnt necessary to go in for anything in particular it wont hurt her to have a fad or two the nicest kind of fad is charity and people go in for that a great deal i think sometimes they use it to work up with and there are some who use religion in the same way i think its horrid but its perfectly safe you cant accuse them of doing it im happy to say though that mere church association doesnt count socially so much as it used to charity is a great deal more insidious but you see how hard it is to define a lady so much has to be left to the nerves in all these things and then its changing all the time europes coming in and the old american ideals are passing away things that people did ten years ago would be impossible now or at least ridiculous you wouldnt be considered vulgar quite but you would certainly be considered a back number and thats almost as bad really said mrs makely i dont believe i can tell you what a lady is  we all laughed together at her frank confession the altrurian asked but do i understand that one of her conditions is that she shall have nothing whatever to do  nothing to do cried mrs makely a lady is busy from morning till night she always goes to bed perfectly worn out  but with what asked the altrurian  with making herself agreeable and her house attractive with going to lunches and teas and dinners and concerts and theatres and art exhibitions and charity meetings and receptions and with writing a thousand and one notes about them and accepting and declining and giving lunches and dinners and making calls and receiving them and i dont know what all its the most hideous slavery her voice rose into something like a shriek one could see that her nerves were going at the mere thought of it all you dont have a moment to yourself your life isnt your own  but the lady isnt allowed to do any useful kind of work  work dont you call all that work and useful im sure i envy the cook in my kitchen at times i envy the woman that scrubs my floors stop dont ask why i dont go into my kitchen or get down on my knees with the mop it isnt possible you simply cant perhaps you could if you were very grande dame but if youre anywhere near the line of necessity or ever have been you cant besides if we did do our own household work as i understand your altrurian ladies do what would become of the servant class we should be taking away their living and that would be wicked  it would certainly be wrong to take away the living of a fellowcreature the altrurian gravely admitted and i see the obstacle in your way  its a mountain said the lady with exhaustion in her voice but a returning amiability his forbearance must have placated her  may i ask what the use of your society life is he ventured after a moment  use why should it have any it kills time  then you are shut up to a hideous slavery without use except to kill time and you cannot escape from it without taking away the living of those dependent on you  yes i put in and that is a difficulty that meets us at every turn it is something that matthew arnold urged with great effect in his paper on that crank of a tolstoy he asked what would become of the people who need the work if we served and waited on ourselves as tolstoy preached the question is unanswerable  that is true in your conditions it is unanswerable said the altrurian  i think said mrs makely that under the circumstances we do pretty well  oh i dont presume to censure you and if you believe that your conditions are the best  we believe them the best in the best of all possible worlds i said devoutly and it struck me that if ever we came to have a national church some such affirmation as that concerning our economical conditions ought to be in the confession of faith  the altrurians mind had not followed mine so far and your young girls he asked of mrs makelyhow is their time occupied  you mean after they come out in society  i suppose so  she seemed to reflect i dont know that it is very differently occupied of course they have their own amusements they have their dances and little clubs and their sewingsocieties i suppose that even an altrurian would applaud their sewing for the poor mrs makely asked rather satirically  yes he answered and then he asked isnt it taking work away from some needy seamstress though but i suppose you excuse it to the thoughtlessness of youth  mrs makely did not say and he went on what i find it so hard to understand is how you ladies can endure a life of mere nervous exertion such as you have been describing to me i dont see how you keep well  we dont keep well said mrs makely with the greatest amusement i dont suppose that when you get above the working classes till you reach the very rich you would find a perfectly well woman in america  isnt that rather extreme i ventured to ask  no said mrs makely its shamefully moderate and she seemed to delight in having made out such a bad case for her sex you cant stop a woman of that kind when she gets started i had better left it alone  but said the altrurian if you are forbidden by motives of humanity from doing any sort of manual labor which you must leave to those who live by it i suppose you take some sort of exercise  well said mrs makely shaking her head gayly we prefer to take medicine  you must approve of that i said to the altrurian as you consider exercise for its own sake insane or immoral but mrs makely i entreated youre giving me away at a tremendous rate i have just been telling mr homos that you ladies go in for athletics so much now in your summer outings that there is danger of your becoming physically as well as intellectually superior to us poor fellows dont take that consolation from me  i wont altogether she said i couldnt have the heart to after the pretty way youve put it i dont call it very athletic sitting around on hotel piazzas all summer long as nineteentwentieths of us do but i dont deny that there is a remnant as matthew arnold calls them who do go in for tennis and boating and bathing and tramping and climbing she paused and then she concluded gleefully and you ought to see what wrecks they get home in the fall  the joke was on me i could not help laughing though i felt rather sheepish before the altrurian fortunately he did not pursue the inquiry his curiosity had been given a slant aside from it  but your ladies he asked they have the summer for rest however they use it do they generally leave town i understood mr twelvemough to say so he added with a deferential glance at me  yes you may say it is the universal custom in the class that can afford it said mrs makely she proceeded as if she felt a tacit censure in his question it wouldnt be the least use for us to stay and fry through our summers in the city simply because our fathers and brothers had to besides we are worn out at the end of the season and they want us to come away as much as we want to come  ah i have always heard that the americans are beautiful in their attitude toward women  they are perfect dears said mrs makely and here comes one of the best of them  at that moment her husband came up and laid her shawl across her shoulders whose character is it youre blasting he asked jocosely  where in the world did you find it she asked meaning the shawl  it was where you left iton the sofa in the side parlor i had to take my life in my hand when i crossed among all those waltzers in there there must have been as many as three couples on the floor poor girls i pity them off at these places the fellows in town have a good deal better time theyve got their clubs and theyve got the theatre and when the weather gets too much for them they can run off down to the shore for the night the places anywhere within an hours ride are full of fellows the girls dont have to dance with one another there or with little boys of course thats all right if they like it better he laughed at his wife and winked at me and smoked swiftly in emphasis of his irony  then the young gentlemen whom the young ladies here usually meet in society are all at work in the cities the altrurian asked him rather needlessly as i had already said so  yes those who are not out west growing up with the country except of course the fellows who have inherited a fortune theyre mostly off on yachts  but why do your young men go west to grow up with the country pursued my friend  because the east is grown up they have got to hustle and the west is the place to hustle to make money added makely in response to a puzzled glance of the altrurian  sometimes said his wife i almost hate the name of money  well so long as you dont hate the thing peggy  oh we must have it i suppose she sighed they used to say about the girls who grew into old maids just after the rebellion that they had lost their chance in the war for the union i think quite as many lose their chance now in the war for the dollar  mars hath slain his thousands but mammon hath slain his tens of thousands i suggested lightly we all like to recognize the facts so long as we are not expected to do anything about them then we deny them  yes quite as bad as that said mrs makely  well my dear you are expensive you know said her husband and if we want to have youwhy weve got to hustle first  oh i dont blame you you poor things theres nothing to be done about it its just got to go on and on i dont see how its ever to end  the altrurian had been following us with that air of polite mystification which i had begun to dread in him then in your good society you postpone and even forego the happiness of life in the struggle to be rich  well you see said makely a fellow dont like to ask a girl to share a home that isnt as nice as the home she has left  sometimes his wife put in rather sadly i think that its all a mistake and that wed be willing to share the privations of the man we loved  well said makely with a laugh we wouldnt like to risk it  i laughed with him but his wife did not and in the silence that ensued there was nothing to prevent the altrurian from coming in with another of his questions how far does this state of things extend downward does it include the working classes too  oh no we all answered together and mrs makely said with your altrurian ideas i suppose you would naturally sympathize a great deal more with the lower classes and think they had to endure all the hardships in our system but if you could realize how the struggle goes on in the best society and how we all have to fight for what we get or dont get you would be disposed to pity our upper classes too  i am sure i should said the altrurian  makely remarked i used to hear my father say that slavery was harder on the whites than it was on the blacks and that he wanted it done away with for the sake of the masters  makely rather faltered in conclusion as if he were not quite satisfied with his remark and i distinctly felt a want of proportion in it but i did not wish to say anything his wife had no reluctance  well theres no comparison between the two things but the struggle certainly doesnt affect the working classes as it does us they go on marrying and giving in marriage in the old way they have nothing to lose and so they can afford it  blessed am dem what dont expect nuffin oh i tell you its a workingmans country said makely through his cigarsmoke you ought to see them in town these summer nights in the parks and squares and cheap theatres their girls are not off for their health anywhere and their fellows are not off growing up with the country their days work is over and theyre going in for a good time and then walk through the streets where they live and see them out on the stoops with their wives and children i tell you its enough to make a fellow wish he was poor himself  yes said mrs makely its astonishing how strong and well those women keep with their great families and their hard work sometimes i really envy them  do you suppose said the altrurian that they are aware of the sacrifices which the ladies of the upper classes make in leaving all the work to them and suffering from the nervous debility which seems to be the outcome of your society life  they have not the remotest idea of it they have no conception of what a society woman goes through with they think we do nothing they envy us too and sometimes theyre so ungrateful and indifferent if you try to help them or get on terms with them that i believe they hate us  but that comes from ignorance  yes though i dont know that they are really any more ignorant of us than we are of them its the other half on both sides  isnt that a pity rather  of course its a pity but what can you do you cant know what people are like unless you live like them and then the question is whether the game is worth the candle i should like to know how you manage in altruria  why we have solved the problem in the only way as you say that it can be solved we all live alike  isnt that a little just a very trifling little bit monotonous mrs makely asked with a smile but there is everything of course in being used to it to an unregenerate spiritlike mine for exampleit seems intolerable  but why when you were younger before you were married you all lived at home togetheror perhaps you were an only child  oh no indeed there were ten of us  then you all lived alike and shared equally  yes but we were a family  we do not conceive of the human race except as a family  now excuse me mr homos that is all nonsense you cannot have the family feeling without love and it is impossible to love other people that talk about the neighbor and all that is all well enough she stopped herself as if she dimly remembered who began that talk and then went on of course i accept it as a matter of faith and the spirit of it nobody denies that but what i mean is that you must have frightful quarrels all the time she tried to look as if this were where she really meant to bring up and he took her on the ground she had chosen  yes we have quarrels hadnt you at home  we fought like little cats and dogs at times  makely and i burst into a laugh at her magnanimous frankness the altrurian remained serious but because you lived alike you knew each other and so you easily made up your quarrels it is quite as simple with us in our life as a human family  this notion of a human family seemed to amuse mrs makely more and more she laughed and laughed again you must excuse me she panted at last but i cannot imagine it no it is too ludicrous just fancy the jars of an ordinary family multiplied by the population of a whole continent why you must be in a perpetual squabble you cant have any peace of your lives its worse far worse than our way  but madam he began you are supposing our family to be made up of people with all the antagonistic interests of your civilization as a matter of fact  no no i know human nature mr homos she suddenly jumped up and gave him her hand goodnight she said sweetly and as she drifted off on her husbands arm she looked back at us and nodded in gay triumph  the altrurian turned upon me with unabated interest and have you no provision in your system for finally making the lower classes understand the sufferings and sacrifices of the upper classes in their behalf do you expect to do nothing to bring them together in mutual kindness  well not this evening i said throwing the end of my cigar away im going to bedarent you  not yet  well goodnight are you sure you can find your room  oh yes goodnight    vi  i left my guest abruptly with a feeling of vexation not very easily definable his repetition of questions about questions which society has so often answered and always in the same way was not so bad in him as it would have been in a person of our civilization he represented a wholly different state of things the inversion of our own and much could be forgiven him for that reason just as in russia much could be forgiven to an american if he formulated his curiosity concerning imperialism from a purely republican experience i knew that in altruria for instance the possession of great gifts of any kind of superiority involved the sense of obligation to others and the wish to identify ones self with the great mass of men rather than the ambition to distinguish ones self from them and that the altrurians honored their gifted men in the measure they did this a man reared in such a civilization must naturally find it difficult to get our point of view with social inclusion as the ideal he would with difficulty conceive of our ideal of social exclusion but i think we had all been very patient with him we should have made short work with an american who had approached us with the same inquiries even from a foreigner the citizen of a republic founded on the notion elsewhere exploded ever since cain that one is his brothers keeper the things he asked seemed inoffensive only because they were puerile but they certainly were puerile i felt that it ought to have been selfevident to him that when a commonwealth of sixty million americans based itself upon the great principle of selfseeking selfseeking was the best thing and whatever hardship it seemed to work it must carry with it unseen blessings in tenfold measure if a few hundred thousand favored americans enjoyed the privilege of socially contemning all the rest it was as clearly right and just that they should do so as that four thousand american millionaires should be richer than all the other americans put together such a status growing out of our political equality and our material prosperity must evince a divine purpose to any one intimate with the designs of providence and it seemed a kind of impiety to doubt its perfection i excused the misgivings which i could not help seeing in the altrurian to his alien traditions and i was aware that my friends had done so too but if i could judge from myself he must have left them all sensible of their effort and this was not pleasant i could not blink the fact that although i had openly disagreed with him on every point of ethics and economics i was still responsible for him as a guest it was as if an english gentleman had introduced a blatant american democrat into tory society or rather as if a southerner of the olden time had harbored a northern abolitionist and permitted him to inquire into the workings of slavery among his neighbors people would tolerate him as my guest for a time but there must be an end of their patience with the tacit enmity of his sentiments and the explicit vulgarity of his ideals and when the end came i must be attainted with him  i did not like the notion of this and i meant to escape it if i could i confess that i would have willingly disowned him as i had already disavowed his opinions but there was no way of doing it short of telling him to go away and i was not ready to do that something in the man i do not know what mysteriously appealed to me he was not contemptibly puerile without being lovably childlike and i could only make up my mind to be more and more frank with him and to try and shield him as well as myself from the effects i dreaded  i fell asleep planning an excursion farther into the mountains which should take up the rest of the week that i expected him to stay with me and would keep him from following up his studies of american life where they would be so injurious to both of us as they must in our hotel a knock at my door roused me and i sent a drowsy come in toward it from the bedclothes without looking that way  goodmorning came back in the rich gentle voice of the altrurian i lifted my head with a jerk from the pillow and saw him standing against the closed door with my shoes in his hand oh i am sorry i waked you i thought  not at all not at all i said its quite time i dare say but you oughtnt to have taken the trouble to bring my shoes in  i wasnt altogether disinterested in it he returned i wished you to compliment me on them dont you think they are pretty well done for an amateur he came toward my bed and turned them about in his hands so that they would catch the light and smiled down upon me  i dont understand i began  why he said i blacked them you know  you blacked them  yes he returned easily i thought i would go into the baggageroom after we parted last night to look for a piece of mine that had not been taken to my room and i found the porter there with his wrist bound up he said he had strained it in handling a ladys saratogahe said a saratoga was a large trunkand i begged him to let me relieve him at the boots he was blacking he refused at first but i insisted upon trying my hand at a pair and then he let me go on with the mens boots he said he could varnish the ladies without hurting his wrist it needed less skill than i supposed and after i had done a few pairs he said i could black boots as well as he  did anybody see you i gasped and i felt a cold perspiration break out on me  no we had the whole midnight hour to ourselves the porters work with the baggage was all over and there was nothing to interrupt the delightful chat we fell into he is a very intelligent man and he told me all about that custom of feeing which you deprecate he says that the servants hate it as much as the guests they have to take the tips now because the landlords figure on them in the wages and they cannot live without them he is a fine manly fellow and  mr homos i broke in with the strength i found in his assurance that no one had seen him helping the porter black boots i want to speak very seriously with you and i hope you will not be hurt if i speak very plainly about a matter in which i have your good solely at heart this was not quite true and i winced inwardly a little when he thanked me with that confounded sincerity of his which was so much like irony but i went on it is my duty to you as my guest to tell you that this thing of doing for others is not such a simple matter here as your peculiar training leads you to think you have been deceived by a superficial likeness but really i do not understand how you could have read all you have done about us and not realize before coming here that america and altruria are absolutely distinct and diverse in their actuating principles they are both republics i know but america is a republic where every man is for himself and you cannot help others as you do at home it is dangerousit is ridiculous you must keep this fact in mind or you will fall into errors that will be very embarrassing to you in your stay among us and i was forced to add to all your friends now i certainly hoped after what i had said to you and what my friends had explained of our civilization that you would not have done a thing of this kind i will see the porter as soon as i am up and ask him not to mention the matter to any one but i confess i dont like to take an apologetic tone with him your conditions are so alien to ours that they will seem incredible to him and he will think i am stuffing him  i dont believe he will think that said the altrurian and i hope you wont find the case so bad as it seems to you i am extremely sorry to have done wrong  oh the thing wasnt wrong in itself it was only wrong under the circumstances abstractly it is quite right to help a fellowbeing who needs help no one denies that even in a country where every one is for himself  i am so glad to hear it said the altrurian then at least i have not gone radically astray and i do not think you need take the trouble to explain the altrurian ideas to the porter i have done that already and they seemed quite conceivable to him he said that poor folks had to act upon them even here more or less and that if they did not act upon them there would be no chance for them at all he says they have to help one another very much as we do at home and that it is only the rich folks among you who are independent i really dont think you need speak to him at all unless you wish and i was very careful to guard my offer of help at the point where i understood from you and your friends that it might do harm i asked him if there was not some one who would help him out with his bootblacking for money because in that case i should be glad to pay him but he said there was no one about who would take the job that he had to agree to black the boots or else he would not have got the place of porter but that all the rest of the help would consider it a disgrace and would not help him for love or money so it seemed quite safe to offer him my services  i felt that the matter was almost hopeless but i asked and what he saiddidnt that suggest anything else to you  how anything else asked the altrurian in his turn  didnt it occur to you that if none of his fellowservants were willing to help him black boots and if he did it only because he was obliged to it was hardly the sort of work for you  why no said the altrurian with absolute simplicity he must have perceived the despair i fell into at this answer for he asked why should i have minded doing for others what i should have been willing to do for myself  there are a great many things we are willing to do for ourselves that we are not willing to do for others but even on that principle which i think false and illogical you could not be justified a gentleman is not willing to black his own boots it is offensive to his feelings to his selfrespect it is something he will not do if he can get anybody else to do it for him  then in america said the altrurian it is not offensive to the feelings of a gentleman to let another do for him what he would not do for himself  certainly not  ah he returned then we understand something altogether different by the word gentleman in altruria i see now how i have committed a mistake i shall be more careful hereafter  i thought i had better leave the subject and bytheway i said how would you like to take a little tramp with me today farther up into the mountains  i should be delighted said the altrurian so gratefully that i was ashamed to think why i was proposing the pleasure to him  well then i shall be ready to start as soon as we have had breakfast i will join you downstairs in half an hour  he left me at this hint though really i was half afraid he might stay and offer to lend me a hand at my toilet in the expression of his national character i found him with mrs makely when i went down and she began with a parenthetical tribute to the beauty of the mountains in the morning light dont be surprised to see me up at this unnatural hour i dont know whether it was the excitement of our talk last night or what it was but my sulphonal wouldnt act though i took fifteen grains and i was up with the lark or should have been if there had been any lark outside of literature to be up with however this air is so glorious that i dont mind losing a nights sleep now and then i believe that with a little practice one could get along without any sleep at all here at least i could im sorry to say poor mr makely cant apparently hes making up for his share of my vigils and im going to breakfast without him do you know ive done a very bold thing ive got the headwaiter to give you places at our table i know youll hate it mr twelvemough because you naturally want to keep mr homos to yourself and i dont blame you at all but im simply not going to let you and thats all there is about it  the pleasure i felt at this announcement was not unmixed but i tried to keep mrs makely from thinking so and i was immensely relieved when she found a chance to say to me in a low voice i know just how youre feeling mr twelvemough and im going to help you keep him from doing anything ridiculous if i can i like him and i think its a perfect shame to have people laughing at him i know we can manage him between us  we so far failed however that the altrurian shook hands with the headwaiter when he pressed open the wirenetting door to let us into the diningroom and made a bow to our waitress of the sort one makes to a lady but we thought it best to ignore these little errors of his and reserve our moral strength for anything more spectacular fortunately we got through our breakfast with nothing worse than his jumping up and stooping to hand the waitress a spoon she let fall but this could easily pass for some attention to mrs makely at a little distance there were not many people down to breakfast yet but i could see that there was a good deal of subdued sensation among the waitresses standing with folded arms behind their tables and that the headwaiters handsome face was red with anxiety  mrs makely asked if we were going to church she said she was driving that way and would be glad to drop us im not going myself she explained because i couldnt make anything of the sermon with my head in the state it is and im going to compromise on a good action i want to carry some books and papers over to mrs camp dont you think that will be quite as acceptable mr homos  i should venture to hope it he said with a tolerant seriousness not altogether out of keeping with her lightness  who is mrs camp i asked not caring to commit myself on the question  lizzies mother you know i told you about them last night i think she must have got through the books i lent her and i know lizzie didnt like to ask me for more because she saw me talking with you and didnt want to interrupt us such a nice girl i think the sunday papers must have come and ill take them over too mrs camp is always so glad to get them and she is so delightful when she gets going about public events but perhaps you dont approve of sunday papers mr homos  im sure i dont know madam i havent seen them yet you know this is the first sunday ive been in america  well im sorry to say you wont see the old puritan sabbath said mrs makely with an abrupt deflection from the question of the sunday papers though you ought to up in these hills the only thing left of it is ryeandindian bread and these baked beans and fishballs  but they are very good  yes i dare say they are not the worst of it  she was a woman who tended to levity and i was a little afraid she might be going to say something irreverent but if she were she was forestalled by the altrurian asking would it be very indiscreet madam if i were to ask you some time to introduce me to that family  the camps she returned not at all i should be perfectly delighted the thought seemed to strike her and she asked why not go with me this morning unless you are inflexibly bent on going to church you and mr twelvemough  the altrurian glanced at me and i said i should be only too glad if i could carry some books so that i could compromise on a good action too take one of your own she instantly suggested  do you think they wouldnt be too severe upon it i asked  well mrs camp might mrs makely consented with a smile she goes in for rather serious fiction but i think lizzie would enjoy a good oldfashioned lovestory where everybody got married as they do in your charming books  i winced a little for every one likes to be regarded seriously and i did not enjoy being remanded to the younggirl public but i put a bold face on it and said my good action shall be done in behalf of miss lizzie  half an hour later mrs makely having left word with the clerk where we were gone so that her husband need not be alarmed when he got up we were striking into the hills on a twoseated buckboard with one of the best teams of our hotel and one of the most taciturn drivers mrs makely had the altrurian get into the back seat with her and after some attempts to make talk with the driver i leaned over and joined in their talk the altrurian was greatly interested not so much in the landscapethough he owned its beauty when we cried out over it from point to pointbut in the human incidents and features he noticed the cattle in the fields and the horses we met on the road and the taste and comfort of the buildings the variety of the crops and the promise of the harvest i was glad of the respite his questions gave me from the study of the intimate character of our civilization for they were directed now at these more material facts and i willingly joined mrs makely in answering them we explained that the finest teams we met were from the different hotels or boardinghouses or at least from the farms where the people took city people to board and that certain shabby equipages belonged to the natives who lived solely by cultivating the soil there was not very much of the soil cultivated for the chief crop was hay with here and there a patch of potatoes or beans and a few acres in sweetcorn the houses of the natives when they were for their use only were no better than their turnouts it was where the city boarder had found shelter that they were modern and pleasant now and then we came to a deserted homestead and i tried to make the altrurian understand how farming in new england had yielded to the competition of the immense agricultural operations of the west you know i said that agriculture is really an operation out there as much as coalmining is in pennsylvania or finance in wall street you have no idea of the vastness of the scale perhaps i swelled a little with pride in my celebration of the national prosperity as it flowed from our western farms of five and ten and twenty thousand acres i could not very well help putting on the pedal in these passages mrs makely listened almost as eagerly as the altrurian for as a cultivated american woman she was necessarily quite ignorant of her own country geographically politically and historically the only people left in the hill country of new england i concluded are those who are too old or too lazy to get away any young man of energy would be ashamed to stay unless he wanted to keep a boardinghouse or live on the city vacationists in summer if he doesnt he goes west and takes up some of the new land and comes back in middlelife and buys a deserted farm to spend his summers on  dear me said the altrurian is it so simple as that then we can hardly wonder at their owners leaving these wornout farms though i suppose it must be with the pang of exile sometimes  oh i fancy there isnt much sentiment involved i answered lightly  whoa said mrs makely speaking to the horses before she spoke to the driver as some women will he pulled them up and looked round at her  isnt that reuben camp now over there by that house she asked as if we had been talking of him that is another way some women have  yes maam said the driver  oh well then and reuben she called to the young man who was prowling about the dooryard of a sadcolored old farmhouse and peering into a window here and there come here a momentwont you please  he lifted his head and looked round and when he had located the appeal made to him he came down the walk to the gate and leaned over it waiting for further instructions i saw that it was the young man whom we had noticed with the girl mrs makely called lizzie on the hotel piazza the night before  do you know whether i should find lizzie at home this morning  yes shes there with mother said the young fellow with neither liking nor disliking in his tone  oh im so glad said the lady i didnt know but she might be at church what in the world has happened here is there anything unusual going on inside  no i was just looking to see if it was all right the folks wanted i should come round  why where are they  oh theyre gone  gone  yes gone west theyve left the old place because they couldnt make a living here any longer  why this is quite a case in point i said now mr homos here is a chance to inform yourself at first hand about a very interesting fact of our civilization and i added in a low voice to mrs makely wont you introduce us  oh yes mr camp this is mr twelvemough the authoryou know his books of course and mr homos a gentleman from altruria  the young fellow opened the gate he leaned on and came out to us he took no notice of me but he seized the altrurians hand and wrung it ive heard of you he said mrs makely were you going to our place  why yes  so do then mother would give almost anything to see mr homos weve heard of altruria over our way he added to our friend mothers been reading up all she can about it shell want to talk with you and she wont give the rest of us much of a chance i guess  oh i shall be glad to see her said the altrurian and to tell her everything i can but wont you explain to me first something about your deserted farms here its quite a new thing to me  it isnt a new thing to us said the young fellow with a short laugh and there isnt much to explain about it youll see them all through new england when a man finds he cant get his funeral expenses out of the land he dont feel like staying to be buried in it and he pulls up and goes  but people used to get their living expenses here i suggested why cant they now  well they didnt use to have western prices to fight with and then the land wasnt worn out so and the taxes were not so heavy how would you like to pay twenty to thirty dollars on the thousand and assessed up to the last notch in the city  why what in the world makes your taxes so heavy  schools and roads weve got to have schools and you city folks want good roads when you come here in the summer dont you then the season is short and sometimes we cant make a crop the frost catches the corn in the field and you have your trouble for your pains potatoes are the only thing we can count on except grass and when everybody raises potatoes you know where the price goes  oh but now mr camp said mrs makely leaning over toward him and speaking in a cosey and coaxing tone as if he must not really keep the truth from an old friend like her isnt it a good deal because the farmers daughters want pianos and the farmers sons want buggies i heard professor lumen saying the other day that if the farmers were willing to work as they used to work they could still get a good living off their farms and that they gave up their places because they were too lazy in many cases to farm them properly  hed better not let me hear him saying that said the young fellow while a hot flush passed over his face he added bitterly if he wants to see how easy it is to make a living up here he can take this place and try for a year or two he can get it cheap but i guess he wouldnt want it the year round hed only want it a few months in the summer when he could enjoy the sightliness of it and see me working over there on my farm while he smoked on his front porch he turned round and looked at the old house in silence a moment then as he went on his voice lost its angry ring the folks here bought this place from the indians and theyd been here more than two hundred years do you think they left it because they were too lazy to run it or couldnt get pianos and buggies out of it or were such fools as not to know whether they were well off it was their home they were born and lived and died here there is the family buryingground over there  neither mrs makely nor myself was ready with a reply and we left the word with the altrurian who suggested still i suppose they will be more prosperous in the west on the new land they take up  the young fellow leaned his arms on the wheel by which he stood what do you mean by taking up new land  why out of the public domain  there aint any public domain thats worth having all the good land is in the hands of railroads and farm syndicates and speculators and if you want a farm in the west youve got to buy it the east is the only place where folks give them away because they aint worth keeping if you havent got the ready money you can buy one on credit and pay ten twenty and thirty per cent interest and live in a dugout on the plainstill your mortgage matures the young man took his arms from the wheel and moved a few steps backward as he added ill see you over at the house later  the driver touched his horses and we started briskly off again but i confess i had quite enough of his pessimism and as we drove away i leaned back toward the altrurian and said now it is all perfect nonsense to pretend that things are at that pass with us there are more millionaires in america probably than there are in all the other civilized countries of the globe and it is not possible that the farming population should be in such a hopeless condition all wealth comes out of the earth and you may be sure they get their full share of it  i am glad to hear you say so said the altrurian what is the meaning of this new party in the west that seems to have held a convention lately i read something of it in the train yesterday  oh that is a lot of crazy hayseeds who dont want to pay back the money they have borrowed or who find themselves unable to meet their interest it will soon blow over we are always having these political flurries a good crop will make it all right with them  but is it true that they have to pay such rates of interest as our young friend mentioned  well i said seeing the thing in the humorous light which softens for us americans so many of the hardships of others i suppose that man likes to squeeze his brother man when he gets him in his grip thats human nature you know  is it asked the altrurian  it seemed to me that he had asked something like that before when i alleged human nature in defence of some piece of everyday selfishness but i thought best not to notice it and i went on the land is so rich out there that a farm will often pay for itself with a single crop  is it possible cried the altrurian then i suppose it seldom really happens that a mortgage is foreclosed in the way our young friend insinuated  well i cant say that exactly and having admitted so much i did not feel bound to impart a fact that popped perversely into my mind i was once talking with a western moneylender a very good sort of fellow frank and open as the day i asked him whether the farmers generally paid off their mortgages and he answered me that if the mortgage was to the value of a fourth of the land the farmer might pay it off but if it were to a half or a third even he never paid it but slaved on and died in his debts you may be sure however i concluded that our young friend takes a jaundiced view of the situation  now really said mrs makely i must insist upon dropping this everlasting talk about money i think it is perfectly disgusting and i believe it was mr makelys account of his speculations that kept me awake last night my brain got running on figures till the dark seemed to be all sown with dollarmarks like the stars in the milky way iugh what in the world is it oh you dreadful little things  mrs makely passed swiftly from terror to hysterical laughter as the driver pulled up short and a group of barefooted children broke in front of his horses and scuttled out of the dust into the roadside bushes like a covey of quails there seemed to be a dozen of them nearly all the same in size but there turned out to be only five or six or at least no more showed their gleaming eyes and teeth through the underbrush in quiet enjoyment of the ladys alarm  dont you know that you might have got killed she demanded with that severity good women feel for people who have just escaped with their lives how lovely the dirty little dears are she added in the next wave of emotion one bold fellow of six showed a halflength above the bushes and she asked dont you know that you oughtnt to play in the road when there are so many teams passing are all those your brothers and sisters  he ignored the first question ones my cousin i pulled out a halfdozen coppers and held my hand toward him see if there is one for each they had no difficulty in solving the simple mathematical problem except the smallest girl who cried for fear and baffled longing i tossed the coin to her and a little fat dog darted out at her feet and caught it up in his mouth oh good gracious i called out in my light humorous way do you suppose hes going to spend it for candy the little people thought that a famous joke and they laughed with the gratitude that even small favors inspire bring your sister here i said to the boldest boy and when he came up with the little woman i put another copper into her hand look out that the greedy dog doesnt get it i said and my gayety met with fresh applause where do you live i asked with some vague purpose of showing the altrurian the kindliness that exists between our upper and lower classes  over there said the boy i followed the twist of his head and glimpsed a wooden cottage on the border of the forest so very new that the sheathing had not yet been covered with clapboards i stood up in the buckboard and saw that it was a story and a half high and could have had four or five rooms in it the bare curtainless windows were set in the unpainted frames but the front door seemed not to be hung yet the people meant to winter there however for the sod was banked up against the wooden underpinning a stovepipe stuck out of the roof of a little wing behind while i gazed a younglooking woman came to the door as if she had been drawn by our talk with the children and then she jumped down from the threshold which still wanted a doorstep and came slowly out to us the children ran to her with their coppers and then followed her back to us  mrs makely called to her before she reached us i hope you werent frightened we didnt drive over any of them  oh i wasnt frightened said the young woman its a very safe place to bring up children in the country and i never feel uneasy about them  yes if they are not under the horses feet said mrs makely mingling instruction and amusement very judiciously in her reply are they all yours  only five said the mother and she pointed to the alien in her flock hes my sisters she lives just below here her children had grouped themselves about her and she kept passing her hands caressingly over their little heads as she talked my sister has nine children but she has the rest at church with her today  you dont speak like an american mrs makely suggested  no were english our husbands work in the quarry thats my little palace the woman nodded her head toward the cottage  its going to be very nice said mrs makely with an evident perception of her pride in it  yes if we ever get money to finish it thank you for the children  oh it was this gentleman mrs makely indicated me and i bore the merit of my good action as modestly as i could  then thank you sir said the young woman and she asked mrs makely youre not living about here maam  oh no were staying at the hotel  at the hotel it must be very dear there  yes it is expensive said mrs makely with a note of that satisfaction in her voice which we all feel in spending a great deal of money  but i suppose you can afford it said the woman whose eye was running hungrily over mrs makelys pretty costume some are poor and some are rich thats the way the world has to be made up isnt it  yes said mrs makely very dryly and the talk languished from this point so that the driver felt warranted in starting up his horses when we had driven beyond earshot she said i knew she was not an american as soon as she spoke by her accent and then those foreigners have no selfrespect that was a pretty bold bid for a contribution to finish up her little palace im glad you didnt give her anything mr twelvemough i was afraid your sympathies had been wrought upon  oh not at all i answered i saw the mischief i had done with the children  the altrurian who has not asked anything for a long time but had listened with eager interest to all that passed now came up smiling with his question will you kindly tell me what harm would have been done by offering the woman a little money to help finish up her cottage  i did not allow mrs makely to answer i was so eager to air my political economy the very greatest harm it would have pauperized her you have no idea how quickly they give way to the poison of that sort of thing as soon as they get any sort of help they expect more they count upon it and they begin to live upon it the sight of those coppers which i gave her childrenmore out of joke than charitydemoralized the woman she took us for rich people and wanted us to build her a house you have to guard against every approach to a thing of that sort  i dont believe said mrs makely that an american would have hinted as she did  no an american would not have done that im thankful to say they take fees but they dont ask charity yet we went on to exult in the noble independence of the american character in all classes at some length we talked at the altrurian but he did not seem to hear us at last he asked with a faint sigh then in your conditions a kindly impulse to aid one who needs your help is something to be guarded against as possibly pernicious  exactly i said and now you see what difficulties beset us in dealing with the problem of poverty we cannot let people suffer for that would be cruel and we cannot relieve their need without pauperizing them  i see he answered it is a terrible quandary  i wish said mrs makely that you would tell us just how you manage with the poor in altruria  we have none he replied  but the comparatively pooryou have some people who are richer than others  no we should regard that as the worst incivism  what is incivism  i interpreted bad citizenship  well then if you will excuse me mr homos she said i think that is simply impossible there must be rich and there must be poor there always have been and there always will be that woman said it as well as anybody didnt christ himself say the poor ye have always with you    vii   the altrurian looked at mrs makely with an amazement visibly heightened by the air of complacency she put on after delivering this poser do you really think christ meant that you ought always to have the poor with you he asked  why of course she answered triumphantly how else are the sympathies of the rich to be cultivated the poverty of some and the wealth of others isnt that what forms the great tie of human brotherhood if we were all comfortable or all shared alike there could not be anything like charity and paul said the greatest of these is charity i believe its love in the new version but it comes to the same thing  the altrurian gave a kind of gasp and then lapsed into a silence that lasted until we came in sight of the camp farmhouse it stood on the crest of a roadside upland and looked down the beautiful valley bathed in sabbath sunlight and away to the ranges of hills so far that it was hard to say whether it was sun or shadow that dimmed their distance decidedly the place was what the country people call sightly the old house once painted a brandon red crouched low to the ground with its leanto in the rear and its flatarched woodsheds and wagonhouses stretching away at the side of the barn and covering the approach to it with an unbroken roof there were flowers in the beds along the underpinning of the house which stood close to the street and on one side of the door was a clump of spanish willow an oldfashioned june rose climbed over it from the other an aged dog got stiffly to his feet from the threshold stone and whimpered as our buckboard drew up the poultry picking about the path and among the chips lazily made way for us and as our wheels ceased to crunch upon the gravel we heard hasty steps and reuben camp came round the corner of the house in time to give mrs makely his hand and help her spring to the ground which she did very lightly her remarkable mind had kept her body in a sort of sympathetic activity and at thirtyfive she had the gracile ease and selfcommand of a girl  ah reuben she sighed permitting herself to call him by his first name with the emotion which expressed itself more definitely in the words that followed how i envy you all this dear old homelike place i never come here without thinking of my grandfathers farm in massachusetts where i used to go every summer when i was a little girl if i had a place like this i should never leave it  well mrs makely said young camp you can have this place cheap if you really want it or almost any other place in the neighborhood  dont say such a thing she returned it makes one feel as if the foundations of the great deep were giving way i dont know what that means exactly but i suppose its equivalent to mislaying georges hatchet and going back on the declaration generally and i dont like to hear you talk so  camp seemed to have lost his bitter mood and he answered pleasantly the declaration is all right as far as it goes but it dont help us to compete with the western farm operations  why you believe every one was born free and equal dont you mrs makely asked  oh yes i believe that but  then why do you object to free and equal competition  the young fellow laughed and said as he opened the door for us walk right into the parlor please mother will be ready for you in a minute he added i guess shes putting on her best cap for you mr homos its a great event for her your coming here it is for all of us were glad to have you  and im glad to be here said the altrurian as simply as the other he looked about the best room of a farmhouse that had never adapted itself to the tastes or needs of the city boarder and was as stiffly repellent in its upholstery and as severe in its decoration as haircloth chairs and darkbrown wallpaper of a trellis pattern with drab roses could make it the windows were shut tight and our host did not offer to open them a fly or two crossed the doorway into the hall but made no attempt to penetrate the interior where we sat in an obscurity that left the highhung family photographs on the walls vague and uncertain i made a mental note of it as a place where it would be very characteristic to have a rustic funeral take place and i was pleased to have mrs makely drop into a sort of mortuary murmur as she said i hope your mother is as well as usual this morning i perceived that this murmur was produced by the sepulchral influence of the room  oh yes said camp and at that moment a door opened from the room across the hall and his sister seemed to bring in some of the light from it to us where we sat she shook hands with mrs makely who introduced me to her and then presented the altrurian she bowed very civilly to me but with a touch of severity such as country people find necessary for the assertion of their selfrespect with strangers i thought it very pretty and instantly saw that i could work it into some picture of character and i was not at all sorry that she made a difference in favor of the altrurian  mother will be so glad to see you she said to him and wont you come right in she added to us all  we followed her and found ourselves in a large low sunny room on the southeast corner of the house which had no doubt once been the livingroom but which was now given up to the bedridden invalid a door opened into the kitchen behind where the table was already laid for the midday meal with the plates turned down in the country fashion and some netting drawn over the dishes to keep the flies away  mrs makely bustled up to the bedside with her energetic patronizing cheerfulness ah mrs camp i am glad to see you looking so well this morning ive been meaning to run over for several days past but i couldnt find a moment till this morning and i knew you didnt object to sunday visits she took the invalids hand in hers and with the air of showing how little she felt any inequality between them she leaned over and kissed her where mrs camp sat propped against her pillows she had a large nobly moulded face of rather masculine contour and at the same time the most motherly look in the world mrs makely bubbled and babbled on and every one waited patiently till she had done and turned and said toward the altrurian i have ventured to bring my friend mr homos with me he is from altruria then she turned to me and said mr twelvemough you know already through his delightful books but although she paid me this perfunctory compliment it was perfectly apparent to me that in the esteem of this disingenuous woman the distinguished stranger was a far more important person than the distinguished author whether mrs camp read my perception of this fact in my face or not i cannot say but she was evidently determined that i should not feel a difference in her she held out her hand to me first and said that i never could know how many heavy hours i had helped to lighten for her and then she turned to the altrurian and took his hand oh she said with a long deepdrawn sigh as if that were the supreme moment of her life and are you really from altruria it seems too good to be true her devout look and her earnest tone gave the commonplace words a quality that did not inhere in them but mrs makely took them on their surface  yes doesnt it she made haste to interpose before the altrurian could say anything that is just the way we all feel about it mrs camp i assure you if it were not for the accounts in the papers and the talk about it everywhere i couldnt believe there was any such place as altruria and if it were not for mr twelvemough herewho has to keep all his inventions for his novels as a mere matter of business routinei might really suspect him and mr homos ofwell working us as my husband calls it  the altrurian smiled politely but vaguely as if he had not quite caught her meaning and i made answer for both i am sure mrs makely if you could understand my peculiar state of mind about mr homos you would never believe that i was in collusion with him i find him quite as incredible as you do there are moments when he seems so entirely subjective with me that i feel as if he were no more definite or tangible than a bad conscience  exactly said mrs makely and she laughed out her delight in my illustration  the altrurian must have perceived that we were joking though the camps all remained soberly silent i hope it isnt so bad as that he said though i have noticed that i seem to affect you all with a kind of misgiving i dont know just what it is but if i could remove it i should be very glad to do so  mrs makely very promptly seized her chance well then in the first place my husband and i were talking it over last night after we left you and that was one of the things that kept us awake it turned into money afterward it isnt so much that a whole continent as big as australia remained undiscovered till within such a very few years as it is the condition of things among you this sort of all living for one another and not each one for himself my husband says that is simply moonshine such a thing never was and never can be it is opposed to human nature and would take away incentive and all motive for exertion and advancement and enterprise i dont know what he didnt say against it but one thing he says its perfectly unamerican the altrurian remained silent gravely smiling and mrs makely added with her most engaging little manner i hope you wont feel hurt personally or patriotically by what ive repeated to you i know my husband is awfully philistine though he is such a good fellow and i dont by any means agree with him on all those points but i would like to know what you think of them the trouble is mrs camp she said turning to the invalid that mr homos is so dreadfully reticent about his own country and i am so curious to hear of it at first hands that i consider it justifiable to use any means to make him open up about it  there is no offence the altrurian answered for himself in what mr makely says though from the altrurian point of view there is a good deal of error  does it seem so strange to you he asked addressing himself to mrs camp that people should found a civilization on the idea of living for one another instead of each for himself  no indeed she answered poor people have always had to live that way or they could not have lived at all  that was what i understood your porter to say last night said the altrurian to me he added to the company generally i suppose that even in america there are more poor people than there are rich people  well i dont know about that i said i suppose there are more people independently rich than there are people independently poor  we will let that formulation of it stand if it is true i do not see why the altrurian system should be considered so very unamerican then as to whether there is or ever was really a practical altruism a civic expression of it i think it cannot be denied that among the first christians those who immediately followed christ and might be supposed to be directly influenced by his life there was an altruism practised as radical as that which we have organized into a national polity and a working economy in altruria  ah but you know said mrs makely with the air of advancing a point not to be put aside they had to drop that it was a dead failure they found that they couldnt make it go at all among cultivated people and that if christianity was to advance they would have to give up all that crankish kind of idolatry of the mere letter at any rate she went on with the satisfaction we all feel in getting an opponent into close quarters you must confess that there is a much greater play of individuality here  before the altrurian could reply young camp said if you want to see american individuality the real simonpure article you ought to go down to one of our big factory towns and look at the millhands coming home in droves after a days work young girls and old women boys and men all fluffed over with cotton and so dead tired that they can hardly walk they come shambling along with all the individuality of a flock of sheep  some said mrs makely heroically as if she were one of these must be sacrificed of course some are not so individual as others a great deal depends upon temperament  a great deal more depends upon capital said camp with an offensive laugh if you have capital in america you can have individuality if you havent you cant  his sister who had not taken part in the talk before said demurely it seems to me youve got a good deal of individuality reub and you havent got a great deal of capital either and the two young people laughed together  mrs makely was one of those fatuous women whose eagerness to make a point excludes the consideration even of their own advantage im sure she said as if speaking for the upper classes we havent got any individuality at all we are as like as so many peas or pins in fact you have to be so in society if you keep asserting your own individuality too much people avoid you its very vulgar and the greatest bore  then you dont find individuality so desirable after all said the altrurian  i perfectly detest it cried the lady and evidently she had not the least notion where she was in the argument for my part im never happy except when ive forgotten myself and the whole individual bother  her declaration seemed somehow to close the incident and we were all silent a moment which i employed in looking about the room and taking in with my literary sense the simplicity and even bareness of its furnishing there was the bed where the invalid lay and near the head a table with a pile of books and a kerosenelamp on it and i decided that she was a good deal wakeful and that she read by that lamp when she could not sleep at night then there were the hard chairs we sat on and some homemade hooked rugs in rounds and ovals scattered about the clean floor there was a small melodeon pushed against the wall the windows had paper shades and i recalled that i had not seen any blinds on the outside of the house over the head of the bed hung a cavalrymans sword with its beltthe sword that mrs makely had spoken of it struck me as a room where a great many things might have happened and i said you cant think mrs camp how glad i am to see the inside of your house it seems to me so typical  a pleased intelligence showed itself in her face and she answered yes it is a real oldfashioned farmhouse we have never taken boarders and so we have kept it as it was built pretty much and only made such changes in it as we needed or wanted for ourselves  its a pity i went on following up what i thought a fortunate lead that we city people see so little of the farming life when we come into the country i have been here now for several seasons and this is the first time i have been inside a farmers house  is it possible cried the altrurian with an air of utter astonishment and when i found the fact appeared so singular to him i began to be rather proud of its singularity  yes i suppose that most city people come and go year after year in the country and never make any sort of acquaintance with the people who live there the year round we keep to ourselves in the hotels or if we go out at all it is to make a call upon some city cottager and so we do not get out of the vicious circle of our own overintimacy with ourselves and our ignorance of others  and you regard that as a great misfortune asked the altrurian  why its inevitable there is nothing to bring us together unless its some happy accident like the present but we dont have a traveler from altruria to exploit every day and so we have no business to come into peoples houses  you would have been welcome in ours long ago mr twelvemough said mrs camp  but excuse me said the altrurian what you say really seems dreadful to me why it is as if you were not the same race or kind of men  yes i answered it has sometimes seemed to me as if our big hotel there were a ship anchored off some strange coast the inhabitants come out with supplies and carry on their barter with the ships steward and we sometimes see them over the side but we never speak to them or have anything to do with them we sail away at the close of the season and that is the end of it till next summer  the altrurian turned to mrs camp and how do you look at it how does it seem to you  i dont believe we have thought about it very much but now that mr twelvemough has spoken of it i can see that it does look that way and it seems very strange doesnt it for we are all the same people and have the same language and religion and countrythe country that my husband fought for and i suppose i may say died for he was never the same man after the war it does appear as if we had some interests in common and might find it out if we ever came together  its a great advantage the city people going into the country so much as they do now said mrs makely they bring five million dollars into the state of new hampshire alone every summer  she looked round for the general approval which this fact merited and young camp said and it shows how worthless the natives are that they cant make both ends meet with all that money but have to give up their farms and go west after all i suppose you think it comes from wanting buggies and pianos  well it certainly comes from something said mrs makely with the courage of her convictions  she was evidently not going to be put down by that sour young fellow and i was glad of it though i must say i thought the thing she left to rankle in his mind from our former meeting had not been said in very good taste i thought too that she would not fare best in any encounter of wits with him and i rather trembled for the result i said to relieve the strained situation i wish there was some way of our knowing each other better im sure theres a great deal of goodwill on both sides  no there isnt said camp or at least i can answer for our side that there isnt you come into the country to get as much for your money as you can and we mean to let you have as little as we can thats the whole story and if mr homos believes anything different hes very much mistaken  i hadnt formed any conclusion in regard to the matter which is quite new to me said the altrurian mildly but why is there no basis of mutual kindness between you  because its like everything else with us its a question of supply and demand and there is no room for any mutual kindness in a question of that kind even if there were there is another thing that would kill it the summer folks as we call them look down on the natives as they call us and we know it  now mr camp i am sure that you cannot say i look down on the natives said mrs makely with an air of argument  the young fellow laughed oh yes you do he said not unamiably and he added and youve got the right to were not fit to associate with you and you know it and we know it youve got more money and youve got nicer clothes and youve got prettier manners you talk about things that most natives never heard of and you care for things they never saw i know its the custom to pretend differently but im not going to pretend differently  i recalled what my friend the banker said about throwing away cant and i asked myself if i were in the presence of some such free spirit again i did not see how young camp could afford it but then i reflected that he had really nothing to lose by it for he did not expect to make anything out of us mrs makely would probably not give up his sister as seamstress if the girl continued to work so well and so cheaply as she said  suppose he went on that some old native took you at your word and came to call upon you at the hotel with his wife just as one of the city cottagers would do if he wanted to make your acquaintance  i should be perfectly delighted said mrs makely and i should receive them with the greatest possible cordiality  the same kind of cordiality that you would show to the cottagers  i suppose that i should feel that i had more in common with the cottagers we should be interested in the same things and we should probably know the same people and have more to talk about  you would both belong to the same class and that tells the whole story if you were out west and the owner of one of those big twentythousand acre farms called on you with his wife would you act toward them as you would toward our natives you wouldnt you would all be rich people together and you would understand one another because you had money  now that is not so mrs makely interrupted there are plenty of rich people one wouldnt wish to know at all and who really cant get into societywho are ignorant and vulgar and then when you come to money i dont see but what country people are as glad to get it as anybody  oh gladder said the young man  well demanded mrs makely as if this were a final stroke of logic the young man did not reply and mrs makely continued now i will appeal to your sister to say whether she has ever seen any difference in my manner toward her from what i show to all the young ladies in the hotel the young girl flushed and seemed reluctant to answer why lizzie cried mrs makely and her tone showed that she was really hurt  the scene appeared to me rather cruel and i glanced at mrs camp with an expectation that she would say something to relieve it but she did not her large benevolent face expressed only a quiet interest in the discussion  you know very well mrs makely said the girl you dont regard me as you do the young ladies in the hotel  there was no resentment in her voice or look but only a sort of regret as if but for this grievance she could have loved the woman from whom she had probably had much kindness the tears came into mrs makelys eyes and she turned toward mrs camp and is this the way you all feel toward us she asked  why shouldnt we asked the invalid in her turn but no it isnt the way all the country people feel many of them feel as you would like to have them feel but that is because they do not think when they think they feel as we do but i dont blame you you cant help yourselves any more than we can were all bound up together in that at least  at this apparent relenting mrs makely tricked her beams a little and said plaintively as if offering herself for further condolence yes that is what that woman at the little shanty back there said some have to be rich and some have to be poor it takes all kinds to make a world  how would you like to be one of those that have to be poor asked young camp with an evil grin  i dont know said mrs makely with unexpected spirit but i am sure that i should respect the feelings of all rich or poor  i am sorry if we have hurt yours mrs makely said mrs camp with dignity you asked us certain questions and we thought you wished us to reply truthfully we could not answer you with smooth things  but sometimes you do said mrs makely and the tears stood in her eyes again and you know how fond i am of you all  mrs camp wore a bewildered look perhaps we have said more than we ought but i couldnt help it and i dont see how the children could when you asked them here before mr homos  i glanced at the altrurian sitting attentive and silent and a sudden misgiving crossed my mind concerning him was he really a man a human entity a personality like ourselves or was he merely a sort of spiritual solvent sent for the moment to precipitate whatever sincerity there was in us and show us what the truth was concerning our relations to one another it was a fantastic conception but i thought it was one that i might employ in some sort of purely romantic design and i was professionally grateful for it i said with a humorous gayety yes we all seem to have been compelled to be much more honest than we like and if mr homos is going to write an account of his travels when he gets home he cant accuse us of hypocrisy at any rate and i always used to think it was one of our virtues what with mr camp here and my friend the banker at the hotel i dont think hell have much reason to complain even of our reticence  well whatever he says of us sighed mrs makely with a pious glance at the sword over the bed he will have to say that in spite of our divisions and classes we are all americans and if we havent the same opinions and ideas on minor matters we all have the same country  i dont know about that came from reuben camp with shocking promptness i dont believe we all have the same country america is one thing for you and its quite another thing for us america means ease and comfort and amusement for you year in and year out and if it means work its work that you wish to do for us america means work that we have to do and hard work all the time if were going to make both ends meet it means liberty for you but what liberty has a man got who doesnt know where his next meal is coming from once i was in a strike when i was working on the railroad and ive seen men come and give up their liberty for a chance to earn their familys living they knew they were right and that they ought to have stood up for their rights but they had to lie down and lick the hand that fed them yes we are all americans but i guess we havent all got the same country mrs makely what sort of a country has a blacklisted man got  a blacklisted man she repeated i dont know what you mean  well a kind of man ive seen in the mill towns that the bosses have all got on their books as a man that isnt to be given work on any account thats to be punished with hunger and cold and turned into the street for having offended them and thats to be made to suffer through his helpless family for having offended them  excuse me mr camp i interposed but isnt a blacklisted man usually a man who has made himself prominent in some labor trouble  yes the young fellow answered without seeming sensible of the point i had made  ah i returned then you can hardly blame the employers for taking it out of him in any way they can thats human nature  good heavens the altrurian cried out is it possible that in america it is human nature to take away the bread of a mans family because he has gone counter to your interest or pleasure on some economical question  well mr twelvemough seems to think so sneered the young man but whether its human nature or not its a fact that they do it and you can guess how much a blacklisted man must love the country where such a thing can happen to him what should you call such a thing as blacklisting in altruria  oh yes mrs makely pleaded do let us get him to talking about altruria on any terms i think all this about the labor question is so tiresome dont you mrs camp  mrs camp did not answer but the altrurian said in reply to her son we should have no name for such a thing for with us such a thing would be impossible there is no crime so heinous with us that the punishment would take away the criminals chance of earning his living  oh if he was a criminal said young camp he would be all right here the state would give him a chance to earn his living then  but if he had no other chance of earning his living and had committed no offence against the laws  then the state would let him take to the roadlike that fellow  he pulled aside the shade of the window where he sat and we saw pausing before the house and glancing doubtfully at the doorstep where the dog lay a vile and loathsomelooking tramp a blot upon the sweet and wholesome landscape a scandal to the sacred day his rags burlesqued the form which they did not wholly hide his broken shoes were covered with dust his coarse hair came in a plume through his tattered hat his red sodden face at once fierce and timid was rusty with a fortnights beard he offended the eye like a visible stench and the wretched carrion seemed to shrink away from our gaze as if he were aware of his loathsomeness  really said mrs makely i thought those fellows were arrested now it is too bad to leave them at large they are dangerous young camp left the room and we saw him going out toward the tramp  ah thats quite right said the lady i hope reuben is going to send him about his business why surely hes not going to feed the horrid creature she added as camp after a moments parley with the tramp turned with him and disappeared round a corner of the house now mrs camp i think that is really a very bad example its encouraging them very likely hell go to sleep in your barn and set it on fire with his pipe what do you do with tramps in altruria mr homos  the altrurian seemed not to have heard her he said to mrs camp then i understand from something your son let fall that he has not always been at home with you here does he reconcile himself easily to the country after the excitement of town life i have read that the cities in america are draining the country of the young people  i dont think he was sorry to come home said the mother with a touch of fond pride but there was no choice for him after his father died he was always a good boy and he has not made us feel that we were keeping him away from anything better when his father was alive we let him go because then we were not so dependent and i wished him to try his fortune in the world as all boys long to do but he is rather peculiar and he seems to have got quite enough of the world to be sure i dont suppose hes seen the brightest side of it he first went to work in the mills down at ponkwasset but he was laid off there when the hard times came and there was so much overproduction and he took a job of railroading and was braking on a freighttrain when his father left us  mrs makely said smiling no i dont think that was the brightest outlook in the world no wonder he has brought back such gloomy impressions i am sure that if he could have seen life under brighter auspices he would not have the ideas he has  very likely said the mother dryly our experiences have a great deal to do with forming our opinions but i am not dissatisfied with my sons ideas i suppose reuben got a good many of his ideas from his father hes his father all over again my husband thought slavery was wrong and he went into the war to fight against it he used to say when the war was over that the negroes were emancipated but slavery was not abolished yet  what in the world did he mean by that demanded mrs makely  something you wouldnt understand as we do i tried to carry on the farm after he first went and before reuben was large enough to help me much and ought to be in school and i suppose i overdid at any rate that was when i had my first shock of paralysis i never was very strong and i presume my health was weakened by my teaching school so much and studying before i was married but that doesnt matter now and hasnt for many a year the place was clear of debt then but i had to get a mortgage put on it the savingsbank down in the village took it and weve been paying the interest ever since my husband died paying it and my son will pay it all my life and then i suppose the bank will foreclose the treasurer was an old playmate of my husbands and he said that as long as either of us lived the mortgage could lie  how splendid of him said mrs makely i should think you had been very fortunate  i said that you would not see it as we do said the invalid patiently  the altrurian asked are there mortgages on many of the farms in the neighborhood  nearly all said mrs camp we seem to own them but in fact they own us  mrs makely hastened to say my husband thinks its the best way to have your property if you mortgage it close up you have all your capital free and you can keep turning it over thats what you ought to do mrs camp but what was the slavery that captain camp said was not abolished yet  the invalid looked at her a moment without replying and just then the door of the kitchen opened and young camp came in and began to gather some food from the table on a plate  why dont you bring him to the table reub his sister called to him  oh he says hed rather not come in as long as we have company he says he isnt dressed for dinner left his spiketail in the city  the young man laughed and his sister with him    viii   young camp carried out the plate of victuals to the tramp and mrs makely said to his mother i suppose you would make the tramp do some sort of work to earn his breakfast on weekdays  not always mrs camp replied do the boarders at the hotel always work to earn their breakfast  no certainly not said mrs makely with the sharpness of offence but they always pay for it  i dont think that paying for a thing is earning it perhaps some one else earned the money that pays for it but i believe there is too much work in the world if i were to live my life over again i should not work half so hard my husband and i took this place when we were young married people and began working to pay for it we wanted to feel that it was ours that we owned it and that our children should own it afterward we both worked all day long like slaves and many a moonlight night we were up till morning almost gathering the stones from our fields and burying them in deep graves that we had dug for them but we buried our youth and strength and health in those graves too and what for i dont own the farm that we worked so hard to pay for and my children wont that is what it has all come to we were rightly punished for our greed i suppose perhaps no one has a right to own any portion of the earth sometimes i think so but my husband and i earned this farm and now the savingsbank owns it that seems strange doesnt it i suppose youll say that the bank paid for it well perhaps so but the bank didnt earn it when i think of that i dont always think that a person who pays for his breakfast has the best right to a breakfast  i could see the sophistry of all this but i had not the heart to point it out i felt the pathos of it too mrs makely seemed not to see the one nor to feel the other very distinctly yes but surely she said if you give a tramp his breakfast without making him work for it you must see that it is encouraging idleness and idleness is very corruptingthe sight of it  you mean to the country people well they have to stand a good deal of that the summer folks that spend four or five months of the year here dont seem to do anything from morning till night  ah but you must recollect that they are resting you have no idea how hard they all work in town during the winter mrs makely urged with an air of argument  perhaps the tramps are resting too at any rate i dont think the sight of idleness in rags and begging at back doors is very corrupting to the country people i never heard of a single tramp who had started from the country they all come from the cities its the other kind of idleness that tempts our young people the only tramps that my son says he ever envies are the welldressed strong young fellows from town that go tramping through the mountains for exercise every summer  the ladies both paused they seemed to have got to the end of their tether at least mrs makely had apparently nothing else to advance and i said lightly but that is just the kind of tramps that mr homos would most disapprove of he says that in altruria they would consider exercise for exercise sake a wicked waste of force and little short of lunacy  i thought my exaggeration might provoke him to denial but he seemed not to have found it unjust why you know he said to mrs camp in altruria every one works with his hands so that the hard work shall not all fall to any one class and this manual labor of each is sufficient to keep the body in health as well as to earn a living after the three hours work which constitutes a days work with us is done the young people have all sorts of games and sports and they carry them as late into life as the temperament of each demands but what i was saying to mr twelvemoughperhaps i did not make myself clearwas that we should regard the sterile putting forth of strength in exercise if others were each day worn out with hard manual labor as insane or immoral but i can account for it differently with you because i understand that in your conditions a person of leisure could not do any manual labor without taking away the work of some one who needed it to live by and could not even relieve an overworked laborer and give him the money for the work without teaching him habits of idleness in altruria we can all keep ourselves well by doing each his share of hard work and we can help those who are exhausted when such a thing happens without injuring them materially or morally  young camp entered at this moment and the altrurian hesitated oh do go on mrs makely entreated she added to camp weve got him to talking about altruria at last and we wouldnt have him stopped for worlds  the altrurian looked around at all our faces and no doubt read our eager curiosity in them he smiled and said i shall be very glad im sure but i do not think you will find anything so remarkable in our civilization if you will conceive of it as the outgrowth of the neighborly instinct in fact neighborliness is the essence of altrurianism if you will imagine having the same feeling toward all he explained to mrs makely as you have toward your nextdoor neighbor  my nextdoor neighbor she cried but i dont know the people next door we live in a large apartment house some forty families and i assure you i do not know a soul among them  he looked at her with a puzzled air and she continued sometimes it does seem rather hard one day the people on the same landing with us lost one of their children and i should never have been a whit the wiser if my cook hadnt happened to mention it the servants all know each other they meet in the back elevator and get acquainted i dont encourage it you cant tell what kind of families they belong to  but surely the altrurian persisted you have friends in the city whom you think of as your neighbors  no i cant say that i have said mrs makely i have my visitinglist but i shouldnt think of anybody on that as a neighbor  the altrurian looked so blank and baffled that i could hardly help laughing then i should not know how to explain altruria to you im afraid  well she returned lightly if its anything like neighborliness as ive seen it in small places deliver me from it i like being independent thats why i like the city youre let alone  i was down in new york once and i went through some of the streets and houses where the poor people live said young camp and they seemed to know each other and to be quite neighborly  and would you like to be all messed in with one another that way demanded the lady  well i thought it was better than living as we do in the country so far apart that we never see one another hardly and it seems to me better than not having any neighbors at all  well every one to his taste said mrs makely i wish you would tell us how people manage with you socially mr homos  why you know he began we have neither city nor country in your sense and so we are neither so isolated nor so crowded together you feel that you lose a great deal in not seeing one another oftener he asked camp  yes folks rust out living alone its human nature to want to get together  and i understand mrs makely that it is human nature to want to keep apart  oh no but to come together independently she answered  well that is what we have contrived in our life at home i should have to say in the first place that  excuse me just one moment mr homos said mrs makely this perverse woman was as anxious to hear about altruria as any of us but she was a woman who would rather hear the sound of her own voice than any other even if she were dying as she would call it to hear the other the altrurian stopped politely and mrs makely went on i have been thinking of what mr camp was saying about the blacklisted men and their all turning into tramps  but i didnt say that mrs makely the young fellow protested in astonishment  well it stands to reason that if the tramps have all been blacklisted men  but i didnt say that either  no matter what i am trying to get at is this if a workman has made himself a nuisance to the employers havent they a right to punish him in any way they can  i believe theres no law yet against blacklisting said camp  very well then i dont see what theyve got to complain of the employers surely know their own business  they claim to know the mens too thats what theyre always saying they will manage their own affairs in their own way but no man or company that does business on a large scale has any affairs that are not partly other folks affairs too all the saying in the world wont make it different  very well then said mrs makely with a force of argument which she seemed to think was irresistible i think the workmen had better leave things to the employers and then they wont get blacklisted its as broad as its long  i confess that although i agreed with mrs makely in regard to what the workmen had better do her position had been arrived at by such extraordinary reasoning that i blushed for her at the same time i wanted to laugh she continued triumphantly you see the employers have ever so much more at stake  then men have everything at stakethe work of their hands said the young fellow  oh but surely said mrs makely you wouldnt set that against capital you wouldnt compare the two  yes i should said camp and i could see his eye kindle and his jaw stiffen  then i suppose you would say that a man ought to get as much for his work as an employer gets for his capital if you think one has as much at stake as the other you must think they ought to be paid alike  that is just what i think said camp and mrs makely burst into a peal of amiable laughter  now that is too preposterous  why is it preposterous he demanded with a quivering nostril  why simply because it is said the lady but she did not say why and although i thought so too i was glad she did not attempt to do it for her conclusions seemed to me much better than her reasons  the old wooden clock in the kitchen began to strike and she rose briskly to her feet and went and laid the books she had been holding in her lap on the table beside mrs camps bed we must really be going she said as she leaned over and kissed the invalid it is your dinnertime and we shall barely get back for lunch if we go by the loop road and i want very much to have mr homos see the witchs falls on the way i have got two or three of the books here that mr makely brought me last nighti shant have time to read them at onceand im smuggling in one of mr twelvemoughs that hes too modest to present for himself she turned a gay glance upon me and mrs camp thanked me and a number of civilities followed from all sides in the process of their exchange mrs makelys spirits perceptibly rose and she came away in high goodhumor with the whole camp family well now i am sure she said to the altrurian as we began the long ascent of the loop road you must allow that you have seen some very original characters but how warped people get living alone so much that is the great drawback of the country mrs camp thinks the savingsbank did her a real injury in taking a mortgage on her place and reuben seems to have seen just enough of the outside world to get it all wrong but they are the besthearted creatures in the world and i know you wont misunderstand them that unsparing country bluntnessdont you think its perfectly delightful i do like to stir poor reuben up and get him talking he is a good boy if he is so wrongheaded and hes the most devoted son and brother in the world very few young fellows would waste their lives on an old farm like that i suppose when his mother dies he will marry and strike out for himself in some growing place  he did not seem to think the world held out any very bright inducements for him to leave home the altrurian suggested  oh let him get one of these lively pushing yankee girls for a wife and he will think very differently said mrs makely  the altrurian disappeared that afternoon and i saw little or nothing of him till the next day at supper then he said he had been spending the time with young camp who had shown him something of the farmwork and introduced him to several of the neighbors he was very much interested in it all because at home he was at present engaged in farmwork himself and he was curious to contrast the american and altrurian methods we began to talk of the farming interest again later in the day when the members of our little group came together and i told them what the altrurian had been doing the doctor had been suddenly called back to town but the minister was there and the lawyer and the professor and the banker and the manufacturer  it was the banker who began to comment on what i said and he seemed to be in the frank humor of the saturday night before yes he said its a hard life and they have to look sharp if they expect to make both ends meet i would not like to undertake it myself with their resources  the professor smiled in asking the altrurian did your agricultural friends tell you anything of the little rural traffic in votes that they carry on about election time that is one of the side means they have of making both ends meet  i dont understand said the altrurian  why you know you can buy votes among our virtuous yeomen from two dollars up at the ordinary elections when party feeling runs high and there are vital questions at stake the votes cost more  the altrurian looked round at us all aghast do you mean that americans buy votes  the professor smiled again oh no i only mean that they sell them well i dont wonder that they rather prefer to blink the fact but it is a fact nevertheless and pretty notorious  good heavens cried the altrurian and what defence have they for such treason i dont mean those who sell from what i have seen of the bareness and hardship of their lives i could well imagine that there might sometimes come a pinch when they would be glad of the few dollars that they could get in that way but what have those who buy to say  well said the professor it isnt a transaction thats apt to be talked about much on either side  i think the banker interposed that there is some exaggeration about that business but it certainly exists and i suppose it is a growing evil in the country i fancy it arises somewhat from a want of clear thinking on the subject then there is no doubt but it comes sometimes from poverty a man sells his vote as a woman sells her person for money when neither can turn virtue into cash they feel that they must live and neither of them would be satisfied if dr johnson told them he didnt see the necessity in fact i shouldnt myself if i were in their places you cant have the good of a civilization like ours without having the bad but i am not going to deny that the bad is bad some people like to do that but i dont find my account in it in either case i confess that i think the buyer is worse than the sellerincomparably worse i suppose you are not troubled with either case in altruria  oh no said the altrurian with an utter horror which no repetition of his words can give the sense of it would be unimaginable  still the banker suggested you have cakes and ale and at times the ginger is hot in the mouth  i dont pretend that we have immunity from error but upon such terms as you have described we have none it would be impossible  the altrurians voice expressed no contempt but only a sad patience a melancholy surprise such as a celestial angel might feel in being suddenly confronted with some secret shame and horror of the pit  well said the banker with us the only way is to take the business view and try to strike an average somewhere  talking of business said the professor turning to the manufacturer who had been quietly smoking why dont some of you capitalists take hold of farming here in the east and make a business of it as they do in the west  thank you said the other if you mean me i would rather not invest he was silent a moment and then he went on as if the notion were beginning to win upon him it may come to something like that though if it does the natural course i should think would he through the railroads it would he a very easy matter for them to buy up all the good farms along their lines and put tenants on them and run them in their own interest really it isnt a bad scheme the waste in the present method is enormous and there is no reason why the roads should not own the farms as they are beginning to own the mines they could manage them better than the small farmers do in every way i wonder the thing hasnt occurred to some smart railroad man  we all laughed a little perceiving the semiironical spirit of his talk but the altrurian must have taken it in dead earnest but in that case the number of people thrown out of work would be very great wouldnt it and what would become of them  well they would have whatever their farms brought to make a new start with somewhere else and besides that question of what would become of people thrown out of work by a given improvement is something that capital cannot consider we used to introduce a bit of machinery in the mill every now and then that threw out a dozen or a hundred people but we couldnt stop for that  and you never knew what became of them  sometimes generally not we took it for granted that they would light on their feet somehow  and the statethe whole peoplethe governmentdid nothing for them  if it became a question of the poorhouse yes  or the jail the lawyer suggested  speaking of the poorhouse said the professor did our exemplary rural friends tell you how they sell out their paupers to the lowest bidder and get them boarded sometimes as low as a dollar and a quarter a week  yes young mr camp told me of that he seemed to think it was terrible  did he well im glad to hear that of young mr camp from all that ive been told before he seems to reserve his conscience for the use of capitalists what does he propose to do about it  he seems to think the state ought to find work for them  oh paternalism well i guess the state wont  that was his opinion too  it seems a hard fate said the minister that the only provision the law makes for people who are worn out by sickness or a life of work should be something that assorts them with idiots and lunatics and brings such shame upon them that it is almost as terrible as death  it is the only way to encourage independence and individuality said the professor of course it has its dark side but anything else would be sentimental and unbusinesslike and in fact unamerican  i am not so sure that it would be unchristian the minister timidly ventured in the face of such an authority on political economy  oh as to that i must leave the question to the reverend clergy said the professor  a very unpleasant little silence followed it was broken by the lawyer who put his feet together and after a glance down at them began to say i was very much interested this afternoon by a conversation i had with some of the young fellows in the hotel you know most of them are graduates and they are taking a sort of supernumerary vacation this summer before they plunge into the battle of life in the autumn they were talking of some other fellows classmates of theirs who were not so lucky but had been obliged to begin the fight at once it seems that our fellows here are all going in for some sort of profession medicine or law or engineering or teaching or the church and they were commiserating those other fellows not only because they were not having the supernumerary vacation but because they were going into business that struck me as rather odd and i tried to find out what it meant and as nearly as i could find out it meant that most college graduates would not go into business if they could help it they seemed to feel a sort of incongruity between their education and the business life they pitied the fellows that had to go in for it and apparently the fellows that had to go in for it pitied themselves for the talk seemed to have begun about a letter that one of the chaps here had got from poor jack or jim somebody who had been obliged to go into his fathers business and was groaning over it the fellows who were going to study professions were hugging themselves at the contrast between their fate and his and were making remarks about business that were to say the least unbusinesslike a few years ago we should have made a summary disposition of the matter and i believe some of the newspapers still are in doubt about the value of a college education to men who have got to make their way what do you think  the lawyer addressed his question to the manufacturer who answered with a comfortable satisfaction that he did not think those young men if they went into business would find that they knew too much  but they pointed out said the lawyer that the great american fortunes had been made by men who had never had their educational advantages and they seemed to think that what we call the education of a gentleman was a little too good for moneymaking purposes  well said the other they can console themselves with the reflection that going into business isnt necessarily making money it isnt necessarily making a living even  some of them seem to have caught on to that fact and they pitied jack or jim partly because the chances were so much against him but they pitied him mostly because in the life before him he would have no use for his academic training and he had better not gone to college at all they said he would be none the better for it and would always be miserable when he looked back to it  the manufacturer did not reply and the professor after a preliminary hemming held his peace it was the banker who took the word well so far as business is concerned they were right it is no use to pretend that there is any relation between business and the higher education there is no business man who will pretend that there is not often an actual incompatibility if he is honest i know that when we get together at a commercial or financial dinner we talk as if great merchants and great financiers were beneficent geniuses who evoked the prosperity of mankind by their schemes from the conditions that would otherwise have remained barren well very likely they are but we must all confess that they do not know it at the time what they are consciously looking out for then is the main chance if general prosperity follows all well and good they are willing to be given the credit for it but as i said with business as business the education of a gentleman has nothing to do that education is always putting the old ciceronian question whether the fellow arriving at a starving city with a cargo of grain is bound to tell the people before he squeezes them that there are half a dozen other fellows with grain just below the horizon as a gentleman he would have to tell them because he could not take advantage of their necessities but as a business man he would think it bad business to tell them or no business at all the principle goes all through i say business is business and i am not going to pretend that business will ever be anything else in our business battles we dont take off our hats to the other side and say gentlemen of the french guard have the goodness to fire that may be war but it is not business we seize all the advantages we can very few of us would actually deceive but if a fellow believes a thing and we know he is wrong we do not usually take the trouble to set him right if we are going to lose anything by undeceiving him that would not be business i suppose you think that is dreadful he turned smilingly to the minister  i wishi wish said the minister gently it could be otherwise  well i wish so too returned the banker but it isnt am i right or am i wrong he demanded of the manufacturer who laughed  i am not conducting this discussion i will not deprive you of the floor  what you say i ventured to put in reminds me of the experience of a friend of mine a brother novelist he wrote a story where the failure of a business man turned on a point just like that you have instanced the man could have retrieved himself if he had let some people believe that what was so was not so but his conscience stepped in and obliged him to own the truth there was a good deal of talk about the case i suppose because it was not in real life and my friend heard divers criticisms he heard of a group of ministers who blamed him for exalting a case of common honesty as if it were something extraordinary and he heard of some business men who talked it over and said he had worked the case up splendidly but he was all wrong in the outcomethe fellow would never have told the other fellows they said it would not have been business  we all laughed except the minister and the altrurian the manufacturer said twentyfive years hence the fellow who is going into business may pity the fellows who are pitying him for his hard fate now  very possibly but not necessarily said the banker of course the business man is on top as far as money goes he is the fellow who makes the big fortunes the millionaire lawyers and doctors and ministers are exceptional but his risks are tremendous ninetyfive times out of a hundred he fails to be sure he picks up and goes on but he seldom gets there after all  then in your system said the altrurian the great majority of those who go into what you call the battle of life are defeated  the killed wounded and missing sum up a frightful total the banker admitted but whatever the end is there is a great deal of prosperity on the way the statistics are correct but they do not tell the whole truth it is not so bad as it seems still simply looking at the material chances i dont blame those young fellows for not wanting to go into business and when you come to other considerations we used to cut the knot of the difficulty pretty sharply we said a college education was wrong or the hot and hot american spreadeaglers did business is the national ideal and the successful business man is the american type it is a business mans country  then if i understand you said the altrurian and i am very anxious to have a clear understanding of the matter the effect of the university with you is to unfit a youth for business life  oh no it may give him great advantages in it and that is the theory and expectation of most fathers who send their sons to the university but undoubtedly the effect is to render business life distasteful the university nurtures all sorts of lofty ideals which business has no use for  then the effect is undemocratic  no it is simply unbusinesslike the boy is a better democrat when he leaves college than he will be later if he goes into business the university has taught him and equipped him to use his own gifts and powers for his advancement but the first lesson of business and the last is to use other mens gifts and powers if he looks about him at all he sees that no man gets rich simply by his own labor no matter how mighty a genius he is and that if you want to get rich you must make other men work for you and pay you for the privilege of doing so isnt that true  the banker turned to the manufacturer with this question and the other said the theory is that we give people work and they both laughed  the minister said i believe that in altruria no man works for the profit of another  no each works for the profit of all replied the altrurian  well said the banker you seem to have made it go nobody can deny that but we couldnt make it go here  why i am very curious to know why our system seems so impossible to you  well it is contrary to the american spirit it is alien to our love of individuality  but we prize individuality too and we think we secure it under our system under yours it seems to me that while the individuality of the man who makes other men work for him is safe except from itself the individuality of the workers  well that is their lookout we have found that upon the whole it is best to let every man look out for himself i know that in a certain light the result has an ugly aspect but nevertheless in spite of all the country is enormously prosperous the pursuit of happiness which is one of the inalienable rights secured to us by the declaration is and always has been a dream but the pursuit of the dollar yields tangible proceeds and we get a good deal of excitement out of it as it goes on you cant deny that we are the richest nation in the world do you call altruria a rich country  i could not quite make out whether the banker was serious or not in all this talk sometimes i suspected him of a fine mockery but the altrurian took him upon the surface of his words  i hardly know whether it is or not the question of wealth does not enter into our scheme i can say that we all have enough and that no one is even in the fear of want  yes that is very well but we should think it was paying too much for it if we had to give up the hope of ever having more than we wanted and at this point the banker uttered his jolly laugh and i perceived that he had been trying to draw the altrurian out and practise upon his patriotism it was a great relief to find that he had been joking in so much that seemed a dead giveaway of our economical position in altruria he asked who is your ideal great man i dont mean personally but abstractly  the altrurian thought a moment with us there is so little ambition for distinction as you understand it that your question is hard to answer but i should say speaking largely that it was some man who had been able for the time being to give the greatest happiness to the greatest number some artist or poet or inventor or physician  i was somewhat surprised to have the banker take this preposterous statement seriously respectfully well that is quite conceivable with your system what should you say he demanded of the rest of us generally was our ideal of greatness  no one replied at once or at all till the manufacturer said we will let you continue to run it  well it is a very curious inquiry and i have thought it over a good deal i should say that within a generation our ideal has changed twice before the war and during all the time from the revolution onward it was undoubtedly the great politician the publicist the statesman as we grew older and began to have an intellectual life of our own i think the literary fellows had a pretty good share of the honors that were going that is such a man as longfellow was popularly considered a type of greatness when the war came it brought the soldier to the front and there was a period of ten or fifteen years when he dominated the national imagination that period passed and the great era of material prosperity set in the big fortunes began to tower up and heroes of another sort began to appeal to our admiration i dont think there is any doubt but the millionaire is now the american ideal it isnt very pleasant to think so even for people who have got on but it cant very hopefully be denied it is the man with the most money who now takes the prize in our national cakewalk  the altrurian turned curiously toward me and i did my best to tell him what a cakewalk was when i had finished the banker resumed only to say as he rose from his chair to bid us goodnight in any average assembly of americans the greatest millionaire would take the eyes of all from the greatest statesman the greatest poet or the greatest soldier we ever had that he added to the altrurian will account to you for many things as you travel through our country    ix   the next time the members of our little group came together the manufacturer began at once upon the banker  i should think that our friend the professor here would hardly like that notion of yours that business as business has nothing to do with the education of a gentleman if this is a business mans country and if the professor has nothing in stock but the sort of education that business has no use for i should suppose that he would want to go into some other line  the banker mutely referred the matter to the professor who said with that cold grin of his which i hated  perhaps we shall wait for business to purge and live cleanly then it will have some use for the education of a gentleman  i see said the banker that i have touched the quick in both of you when i hadnt the least notion of doing so but i shouldnt really like to prophesy which will adapt itself to the othereducation or business let us hope there will be mutual concessions there are some pessimists who say that business methods especially on the large scale of the trusts and combinations have grown worse instead of better but this may be merely what is called a transition state hamlet must be cruel to be kind the darkest hour comes before dawnand so on perhaps when business gets the whole affair of life into its hands and runs the republic as its enemies now accuse it of doing the process of purging and living cleanly will begin i have known lots of fellows who started in life rather scampishly but when they felt secure of themselves and believed that they could afford to be honest they became so theres no reason why the same thing shouldnt happen on a large scale we must never forget that we are still a very novel experiment though we have matured so rapidly in some respects that we have come to regard ourselves as an accomplished fact we are really less so than we were forty years ago with all the tremendous changes since the war before that we could take certain matters for granted if a man got out of work he turned his hand to something else if a man failed in business he started in again from some other direction as a last resort in both cases he went west preempted a quartersection of public land and grew up with the country now the country is grown up the public land is gone business is full on all sides and the hand that turned itself to something else has lost its cunning the struggle for life has changed from a freefight to an encounter of disciplined forces and the freefighters that are left get ground to pieces between organized labor and organized capital decidedly we are in a transition state and if the higher education tried to adapt itself to business needs there are chances that it might sacrifice itself without helping business after all how much education does business need were our great fortunes made by educated men or men of university training i dont know but these young fellows are right about that  yes that may all be i put in but it seems to me that you give mr homos somehow a wrong impression of our economic life by your generalizations you are a harvard man yourself  yes and i am not a rich man a million or two more or less but what is that i have suffered at the start and all along from the question as to what a man with the education of a gentleman ought to do in such and such a juncture the fellows who have not that sort of education have not that sort of question and they go in and win  so you admit then said the professor that the higher education elevates a business mans standard of morals  undoubtedly that is one of its chief drawbacks said the banker with a laugh  well i said with the deference due even to a man who had only a million or two more or less we must allow you to say such things but if the case is so bad with the business men who have made the great fortunesthe business men who have never had the disadvantage of a university educationi wish you would explain to mr homos why in every public exigency we instinctively appeal to the business sense of the community as if it were the fountain of wisdom probity and equity suppose there were some question of vital interesti wont say financial but political or moral or socialon which it was necessary to rouse public opinion what would be the first thing to do to call a meeting over the signatures of the leading business men because no other names appeal with such force to the public you might get up a call signed by all the novelists artists ministers lawyers and doctors in the state and it would not have a tithe of the effect with the people at large that a call signed by a few leading merchants bank presidents railroad men and trust officers would have what is the reason it seems strange that i should be asking you to defend yourself against yourself  not at all my dear fellow not at all the banker replied with his caressing bonhomie though i will confess to begin with that i do not expect to answer your question to your entire satisfaction i can only do my beston the instalment plan  he turned to the altrurian and then went on as i said the other night this is a business mans country we are a purely commercial people money is absolutely to the fore and business which is the means of getting the most money is the american ideal if you like you may call it the american fetish i dont mind calling it so myself the fact that business is our ideal or our fetish will account for the popular faith in business men who form its priesthood its hierarchy i dont know myself any other reason for regarding business men as solider than novelists or artists or ministers not to mention lawyers and doctors they are supposed to have long heads but it appears that ninetyfive times out of a hundred they havent they are supposed to be very reliable but it is almost invariably a business man of some sort who gets out to canada while the state examiner is balancing his books and it is usually the longest headed business men who get plundered by him no it is simply because business is our national ideal that the business man is honored above all other men among us in the aristocratic countries they forward a public object under the patronage of the nobility and gentry in a plutocratic country they get the business men to indorse it i suppose that the average american citizen feels that they wouldnt indorse a thing unless it was safe and the average american citizen likes to be safehe is cautious as a matter of fact business men are always taking risks and business is a game of chance in a certain degree have i made myself intelligible  entirely so said the altrurian and he seemed so thoroughly well satisfied that he forbore asking any further question  no one else spoke the banker lighted a cigar and resumed at the point where he left off when i ventured to enter upon the defence of his class with him i must say that he had not convinced me at all at that moment i would rather have trusted him in any serious matter of practical concern than all the novelists i ever heard of but i thought i would leave the word to him without further attempt to reinstate him in his selfesteem in fact he seemed to be getting along very well without it or else he was feeling that mysterious control from the altrurian which i had already suspected him of using voluntarily or involuntarily the banker proceeded with his contribution to the altrurians stock of knowledge concerning our civilization  i dont believe however that the higher education is any more of a failure as a provision for a business career than the lower education is for the life of labor i suppose that the hypercritical observer might say that in a wholly commercial civilization like ours the business man really needed nothing beyond the three rs and the workingman needed no r at all as a practical affair there is a good deal to be said in favor of that view the higher education is part of the social ideal which we have derived from the past from europe it is part of the provision for the life of leisure the life of the aristocrat which nobody of our generation leads except women our women really have some use for the education of a gentleman but our men have none how will that do for a generalization the banker asked of me  oh i admitted with a laugh it is a good deal like one of my own i have always been struck with that phase of our civilization  well then the banker resumed take the lower education that is part of the civic ideal which i suppose i may say we evolved from the depths of our inner consciousness of what an american citizen ought to be it includes instruction in all the rs and in several other letters of the alphabet it is given free by the state and no one can deny that it is thoroughly socialistic in conception and application  distinctly so said the professor now that the textbooks are furnished by the state we have only to go a step further and provide a good hot lunch for the children every day as they do in paris  well the banker returned i dont know that i should have much to say against that it seems as reasonable as anything in the system of education which we force upon the working classes they know perfectly well whether we do or not that the three rs will not make their children better mechanics or laborers and that if the fight for a mere living is to go on from generation to generation they will have no leisure to apply the little learning they get in the public schools for their personal culture in the mean time we deprive the parents of their childrens labor in order that they may be better citizens for their schooling as we imagine i dont know whether they are or not we offer them no sort of compensation for their time and i think we ought to feel obliged to them for not wanting wages for their children while we are teaching them to be better citizens  you know said the professor that has been suggested by some of their leaders  no really well that is too good the banker threw back his head and roared and we all laughed with him when we had sobered down again he said i suppose that when a workingman makes all the use he can of his lower education he becomes a business man and then he doesnt need the higher professor you seem to be left out in the cold by our system whichever way you take it  oh said the professor the law of supply and demand works both ways it creates the demand if the supply comes first and if we keep on giving the sons of business men the education of a gentleman we may yet make them feel the need of it we shall evolve a new sort of business man  the sort that cant make money or wouldnt exactly like to on some terms asked the banker well perhaps we shall work out our democratic salvation in that way when you have educated your new business man to the point where he cant consent to get rich at the obvious cost of others youve got him on the way back to work with his hands he will sink into the ranks of labor and give the fellow with the lower education a chance ive no doubt hell take it i dont know but youre right professor  the lawyer had not spoken as yet now he said then it is education after all that is to bridge the chasm between the classes and the masses though it seems destined to go a long way around about it there was a time i believe when we expected religion to do that  well it may still be doing it for all i know said the banker what do you say he asked turning to the minister you ought to be able to give us some statistics on the subject with that large congregation of yours you preach to more people than any other pulpit in your city  the banker named one of the principal cities in the east and the minister answered with modest pride i am not sure of that but our society is certainly a very large one  well and how many of the lower classes are there in itpeople who work for their living with their hands  the minister stirred uneasily in his chair and at last he said with evident unhappiness theyi supposethey have their own churches i have never thought that such a separation of the classes was right and i have had some of the very best peoplesocially and financiallywith me in the wish that there might be more brotherliness between the rich and poor among us but as yet  he stopped the banker pursued do you mean there are no workingpeople in your congregation  i cannot think of any returned the minister so miserably that the banker forbore to press the point  the lawyer broke the awkward pause which followed i have heard it asserted that there is no country in the world where the separation of the classes is so absolute as in ours in fact i once heard a russian revolutionist who had lived in exile all over europe say that he had never seen anywhere such a want of kindness or sympathy between rich and poor as he had observed in america i doubted whether he was right but he believed that if it ever came to the industrial revolution with us the fight would be more uncompromising than any such fight that the world had ever seen there was no respect from low to high he said and no consideration from high to low as there were in countries with traditions and old associations  well said the banker there may be something in that certainly so far as the two forces have come into conflict here there has been no disposition on either side to make war with the water of roses its astonishing in fact to see how ruthless the fellows who have just got up are toward the fellows who are still down and the best of us have been up only a generation or twoand the fellows who are still down know it  and what do you think would be the outcome of such a conflict i asked with my soul divided between fear of it and the perception of its excellence as material my fancy vividly sketched the outline of a story which should forecast the struggle and its event somewhat on the plan of the battle of dorking  we should beat said the banker breaking his cigarash off with his little finger and i instantly cast him with his ironic calm for the part of a great patrician leader in my fall of the republic of course i disguised him somewhat and travestied his worldly bonhomie with the bluff sangfroid of the soldier these things are easily done  what makes you think we should beat asked the manufacturer with a certain curiosity  well all the good jingo reasons we have got the materials for beating those fellows throw away their strength whenever they begin to fight and theyve been so badly generalled up to the present time that they have wanted to fight at the outset of every quarrel they have been beaten in every quarrel but still they always want to begin by fighting that is all right when they have learned enough to begin by voting then we shall have to look out but if they keep on fighting and always putting themselves in the wrong and getting the worst of it perhaps we can fix the voting so we neednt be any more afraid of that than we are of the fighting its astonishing how shortsighted they are they have no conception of any cure for their grievances except more wages and fewer hours  but i asked do you really think they have any just grievances  of course not as a business man said the banker if i were a workingman i should probably think differently but we will suppose for the sake of argument that their day is too long and their pay is too short how do they go about to better themselves they strike well a strike is a fight and in a fight nowadays it is always skill and money that win the workingmen cant stop till they have put themselves outside of the public sympathy which the newspapers say is so potent in their behalf i never saw that it did them the least good they begin by boycotting and breaking the heads of the men who want to work they destroy property and they interfere with businessthe two absolutely sacred things in the american religion then we call out the militia and shoot a few of them and their leaders declare the strike off it is perfectly simple  but will it be quite as simple i asked reluctant in behalf of my projected romance to have the matter so soon disposed ofwill it be quite so simple if their leaders ever persuade the workingmen to leave the militia as they threaten to do from time to time  no not quite so simple the banker admitted still the fight would be comparatively simple in the first place i doubtthough i wont be certain about itwhether there are a great many workingmen in the militia now i rather fancy it is made up for the most part of clerks and small tradesmen and bookkeepers and such employés of business as have time and money for it i may be mistaken  no one seemed able to say whether he was mistaken or not and after waiting a moment he proceeded i feel pretty sure that it is so in the city companies and regiments at any rate and that if every workingman left them it would not seriously impair their effectiveness but when the workingmen have left the militia what have they done they have eliminated the only thing that disqualifies it for prompt and unsparing use against strikers as long as they are in it we might have our misgivings but if they were once out of it we should have none and what would they gain they would not be allowed to arm and organize as an inimical force that was settled once for all in chicago in the case of the international groups a few squads of policemen would break them up why the banker exclaimed with his goodhumored laugh how preposterous they are when you come to look at it they are in the majority the immense majority if you count the farmers and they prefer to behave as if they were the hopeless minority they say they want an eighthour law and every now and then they strike and try to fight it why dont they vote it they could make it the law in six months by such overwhelming numbers that no one would dare to evade or defy it they can make any law they want but they prefer to break such laws as we have that alienates public sympathy the newspapers say but the spectacle of their stupidity and helpless wilfulness is so lamentable that i could almost pity them if they chose it would take only a few years to transform our government into the likeness of anything they wanted but they would rather not have what they want apparently if they can only keep themselves from getting it and they have to work hard to do that  i suppose i said that they are misled by the unamerican principles and methods of the socialists among them  why no returned the banker i shouldnt say that as far as i understand it the socialists are the only fellows among them who propose to vote their ideas into laws and nothing can be more american than that i dont believe the socialists stir up the strikesat least among our workingmen though the newspapers convict them of it generally without trying them the socialists seem to accept the strikes as the inevitable outcome of the situation and they make use of them as proofs of the industrial discontent but luckily for the status our labor leaders are not socialists for your socialist whatever you may say against him has generally thought himself into a socialist he knows that until the workingmen stop fighting and get down to votinguntil they consent to be the majoritythere is no hope for them i am not talking of anarchists mind you but of socialists whose philosophy is more law not less and who look forward to an order so just that it cant be disturbed  and what the minister faintly said do you think will be the outcome of it all  we had that question the other night didnt we our legal friend here seemed to feel that we might rub along indefinitely as we are doing or work out an altruria of our own or go back to the patriarchal stage and own our workingmen he seemed not to have so much faith in the logic of events as i have i doubt if it is altogether a womans logic parole femmine fatti maschi and the logic of events isnt altogether words its full of hard knocks too but im no prophet i cant forecast the future i prefer to take it as it comes theres a little tract of william morriss thoughi forget just what he calls itthat is full of curious and interesting speculation on this point he thinks that if we keep the road we are now going the last state of labor will be like its first and it will be owned  oh i dont believe that will ever happen in america i protested  why not asked the banker practically it is owned already in a vastly greater measure than we recognize and where would the great harm be the new slavery would not be like the old there neednt be irresponsible whipping and separation of families and private buying and selling the proletariate would probably be owned by the state as it was at one time in greece or by large corporations which would be much more in keeping with the genius of our free institutions and an enlightened public opinion would cast safeguards about it in the form of law to guard it from abuse but it would be strictly policed localized and controlled there would probably be less suffering than there is now when a man may be cowed into submission to any terms through the suffering of his family when he may be starved out and turned out if he is unruly you may be sure that nothing of that kind would happen in the new slavery we have not had nineteen hundred years of christianity for nothing  the banker paused and as the silence continued he broke it with a laugh which was a prodigious relief to my feelings and i suppose to the feelings of all i perceived that he had been joking and i was confirmed in this when he turned to the altrurian and laid his hand upon his shoulder you see he said im a kind of altrurian myself what is the reason why we should not found a new altruria here on the lines ive drawn have you never had philosopherswell call them philanthropists i dont mindof my way of thinking among you  oh yes said the altrurian at one time just before we emerged from the competitive conditions there was much serious question whether capital should not own labor instead of labor owning capital that was many hundred years ago  i am proud to find myself such an advanced thinker said the banker and how came you to decide that labor should own capital  we voted it answered the altrurian  well said the banker our fellows are still fighting it and getting beaten  i found him later in the evening talking with mrs makely my dear sir i said i liked your frankness with my altrurian friend immensely and it may be well to put the worst foot foremost but what is the advantage of not leaving us a leg to stand upon  he was not in the least offended at my boldness as i had feared he might be but he said with that jolly laugh of his capital well perhaps i have worked my candor a little too hard i suppose there is such a thing but dont you see that it leaves me in the best possible position to carry the war into altruria when we get him to open up about his native land  ah if you can get him to do it  well we were just talking about that mrs makely has a plan  yes said the lady turning an empty chair near her own toward me sit down and listen    x   i sat down and mrs makely continued i have thought it all out and i want you to confess that in all practical matters a womans brain is better than a mans mr bullion here says it is and i want you to say so too  yes the banker admitted when it comes down to business a woman is worth any two of us  and we have just been agreeing i coincided that the only gentlemen among us are women mrs makely i admit without further dispute that the most unworldly woman is worldlier than the worldliest man and that in all practical matters we fade into dreamers and doctrinaires beside you now go on  but she did not mean to let me off so easily she began to brag herself up as women do whenever you make them the slightest concession  here you men she said have been trying for a whole week to get something out of mr homos about his country and you have left it to a poor weak woman at last to think how to manage it i do believe that you get so much interested in your own talk when you are with him that you dont let him get in a word and thats the reason you havent found out anything about altruria yet from him  in view of the manner in which she had cut in at mrs camps and stopped homos on the very verge of the only full and free confession he had ever been near making about altruria i thought this was pretty cool but for fear of worse i said  youre quite right mrs makely im sorry to say that there has been a shameful want of selfcontrol among us and that if we learn anything at all from him it will be because you have taught us how  she could not resist this bit of taffy she scarcely gave herself time to gulp it before she said  oh its very well to say that now but where would you have been if i hadnt set my wits to work now listen it just popped into my mind like an inspiration when i was thinking of something altogether different it flashed upon me in an instant a good object and a public occasion  well i said finding this explosion and electrical inspiration rather enigmatical  why you know the union chapel over in the village is in a languishing condition and the ladies have been talking all summer about doing something for it getting up somethinga concert or theatricals or a dance or somethingand applying the proceeds to repainting and papering the visible church it needs it dreadfully but of course those things are not exactly religious dont you know and a fair is so much trouble and such a bore when you get the articles ready even and everybody feels swindled and now people frown on raffles so there is no use thinking of them what you want is something striking we did think of a parlorreading or perhaps ventriloquism but the performers all charge so much that there wouldnt be anything left after paying expenses  she seemed to expect some sort of prompting at this point so i said well  well she repeated that is just where your mr homos comes in  oh how does he come in there  why get him to deliver a talk on altruria as soon as he knows its for a good object he will be on fire to do it and they must live so much in common there that the public occasion will be just the thing that will appeal to him  it did seem a good plan to me and i said so but mrs makely was so much in love with it that she was not satisfied with my modest recognition  good its magnificent its the very thing and i have thought it out down to the last detail  excuse me i interrupted do you think there is sufficient general interest in the subject outside of the hotel to get a full house for him i shouldnt like to see him subjected to the mortification of empty benches  what in the world are you thinking of why there isnt a farmhouse anywhere within ten miles where they havent heard of mr homos and there isnt a servant under this roof or in any of the boardinghouses who doesnt know something about altruria and want to know more it seems that your friend has been much oftener with the porters and the stableboys than he has been with us  i had only too great reason to fear so in spite of my warnings and entreaties he had continued to behave toward every human being he met exactly as if they were equals he apparently could not conceive of that social difference which difference of occupation creates among us he owned that he saw it and from the talk of our little group he knew it existed but when i expostulated with him upon some act in gross violation of society usage he only answered that he could not imagine that what he saw and knew could actually be it was quite impossible to keep him from bowing with the greatest deference to our waitress he shook hands with the headwaiter every morning as well as with me there was a fearful story current in the house that he had been seen running down one of the corridors to relieve a chambermaid laden with two heavy waterpails which she was carrying to the rooms to fill up the pitchers this was probably not true but i myself saw him helping in the hotel hayfield one afternoon shirtsleeved like any of the hired men he said that it was the best possible exercise and that he was ashamed he could give no better excuse for it than the fact that without something of the kind he should suffer from indigestion it was grotesque and out of all keeping with a man of his cultivation and breeding he was a gentleman and a scholar there was no denying and yet he did things in contravention of good form at every opportunity and nothing i could say had any effect with him i was perplexed beyond measure the day after i had reproached him for his labor in the hayfield to find him in a group of tablegirls who were listening while the headwaiter read aloud to them in the shade of the house there was a corner looking toward the stables which was given up to them by tacit consent of the guests during a certain part of the afternoon  i feigned not to see him but i could not forbear speaking to him about it afterward he took it in good part but he said he had been rather disappointed in the kind of literature they liked and the comments they made on it he had expected that with the education they had received and with their experience of the seriousness of life they would prefer something less trivial he supposed however that a romantic lovestory where a poor american girl marries an english lord formed a refuge for them from the real world which promised them so little and held them so cheap it was quite useless for one to try to make him realize his behavior in consorting with servants as a kind of scandal  the worst of it was that his behavior as i could see had already begun to demoralize the objects of his misplaced politeness at first the servants stared and resented it as if it were some tasteless joke but in an incredibly short time when they saw that he meant his courtesy in good faith they took it as their due i had always had a good understanding with the headwaiter and i thought i could safely smile with him at the queer conduct of my friend toward himself and his fellowservants to my astonishment he said i dont see why he shouldnt treat them as if they were ladies and gentlemen doesnt he treat you and your friends so  it was impossible to answer this and i could only suffer in silence and hope the altrurian would soon go i had dreaded the moment when the landlord should tell me that his room was wanted now i almost desired it but he never did on the contrary the altrurian was in high favor with him he said he liked to see a man make himself pleasant with everybody and that he did not believe he had ever had a guest in the house who was so popular all round  of course mrs makely went on i dont criticise himwith his peculiar traditions i presume i should be just so myself if i had been brought up in altruria which thank goodness i wasnt but mr homos is a perfect dear and all the women in the house are in love with him from the cooks helpers up and down no the only danger is that there wont be room in the hotel parlors for all the people that will want to hear him and we shall have to make the admission something that will be prohibitive in most cases we shall have to make it a dollar  well i said i think that will settle the question as far as the farming population is concerned its twice as much as they ever pay for a reserved seat in the circus and four times as much as a simple admission im afraid mrs makely youre going to be very few though fit  well ive thought it all over and im going to put the tickets at one dollar  very good have you caught your hare  no i havent yet and i want you to help me catch him what do you think is the best way to go about it  the banker said he would leave us to the discussion of that question but mrs makely could count upon him in everything if she could only get the man to talk at the end of our conference we decided to interview the altrurian together  i shall always be ashamed of the way that woman wheedled the altrurian when we found him the next morning walking up and down the piazza before breakfastthat is it was before our breakfast when we asked him to go in with us he said he had just had his breakfast and was waiting for reuben camp who had promised to take him up as he passed with a load of hay for one of the hotels in the village  ah that reminds me mr homos the unscrupulous woman began on him at once we want to interest you in a little movement were getting up for the union chapel in the village you know its the church where all the different sects have their services alternately of course its rather an original way of doing but there is sense in it where the people are too poor to go into debt for different churches and  its admirable said the altrurian i have heard about it from the camps it is an emblem of the unity which ought to prevail among christians of all professions how can i help you mrs makely  i knew you would approve of it she exulted well its simply this the poor little place has got so shabby that im almost ashamed to be seen going into it for one and want to raise money enough to give it a new coat of paint outside and put on some kind of pretty paper of an ecclesiastical pattern on the inside i declare those staring white walls with the cracks in the plastering zigzagging every which way distract me so that i cant put my mind on the sermon dont you think that paper say of a gothic design would be a great improvement im sure it would and its mr twelvemoughs idea too  i learned this fact now for the first time but with mrs makelys warning eye upon me i could not say so and i made what sounded to me like a gothic murmur of acquiescence it sufficed for mrs makelys purpose at any rate and she went on without giving the altrurian a chance to say what he thought the educational effect of wallpaper would be  well the long and short of it is that we want you to make this money for us mr homos  i he started in a kind of horror my dear lady i never made any money in my life i should think it wrong to make money  in altruria yes we all know how it is in your delightful country and i assure you that no one could respect your conscientious scruples more than i do but you must remember that you are in america now in america you have to make money or elseget left and then you must consider the object and all the good you can do indirectly by a little talk on altruria  he answered blandly a little talk on altruria how in the world should i get money by that  she was only too eager to explain and she did it with so much volubility and at such great length that i who am good for nothing till i have had my cup of coffee in the morning almost perished of an elucidation which the altrurian bore with the sweetest patience  when she gave him a chance to answer at last he said i shall be very happy to do what you wish madam  will you she screamed oh im so glad you have been so slippery about altruria you know that i expected nothing but a pointblank refusal of course i knew you would be kind about it oh i can hardly believe my senses you cant think what a dear you are i knew she had got that word from some english people who had been in the hotel and she was working it rather wildly but it was not my business to check her well then all you have got to do is to leave the whole thing to me and not bother about it a bit till i send and tell you we are ready to listen there comes reuben with his oxteam thank you so much mr homos no one need be ashamed to enter the house of godshe said gawd in an access of pietyafter we get that paint and paper on it and we shall have them on before two sabbaths have passed over it  she wrung the altrurians hand i was only afraid she was going to kiss him  there is but one stipulation i should like to make he began  oh a thousand she cut in  and that is there shall be no exclusion from my lecture on account of occupation or condition that is a thing that i can in no wise countenance even in america it is far more abhorrent to me even than moneymaking though they are each a part and parcel of the other  i thought it was that she retorted joyously and i can assure you mr homos there shall be nothing of that kind every onei dont care who it is or what they doshall hear you who buys a ticket now will that do  perfectly said the altrurian and he let her wring his hand again  she pushed hers through my arm as we started for the diningroom and leaned over to whisper jubilantly that will fix it he will see how much his precious lower classes care for altruria if they have to pay a dollar apiece to hear about it and i shall keep faith with him to the letter  i could not feel that she would keep it in the spirit but i could only groan inwardly and chuckle outwardly at the womans depravity  it seemed to me though i could not approve of it a capital joke and so it seemed to all the members of the little group whom i had made especially acquainted with the altrurian it is true that the minister was somewhat troubled with the moral question which did not leave me wholly at peace and the banker affected to find a question of taste involved which he said he must let me settle however as the mans host if i could stand it he could no one said anything against the plan to mrs makely and this energetic woman made us take two tickets apiece as soon as she got them printed over in the village she got little handbills printed and had them scattered about through the neighborhood at all the hotels boardinghouses and summer cottages to give notice of the time and place of the talk on altruria she fixed this for the following saturday afternoon in our hotel parlor she had it in the afternoon so as not to interfere with the hop in the evening she put tickets on sale at the principal houses and at the village drugstore and she made me go about with her and help her sell them at some of the cottages in person  i must say i found this extremely distasteful especially where the people were not very willing to buy and she had to urge them they all admitted the excellence of the object but they were not so sure about the means at several places the ladies asked who was this mr homos anyway and how did she know he was really from altruria he might be an impostor  then mrs makely would put me forward and i would be obliged to give such account of him as i could and to explain just how and why he came to be my guest with the cumulative effect of bringing back all the misgivings which i had myself felt at the outset concerning him and which i had dismissed as too fantastic  the tickets went off rather slowly even in our own hotel people thought them too dear and some as soon as they knew the price said frankly they had heard enough about altruria already and were sick of the whole thing  mrs makely said this was quite what she had expected of those people that they were horrid and stingy and vulgar and she should see what face they would have to ask her to take tickets when they were trying to get up something she began to be vexed with herself she confessed at the joke she was playing on mr homos and i noticed that she put herself rather defiantly en evidence in his company whenever she could in the presence of these reluctant ladies she told me she had not the courage to ask the clerk how many of the tickets he had sold out of those she had left at the desk  one morning the third or fourth as i was going in to breakfast with her the headwaiter stopped her as he opened the door and asked modestly if she could spare him a few tickets for he thought he could sell some to my amazement the unprincipled creature said why certainly how many and instantly took a package out of her pocket where she seemed always to have them he asked would twenty be more than she could spare and she answered not at all here are twentyfive and bestowed the whole package upon him  that afternoon reuben camp came lounging up toward us where i sat with her on the corner of the piazza and said that if she would like to let him try his luck with some tickets for the talk he would see what he could do  you can have all you want reuben she said and i hope youll have better luck than i have im perfectly disgusted with people  she fished several packages out of her pocket this time and he asked do you mean that i can have them all  every one and a band of music into the bargain she answered recklessly but she seemed a little daunted when he quietly took them you know there are a hundred here  yes i should like to see what i can do among the natives then there is a construction train over at the junction and i know a lot of the fellows i guess some of em would like to come  the tickets are a dollar each you know she suggested  thats all right said camp well goodafternoon  mrs makely turned to me with a kind of gasp as he shambled away i dont know about that  about having the whole crew of a construction train at the talk i dare say it wont be pleasant to the ladies who have bought tickets  oh said mrs makely with astonishing contempt i dont care what they think but reuben has got all my tickets and suppose he keeps them so long that i wont have time to sell any and then throws them back on my hands i know she added joyously i can go around now and tell people that my tickets are all gone and ill go instantly and have the clerk hold all he has left at a premium  she came back looking rather blank  he hasnt got a single one left he says an old native came in this morning and took every last one of themhe doesnt remember just how many i believe theyre going to speculate on them and if reuben camp serves me a trick like thatwhy she broke off i believe ill speculate on them myself i should like to know why i shouldnt oh i should just like to make some of those creatures pay double or treble for the chances theyve refused ah mrs bulkham she called out to a lady who was coming down the veranda toward us youll be glad to know ive got rid of all my tickets such a relief  you have mrs bulkham retorted  every one  i thought said mrs bulkham that you understood i wanted one for my daughter and myself if she came  i certainly didnt said mrs makely with a wink of concentrated wickedness at me but if you do you will have to say so now without any ifs or ands about it and if any of the tickets come backi let friends have a few on salei will give you two  well i do said mrs bulkham after a moment  very well it will be five dollars for the two i feel bound to get all i can for the cause shall i put your name down  yes said mrs bulkham rather crossly but mrs makely inscribed her name on her tablets with a radiant amiability which suffered no eclipse when within the next fifteen minutes a dozen other ladies hurried up and bought in at the same rate  i could not stand it and i got up to go away feeling extremely particeps criminis mrs makely seemed to have a conscience as light as air  if reuben camp or the headwaiter dont bring back some of those tickets i dont know what i shall do i shall have to put chairs into the aisles and charge five dollars apiece for as many people as i can crowd in there i never knew anything so perfectly providential  i envy you the ability to see it in that light mrs makely i said faint at heart suppose camp crowds the place full of his trainmen how will the ladies that youve sold tickets to at five dollars apiece like it  pooh what do i care how they like it horrid things and for repairs on the house of gawd its the same as being in church where everybody is equal  the time passed mrs makely sold chances to all the ladies in the house on friday night reuben camp brought her a hundred dollars the headwaiter had already paid in twentyfive i didnt dare to ask them if they speculated on them she confided to me do you suppose they would have the conscience  they had secured the large parlor of the hotel where the young people danced in the evening and where entertainments were held of the sort usually given in summer hotels we had already had a dramatic reading a time with the phonograph an exhibition of necromancy a concert by a college glee club and i do not know what else the room would hold perhaps two hundred people if they were closely seated and by her own showing mrs makely had sold above two hundred and fifty tickets and chances all saturday forenoon she consoled herself with the belief that a great many people at the other hotels and cottages had bought seats merely to aid the cause and would not really come she estimated that at least fifty would stay away but if reuben camp had sold his tickets among the natives we might expect every one of them to come and get his moneys worth she did not dare to ask the headwaiter how he had got rid of his twentyfive tickets  the hour set for the talk to begin was three oclock so that people could have their naps comfortably over after the one oclock dinner and be just in the right frame of mind for listening but long before the appointed time the people who dine at twelve and never take an afternoon nap began to arrive on foot in farmwagons smart buggies mudcrusted carryalls and all manner of ramshackle vehicles they arrived as if coming to a circus old husbands and wives young couples and their children pretty girls and their fellows and hitched their horses to the tails of their wagons and began to make a picnic lunch in the shadow of the grove lying between the hotel and the station about two we heard the snorting of a locomotive at a time when no train was due and a construction train came in view with the men waving their handkerchiefs from the windows and apparently ready for all the fun there was to be in the thing some of them had a small flag in each hand the american stars and stripes and the white flag of altruria in compliment to my guest i suppose a good many of the farmers came over to the hotel to buy tickets which they said they expected to get after they came and mrs makely was obliged to pacify them with all sorts of lying promises from moment to moment she was in consultation with the landlord who decided to throw open the diningroom which connected with the parlor so as to allow the help and the neighbors to hear without incommoding the hotel guests she said that this took a great burden off her mind and that now she should feel perfectly easy for now no one could complain about being mixed up with the servants and the natives and yet every one could hear perfectly  she could not rest until she had sent for homos and told him of this admirable arrangement i did not know whether to be glad or not when he instantly told her that if there was to be any such separation of his auditors in recognition of our class distinctions he must refuse to speak at all  then what in the world are we to do she wailed out and the tears came into her eyes  have you got the money for all your tickets he asked with a sort of disgust for the whole transaction in his tone  yes and more too i dont believe theres a soul in the hotel or out of it that hasnt paid at least a dollar to hear you and that makes it so very embarrassing oh dear mr homos you wont be so implacably highprincipled as all that think that you are doing it for the house of gawd  the woman made me sick  then no one said the altrurian can feel aggrieved or unfairly used if i say what i have to say in the open air where all can listen equally without any manner of preference or distinction we will go up to the edge of the grove overlooking the tenniscourt and hold our meeting there as the altrurian meetings are always held with the sky for a roof and with no walls but the horizon  the very thing cried mrs makely who would ever have thought you were so practical mr homos i dont believe youre an altrurian after all i believe you are an american in disguise  the altrurian turned away without making any response to this flattering attribution of our nationality to him but mrs makely had not waited for any she had flown off and i next saw her attacking the landlord with such apparent success that he slapped himself on the leg and vanished and immediately the porters and bellboys and all the menservants began carrying out chairs to the tenniscourt which was already well set round with benches in a little while the whole space was covered and settees were placed well up the ground toward the grove  by halfpast two the guests of the hotel came out and took the best seats as by right and the different tallyhoes and mountain wagons began to arrive from the other hotels with their silly hotel cries and their gay groups dismounted and dispersed themselves over the tenniscourt until all the chairs were taken it was fine to see how the natives and the trainmen and the hotel servants with an instinctive perception of the proprieties yielded these places to their superiors and after the summer folks were all seated scattered themselves on the grass and the pineneedles about the border of the grove i should have liked to instance the fact to the altrurian as a proof that this sort of subordination was a part of human nature and that a principle which pervaded our civilization after the democratic training of our whole national life must be divinely implanted but there was no opportunity for me to speak with him after the fact had accomplished itself for by this time he had taken his place in front of a little clump of low pines and was waiting for the assembly to quiet itself before he began to speak i do not think there could have been less than five hundred present and the scene had that accidental picturesqueness which results from the grouping of all sorts of faces and costumes many of our ladies had pretty hats and brilliant parasols but i must say that the soberer tone of some of the old farmwives brown calicoes and outdated bonnets contributed to enrich the coloring and there was a certain gayety in the sunny glisten of the mens straw hats everywhere that was very good  the sky overhead was absolutely stainless and the light of the cool afternoon sun streamed upon the slopes of the solemn mountains to the east the tall pines in the background blackened themselves against the horizon nearer they showed more and more decidedly their bluish green and the yellow of the newly fallen needles painted their aisles deep into the airy shadows  a little wind stirred their tops and for a moment just before the altrurian began to speak drew from them an organtone that melted delicately away as his powerful voice rose    xi   i could not give you a clear account of the present state of things in my country the altrurian began without first telling you something of our conditions before the time of our evolution it seems to be the law of all life that nothing can come to fruition without dying and seeming to make an end it must be sown in corruption before it can be raised in incorruption the truth itself must perish to our senses before it can live to our souls the son of man must suffer upon the cross before we can know the son of god  it was so with his message to the world which we received in the old time as an ideal realized by the earliest christians who loved one another and who had all things common the apostle cast away upon our heathen coasts won us with the story of this first christian republic and he established a commonwealth of peace and goodwill among us in its likeness that commonwealth perished just as its prototype perished or seemed to perish and long ages of civic and economic warfare succeeded when every mans hand was against his neighbor and might was the rule that got itself called right religion ceased to be the hope of this world and became the vague promise of the next we descended into the valley of the shadow and dwelt amid chaos for ages before we groped again into the light  the first glimmerings were few and indistinct but men formed themselves about the luminous points here and there and when these broke and dispersed into lesser gleams still men formed themselves about each of them there arose a system of things better indeed than that darkness but full of war and lust and greed in which the weak rendered homage to the strong and served them in the field and in the camp and the strong in turn gave the weak protection against the other strong it was a juggle in which the weak did not see that their safety was after all from themselves but it was an image of peace however false and fitful and it endured for a time it endured for a limited time if we measure by the life of the race it endured for an unlimited time if we measure by the lives of the men who were born and died while it endured  but that disorder cruel and fierce and stupid which endured because it sometimes masked itself as order did at last pass away here and there one of the strong overpowered the rest then the strong became fewer and fewer and in their turn they all yielded to a supreme lord and throughout the land there was one rule as it was called then or one misrule as we should call it now this rule or this misrule continued for ages more and again in the immortality of the race men toiled and struggled and died without the hope of better things  then the time came when the long nightmare was burst with the vision of a future in which all men were the law and not one man or any less number of men than all  the poor dumb beast of humanity rose and the throne tumbled and the sceptre was broken and the crown rolled away into that darkness of the past we thought that heaven had descended to us and that liberty equality and fraternity were ours we could not see what should again alienate us from one another or how one brother could again oppress another with a free field and no favor we believed we should prosper on together and there would be peace and plenty for all we had the republic again after so many ages now and the republic as we knew it in our dim annals was brotherhood and universal happiness all but a very few who prophesied evil of our lawless freedom were wrapped in a delirium of hope mens minds and mens hands were suddenly released to an activity unheard of before invention followed invention our rivers and seas became the warp of commerce where the steamsped shuttles carried the woof of enterprise to and fro with tireless celerity machines to save labor multiplied themselves as if they had been procreative forces and wares of every sort were produced with incredible swiftness and cheapness money seemed to flow from the ground vast fortunes rose like an exhalation as your milton says  at first we did not know that they were the breath of the nethermost pits of hell and that the love of money which was becoming universal with us was filling the earth with the hate of men it was long before we came to realize that in the depths of our steamships were those who fed the fires with their lives and that our mines from which we dug our wealth were the graves of those who had died to the free light and air without finding the rest of death we did not see that the machines for saving labor were monsters that devoured women and children and wasted men at the bidding of the power which no man must touch  that is we thought we must not touch it for it called itself prosperity and wealth and the public good and it said that it gave bread and it impudently bade the toiling myriads consider what would become of them if it took away their means of wearing themselves out in its service it demanded of the state absolute immunity and absolute impunity the right to do its will wherever and however it would without question from the people who were the final law it had its way and under its rule we became the richest people under the sun the accumulation as we called this power because we feared to call it by its true name rewarded its own with gains of twenty of a hundred of a thousand per cent and to satisfy its need to produce the labor that operated its machines there came into existence a hapless race of men who bred their kind for its service and whose little ones were its prey almost from their cradles then the infamy became too great and the law the voice of the people so long guiltily silent was lifted in behalf of those who had no helper the accumulation came under control for the first time and could no longer work its slaves twenty hours a day amid perils to life and limb from its machinery and in conditions that forbade them decency and morality the time of a hundred and a thousand per cent passed but still the accumulation demanded immunity and impunity and in spite of its conviction of the enormities it had practised it declared itself the only means of civilization and progress it began to give out that it was timid though its history was full of the boldest frauds and crimes and it threatened to withdraw itself if it were ruled or even crossed and again it had its way and we seemed to prosper more and more the land was filled with cities where the rich flaunted their splendor in palaces and the poor swarmed in squalid tenements the country was drained of its life and force to feed the centres of commerce and industry the whole land was bound together with a network of iron roads that linked the factories and founderies to the fields and mines and blasted the landscape with the enterprise that spoiled the lives of men  then all at once when its work seemed perfect and its dominion sure the accumulation was stricken with consciousness of the lie always at its heart it had hitherto cried out for a free field and no favor for unrestricted competition but in truth it had never prospered except as a monopoly whenever and wherever competition had play there had been nothing but disaster to the rival enterprises till one rose over the rest then there was prosperity for that one  the accumulation began to act upon its new consciousness the iron roads united the warring industries made peace each kind under a single leadership monopoly not competition was seen to be the beneficent means of distributing the favors and blessings of the accumulation to mankind but as before there was alternately a glut and dearth of things and it often happened that when starving men went ragged through the streets the storehouses were piled full of rotting harvests that the farmers toiled from dawn till dusk to grow and the warehouses fed the moth with the stuffs that the operative had woven his life into at his loom then followed with a blind and mad succession a time of famine when money could not buy the superabundance that vanished none knew how or why  the money itself vanished from time to time and disappeared into the vaults of the accumulation for no better reason than that for which it poured itself out at other times our theory was that the peoplethat is to say the government of the peoplemade the peoples money but as a matter of fact the accumulation made it and controlled it and juggled with it and now you saw it and now you did not see it the government made gold coins but the people had nothing but the paper money that the accumulation made but whether there was scarcity or plenty the failures went on with a continuous ruin that nothing could check while our larger economic life proceeded in a series of violent shocks which we called financial panics followed by long periods of exhaustion and recuperation  there was no law in our economy but as the accumulation had never cared for the nature of law it did not trouble itself for its name in our order of things it had always bought the law it needed for its own use first through the voter at the polls in the more primitive days and then as civilization advanced in the legislatures and the courts but the corruption even of these methods was far surpassed when the era of consolidation came and the necessity for statutes and verdicts and decisions became more stringent then we had such a burlesque of  look here a sharp nasal voice snarled across the rich full pipe of the altrurian and we all instantly looked there the voice came from an old farmer holding himself stiffly up with his hands in his pockets and his lean frame bent toward the speaker when are you goin to get to altrury we know all about ameriky  he sat down again and it was a moment before the crowd caught on then a yell of delight and a roar of volleyed laughter went up from the lower classes in which i am sorry to say my friend the banker joined so far as the laughter was concerned good thats it firstrate came from a hundred vulgar throats  isnt it a perfect shame mrs makely demanded i think some of you gentlemen ought to say something what will mr homos think of our civilization if we let such interruptions go unrebuked  she was sitting between the banker and myself and her indignation made him laugh more and more oh it serves him right he said dont you see that he is hoist with his own petard let him alone hes in the hands of his friends  the altrurian waited for the tumult to die away and then he said gently i dont understand  the old farmer jerked himself to his feet again its like this i paid my dolla to hear about a country where there want no coperations nor no monoplies nor no buyin up couts and i aint agoin to have no allegory shoved down my throat instead of a true history noways i know all about how it is here fist run their line through your backyad and then kill off your cattle and keep kerryin on it up from cout to cout till there aint hide or hair on em left  oh set down set down let the man go on hell make it all right with you one of the construction gang called out but the farmer stood his ground and i could hear him through the laughing and shouting keep saying something from time to time about not wanting to pay no dolla for no talk about coperations and monoplies that we had right under our own noses the whole while and you might say in your very breadtroughs till at last i saw reuben camp make his way toward him and after an energetic expostulation turn to leave him again  then he faltered out i guess its all right and dropped out of sight in the group he had risen from i fancied his wife scolding him there and all but shaking him in public  i should be very sorry the altrurian proceeded to have any one believe that i have not been giving you a bona fide account of conditions in my country before the evolution when we first took the name of altruria in our great peaceful campaign against the accumulation as for offering you any allegory or travesty of your own conditions i will simply say that i do not know them well enough to do so intelligently but whatever they are god forbid that the likeness which you seem to recognize should ever go so far as the desperate state of things which we finally reached i will not trouble you with details in fact i have been afraid that i had already treated of our affairs too abstractly but since your own experience furnishes you the means of seizing my meaning i will go on as before  you will understand me when i explain that the accumulation had not erected itself into the sovereignty with us unopposed the workingmen who suffered most from its oppression had early begun to band themselves against it with the instinct of selfpreservation first trade by trade and art by art and then in congresses and federations of the trades and arts until finally they enrolled themselves in one vast union which included all the workingmen whom their necessity or their interest did not leave on the side of the accumulation this beneficent and generous association of the weak for the sake of the weakest did not accomplish itself fully till the baleful instinct of the accumulation had reduced the monopolies to one vast monopoly till the stronger had devoured the weaker among its members and the supreme agent stood at the head of our affairs in everything but name our imperial ruler we had hugged so long the delusion of each man for himself that we had suffered all realty to be taken from us the accumulation owned the land as well as the mines under it and the shops over it the accumulation owned the seas and the ships that sailed the seas and the fish that swam in their depths it owned transportation and distribution and the wares and products that were to be carried to and fro and by a logic irresistible and inexorable the accumulation was and we were not  but the accumulation too had forgotten something it had found it so easy to buy legislatures and courts that it did not trouble itself about the polls it left us the suffrage and let us amuse ourselves with the periodical election of the political clay images which it manipulated and moulded to any shape and effect at its pleasure the accumulation knew that it was the sovereignty whatever figurehead we called president or governor or mayor we had other names for these officials but i use their analogues for the sake of clearness and i hope my good friend over there will not think i am still talking about america  no the old farmer called back without rising we haint got there quite yit  no hurry said a trainman all in good time go on he called to the altrurian  the altrurian resumed  there had been from the beginning an almost ceaseless struggle between the accumulation and the proletariate the accumulation always said that it was the best friend of the proletariate and it denounced through the press which it controlled the proletarian leaders who taught that it was the enemy of the proletariate and who stirred up strikes and tumults of all sorts for higher wages and fewer hours but the friend of the proletariate whenever occasion served treated the proletariate like a deadly enemy in seasons of overproduction as it was called it locked the workmen out or laid them off and left their families to starve or ran light work and claimed the credit of public benefactors for running at all it sought every chance to reduce wages it had laws passed to forbid or cripple the workmen in their strikes and the judges convicted them of conspiracy and wrested the statutes to their hurt in cases where there had been no thought of embarrassing them even among the legislators god forbid that you should ever come to such a pass in america but if you ever should god grant that you may find your way out as simply as we did at last when freedom had perished in everything but name among us and justice had become a mockery  the accumulation had advanced so smoothly so lightly in all its steps to the supreme power and had at last so thoroughly quelled the uprisings of the proletariate that it forgot one thing it forgot the despised and neglected suffrage the ballot because it had been so easy to annul its effect had been left in the peoples hands and when at last the leaders of the proletariate ceased to counsel strikes or any form of resistance to the accumulation that could be tormented into the likeness of insurrection against the government and began to urge them to attack it in the political way the deluge that swept the accumulation out of existence came trickling and creeping over the land it appeared first in the country a spring from the ground then it gathered head in the villages then it swelled to a torrent in the cities i cannot stay to trace its course but suddenly one day when the accumulations abuse of a certain power became too gross it was voted out of that power you will perhaps be interested to know that it was with the telegraphs that the rebellion against the accumulation began and the government was forced by the overwhelming majority which the proletariate sent to our parliament to assume a function which the accumulation had impudently usurped then the transportation of smaller and more perishable wares  yes a voice calledexpress business go on  was legislated a function of the postoffice the altrurian went on then all transportation was taken into the hands of the political government which had always been accused of great corruption in its administration but which showed itself immaculately pure compared with the accumulation the common ownership of mines necessarily followed with an allotment of lands to any one who wished to live by tilling the land but not a foot of the land was remitted to private hands for the purposes of selfish pleasure or the exclusion of any other from the landscape as all business had been gathered into the grasp of the accumulation and the manufacture of everything they used and the production of everything that they ate was in the control of the accumulation its transfer to the government was the work of a single clause in the statute  the accumulation which had treated the first menaces of resistance with contempt awoke to its peril too late when it turned to wrest the suffrage from the proletariate at the first election where it attempted to make head against them it was simply snowed under as your picturesque phrase is the accumulation had no voters except the few men at its head and the creatures devoted to it by interest and ignorance it seemed at one moment as if it would offer an armed resistance to the popular will but happily that moment of madness passed our evolution was accomplished without a drop of bloodshed and the first great political brotherhood the commonwealth of altruria was founded  i wish that i had time to go into a study of some of the curious phases of the transformation from a civility in which the people lived upon each other to one in which they lived for each other there is a famous passage in the inaugural message of our first altrurian president which compares the new civic consciousness with that of a disembodied spirit released to the life beyond this and freed from all the selfish cares and greeds of the flesh but perhaps i shall give a sufficiently clear notion of the triumph of the change among us when i say that within half a decade after the fall of the old plutocratic oligarchy one of the chief directors of the accumulation publicly expressed his gratitude to god that the accumulation had passed away forever you will realize the importance of such an expression in recalling the declarations some of your slaveholders have made since the civil war that they would not have slavery restored for any earthly consideration  but now after this preamble which has been so much longer than i meant it to be how shall i give you a sufficiently just conception of the existing altruria the actual state from which i come  yes came the nasal of the old farmer again thats what we are here fur i wouldnt give a copper to know all you went through beforehand its too dumn like what we have been through ourselves as fur as heard from  a shout of laughter went up from most of the crowd but the altrurian did not seem to see any fun in it  well he resumed i will tell you as well as i can what altruria is like but in the first place you will have to cast out of your minds all images of civilization with which your experience has filled them for a time the shell of the old accumulation remained for our social habitation and we dwelt in the old competitive and monopolistic forms after the life had gone out of themthat is we continued to live in populous cities and we toiled to heap up riches for the moth to corrupt and we slaved on in making utterly useless things merely because we had the habit of making them to sell for a while we made the old sham things which pretended to be useful things and were worse than the confessedly useless things i will give you an illustration from the trades which you will all understand the proletariate in the competitive and monopolistic time used to make a kind of shoes for the proletariate or the women of the proletariate which looked like fine shoes of the best quality it took just as much work to make these shoes as to make the best fine shoes but they were shams through and through they wore out in a week and the people called them because they were bought fresh for every sunday  satdynight shoes screamed the old farmer i know em my gals buy em halfdolla a pai and not woth the money  well said the altrurian they were a cheat and a lie in every way and under the new system it was not possible when public attention was called to the fact to continue the falsehood they embodied as soon as the saturdaynight shoes realized itself to the public conscience an investigation began and it was found that the principle of the saturdaynight shoe underlay half our industries and made half the work that was done  then an immense reform took place we renounced in the most solemn convocation of the whole economy the principle of the saturdaynight shoe and those who had spent their lives in producing sham shoes  yes said the professor rising from his seat near us and addressing the speaker i shall be very glad to know what became of the worthy and industrious operatives who were thrown out of employment by this explosion of economic virtue  why the altrurian replied they were set to work making honest shoes and as it took no more time to make a pair of honest shoes which lasted a year than it took to make a pair of dishonest shoes that lasted a week the amount of labor in shoemaking was at once enormously reduced  yes said the professor i understand that what became of the shoemakers  they joined the vast army of other laborers who had been employed directly or indirectly in the fabrication of fraudulent wares these shoemakerslasters buttonholers binders and so onno longer wore themselves out over their machines one hour sufficed where twelve hours were needed before and the operatives were released to the happy labor of the fields where no one with us toils killingly from dawn till dusk but does only as much work as is needed to keep the body in health we had a continent to refine and beautify we had climates to change and seasons to modify a whole system of meteorology to readjust and the public works gave employment to the multitudes emancipated from the souldestroying service of shams i can scarcely give you a notion of the vastness of the improvements undertaken and carried through or still in process of accomplishment but a single one will perhaps afford a sufficient illustration our southeast coast from its vicinity to the pole had always suffered from a winter of antarctic rigor but our first president conceived the plan of cutting off a peninsula which kept the equatorial current from making in to our shores and the work was begun in his term though the entire strip twenty miles in width and ninetythree in length was not severed before the end of the first altrurian decade since that time the whole region of our southeastern coast has enjoyed the climate of your mediterranean countries  it was not only the makers of fraudulent things who were released to these useful and wholesome labors but those who had spent themselves in contriving ugly and stupid and foolish things were set free to the public employment the multitude of these monstrosities and iniquities was as great as that of the shams  here i lost some words for the professor leaned over and whispered to me he has got that out of william morris depend upon it the man is a humbug he is not an altrurian at all  i confess that my heart misgave me but i signalled the professor to be silent and again gave the altrurianif he was an altrurianmy whole attention    xii   and so the altrurian continued when the labor of the community was emancipated from the bondage of the false to the free service of the true it was also by an inevitable implication dedicated to beauty and rescued from the old slavery to the ugly the stupid and the trivial the thing that was honest and useful became by the operation of a natural law a beautiful thing  once we had not time enough to make things beautiful we were so overworked in making false and hideous things to sell but now we had all the time there was and a glad emulation arose among the trades and occupations to the end that everything done should be done finely as well as done honestly the artist the man of genius who worked from the love of his work became the normal man and in the measure of his ability and of his calling each wrought in the spirit of the artist we got back the pleasure of doing a thing beautifully which was gods primal blessing upon all his working children but which we had lost in the horrible days of our need and greed there is not a workingman within the sound of my voice but has known this divine delight and would gladly know it always if he only had the time well now we had the time the evolution had given us the time and in all altruria there was not a furrow driven or a swath mown not a hammer struck on house or on ship not a stitch sewn or a stone laid not a line written or a sheet printed not a temple raised or an engine built but it was done with an eye to beauty as well as to use  as soon as we were freed from the necessity of preying upon one another we found that there was no hurry the good work would wait to be well done and one of the earliest effects of the evolution was the disuse of the swift trains which had traversed the continent night and day that one man might overreach another or make haste to undersell his rival or seize some advantage of him or plot some profit to his loss ninetenths of the railroads which in the old times had ruinously competed and then in the hands of the accumulation had been united to impoverish and oppress the people fell into disuse the commonwealth operated the few lines that were necessary for the collection of materials and the distribution of manufactures and for pleasure travel and the affairs of state but the roads that had been built to invest capital or parallel other roads or make work as it was called or to develop resources or boom localities were suffered to fall into ruin the rails were stripped from the landscape which they had bound as with shackles and the roadbeds became highways for the use of kindly neighborhoods or nature recovered them wholly and hid the memory of their former abuse in grass and flowers and wild vines the ugly towns that they had forced into being as frankenstein was fashioned from the materials of the charnel and that had no life in or from the good of the community soon tumbled into decay the administration used parts of them in the construction of the villages in which the altrurians now mostly live but generally these towns were built of materials so fraudulent in form so vile that it was judged best to burn them in this way their sites were at once purified and obliterated  we had of course a great many large cities under the old egoistic conditions which increased and fattened upon the country and fed their cancerous life with fresh infusions of its blood we had several cities of half a million and one of more than a million we had a score of them with a population of a hundred thousand or more we were very proud of them and vaunted them as a proof of our unparalleled prosperity though really they never were anything but congeries of millionaires and the wretched creatures who served them and supplied them of course there was everywhere the appearance of enterprise and activity but it meant final loss for the great mass of the business men large and small and final gain for the millionaires these and their parasites dwelt together the rich starving the poor and the poor plundering and misgoverning the rich and it was the intolerable suffering in the cities that chiefly hastened the fall of the old accumulation and the rise of the commonwealth  almost from the moment of the evolution the competitive and monopolistic centres of population began to decline in the clear light of the new order it was seen that they were not fit dwellingplaces for men either in the complicated and luxurious palaces where the rich fenced themselves from their kind or in the vast tenements towering height upon height ten and twelve stories up where the swarming poor festered in vice and sickness and famine if i were to tell you of the fashion of those cities of our egoistic epoch how the construction was one error from the first and every correction of an error bred a new defect i should make you laugh i should make you weep we let them fall to ruin as quickly as they would and their sites are still so pestilential after the lapse of centuries that travelers are publicly guarded against them ravening beasts and poisonous reptiles lurk in those abodes of the riches and the poverty that are no longer known to our life a part of one of the less malarial of the old cities however is maintained by the commonwealth in the form of its prosperity and is studied by antiquarians for the instruction and by moralists for the admonition it affords a section of a street is exposed and you see the foundations of the houses you see the filthy drains that belched into the common sewers trapped and retrapped to keep the poison gases down you see the sewers that rolled their loathsome tides under the streets amid a tangle of gaspipes steampipes waterpipes telegraphwires electric lightingwires electric motorwires and gripcablesall without a plan but makeshifts expedients devices to repair and evade the fundamental mistake of having any such cities at all  there are now no cities in altruria in your meaning but there are capitals one for each of the regions of our country and one for the whole commonwealth these capitals are for the transaction of public affairs in which every citizen of altruria is schooled and they are the residences of the administrative officials who are alternated every year from the highest to the lowest a public employment with us is of no greater honor or profit than any other for with our absolute economic equality there can be no ambition and there is no opportunity for one citizen to outshine another but as the capitals are the centres of all the arts which we consider the chief of our public affairs they are oftenest frequented by poets actors painters sculptors musicians and architects we regard all artists who are in a sort creators as the human type which is likest the divine and we try to conform our whole industrial life to the artistic temperament even in the labors of the field and shop which are obligatory upon all we study the inspiration of this temperament and in the voluntary pursuits we allow it full control each in these follows his fancy as to what he shall do and when he shall do it or whether he shall do anything at all in the capitals are the universities theatres galleries museums cathedrals laboratories and conservatories and the appliances of every art and science as well as the administration buildings and beauty as well as use is studied in every edifice our capitals are as clean and quiet and healthful as the country and these advantages are secured simply by the elimination of the horse an animal which we should be as much surprised to find in the streets of a town as the plesiosaurus or the pterodactyl all transportation in the capitals whether for pleasure or business is by electricity and swift electrical expresses connect the capital of each region with the villages which radiate from it to the cardinal points these expresses run at the rate of a hundred and fifty miles an hour and they enable the artist the scientist the literary man of the remotest hamlet to visit the capital when he is not actually resident there in some public use every day after the hours of the obligatory industries or if he likes he may remain there a whole week or fortnight giving six hours a day instead of three to the obligatories until the time is made up in case of very evident merit or for the purpose of allowing him to complete some work requiring continuous application a vote of the local agents may release him from the obligatories indefinitely generally however our artists prefer not to ask this but avail themselves of the stated means we have of allowing them to work at the obligatories and get the needed exercise and variety of occupation in the immediate vicinity of the capital  we do not think it well to connect the hamlets on the different lines of radiation from the capital except by the good country roads which traverse each region in every direction the villages are mainly inhabited by those who prefer a rural life they are farming villages but in altruria it can hardly be said that one man is more a farmer than another we do not like to distinguish men by their callings we do not speak of the poet this or the shoemaker that for the poet may very likely be a shoemaker in the obligatories and the shoemaker a poet in the voluntaries if it can be said that one occupation is honored above another with us it is that which we all share and that is the cultivation of the earth we believe that this when not followed slavishly or for gain brings man into the closest relations to the deity through a grateful sense of the divine bounty and that it not only awakens a natural piety in him but that it endears to the worker that piece of soil which he tills and so strengthens his love of home the home is the very heart of the altrurian system and we do not think it well that people should be away from their homes very long or very often in the competitive and monopolistic times men spent half their days in racing back and forth across our continent families were scattered by the chase for fortune and there was a perpetual paying and repaying of visits onehalf the income of those railroads which we let fall into disuse came from the ceaseless unrest now a man is born and lives and dies among his own kindred and the sweet sense of neighborhood of brotherhood which blessed the golden age of the first christian republic is ours again every year the people of each region meet one another on evolution day in the regionic capital once in four years they all visit the national capital there is no danger of the decay of patriotism among us our country is our mother and we love her as it is impossible to love the stepmother that a competitive or monopolistic nation must be to its citizens  i can only touch upon this feature and that of our system as i chance to think of it if any of you are curious about others i shall be glad to answer questions as well as i can we have of course the altrurian proceeded after a little indefinite pause to let any speak who liked no money in your sense as the whole people control affairs no man works for another and no man pays another every one does his share of labor and receives his share of food clothing and shelter which is neither more nor less than anothers if you can imagine the justice and impartiality of a wellordered family you can conceive of the social and economic life of altruria we are properly speaking a family rather than a nation like yours  of course we are somewhat favored by our insular or continental position but i do not know that we are more so than you are certainly however we are selfsufficing in a degree unknown to most european countries and we have within our borders the materials of every comfort and the resources of every need we have no commerce with the egoistic world as we call that outside and i believe that i am the first altrurian to visit foreign countries avowedly in my national character though we have always had emissaries living abroad incognito i hope that i may say without offence that they find it a sorrowful exile and that the reports of the egoistic world with its wars its bankruptcies its civic commotions and its social unhappiness do not make us discontented with our own condition before the evolution we had completed the round of your inventions and discoveries impelled by the force that drives you on and we have since disused most of them as idle and unfit but we profit now and then by the advances you make in science for we are passionately devoted to the study of the natural laws open or occult under which all men have their being occasionally an emissary returns with a sum of money and explains to the students of the national university the processes by which it is lost and won and at a certain time there was a movement for its introduction among us not for its use as you know it but for a species of counters in games of chance it was considered however to contain an element of danger and the scheme was discouraged  nothing amuses and puzzles our people more than the accounts our emissaries give of the changes of fashion in the outside world and of the ruin of soul and body which the love of dress often works our own dress for men and for women is studied in one ideal of use and beauty from the antique caprice and vagary in it would be thought an effect of vulgar vanity nothing is worn that is not simple and honest in texture we do not know whether a thing is cheap or dear except as it is easy or hard to come by and that which is hard to come by is forbidden as wasteful and foolish the community builds the dwellings of the community and these too are of a classic simplicity though always beautiful and fit in form the splendors of the arts are lavished upon the public edifices which we all enjoy in common  isnt this the greatest rehash of utopia new atlantis and city of the sun that you ever imagined the professor whispered across me to the banker the man is a fraud and a very bungling fraud at that  well you must expose him when he gets through the banker whispered back  but the professor could not wait he got upon his feet and called out may i ask the gentleman from altruria a question  certainly the altrurian blandly assented  make it short reuben camps voice broke in impatiently we didnt come here to listen to your questions  the professor contemptuously ignored him i suppose you occasionally receive emissaries from as well as send them to the world outside  yes now and then castaways land on our coasts and ships out of their reckonings put in at our ports for water or provision  and how are they pleased with your system  why i cannot better answer than by saying that they mostly refuse to leave us  ah just as bacon reports cried the professor  you mean in the new atlantis returned the altrurian yes it is astonishing how well bacon in that book and sir thomas more in his utopia have divined certain phases of our civilization and polity  i think he rather has you professor the banker whispered with a laugh  but all those inspired visionaries the altrurian continued while the professor sat grimly silent watching for another chance who have borne testimony of us in their dreams conceived of states perfect without the discipline of a previous competitive condition what i thought however might specially interest you americans in altruria is the fact that our economy was evolved from one so like that in which you actually have your being i had even hoped you might feel that in all these points of resemblance america prophesies another altruria i know that to some of you all that i have told of my country will seem a baseless fabric with no more foundation in fact than mores fairytale of another land where men dealt kindly and justly by one another and dwelt a whole nation in the unity and equality of a family but why should not a part of that fable have come true in our polity as another part of it has come true in yours when sir thomas more wrote that book he noted with abhorrence the monstrous injustice of the fact that men were hanged for small thefts in england and in the preliminary conversation between its characters he denounced the killing of men for any sort of thefts now you no longer put men to death for theft you look back upon that cruel code of your mother england with an abhorrence as great as his own we for our part who have realized the utopian dream of brotherly equality look back with the same abhorrence upon a state where some were rich and some poor some taught and some untaught some high and some low and the hardest toil often failed to supply a sufficiency of the food which luxury wasted in its riots that state seems as atrocious to us as the state which hanged a man for stealing a loaf of bread seems to you  but we do not regret the experience of competition and monopoly they taught us some things in the operation of the industries the laborsaving inventions which the accumulation perverted to moneymaking we have restored to the use intended by their inventors and the creator of their inventors after serving the advantage of socializing the industries which the accumulation effected for its own purposes we continued the work in large mills and shops in the interest of the workers whom we wished to guard against the evil effects of solitude but our mills and shops are beautiful as well as useful they look like temples and they are temples dedicated to that sympathy between the divine and human which expresses itself in honest and exquisite workmanship they rise amid leafy boscages beside the streams which form their only power for we have disused steam altogether with all the offences to the eye and ear which its use brought into the world our life is so simple and our needs are so few that the handwork of the primitive toilers could easily supply our wants but machinery works so much more thoroughly and beautifully that we have in great measure retained it only the machines that were once the workmens enemies and masters are now their friends and servants and if any man chooses to work alone with his own hands the state will buy what he makes at the same price that it sells the wares made collectively this secures every right of individuality  the farmwork as well as the millwork and the shopwork is done by companies of workers and there is nothing of that loneliness in our woods and fields which i understand is the cause of so much insanity among you it is not good for man to be alone was the first thought of his creator when he considered him and we act upon this truth in everything the privacy of the family is sacredly guarded in essentials but the social instinct is so highly developed with us that we like to eat together in large refectories and we meet constantly to argue and dispute on questions of aesthetics and metaphysics we do not perhaps read so many books as you do for most of our reading when not for special research but for culture and entertainment is done by public readers to large groups of listeners we have no social meetings which are not free to all and we encourage joking and the friendly give and take of witty encounters  a little hint from sparta suggested the professor  the banker leaned over to whisper to me from what i have seen of your friend when offered a piece of american humor i should fancy the altrurian article was altogether different upon the whole i would rather not be present at one of their witty encounters if i were obliged to stay it out  the altrurian had paused to drink a glass of water and now he went on but we try in everything that does not inconvenience or injure others to let every one live the life he likes best if a man prefers to dwell apart and have his meals in private for himself alone or for his family it is freely permitted only he must not expect to be served as in public where service is one of the voluntaries private service is not permitted those wishing to live alone must wait upon themselves cook their own food and care for their own tables very few however wish to withdraw from the public life for most of the discussions and debates take place at our midday meal which falls at the end of the obligatory labors and is prolonged indefinitely or as long as people like to chat and joke or listen to the reading of some pleasant book  in altruria there is no hurry for no one wishes to outstrip another or in any wise surpass him we are all assured of enough and are forbidden any and every sort of superfluity if any one after the obligatories wishes to be entirely idle he may be so but i cannot now think of a single person without some voluntary occupation doubtless there are such persons but i do not know them it used to be said in the old times that it was human nature to shirk and malinger and loaf but we have found that it is no such thing we have found that it is human nature to work cheerfully willingly eagerly at the tasks which all share for the supply of the common necessities in like manner we have found out that it is not human nature to hoard and grudge but that when the fear and even the imagination of want is taken away it is human nature to give and to help generously we used to say a man will lie or a man will cheat in his own interest that is human nature but that is no longer human nature with us perhaps because no man has any interest to serve he has only the interests of others to serve while others serve his it is in no wise possible for the individual to separate his good from the common good he is prosperous and happy only as all the rest are so and therefore it is not human nature with us for any one to lie in wait to betray another or seize an advantage that would be ungentlemanly and in altruria every man is a gentleman and every woman a lady if you will excuse me here for being so frank i would like to say something by way of illustration which may be offensive if you take it personally  he looked at our little group as if he were addressing himself more especially to us and the banker called out jollily go on i guess we can stand it and go ahead came from all sides from all kinds of listeners  it is merely this that as we look back at the old competitive conditions we do not see how any man could be a gentleman in them since a gentleman must think first of others and these conditions compelled every man to think first of himself  there was a silence broken by some conscious and hardy laughter while we each swallowed this pill as we could  what are competitive conditions mrs makely demanded of me  well ours are competitive conditions i said  very well then she returned i dont think mr homos is much of a gentleman to say such a thing to an american audience or wait a moment ask him if the same rule applies to women  i rose strengthened by the resentment i felt and said do i understand that in your former competitive conditions it was also impossible for a woman to be a lady  the professor gave me an applausive nod as i sat down i envy you the chance of that little dig he whispered  the altrurian was thoughtful a moment and then he answered no i should not say it was from what we know historically of those conditions in our country it appears that the great mass of women were not directly affected by them they constituted an altruistic dominion of the egoistic empire and except as they were tainted by social or worldly ambitions it was possible for every woman to be a lady even in competitive conditions her instincts were unselfish and her first thoughts were nearly always of others  mrs makely jumped to her feet and clapped violently with her fan on the palm of her left hand three cheers for mr homos she shrieked and all the women took up the cry supported by all the natives and the construction gang i fancied these fellows gave their support largely in a spirit of burlesque but they gave it robustly and from that time on mrs makely led the applause and they roared in after her  it is impossible to follow closely the course of the altrurians account of his country which grew more and more incredible as he went on and implied every insulting criticism of ours some one asked him about war in altruria and he said the very name of our country implies the absence of war at the time of the evolution our country bore to the rest of our continent the same relative proportion that your country bears to your continent the egoistic nations to the north and the south of us entered into an offensive and defensive alliance to put down the new altruistic commonwealth and declared war against us their forces were met at the frontier by our entire population in arms and full of the martial spirit bred of the constant hostilities of the competitive and monopolistic epoch just ended negotiations began in the face of the imposing demonstration we made and we were never afterward molested by our neighbors who finally yielded to the spectacle of our civilization and united their political and social fate with ours at present our whole continent is altrurian for a long time we kept up a system of coast defences but it is also a long time since we abandoned these for it is a maxim with us that where every citizens life is a pledge of the public safety that country can never be in danger of foreign enemies  in this as in all other things we believe ourselves the true followers of christ whose doctrine we seek to make our life as he made it his we have several forms of ritual but no form of creed and our religious differences may be said to be aesthetic and temperamental rather than theological and essential we have no denominations for we fear in this as in other matters to give names to things lest we should cling to the names instead of the things we love the realities and for this reason we look at the life of a man rather than his profession for proof that he is a religious man  i have been several times asked during my sojourn among you what are the sources of compassion of sympathy of humanity of charity with us if we have not only no want or fear of want but not even any economic inequality i suppose this is because you are so constantly struck by the misery arising from economic inequality and want or the fear of want among yourselves that you instinctively look in that direction but have you ever seen sweeter compassion tenderer sympathy warmer humanity heavenlier charity than that shown in the family where all are economically equal and no one can want while any other has to give altruria i say again is a family and as we are mortal we are still subject to those nobler sorrows which god has appointed to men and which are so different from the squalid accidents that they have made for themselves sickness and death call out the most angelic ministries of love and those who wish to give themselves to others may do so without hinderance from those cares and even those duties resting upon men where each must look out first for himself and for his own oh believe me believe me you can know nothing of the divine rapture of selfsacrifice while you must dread the sacrifice of another in it you are not free as we are to do everything for others for it is your duty to do rather for those of your own household  there is something he continued which i hardly know how to speak of and here we all began to prick our ears i prepared myself as well as i could for another affront though i shuddered when the banker hardily called out dont hesitate to say anything you wish mr homos i for one should like to hear you express yourself fully  it was always the unexpected certainly that happened from the altrurian it is merely this he said having come to live rightly upon earth as we believe or having at least ceased to deny god in our statutes and customs the fear of death as it once weighed upon us has been lifted from our souls the mystery of it has so far been taken away that we perceive it as something just and natural now that all unkindness has been banished from among us we can conceive of no such cruelty as death once seemed if we do not know yet the full meaning of death we know that the creator of it and of us meant mercy and blessing by it when one dies we grieve but not as those without hope we do not say that the dead have gone to a better place and then selfishly bewail them for we have the kingdom of heaven upon earth already and we know that wherever they go they will be homesick for altruria and when we think of the years that may pass before we meet them again our hearts ache as theirs must but the presence of the risen christ in our daily lives is our assurance that no one ceases to be and that we shall see our dead again i cannot explain this to you i can only affirm it  the altrurian spoke very solemnly and a reverent hush fell upon the assembly it was broken by the voice of a woman wailing out oh do you suppose if we lived so we should feel so too that i should know my little girl was living  why not asked the altrurian  to my vast astonishment the manufacturer who sat the farthest from me in the same line with mrs makely the professor and the banker rose and asked tremulously and havehave you had any direct communication with the other world has any disembodied spirit returned to testify of the life beyond the grave  the professor nodded significantly across mrs makely to me and then frowned and shook his head i asked her if she knew what he meant why didnt you know that spiritualism was that poor mans foible he lost his son in a railroad accident and ever since  she stopped and gave her attention to the altrurian who was replying to the manufacturers question  we do not need any such testimony our life here makes us sure of the life there at any rate no externation of the supernatural no objective miracle has been wrought in our behalf we have had faith to do what we prayed for and the prescience of which i speak has been added unto us  the manufacturer asked as the bereaved mother had asked and if i lived so should i feel so  again the altrurian answered why not  the poor woman quavered oh i do believe it i just know it must be true  the manufacturer shook his head sorrowfully and sat down and remained there looking at the ground  i am aware the altrurian went on that what i have said as to our realizing the kingdom of heaven on the earth must seem boastful and arrogant that is what you pray for every day but you do not believe it possible for gods will to be done on earth as it is done in heaventhat is you do not if you are like the competitive and monopolistic people we once were we once regarded that petition as a formula vaguely pleasing to the deity but we no more expected his kingdom to come than we expected him to give us each day our daily bread we knew that if we wanted something to eat we should have to hustle for it and get there first i use the slang of that faroff time which i confess had a vulgar vigor  but now everything is changed and the change has taken place chiefly from one causenamely the disuse of money at first it was thought that some sort of circulating medium must be used that life could not be transacted without it but life began to go on perfectly well when each dwelt in the place assigned him which was no better and no worse than any other and when after he had given his three hours a day to the obligatory labors he had a right to his share of food light heat and raiment the voluntary labors to which he gave much time or little brought him no increase of those necessaries but only credit and affection we had always heard it said that the love of money was the root of all evil but we had taken this for a saying merely now we realized it as an active vital truth as soon as money was abolished the power to purchase was gone and even if there had been any means of buying beyond the daily needs with overwork the community had no power to sell to the individual no man owned anything but every man had the right to anything that he could use when he could not use it his right lapsed  with the expropriation of the individual the whole vast catalogue of crimes against property shrank to nothing the thief could only steal from the community but if he stole what was he to do with his booty it was still possible for a depredator to destroy but few mens hate is so comprehensive as to include all other men and when the individual could no longer hurt some other individual in his property destruction ceased  all the many murders done from love of money or of what money could buy were at an end where there was no want men no longer bartered their souls or women their bodies for the means to keep themselves alive the vices vanished with the crimes and the diseases almost as largely disappeared people were no longer sickened by sloth and surfeit or deformed and depleted by overwork and famine they were wholesomely housed in healthful places and they were clad fitly for their labor and fitly for their leisure the caprices of vanity were not suffered to attaint the beauty of the national dress  with the stress of superfluous social and business duties and the perpetual fear of want which all classes felt more or less with the tumult of the cities and the solitude of the country insanity had increased among us till the whole land was dotted with asylums and the mad were numbered by hundreds of thousands in every region they were an army an awful army of anguish and despair now they have decreased to a number so small and are of a type so mild that we can hardly count insanity among our causes of unhappiness  we have totally eliminated chance from our economic life there is still a chance that a man will be tall or short in altruria that he will be strong or weak well or ill gay or grave happy or unhappy in love but none that he will be rich or poor busy or idle live splendidly or meanly these stupid and vulgar accidents of human contrivance cannot befall us but i shall not be able to tell you just how or why or to detail the process of eliminating chance i may say however that it began with the nationalization of telegraphs expresses railroads mines and all large industries operated by stock companies this at once struck a fatal blow at the speculation in values real and unreal and at the stockexchange or bourse we had our own name for that gamblers paradise or gamblers hell whose baleful influence penetrated every branch of business  there were still business fluctuations as long as we had business but they were on a smaller and smaller scale and with the final lapse of business they necessarily vanished all economic chance vanished the founders of the commonwealth understood perfectly that business was the sterile activity of the function interposed between the demand and the supply that it was nothing structural and they intended its extinction and expected it from the moment that money was abolished  this is all pretty tiresome said the professor to our immediate party i dont see why we oblige ourselves to listen to that fellows stuff as if a civilized state could exist for a day without money or business  he went on to give his opinion of the altrurians pretended description in a tone so audible that it attracted the notice of the nearest group of railroad hands who were listening closely to homos and one of them sang out to the professor cant you wait and let the first man finish and another yelled put him out and then they all laughed with a humorous perception of the impossibility of literally executing the suggestion  by the time all was quiet again i heard the altrurian saying as to our social life i cannot describe it in detail but i can give you some notion of its spirit we make our pleasures civic and public as far as possible and the ideal is inclusive and not exclusive there are of course festivities which all cannot share but our distribution into small communities favors the possibility of all doing so our daily life however is so largely social that we seldom meet by special invitation or engagement when we do it is with the perfect understanding that the assemblage confers no social distinction but is for a momentary convenience in fact these occasions are rather avoided recalling as they do the vapid and tedious entertainments of the competitive epoch the receptions and balls and dinners of a semibarbaric people striving for social prominence by shutting a certain number in and a certain number out and overdressing overfeeding and overdrinking anything premeditated in the way of a pleasure we think stupid and mistaken we like to meet suddenly or on the spur of the moment outofdoors if possible and arrange a picnic or a dance or a play and let people come and go without ceremony no one is more host than guest all are hosts and guests people consort much according to their tastesliterary musical artistic scientific or mechanicalbut these tastes are made approaches not barriers and we find out that we have many more tastes in common than was formerly supposed  but after all our life is serious and no one among us is quite happy in the general esteem unless he has dedicated himself in some special way to the general good our ideal is not rights but duties  mazzini whispered the professor  the greatest distinction which any one can enjoy with us is to have found out some new and signal way of serving the community and then it is not good form for him to seek recognition the doing any fine thing is the purest pleasure it can give applause flatters but it hurts too and our benefactors as we call them have learned to shun it  we are still far from thinking our civilization perfect but we are sure that our civic ideals are perfect what we have already accomplished is to have given a whole continent perpetual peace to have founded an economy in which there is no possibility of want to have killed out political and social ambition to have disused money and eliminated chance to have realized the brotherhood of the race and to have outlived the fear of death  the altrurian suddenly stopped with these words and sat down he had spoken a long time and with a fulness which my report gives little notion of but though most of his cultivated listeners were weary and a good many ladies had left their seats and gone back to the hotel not one of the natives or the workpeople of any sort had stirred now they remained a moment motionless and silent before they rose from all parts of the field and shouted go on dont stop tell us all about it  i saw reuben camp climb the shoulders of a big fellow near where the altrurian had stood he waved the crowd to silence with outspread arms he isnt going to say anything more hes tired but if any man dont think hes got his dollars worth let him walk up to the door and the ticketagent will refund him his money  the crowd laughed and some one shouted good for you reub  camp continued but our friend here will shake the hand of any man woman or child that wants to speak to him and you neednt wipe it on the grass first either hes a man and i want to say that hes going to spend the next week with us at my mothers house and we shall be glad to have you call  the crowd the rustic and ruder part of it cheered and cheered till the mountain echoes answered then a railroader called for three times three with a tiger and got it the guests of the hotel broke away and went toward the house over the long shadows of the meadow the lower classes pressed forward on camps invitation  well did you ever hear a more disgusting rigmarole asked mrs makely as our little group halted indecisively about her  with all those imaginary commonwealths to draw upon from plato through more bacon and campanella down to bellamy and morris he has constructed the shakiest effigy ever made of old clothes stuffed with straw said the professor  the manufacturer was silent the banker said i dont know he grappled pretty boldly with your insinuations that frank declaration that altruria was all these pretty soapbubble worlds solidified was rather fine  it was splendid cried mrs makely the lawyer and the minister came toward us from where they had been sitting together she called out to them why in the world didnt one of your gentlemen get up and propose a vote of thanks  the difficulty with me is continued the banker that he has rendered altruria incredible i have no doubt that he is an altrurian but i doubt very much if he comes from anywhere in particular and i find this quite a blow for we had got altruria nicely located on the map and were beginning to get accounts of it in the newspapers  yes that is just exactly the way i feel about it sighed mrs makely but still dont you think there ought to have been a vote of thanks mr bullion  why certainly the fellow was immensely amusing and you must have got a lot of money by him it was an oversight not to make him a formal acknowledgment of some kind if we offered him money he would have to leave it all behind him here when he went home to altruria  just as we do when we go to heaven i suggested the banker did not answer and i instantly felt that in the presence of the minister my remark was out of taste  well then dont you think said mrs makely who had a leathery insensibility to everything but the purpose possessing her that we ought at least to go and say something to him personally  yes i think we ought said the banker and we all walked up to where the altrurian stood still thickly surrounded by the lower classes who were shaking hands with him and getting in a word with him now and then  one of the construction gang said carelessly no allrail route to altruria i suppose  no answered homos its a far sea voyage  well i shouldnt mind working my passage if you think theyd let me stay after i got there  ah you mustnt go to altruria you must let altruria come to you returned homos with that confounded smile of his that always won my heart  yes shouted reuben camp whose thin face was red with excitement thats the word have altruria right here and right now  the old farmer who had several times spoken cackled out i didnt know one while when you was talkn about not havin no money but what some on us had had altrury here for quite a spell already i dont pass moren fifty dollas through my hands most years  a laugh went up and then at sight of mrs makely heading our little party the people round homos civilly made way for us she rushed upon him and seized his hand in both of hers she dropped her fan parasol gloves handkerchief and vinaigrette in the grass to do so oh mr homos she fluted and the tears came into her eyes it was beautiful beautiful every word of it i sat in a perfect trance from beginning to end and i felt that it was all as true as it was beautiful people all around me were breathless with interest and i dont know how i can ever thank you enough  yes indeed the professor hastened to say before the altrurian could answer and he beamed malignantly upon him through his spectacles while he spoke it was like some strange romance  i dont know that i should go so far as that said the banker in his turn but it certainly seemed too good to be true  yes the altrurian responded simply but a little sadly now that i am away from it all and in conditions so different i sometimes had to ask myself as i went on if my whole life had not hitherto been a dream and altruria were not some blessed vision of the night  then you know how to account for a feeling which i must acknowledge too the lawyer asked courteously but it was most interesting  the kingdom of god upon earth said the ministerit ought not to be incredible but that more than anything else you told us of gave me pause  you of all men returned the altrurian gently  yes said the minister with a certain dejection when i remember what i have seen of men when i reflect what human nature is how can i believe that the kingdom of god will ever come upon the earth  but in heaven where he reigns who is it does his will the spirits of men pursued the altrurian  yes but conditioned as men are here  but if they were conditioned as men are there  now i cant let you two good people get into a theological dispute mrs makely pushed in here is mr twelvemough dying to shake hands with mr homos and compliment his distinguished guest  ah mr homos knows what i must have thought of his talk without my telling him i began skilfully but i am sorry that i am to lose my distinguished guest so soon  reuben camp broke out that was my blunder mr twelvemough mr homos and i had talked it over conditionally and i was not to speak of it till he had told you but it slipped out in the excitement of the moment  oh its all right i said and i shook hands cordially with both of them it will be the greatest possible advantage for mr homos to see certain phases of american life at close range and he couldnt possibly see them under better auspices than yours camp  yes im going to drive him through the hill country after haying and then im going to take him down and show him one of our big factory towns  i believe this was done but finally the altrurian went on to new york where he was to pass the winter we parted friends i even offered him some introductions but his acquaintance had become more and more difficult and i was not sorry to part with him that taste of his for low company was incurable and i was glad that i was not to be responsible any longer for whatever strange thing he might do next i think he remained very popular with the classes he most affected a throng of natives construction hands and tablegirls saw him off on his train and he left large numbers of such admirers in our house and neighborhood devout in the faith that there was such a commonwealth as altruria and that he was really an altrurian as for the more cultivated people who had met him they continued of two minds upon both points  the end
