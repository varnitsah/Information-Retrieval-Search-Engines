49234316	the rover boys in the jungle  or  stirring adventures in africa   by arthur m winfield edward stratemeyer    introduction  my dear boys  this volume the rover boys in the jungle is the third story of the rover boys series and while a complete tale in itself forms a companion story to the rover boys at school and the rover boys on the ocean which preceded it  in the former volumes i told you much of the doings of dick tom and sam at putnam hall and during a remarkable chase on the atlantic ocean  in the present story the scene is shifted from the military academy where the boys are cadets to the wilds of africa whither the lads with their uncle have gone to look for anderson rover the boys father who had disappeared many years before a remarkable message from the sea causes the party to leave this country and they journey to africa little dreaming of all the stirring adventures which await them in the heart of the dark continent how they battle against their many perils and what the outcome of their remarkable search is i will leave for the pages that follow to explain  in conclusion let me state that i am extremely grateful for the kind favor given the previous volumes of this series and i sincerely trust that the present tale merits a continuance of your support  affectionately and sincerely yours  edward stratemeyer november 10 1899    the rover boys in the jungle     chapter i  unpleasant news  back to putnam hall again boys  hurrah  yes back again tom and glad of it returned dick rover  i can tell you the academy is getting to be a regular second home  right you are dick came from sam rover the youngest of the three brothers  id rather be here than up to the farm even if uncle randolph and aunt martha are kind and considerate  the farm is so slow   while here we have our full share of adventures and more finished tom  i wonder what will happen to us this term  the other terms kept us mighty busy didnt they  im not looking for any more outside adventures said dick with a serious shake of his head  our enemies have been disposed of and i dont want to hear of or see them again  nor i  but well hear of them nevertheless mark my words the baxters wont leave us rest  they are a hard crowd and buddy girk is just as bad finished tom  it was the opening of the spring term at putnam hall military academy and the three rover boys had just come up from cedarville in the carryall driven by peleg snuggers the generalutility man of the place  their old chums frank harrington fred garrison larry colby and a number of others had already arrived so the boys did not lack for company  as they entered the spacious building genial captain putnam greeted each with a hearty handshake and a pleasant word also came to them from george strong the head assistant  for the benefit of those who have not read the other books of this series entitled the rover boys at school and the rover boys on the ocean i would state that the rover boys were three in number dick being the oldest tom next and sam the youngest as already mentioned  whether the boys were orphans or not was a question which could not be answered  upon the death of their mother their father a rich mine owner and geological expert had left the boys in the care of his brother randolph rover an eccentric gentleman who devoted his entire time to scientific farming  mr anderson rover had then journeyed to the western coast of africa hoping to locate some valuable gold mines in the heart of the dark continent  he had plunged into the interior with a number of natives and that was the last heard of him although mr randolph rover had made diligent inquiries concerning his whereabouts  all of the boys were bright funloving fellows and to keep them out of mischief randolph rover had sent them off to putnam hall a first class school located some distance from cedarville a pretty town on lake cayuga in new york state  here the lads had made numerous friends and incidentally a number of enemies  of the friends several have already been named and others will come to the front as our story proceeds  of the enemies the principal ones were arnold baxter a man who had tried years before to defraud the boys father out of a gold mine in the west and his son dan who had once been the bully of putnam hall arnold baxters tool was a goodfornothing scamp named buddy girk who had once robbed dick of his watch  both of these men were now in jail charged with an important robbery in albany and the rover boys had aided in bringing the men to justice  dan the bully was also under arrest charged with the abduction of dom stanhope  dom who was dick rovers dearest friend had been carried off by the directions of josiah crabtree a former teacher of putnam hall who wished to marry mrs stanhope and thus get his hands on the money the widow held in trust for her daughter but the abduction had been nipped in the bud and josiah crabtree had fled leaving dan baxter to shoulder the blame of the transaction how dora was restored to her mother and what happened afterward old readers already know  a winter had passed since the events narrated above and before and after the holidays the rover boys had studied diligently to make up for the time lost on that nevertobeforgotten ocean chase  their efforts had not been in vain and each lad had been promoted to the next higher class much to randolph rovers  satisfaction and the joy of their tenderhearted aunt martha  the boys are all right even if they do love to play pranks was randolph rovers comment when he heard of the promotions  i trust they improve their time during the term to come  they are good boys randolph returned mr rover  they would not be real boys if they did not cut up once in a while  as to their daring  why they simply take after their father  poor man  if only we knew what had become of him  yes a great weight would be lifted from our shoulders martha if we knew that  but we do not know and there seems to be no way of finding out  i have written to the authorities at various places in africa until i know not whom to address next  he must be dead otherwise he would write or come home randolph he was not one to keep us in the dark so long  i cannot believe my brother dead and the boys will not believe it either  do you know what dick said to me before he left for school  he said that if we didnt get word he was going to africa some day to hunt his father up  to africa  what will that boy do in such a jungle and among such fierce natives  he will be killed  perhaps not  the boy is uncommonly shrewd when it comes to dealing with his enemies  just look how nicely he and tom and sam served arnold baxter and those others  it was wonderful doings  for boys  yes but they may not be so successful always randolph  i should hate to see them run into any more danger  so should i my dear  but they will take care of themselves i feel that more and more every day concluded randolph rover and there for the time being the subject was dropped  i wonder what has become of old josiah crabtree remarked dick rover as he and his brothers walked around the parade ground to inspect several improvement which captain putnam had caused to be made  im sure i cant guess answered tom  like as not he became scared to death  i suppose youll be satisfied if he keeps away from dora and her mother in the future  yes i never want to set eyes on him again tom  he worried the widow half to death with his strange ways  i wonder how the baxters feel to be locked up put in sam  i know arnold baxter is used to it but its a new experience for dan  dan is as bad as his father broke in larry colby who had joined the brothers  i was glad to hear that mumps had turned over a new leaf and cut the bully dead  oh so were all of us said tom  by the way do you know where mumps is now  in the mining business out west acting as some sort of a clerk  a spell in the west will take the nonsense out of him came from dick  it was a great pity he ever got under dan baxters influence i wonder how arnold baxter is getting along  he was quite severely wounded you know during that tussle on the yachts  hes about over that so frank harrington says replied larry ill wager he is mighty bitter against you fellows for having put him where he is  it was his own fault larry  if a person is going to do wrong he must take the consequences mr baxter might today be a fairly welltodo mine owner of the west and dan might be a leading cadet here  but instead they both threw themselves away  and now they must take what comes  my father used to say it took all kind of people to make a world went on larry  but i reckon we could do without the baxter and the buddy girk kind  and the josiah crabtree kind added sam  dont forget that miserable sneak  perhaps crabtree has reformed like mumps  it wasnt in him to reform larry came from tom  oh how i detested him with his slick oily tongue  i wish they had caught him and placed him where he deserved to be with the baxters  yes and then we could  began sam when he stopped  hullo frank what are you running so fast about he cried  just got a letter from my father  burst out frank harrington as he came up out of breath  i knew you would want to hear the news  dan baxter has escaped from jail and the authorities dont know where to look for him      chapter ii  newcomers at the academy   dan baxter has escaped repeated dick  that is news indeed does your father give my particulars  he says it is reported that the jailer was sick and unable to stop dan  humph  then they must have had some sort of a row put in tom well it does beat the nation how the baxters do it  dont you remember how arnold baxter escaped from the hospital authorities last year  those baxters are as slick as you can make them said frank ive been thinking if dan would dare to show himself around putnam hall  not he cried larry  hell travel as far can and as fast as he can  perhaps not mused dick i rather he will hang around and try to help his father out of prison  that wont help him for the authorities will be on strict guard now  you know the stable door is always locked after the horse is stolen  at this there was a general laugh and when it ended a loud roll of a drum made the young cadets hurry to the front of the parade ground  fall in companies a and b came the command from the major of the battalion and the boys fell in  dick was now a first lieutenant while tom and sam were first and second sergeants respectively  as soon as the companies were formed they were marched around the hall and to the messroom  here they were kept standing in a long fine while george strong came to the front with half a dozen new pupils  young gentlemen i will introduce to you several who will join your ranks for this season said the head assistant  then he began to name the half dozen  among others they included a roundfaced german youth named hans mueller and a tall lank redhaired boy of irish descent who rejoiced in the name of jim caven  ill wager the dutch boy is full of fun whispered sam to tom you can see it in his eyes  i dont like the looks of that jim caven returned tom  he looks like a worse sneak than mumps ever was  i agree there  perhaps we had better keep our eyes open for him  despite this talk however the newcomers were welcomed cordially and to the credit of the students be it said that each old cadet did all in his power to make the new boys feel perfectly at home  mine fadder vos von soldier py der cherman army said hans mueller  dots vy he sent me py a military academy ven we come py dis country  glad to know you intend to help us fight the indians answered tom innocently  me fight der indians  vot you means py dot demanded hans his lightblue eyes wide open with interest  why dont you know that we are here to learn how to fight indians went on tom with a side wink at those around him  no i dink me dis vos von school only  so it is  a school to learn how to shoot and scalp  schalp  vots dot  cut an indians topknot off with a knife this way and tom made an imaginary slash at hans golden locks  tont do dot stammered the german boy falling back  no i tont vant to learn to schalp noputty  but you are willing to fight the indians are you not put in sam  we are all going to do that you know  i tont like dem indians sighed hans  i see me some of dem vonde by a show in chermany und i vos afraid  at this a laugh went up  how much further the joke would have been carried it is impossible to say but just then a bell rang and the boys had to go into the classroom  but tom remembered about the indians as the others found out about a week later  as the majority of the scholars had been to the hall before it did not take long for matters to become settled and in a few days all of the boys felt thoroughly at home that is all but jim caven who went around with that same sneaking look on his face that tom had first noticed  he made but few friends and those only among the smaller boys who had plenty of pocket money to spend  caven rarely showed any money of his own  with the coming of spring the cadets formed as of old several football teams and played several notches including one with their old rivals the pupils of pornell academy  this game they lost by a score of four to five which made the pornellites feel much better they having lost every game in the past for the doings of the putnam hall students previous to the arrival at that institution of the rover boys see the putnam hall series the first volume of which is entitled the putnam hall cadets  publisher  well we cant expect to beat always said tom who played quarterback on the putnam team  we gave them a close brush  yes and we might have won if larry hadnt slipped and sprained his ankle put in sam  well never mind better luck next time well play them again next fall  sam was right so far as a game between the rival academies was concerned but none of the rover boys were on hand to take part in the contest  for reasons which the chapter to follow will disclose  with the football came kiteflying and wonderful indeed were some of the kites which the boys manufactured  i can tell you if a fellow had time he could reduce kiteflying to a regular science said dick  oh dick dont give us any more science cried sam  we get enough of science from uncle randolph with his scientific farming fowlraising and the like  i would just as lief fly an oldfashioned kite as anything  dick is right though put in fred garrison  now you have a big flatkite there three times larger than mine  yet ill wager my little box kite will fly higher than your kite  done cried sam  what shall the wager be  ice cream for the boys of our dormitory answered fred  all right but how is a fellow to get the cream if he loses  thats for him to find out sam  if i lose ill sneak off to cedarville as dick did once and buy what i need  ice cream for our room it is said frank  and mums the word about the wager or captain putnam will spoil the whole affair if he gets wind of it  make me stakeholder grinned tom  id just like to lay hands on about two quarts of chocolate cream  there wont be any stakeholder said dick  but when is this kiteflying contest to come off  the matter was talked over and it was decided to wait until the next saturday which would be as usual a halfholiday  in the meantime some of the other boys heard there was going to be a contest although they knew nothing of the wager made and half a dozen other matches were arranged  saturday proved to be cool and clear with a stiff breeze blowing directly from the west   this being so it was decided in order to get clear of the woods in front of the hall to hold the contests on bakers plain a level patch of ground some distance to the westward  the cadets were soon on the way shouting and laughing merrily over the sport promised  only a few remained behind including jim caven who gave as his excuse that he had a headache  im glad he is not with us said dick  i declare for some reason i cant bear to have him around  nor i returned frank  its queer but he gives me the shivers whenever he comes near me  its a wonder he came here at all  he doesnt belong in our style of a crowd  to reach bakers plain the cadets had to make a detour around a high cliff which overlooked a rocky watercourse which flowed into cayuga lake  they moved slowly as nobody wished to damage his kite and it was after two oclock before all hands were ready for the first trial at kiteflying  gracious but it is blowing cried tom  sam have you a good strong cord on your kite  the strongest i could get answered the youngest rover  i guess it is stronger than what fred has  my kite wont pull like yours said fred garrison  all ready  yes  then up they go  and may the best kite win  soon a dozen kites of various kinds were soaring in the air some quite steadily and others darting angrily from side to side  one went up with a swoop to come down with a bang on the rocks thus knocking itself into a hundred pieces  mine cracious look at dot burst out hans mueller  mine gretchen kite vos busted up  und i spent me feefteen cents on him alreety and a roar went up  never mind hans said dick you can help sail the katydid she will pull strong enough for two i am sure  the katydid was a wonderful affair of silver and gold which dick had constructed on ideas entirely his own  it went up slowly but surely and proved to be as good a kite as the majority  a number of girls living in the neighborhood bad heard of the kiteflying contests and now they came up dora stanhope with the rest accompanied by her two cousins grace and nellie laning  as my old readers may guess dick was very attentive to dora and his brothers were scarcely less so to the two laning sisters  and how is your mother dick asked of dom during the course of their conversation  she is much better replied dora although she is still weak from her sickness  does she ever mention josiah crabtree  she mentioned him once  she said that she had dreamed of him and of you nick  me  and what was the dream  oh  it was only a silly affair dick not worth mentioning  but i would like to know what it was  well then she dreamed that both of you were in a big forest and he was about to attack you with a gun or a club she couldnt tell which  she awoke screaming and i ran to her side and that is how she told me of the dream      chapter iii  an old enemy turns up  that was certainly an odd dream said dick after a short pause i am sure i never want to meet josiah crabtree under such circumstances  it was silly dick  id forget it if i was you  and she never mentioned the man at any other time  no  but i am certain she is glad he has left for parts unknown i never never want to see him again and the girl shivered  dont be alarmed dora i dont think he will dare to show himself answered dick and on the sly gave her hand a tight squeeze  they were warmer friends than ever since dick had rescued her from those who had abducted her  the kiteflying was now in full blast as sam expressed it and the boys had all they could do to keep the various lines from becoming tangled up  his own kite and freds were side by side and for a long time it looked as if neither would mount above the other  run her up fred  you can win if you try cried several of the cadets  play out a bit more sam you havent given your kite all the slack she wants said others  so the talk ran on while each contestant did the best to make his kite mount higher  in the meantime the wind kept increasing in violence making each kite pull harder than ever  its a dandy for flying panted tom who was holding his kite with all the strength he possessed  something must give way soon and something did give way  it was the string he was holding and as it snapped he went over on his back in such a comical fashion that all even to the girls had to laugh  torn  tom  what a sight burst out nellie laning  you should have brought a stronger cord  if i had id agone up in the clouds answered tom ruefully thats the last of that kite i suppose if i   the string has caught on sams kite interrupted grace laning oh my  see both of them going up  now you can win sam laughed dora  fred your flying is nowhere now  he didnt calculate to fly one kite against two answered fred hold on sam where are you going  the cliff is over in that direction he yelled suddenly  i  i know it came back the alarming answer  but i cant stop myself  he cant stop himself repeated dora  oh stop him somebody before he goes over the cliff  let go of the line shouted dick  dont go any closer to the cliff  i  i cant let go  the line is fast around my wrist gasped poor sam  oh dear its cutting me like a knife  hes in a mess came from frank  if he isnt careful hell go over the cliff as sure as hes born  throw yourself down went on dick and leaving his kite in hans muellers care he ran after his brother  by this time sam had gained a few bushes which grew but a dozen feet away from the edge of the cliff that at this point was nearly forty feet in height  with his right hand held a painful prisoner he clutched at the bushes with his left  ive got the bushes but i cant hold on long he panted as dick came close  help me quick  scarcely had the words left his mouth when the bushes came up by the roots and poor sam fell over on his side  then came another strong puff of wind and he was dragged to the very edge of the rocky ledge  im going he screamed when making a mighty leap dick caught him by the foot  catch the rock  anything cried the older brother  if you dont youll be killed  save me was all poor sam could say  oh dick dont let me go over  ill do my best sam was dicks answer and he held on like grim death  by this time half a dozen boys were running to the scene  dora stanhope followed and as she came up she pulled a tiny penknife from her pocket  cant i cut the line with this she asked timidly as she pushed her way to dicks side  yes yes cut it moaned sam  oh my wrist is almost cut in two  stooping low dora sawed away at the kite line which was as taut as a string on a bass fiddle  suddenly there was a loud snap and the cord parted  sam and dick fell back from the edge of the cliff while the entangled kites soared away for parts unknown  thank heaven you cut the line dora said dick who was the first to recover from the excitement of the situation  he saw that dom was trembling like a leaf and he hastened to her support but she pushed him away and pointed to sam  dont mind me  i am all right dick she said  go care for poor sam  see how his wrist is bleeding  oh how dreadful  here is my handkerchief he had better bind it up with that said grace laning as she offered the article  well wash the wound first put in frank and raced off for some water  soon he returned with his stiff hat full and the cut on sams wrist was tenderly washed by the laning girls who then bound it up with the skill of a hospital surgeon  the kiteflying continued for the balance of the afternoon  but sam and dick had had enough of it and along with tom they took a stroll along the lake front with dora stanhope and grace and nellie  of course both boys and girls talked a whole lot of nonsense yet all enjoyed the walk very much  this is the spot where they abducted me shivered dora as they came to the old boathouse  oh what a dreadful time that was to be sure  i dont believe our enemies will bother you any more dora said dick  its not likely that old crabtree will try the same game twice and mumps has really turned over a new leaf and gone to work for a living  yes i was glad to hear that for i dont believe he was such a bad fellow at heart  he was under dan baxters influence just as  as   as josiah crabtree tried to influence your mother whispered dick and dora nodded slowly  well let us forget it and  my gracious  dick stopped short to stare in openmouthed wonder at a small boat shooting down the lake at a distance of several hundred yards from the shore  whats up came simultaneously from tom and sam  dont you see that fellow in the boat demanded dick in increased wonder  of course we see him answered tom  dont you recognize him  no hes too far off came from sam  its dan baxter  baxter cried dora  oh dick  nonsense said tom  how could he be am here  it does look a little like baxter was sams slow comment  yet it seems impossible that he could be here as tom says  i say its baxter affirmed dick stoutly  ill hail him and make sure  oh dont bring him over here interposed dora becoming alarmed  dont be alarmed  he shant hurt anybody dora dick raised his voice  hi there baxter  what are you doing here  at first there was no reply and the boy in the rowboat kept on pulling  but as dick repeated his call the rower threw up his oars  you mind your own business he growled  guess i can row on the lake if i want to  it is baxter sure enough ejaculated tom  the rascal  we ought to recapture him  thats the talk added sam  i wish my wrist wasnt so sore  id go after him  theres a boat below here said dick  lets put out in that  he may  may shoot at you faltered dora  you know how wicked he can be at times  indeed i do know answered dick  but he ought to be handed over to the authorities  it is a crime to let him go free  hi baxter  come over here we want to talk to you yelled tom  not much growled the former bully of putnam hall  you had better come said sam  if you dont come well bring you  hush sam or youll make a mess of things cried dick softly but the warning came too late  will you bring me back roared the bully  just try it on and see how ill fix you  come on for the boat said tom  well show him he cant scare us  he started off and dick came after him  sam was also about to follow when his elder brother stopped him  you cant do much with that sore wrist sam he said  better stay with the girls until we come back  you can watch events from the shore and run for assistance if its necessary  sam demurred at first but soon saw the wisdom of  dicks reasoning and consented to remain behind  by this time tom had shoved out the rowboat dick had mentioned  a neat craft belonging to a farmer living near  a pair of oars lay in a locker on the lake bank and securing these tom leaped on board of the craft and soon dick came after  dan baxter had watched their movement with interest which speedily gave way to arm when he saw the other boat come out and beheld dick and tom each take up an oar and begin to pull for all they could  i was a clam to come up here when there  is no real need for it he muttered  two to one eh  well i reckon i can put up a pretty stiff fight if it comes to the worst then he caught up his oars once more and began to row down cayuga lake with all possible speed      chapter iv  the chase on the lake  he means to give us as much of a chase as possible remarked tom as he glanced over his shoulder  if i remember rightly baxter was always a pretty fair oarsman  yes that was the one thing he could do well returned dick but we ought to be able to catch him tom  we could if we had two pairs of oars  one pair can do just about so much and no more  nonsense  now both together and put all your muscle into it and dick set a stiff stroke that his brother followed with difficulty  baxter had been rowing down the lake but as soon as he saw that he was being pursued he changed his course for the east shore  he was settled to his work and for several minutes it was hard to tell whether he was holding his own or losing  hurrah we are catching up cried dick after pulling for five minutes  keep at it tom and well have him before he is half over  gosh but its hot work came with a pant from tom rover  he must be almost exhausted to row like that  he knows what he has at stake  he sees the prison cell staring him in the face again  youd do your best too if you were in his place  im doing my best now dick  on we go and tom renewed his exertions  dick set a faster stroke than ever having caught his second wind and the rowboat flew over the calm surface of the lake like a thing of life  keep off  the cry came from baxter while he was still a hundred yards from the eastern shore  keep off or it will be the worse for you  we are not afraid of you baxter and you ought to know it by this time answered dick  you may as well give in now as later on  give in  you must be crazy  we are two to one and you know what we have been able to do in the past  humph  i dont intend to go to jug again and that is all there is to it  maybe you cant help yourself  well see about that  are you  going to keep off or not  dont ask foolish a question  you wont keep off  no  if you dont i  ill shoot you  as dan baxter spoke he stopped rowing and brought from a hip pocket a highly polished nickelplated revolver  do you see this he demanded as he pointed the weapon toward the rover boys  both dick and tom were taken aback at the sight of the weapon but they had seen such arms before and had faced them consequently they were not as greatly alarmed as they right otherwise have been  they knew too that dan baxter was a notoriously bad shot  put that up baxter said dick calmly  it may only get you into deeper trouble  i dont care said the bully recklessly  im not going back to jail and that is all there is to it  you wont dare to shoot at us and you know it put in tom as the two boats drifted closer together  i will and dont you fool yourself on it  drop those oars or ill fire as sure as my name is dan baxter and the revolver which had been partly lowered was raised a second time  it must be confessed that dick and tom were much disconcerted the two rowboats were now less than fifty feet apart and any kind of a shot from the weapon was likely to prove more or less dangerous  baxters eyes gleamed with the hatred of an angry snake ready to strike  you think you are smart you rover boys said the bully after an awkward pause all around  you think you did a big thing in rescuing dom stanhope and in putting me and my father and buddy girk in prison  but let me tell you that this game hasnt come to an end yet and some day we intend to square accounts  there is no use in wasting breath in this fashion baxter returned dick as calmly as he could  we are two to one and the best thing to do is for you to submit  if you fire on us we may do a little shooting on our own account  humph  do you imagine you can scare me in that fashion  you havent any pistol and i know it  if you had you would have drawn the weapon long ago  at this dick bit his lip  dont be too sure he said steadily as the boats drifted still closer together  the minute i heard you had escaped from jail i went and bought a pistol in cedarville  this was the strict truth but dick did not add that the weapon lay at that moment safe in the bottom of his trunk at the hall  got afraid id come around eh  i knew there was nothing like becoming prepared  now will you   dick did not have time to finish for lowering the front end of the pistol dan baxter pulled the trigger twice and two reports rang out in quick succession  one bullet buried itself in the seat beside tom while the second plowed its way through the bottom near the stern  you villain cried dick and in his excitement hurled his oar at dan baxter hitting the fellow across the fact with such force that the bullys nose began to bleed  the shock made baxter lose his hold on the pistol and it went over the side of his craft and sank immediately to the bottom of the lake  my but that was a close shave muttered tom as he gazed at the hole through the seat  a little closer and i would have got it in the stomach  a yell now came from sam and a shriek from the girls all of whom had heard the pistol shots  they were too far away to see the result of the shooting and feared both tom and dick had been killed or wounded  as quickly as he could recover from the blow of the oar dan baxter picked up his own blades and without paying attention to the blood which was flowing from his nose began once again to pull for the shore  come on his pistol is gone shouted dick and then his face fell confound it ive thrown away my oar  there it goes  and he pointed some distance to their left  that isnt the worst of it groaned tom look at that hole in the bottom made by that pistol shot  the water is coming in just as fast as it can  there was small need to call attention to it for the water in the bottom of the boat was already an inch deep  dick started in perplexity then struck by a sudden idea drew a lead pencil from his pocket and rammed it into the opening  it fitted very well and the water ceased to come in  now well have to bail out and pick up that other oar said tom it was foolish to throw it away dick  i dont know about that  it deprived baxter of his pistol paddle over and ill pick it up  tom did so and the blade was speedily recovered  but dan baxter had made good use of the precious moments lost by the rover boys and hardly were the latter into shape for rowing once more than they saw the bully beach his craft and leap out on the shore  goodby to you he cried mockingly  i told you that you couldnt catch me  the next time we meet ill make you sorry that you ever followed me and he started to run off with all possible speed  tom and dick were too chagrined to answer him and pulled forward to the shore in silence  they ran the craft into some bushes and tied up and then started after baxter who was now making for the woods south of the village of nelson  when the highway skirting this portion of cayuga lake was gained dan baxter was a good five hundred feet ahead of them  a turn in the road soon hid him from view  gaining the bend they discovered that he had disappeared from view altogether  he has taken to the woods sighed dick  if that is so we may as well give the hunt up answered his brother  it would be worse than looking for a pin in a haystack for we wouldnt know what direction he had taken  i wish i had a bloodhound with which to trail him  he ought to be run down tom  well let us notify some of the people living near and see what can be done  they ran on to the spot where they supposed baxter had left the highway  on both sides were dense thickets of cedars with heavy underbrush  all in all the locality formed an ideal hiding place  night was coming on by the time they gained the nearest farmhouse here they found three men to whom they explained the situation all of the men smiled grimly  if he went into the woods it would be a hard job to trail him was the comment from farmer mason  if he aint careful hell lose himself so completely hell never git out bgosh  well i dont know but what that would suit me responded tom dryly  the search was begun and several others joined in  it lasted until night was fairly upon the party and was then given up in disgust  its no use said dick  he has slipped us  but we ought to notify the authorities said tom  they will probably put a detective on his track  yes but a detective cant do any more than we can up in this wild locality  he wont remain in the woods forever  hell starve to death  well we can send the police a telegram from cedarville  this was done and the rover boys returned to putnam hall by way of the side road leaving past the homes of the stanhopes and the lanings  they found sam and the girls very anxious concerning their welfare  we were afraid you had been shot said dora  i am thankful that you escaped  so am i put in sam  but its too bad that baxter got away  i wonder where he will turn up next  they all wondered but could not even venture an answer  soon the boys left the girls and hurried to the academy where their story had to be told over again  captain putnam looked exceedingly grave over the narrative  you must be careful in the future lads he said  remember you are in my care here  i do not know what your uncle would say if anything should happen to you  we will be on our guard in the future answered dick  but i am awfully sorry we didnt catch him  so am i  but perhaps the authorities will have better luck and there the talk came to an end and the boys retired for the night      chapter v  fun and an explosion  several days slipped by and the boys waited anxiously for some news from the authorities  but none came and they rightfully surmised that for the time being dan baxter had made good his escape  on account of the disastrous ending to the kiteflying match many had supposed that the feast in dormitory no 6 was not to come off but sam tom frank and several others got their heads together and prepared for a layout for the following wednesday which would be dicks birthday  well give him a surprise said sam and so it was agreed passing around the hat netted exactly three dollars and a quarter and tom sam and fred garrison were delegated to purchase the candies cake and ice cream which were to constitute the spread  well do the thing up brown said sam  we must strike higher than that feast we had last year  right you are came from tom oh dear do you remember how we served mumps that night and he set up a roar over the remembrance of the scene  hans mueller had become one of the occupants of the dormitory and he was as much interested as anybody in the preparations for the spread dot vill pe fine he said  i like to have von feast twist a veek ha i ha  hes a jolly dog said tom to frank  but say ive been thinking of having some fun with him before this spread comes off  let me in on the ground floor pleaded frank who always wok a great interest in toms jokes  i will on one condition frank  and what is that  that you loan me that masquerade suit you have in your trunk the one you used at that new years dance at home  you mean that indian rig  yes  hullo i reckon i smell a mouse laughed the senators son  i heard you giving hans that yarn about us training to fight indians  did you indeed  i did indeed and i heard hans say that he wanted nothing to do with the indians  well hes going to have something to do with at least one indian grinned tom  what do you say i get the suit  yes if youll fix it so that i can see the sport  all of the crowd can see it if they dont leak about it returned the funloving rover  tom soon had the masquerade suit in his possession and also some face paints which frank had saved from the new years dance mentioned shortly afterward tom joined the crowd in the gymnasium where hans mueller was trying to do some vaulting over the bars  i dink i could chump dem sticks of i vos taller the german youth was saying  or the sticks were lower replied tom with a wink at the crowd thats right hans you had better learn how to jump now and to run too  the indians have come put in frank  indians repeated hans mueller  vere is da  they say a band of them are in the woods around here answered tom  if you go out you want to be careful or they may scalp you  cracious rofer tont say dot cried mueller in alarm  vot is dem indians doing here annavay  they came in east to hunt up some buffalo that got away  they had something like half a million in a corral and about two thousand got away from them  this preposterous announcement was taken by hans mueller in all seriousness and he asked tom all sorts of ridiculous questions about the savage red men whom he supposed as wild and wily as those of generations ago  no i tont vonts to meet any of dem he said at last  da vos von pad lot alretty  thats right hans you give them a wide berth said tom and walked away  later on tom persuaded dick to ask hans if he would not walk down to cedarville for him to buy him a baseball  eager to be accommodating the german youth received the necessary permission to leave the academy acres and hurried off at the full speed of his sturdy legs  now for some fun cried tom and ran off for the indian suit and the face paints  these he took down to the bam and set to work to transform himself into a wildlooking red man  youre a lively one grinned peleg snuggers who stood watching him  we never had such a lad as you before master thomas  thanks peleg and perhaps youll never have one like me again  and then youll be dreadfully sorry  or glad murmured peleg  mums the word old man  oh i never say nuthin master thomas you know that returned the manofallwork  a number of the other pupils had been let into the secret and led by dick they ran off to the woods lining the cedarville road tom came after them skulking along that nobody driving by might catch sight of him  not quite an hour later hans mueller was heard coming back  the german boy was humming to himself and at the same time throwing up the new ball he had purchased for dick  burra  burra thundered out tom as he leaped from behind a big tree  dutcha boy heap big scalpme take um  burra  and he danced up to hans flourishing a big tin knife as he did so  the masquerade was a perfect one and he looked like an indian who had just stepped forth from some wild west show  ach du screamed hans as he stopped short and grew white its dem indians come to take mine hair  oh please mister indian tont vos touch me  dutcha boy heap nice hair continued tom drawing nearer  maka nice doormat for big wolf  burra  no no tont vos touch mine hairit vos all der hair i vos got howled hans  please mister indian mans let me go  and then he started to back away  white bay stop or big wolf shoot bellowed tom drawing forth a rusty pistol he had picked up in the barn  this rusty pistol had done lots of duty at funmaking before  no no tont shoot screamed hans  then he fell on his knees in despair  tom could scarcely keep from laughing at the sight and a snicker or two could be heard coming from where frank dick and the others were concealed behind the bushes  but the german youth was too terrorized to notice anything but that awful red man before him with his hideous warpaint of blue and yellow  dutcha boy dance for big wolf went on tom  dance  dance or big wolf shoot  and the funloving rover set the pace in a mad caper that would have done credit to a zulu  i cant vos dance faltered hans and then thinking he might appease the wrath of his unexpected enemy he began to caper about in a clumsy fashion which was comical in the extreme  hoopla keep it up roared tom  dutcha boy take the cake for flingin hees boots  faster faster or big wolf shoot bang  no no i vos dance so hard as i can panted hans and renewed his exertions until tom could keep in no longer and set up such a laugh as had not been heard around the hall for many a day  it is needless to add that the other boys joined in still however keeping out of sight  youre a corker hans cried tom in his natural voice  you ought to join the buckandwing dancers in a minstrel company  vot  vot   began the german boy in bewilderment  aint you no indian  to be sure i am im big wolf the head dancing master of the tuscaroras hans dear boy  dont you think im a stunner  you vos tom rofer made up growled hans in sudden and deep disgust  vot for you vos blay me such a drick as dis hey  just to wake you up hans  i tont vos been asleep not me  i mean to stir up your ideas  put something new into your head  mine head vos all right tom  to be sure it is  den vot you say you vos put somedings new py him hey  i mean to make you sharperput you on your mettle  i tont understand stammered the german youth hopelessly  thats so and you wont in a thousand years hans  but you are the right sort any way  i dink  i blay me indian mineselluf some tay mused hans  dot vos lots of fun to make me tance vosnt it  vere you got dot bistol  down in the barn  look out or it may go off added tom as he held out the weapons thinking hans would draw back in alarm  instead however the german boy took the pistol and of a sudden pointed it at toms head  now you tance he cried abruptly  tance or i vos shoot you full of holes  hi tom hes got the best of you now cried frank from behind the bushes  you cant make me dance hans returned tom  that old rusty iron hasnt been loaded for years   it tont vos no goot  no  maybe you vos only fool me  pull the trigger and see answered tom coolly  he had scarcely spoken when hans mueller did as advised  a tremendous report followed and when the smoke cleared away the boys in the bushes were horrified to see that the rusty pistol had been shattered into a thousand pieces and that both tom and hans lay on their backs in the road their faces covered with blood      chapter vi  the strange figure in the hallway  at the fearful outcome of the joke tom had been perpetrating the boys concealed in the bushes were almost struck dumb and for several seconds nobody could speak or move  oh heavens tom is killed burst out dick who was the first to find his voice  he ran forth as speedily as possible and one after another the other cadets followed  tom lay as quiet as death with his eyes closed and the blood trickling over his temple and left cheek  quickly dick knelt by his side and felt of his heart  tom tom speak to me  tell me you are not seriously hurt he faltered  but no answer came back and sam raced off to get some water which he brought in a tin can he had discovered lying handy  the water was dashed over tonis face and presently he gave a little gasp  oh my what struck me he murmured and then tried to sit up but for the minute the effort was a failure  the pistol exploded said frank  a piece must have hit you on the head and he pointed at a nasty scalp wound from which the flow of blood emanated  as well as it could be done frank and dick bound up toms head with a handkerchief and presently the funloving lad declared himself about as well as ever only a bit lightheaded as he added  in the meantime the others had given their attention to hans who had been struck both in the scalp and in the shoulder  it was a good quarter of an hour before the german youth came around and then he felt so weak that the boys had to assist him back to the academy  honestly i thought the pistol was empty said tom on the return to the hall  why i think ive pulled that trigger a dozen times  dont mention it said frank with a shiver  why only last week i pointed the thing at peleg snuggers and played at firing it  supposing it had gone off and killed somebody  and he shivered again  dot vos almost as pad as von indians schalping put in hans faintly  i dink tom you vos play no more such dricks hey  no ive had enough replied tom very soberly  if you had been killed or seriously hurt i would never have forgiven myself  and it may be added here that for some time after this event funmaking and tom were strangers to each other  at the proper time the feast which had been planned came off and proved to be an event not readily forgotten  it was no easy matter to obtain the good things required and the boys ran the risk of being discovered by george strong and punished but by midnight everything was ready and soon eating was in full blast to use sams way of expressing it  a few of the boys from the other dormitories had been invited and the boys took turns in standing out in the hall on guard  you see explained tom mr strong may come in and i wont be able to play nightmare again as i did last year  say but that was a prime joke laughed frank  and mumps cried larry  ill never forget the orange flavored with kerosene and a general laugh followed  somebody had spoken of inviting jim caven to the feast but no one cared particularly for the fellow and he had been left out  perhaps hell tell on us suggested larry but frank shook his head  he hasnt got backbone enough to do it  hes a worse coward than mumps was  soon it came time for sam to do his turn at guarding and stuffing a big bit of candy in his mouth the youngest rover stepped out into the dimly lit hallway and sat down on a low stool which one of the guards had placed there  for ten or fifteen minutes nothing occurred to disturb sam and he was just beginning to think that watching was all nonsense when he saw a dark figure creeping along the wall at the extreme lower end of the hallway where it made a turn toward the back stairs  hullo whos that he muttered  it doesnt look much like mr strong  he continued to watch the figure and now saw that it was dressed in a black suit and had what looked like a shawl over its head  thats queer went on the boy  what can that man or boy be up to  presently the figure turned and entered one of the lower dormitories closing the door gently behind it  then it came out again and made swiftly for the rear of the upper hallway   by this time sam was more curious than ever and as the figure disappeared around the bend by the back stairs he followed on tiptoes  but as what light there was came from the front the rear was very dark and the youth could see little or nothing  he heard a door close and the lock click but whether or not it was upstairs or down he could not tell  for several minutes he remained in the rear hallway and then he went back to his post  soon tom came out to relieve him and sam reentered the dormitory and told his story to the others  thats certainly odd was dicks comment  was it a man or a boy sam  i cant say exactly  if it wasnt a man it was a pretty big boy  perhaps we ought to report the matter to captain putnam suggested frank  that person may have been around the hallways for no good purpose  oh pshaw perhaps it was somebody who was trying to spy on us put in fred  if we tell the captain we will only be exposing ourselves and i guess you all know what that means  it means halfholidays cut off for a month said dick  besser you vait und see vot comes of dis said hans and after a little more talk this idea prevailed and then the boys went in to clear up what was left of the feast  everything was gone but a little icecream and it did not take long to dispose of this  sam was bound to have some fun and instead of eating his last mouthful of cream he awaited a favorable opportunity and dropped it down inside of freds collar  great scott roared fred garrison  whow  and he began to dance around  oh my backbone  thats worse than a chunk of ice  oh but ill be frozen stiff  go down and sit on the kitchen stove suggested dick  sit on the stove  ill sit on sams head if i get the chance roared fred and made a rush for sam  a scuffle ensued which came to a sudden end as both sent a washstand over with a loud crash  wow youve done it cried frank  thats noise enough to wake the dead  great caesar stop that row burst out torn opening the door do you want to bring the captain down on us at the last minute  clear up that muss both of you said dick to sam and fred  but the latter demurred  it was sams fault  he started the racket  i wont touch it  and fred proceeded to go to bed  i reckon we had best dust said one of the boys from another dormitory  so you had burst out tom  i hear somebody coming already and in a twinkle the outsiders ran for their various quarters leaving the occupants of dormitory no 6 to fix up matters as best they could  it was no easy job to straighten out the washstand clear up the general muss and disrobe  but the boys were on their mettle and in less than two minutes the light was out and all were under the covers although to be sure sam had his shoes still on and tom was entirely clothed  boys what is the row up here  the call came from captain putnam himself  he was ascending the front stairs lamp in hand and attired in a long dressing gown  as no one answered he paused in the upper hallway and asked the question again  then he looked into one dormitory after another  all asleep eh  well see that you dont wake up again as soon as my back is turned he went on and soon after walked below again a faint smile on his features  he knew that boys were bound to be more or less mischievous no matter how strict his regulations  ill tell you what the captains a brick whispered tom as he began to disrobe noiselessly  so he is answered frank  you wouldnt catch old crabtree acting that way  hed have bad every cadet out of bed and sent half a dozen of us down to the guardroom  i guess the captain remembers when he was a cadet himself remarked dick  ive heard that they cut up some high pranks at west point  george strong would be just as kind came from tom  but say i am growing awfully tired  so am i came from several others  then the goodnight word was passed and soon all of the cadets were sound asleep never dreaming of the surprise which awaited them in the morning      chapter vii  who was guilty  boys ive had my trunk looted  and ive had my trousers pockets picked  and the halfdollar i left on the bureau is gone  such were some of the excited exclamations which the rover boys heard when they went downstairs the next morning   the speakers were the youths who occupied dormitories numbers 3 and 4 at the rear of the main upper hall  an inquiry among the lads elicited the information that everybody had suffered excepting one boy who said he had not had any money on hand  i spent my last cent for the spread he grinned  i guess im the lucky one  the news of the robberies created a profound sensation throughout putnam hall and both captain putnam and george strong were very much disturbed  we never had such a thing occur before said the captain and he ordered a strict investigation  all told something like thirtytwo dollars were missing and also a gold watch a silver watch and several shirtstuds of more or less value  among the shirtstuds was one set with a ruby belonging to a cadet named weeks  the investigation revealed nothing of importance  the robbery had been committed during the night while the owners of the money and the various articles slept  i must get at the bottom of this affair said captain putnam the honor of the academy is at stake  he talked to all of those who had lost anything and promised to make the matter good  then he asked each if he had any suspicions regarding the thief or thieves  no one had and for the time being it looked as if the case must fall to the ground  those who had been at the feast hardly knew what to say or to do should they tell the captain of the strange figure sam had seen in the hallway  ill tell him and shoulder the blame if you fellows are willing said sam after a long discussion  fun is one thing and shielding a thief is another  but what can you tell asked fred  you do not know that that person was the thief  more than likely he was came from dick  and if he was who was he went on fred  if you tell captain putnam youll simply get us all into trouble  i vote that sam makes a clean breast of it said frank and larry said the same  this was just before dinner and immediately after the midday meal had been finished the youngest rover went up to the master of the hall and touched him on the arm  i would like to speak to you in private and at once captain putnam he said  very well rover come with me was the reply and captain putnam led the way to his private office  i suppose i should have spoken of this before said sam when the two were seated but i didnt want to get the others into trouble as it is captain putnam i want to take the entire blame on my own shoulders  the blame of what samuel  of what i am going to tell you about  we voted to tell you but i dont want to be a tattletale and get the others into trouble along with me  i will hear what you have to say returned the master of the hall briefly  well sir you know it was dicks birthday yesterday and we boys thought we would celebrate a bit  so we had a little blowout in our room  was that the noise i heard last night  the noise you heard was from our room yes  but that isnt what i was getting at stammered sam  we set a guard out in the hallway to keep watch  well  i was out in the hall part of the time and i saw a dark figure in the rear hallway prowling around in a most suspicious manner it went into dormitory no 3 and then came out and disappeared toward the back stairs  this is interesting  who was the party  i couldnt make out  was it a man or a woman  a man sir or else a big boy  he had something like a shawl over his shoulders and was dressed in black or darkbrown  you saw him go in and come out of one of the sleeping rooms  yes sir  and then he went down the back stairs  he either went down the stairs or else into one of the back rooms  i walked back after a minute or two but i didnt see anything more of him although i heard a door close and heard a key turn in a lock  was this before i came up or after  before sir we went to sleep right after you came up  who was present at the feast and now captain putnam prepared to write down the names  oh sir i hope you wont  wont   ill have to ask you for the names samuel  i want to know who was on foot last night as well as who was robbed  surely you dont think any of us was guilty cried sam in sudden horror  i dont know what to think  the names please  i  i think ill have to refuse to give them captain putnam  of course all the boys who sleep in your dormitory were present  i said i would take this all on my own shoulders captain putnam of course you know i wouldnt have confessed at all but i dont wish to give that thief any advantage  perhaps the person wasnt a thief at all only some other cadet spying upon you  we thought of that  you may as well give me the names  i shall find them out anyway  hardly knowing whether or not he was doing right sam mentioned all of the cadets who had taken part in the feast  this list captain putnam compared with another containing the names of those who had been robbed  thirtytwo pupils he mused ill have the whole school in this before i finish  he looked at sam curiously  the youth wondered what was coming next when there was a sudden knock on the door  come in said captain putnam and one of the little boys entered with a letter in his hand  mr strong sent me with this said the young cadet  he just found it on the desk in the main recitation room  all right powers thank you answered the captain and took the letter  you can go and powers retired again  the letter was encased in a dirty envelope on which was printed in a big hand in lead pencil  capt victor putnam very important deliver at once  taking up a steel blade the master of the hall cut open the envelope and took out the slip of paper it contained  as he read the communication he started  then he crushed the paper in his hand and looked sharply at sam  samuel was the party you saw in the hallway tall and slim  rather tall yes sir  and slim  well he wasnt fat  did you see his face  no it was too dark for that and besides he had that shawl or whatever it was pretty well up around him  did you notice how he walked  he moved on tiptoes  and you cannot imagine who it was  no sir  by the way you of course know alexander pop our colored waiter  why to be sure  everybody knows aleck and we have had lots of fun with him at one time or another  but you surely dont suspect him do you  this letter says pop is guilty  that letter  and who wrote it  i do not know  it contains but two lines and you can read it for yourself and the captain handed over the communication which ran as follows  alexander pop stole that money and the other things one who knows all  thats a mighty queer letter for anybody to write murmured sam as he handed it back  why didnt the writer come to you as i have done  perhaps he wanted to keep out of trouble  i dont believe the letter tells the truth sir  and why not  because aleck is too goodhearted a fellow to turn thief  hum  that hardly covers the ground samuel  well why dont you have him searched  i will  without further ado sam was dismissed and captain putnam called george strong to him and showed the strange letter  why not look among pops effects suggested the assistant  he may have hidden the money and jewelry in his trunk  we will go up to his apartment replied captain putnam and a few minutes later the pair ascended to the attic room which the colored waiter had used for several terms  they found pop just fixing up for a trip to cedarville  he nodded pleasantly and then looked at both questioningly  pop i am afraid i have a very unpleasant duty to perform began captain putnam  wots dat sah asked aleck in surprise  you have heard of the robberies that have been committed  deed i has sah  but  but yo dont go fo to distrust me do yo capn went on the colored man anxiously  i would like to search your trunk and your clothing pop  if you are innocent you will not object  but sah i didnt steal nuffin sah  then you shouldnt object  it aint right nohow to spect an honest colored pusson sah said aleck growing angry  do you object to the search  i do sah  i am not guilty sah an dis am not treatin me jest right sah deed it aint sah  if you object pop i will be under the painful necessity of having snuggers place you under arrest  you know he is a special officer for the hall  at this announcement aleck fell back completely dumfounded well dats de wust yet he muttered and sank back on a chair not knowing what to do next      chapter viii  in which alexander pop runs away   will you submit to having your trunk examined or not demanded captain putnam after a painful pause during which alexander pops eyes rolled wildly from one teacher to the other  yo kin examine it if yo desire said aleck but its an outrage capn putnam an outrage sah  without more ado captain putnam approached the waiters trunk to find it locked  where is the key pop  dare sah on de nail alongside ob yo sah  soon the trunk was unlocked and the lid thrown back  the box contained a miscellaneous collection of wearing apparel which the captain pushed to one side  then he brought out a cigar box containing some cheap jewelry and other odds and ends as well as two five dollar bills  dat money am mine sah said aleck yo paid me dat las saturday sall  that is true but how did this get here pop  as captain putnam paused he held up a stud set with a rubythe very stud the cadet weeks had lost  dat  dat stud  i never seen dat shirtstud before capn deed i didnt stammered the waiter  that is certainly weeks stud i remember it well put in george strong  he showed it to me one day stating it was a gift from his aunt  and here is a cheap watch added captain putnam bringing forth the article  pop is this your watch  no sah  i  i never seen dat watch before answered aleck nervously  i dun reckon sumbuddy put up a job on dis poah coon sah he continued ruefully  i believe the job was put up by yourself answered captain putnam sternly  if you are guilty you had better confess  a stormy war of words followed  alexander pop stoutly declared himself innocent but in the face of the proofs discovered the master of the hall would not listen to him  peleg snuggers shall take you in charge and drive down to the cedarville lockup said the captain  the news that some of the things had been found in pops trunk spread with great rapidity  many were astonished to learn that he was thought guilty but a few declared that a coon wasnt to be trusted anyway  niggers are all thieves said jim caven never yet saw an honest one  i dont believe you burst out tom  pops a firstrate fellow and the captain has got to have more proof against him before ill believe him guilty  oh hes a bad egg growled the irish boy  you only say that because he called you down last week put in frank  he referred to a tilt between the new pupil and the colored man  jim caven had tried to be smart and had gotten the worst of the encounter  yes i think hes as honest as you are burst out tom before he had stopped to think twice  what do you call me a thief roared jim caven and leaped upon tom with his face as white as the wall  ill make you smart for that  one blow landed on toms cheek and another was about to follow when tom dodged and came up under cavens left arm  then the two boys faced each other angrily  a fight  fight cried a number of the cadets and in a twinkle a ring was formed around the two contestants  im going to give you the worst thrashing you ever had said caven but in rather a nervous tone  all right caven go ahead and do it cried tom  i will stand up for aleck pop and there you are  tom launched forth and caught caven on the right cheek  the irish lad also struck out but the blow fell short  then the two boys clinched  break away there cried frank break away  ill break his head panted caven  how do you like that  and he held tom with one hand and hit him in the neck with the other  the blow was a telling one and for a brief instant tom was dazed but then he caught his second wind and threw caven backward before the irish lad could recover his balance tom struck him in the nose and over rolled his opponent  a shout went up  good for tom rover  that was a telling blow i keep it up  ill fix you gasped jim caven as soon as he could speak ill fix you and staggering to his feet he glanced around for some weapon  nothing met his view but a garden spade which peleg snuggers had been using and catching this up he ran for tom as if to lay him low forever  caven none of that  fight fair  he shant call me a thief growled the irish boy  ill show him  and he aimed a tremendous blow for toms head  had the spade fallen as intended toms cranium might have been split in twain  but now both dick and frank caught the unreasonable youth and held him while sam and several others took the spade away  stop it  here comes mr strong came the unexpected cry from some outsiders  yes give it up tom whispered sam  were in hot water enough on account of that feast  ill give it up if caven is willing muttered  ill meet you another time answered caven and walked rapidly away  what is the row here demanded george strong as he strode up  nothing sir said one of the boy  some of the fellows were wrestling for possession of that spade  oh i was afraid there was a fight and mr strong sauntered off  he was on his way to the barn and presently the cadets saw him come forth with the manoffallwork and the light spring wagon  they are going to take poor aleck to the cedarville lockup announced fred  poor chap i never thought this of him  nor i answered dick  to me this affair isnt very clear  i dont believe they will be able to convict him of the crime put in sam  an hour later peleg snuggers started away from putnam hall with his prisoner  aleck looked the picture of misery as he sat on a rear seat his wrists bound together and one leg tied to the wagon seat with a rope  dis am a mistake he groaned  i aint guilty nohow  some of the boys wished to speak to him but this was not permitted  soon the turnout was out of sight  you may think i am hard with him said captain putnam later on but to tell the truth he does not come from a very good family and he has a stepbrother already in prison   aleck cant be held responsible for his stepbrothers doings murmured tom but not loud enough for the master to hear him  a diligent search had been made for the other stolen articles but nothing more was brought to light  if pop had taken the things he had either hidden them well or else disposed of them  it was nearly nightfall when peleg snuggers drove back to the hall  dick and tom met him just outside the gates and saw that the manofallwork looked much dejected  well peleg is he safe in jail called out tom  no he aint was the snappy reply  why what did you do with him questioned dick quickly  do  i didnt do nuthin  not me  it was him as did it all  cut that blessed rope and shoved me over the dashboard on to the hosses growled snuggers  do you mean to say he got away from you asked tom  yes he did  got away like a streak o fightnin thets wot he did consarn him  and without another word peleg drove to the rear of the hall put his team in the barn and went in to report to captain putnam  another row resulted and this nearly cost the utility man his position  but it appeared that he was not so much to blame that alexander pop had taken him unawares and finally he was sent away to his work with the caution to be more careful in the future before night and during the next day a hunt was made for the colored man but he had left the vicinity entirely gone to new york and shipped on one of the outwardbound ocean vessels  the rover boys fancied that they would never see him again but in this they were mistaken     chapter ix  the rover boys on wheels  say fellows but this is the greatest sport yet  i feel like flying tom said dick rover  i never thought wheeling was so grand  nor i came from sam rover  where shall we go this afternoon  it was several weeks later and the scholars were having a halfholiday  just six days before randolph rover had surprised his three nephews by sending each a handsome bicycle and it had taken them hardly any time to learn how to handle the machines  let us take a ride over to chardale said dick  i understand that the roads are very good in that direction  all right im willing answered sam and tom said the same soon the three brothers were on the way dick leading and tom and sam coming behind side by side  it was an ideal day for cycling cool and clear and the road they had elected to take was inviting to the last degree with its broad curves its beautiful trees and the mountainous views far to the north and west  its a wonder we didnt get wheels before observed dick  this beats skating or riding a to bits  just you look out that you dont take a header warned tom this road is all right but a loose stone might do a pile of damage  ive got my eye on the road answered his big brother  for the matter of that well all have to keep our eyes open  to reach chardale they had to cross several bridges and then descend a long hill at the foot of which ran the railroad to several towns north and south  come on cried tom and spurted ahead  with a laugh sam tried to catch up to him but could not  now for a coast went on the funloving rover as the hill was gained and on he started his wheel flying faster and faster as yard after yard was covered  my gracious tom look out or youll be smashed up yelled dick put on your brake  cant came back the answer  i took it off entirely this morning  this reply had scarcely reached dicks ears when another sound came to him which disturbed him greatly  far away he heard the whistle of a locomotive as it came around the bottom of the hill  looking in the direction he saw the puff of smoke over the treetops  he tried to cry out but now the road was rather rough and he had to pay strict attention to where he was riding  toms going to get into trouble gasped sam as he ranged up alongside of his elder brother  the road crosses the railroad tracks just below here  i know it sam  i wish we could make him come back  as dick finished he saw a chance to stop and at once dismounted then he yelled at the top of his lungs  tom stop  stop or youll run into the railroad train  sam also came to a halt and set up a shout  but tom was now speeding along like the wind and did not hear them  nearer and nearer he shot to the railroad tracks  then the whistle of the locomotive broke upon his ears and he turned pale  i dont want to run into that train he muttered and tried to bring his bicycle to a halt  but the movement did not avail without a brake and so he was compelled to seek for some side path into which he might guide his machine  but alas the road was hemmed in with a heavy woods on one side and a field of rocks on the other  a sudden stop therefore would mean a bad spill and tom had no desire to break his bones by any such proceeding  nearer and nearer he drew to the railroad crossing  he could now hear the puffing of the engine quite plainly and caught a glimpse of the long train over the rocks to his left  on he bounded until the crossing itself came into view  he was less than a hundred yards from it  and the oncoming engine was about the same distance away  there are some moments in ones life that seem hours and the present fraction of time was of that sort to poor tom  he had a vision of a terrific smashup and of dick and sam picking up his lifeless remains from the railroad tracks  im a goner he muttered and then just before the tracks were reached he made one wild desperate leap in the direction of a number of bushes skirting the woods  he turned over and over hit hard  and for several seconds knew no more  when dick and sam came up they found tom sitting in the very midst of the bushes  the bicycle lay among the rocks with the handle bars and the spokes of the front wheel badly twisted  are you much hurt tom asked his big brother sympathetically yet glad to learn that tom had not been ground to death under the train which had now passed the crossing  i dont know if im hurt or not was the slow answer as tom held his handkerchief to his nose which was bleeding  i tried to plow up these bushes with my head thats all i guess my ankle is sprained too  you cant ride that wheel any further announced sam  i dont want to ride  ive had enough for a few days at least  it was a good quarter of an hour before tom felt like standing up then he found his ankle pained him so much that walking was out of the question  im sure i dont know what i am going to do he said ruefully i cant walk and i cant ride and i dont know as i can stay here  perhaps dick and i can carry you to hopeton said sam mentioning a small town just beyond the railroad tracks  it will be a big job if you   here comes a wagon  perhaps the driver of that will give me a lift  as tom finished a large farm wagon rattled into sight drawn by a pair of bony horses and driven by a tall lank farmer  hullo wots the matter asked the farmer as he drew rein had a breakdown  no ive had a smashup answered tom  my brothers ankle is sprained and we would like to know if you can give him a lift to the next town put in dick well pay you for your trouble  thats all right  seth dickerson is allers ready to aid a fellowbein in distress answered the farmer  can ye git in the wagon alone  tom could not and the farmer and dick carried him forward and placed him on the seat  then the damaged bicycle was placed in the rear of the turnout and seth dickerson drove off while sam and dick followed on their steeds of steel  i see you air dressed in cadet uniforms remarked the farmer as the party proceeded on its way  be you fellers from pornell school  no we come from putnam hall answered tom  oh yes  bout the same thing i take it  how is matters up to the school  larnin a heap  we are trying to learn all we have to  had some trouble up thar didnt ye  my wifes brother was atellin me about it  a darkey stole some money an watches an that like  they think he stole them said tom  we can hardly believe it  why dont captain putnam hunt around them air pawnshops fer the watches went on seth dickerson after a pause  the thief would most likely pawn em to my way of thinkin  he hasnt much of a chance to do that  but i presume the police will keep their eyes open  i was over to auburn yesterday  had to go to see about a mortgage on our farm  and i stopped into one of them pawnbrokin shops to buy a shotgun if i could git one cheap  while i was in there a big boy came in and pawned a gold watch an two shirt studs  is that so returned tom with much interest  what kind of a looking boy was it  a tall slim feller with reddish hair  he had sech shifty eyes i couldnt help but think that maybe he had stolen them things jest to raise some spending money  did he give his name  he said jack smith but i dont think thet vas correct for he hesitated afore he gave it  a tall slim fellow with reddish hair and shifty eyes mused tom  do you remember how he was dressed  he had on a rough suit of brownishgreen and a derby hat with a hole knocked in one side  my gracious me burst out the boy  can it be possible  can wot be possible lad  that description fits one of our students exactly  tom called to dick and sam  come up here both of you  whats up tom do you feel worse asked dick as he wheeled as closely to the seat of the wagon as possible  no i feel better  but ive made a big discovery  at least i feel pretty certain that i have  what discovery questioned sam  ive discovered who stole that money and other stuff  and who was it came quickly from both brothers  jim caven      chapter x  a strange message from the sea  jim caven repeated dick slowly what makes you believe that he is guilty  from what mr dickerson here says answered tom and repeated what the farmer had told him  gracious that does look black for caven said dick when he had finished  he turned to the farmer  would you recognize that boy again if you saw him  i allow as how i would  his eyes was wot got me  never saw sech unsteady ones afore in my life  yes those eyes put me down on caven the minute i saw him answered tom  more than half of the boys at the hall have put him down as a firstclass sneak although we cant exactly tell why  see here said dick  i think it would be best if mr dickerson would drive back to the hall with us and tell captain putnam of what he knows  and see if he can identify caven finished sam  are you willing to do that mr dickerson  well to tell the truth ive got some business to attend to now was the slow reply  i am sure captain putnam will pay you for your trouble went on sam  if he wont we will  you seem mighty anxious to bring this caven to justice  smiled the farmer  we are for two reasons said tom  the first is because he isnt the nice sort to have around and the second is because one of the men working at the school a colored waiter whom we all liked has been suspected of this crime and had to run away to avoid arrest  i see well   the farmer mused for a moment  all right ill go back with ye  and at once  the team was turned around as well as the narrow confines of the hilly road permitted and soon the rover boys were on their way back to putnam hall a proceeding which pleased tom in more ways than one since he would not have now to put up at a strange resort to have his ankle and his wheel cared for  they bowled along at a rapid gait the horses having more speed in them than their appearance indicated  they were just turning into the road leading to putnam hall grounds when dick espied several cadets approaching bound for the lake shore  here come caven willets and several others he cried  mr dickerson do you recognize any of those boys  the farmer gave a searching glance which lasted until the approaching cadets were beside the wagon  then he pointed his hand at jim caven  thets the boy i seed over to auburn apawning thet watch an them studs he announced  hes got his sodger uniform on but i know him jest the same  jim caven looked at the farmer in astonishment  then when he heard seth dickersons words he fell back and his face grew deathly white  i  i dont know you he stammered  i seed you over to auburn in a pawnshop repeated dickerson  it  it isnt true gasped caven  i was never over to auburn in my life  why should i go there to a pawnshop  i guess you know well enough caven said tom  you bad better come back to the hall with us and have a talk with captain putnam  i wont go with you  this is  is a  a plot against me stammered the slim youth  you will go back cried dick and caught caven by the arm  but with a jerk the seared boy freed himself and ran down the road at the top of his speed  sam and dick pursued him on their bicycles while some of the others came after on foot  seeing this jim caven took to the woods just as dan baxter had done and the boys found it impossible to track him any further  i wonder if hell come back tonight said dick as the party returned to where they had left seth dickerson and tom  i dont think he will answered sam  i declare he must be almost as bad as the baxters  the farm wagon soon reached the hall and dick ushered seth dickerson into captain putnams office  the captain looked surprised at the unexpected visitor but listened with deep concern to all the farmer and the rover boys had to say  this certainly looks black for caven he said at last  i did not think i had such a bad boy here  and you say he got away from you  yes sir  it is a question if he will come back  providing he is really guilty  i will have his trunk and bag searched without delay but if he is guilty how did that ruby stud and the watch come into alexander pops possession  he was down on aleck replied tom who had hobbled in after the others  and besides he thought if aleck was arrested the search for the criminal would go no further  perhaps you are right thomas  it is a sad state of affairs at the best  the party ascended to the dormitory which jim caven occupied with several smaller boy  his trunk was found locked but captain putnam took upon himself the responsibility of hunting up a key to fit the box  once open the trunk was found to contain among other things a bit of heavy cloth tied with a piece of strong cord  here we are sure enough cried the captain as he undid the package and brought to light several of the missing watches and also some of the jewelry  i guess it is a clear case against caven and pop is innocent  i wish we could tell pop of it put in dick  he must feel awfully bad  i will do what i can for the negro rover  i am very sorry indeed now that i suspected him said captain putnam with a slow shake of his head  at the bottom of the trunk was a pocketbook containing nearly all of the money which had been stolen  a footingup revealed the fact that two watches and three gold shirt studs were still missing  and those were pawned in auburn said sam  just wait and see if i am not right  a party was organized to hunt for caven and the captain himself went to auburn that very evening  the hunt for the missing boy proved unsuccessful and it may be added here that he never turned up at putnam hall again nor at his home in middletown having run away to the west  when captain putnam came back he announced that he had recovered all but one watch  the various goods and the money were distributed among their rightful owners and it must be confessed that a big sigh of relief went up from the cadets who had suffered  the single missing timepiece was made good to the boy who had lost it by the captain buying a similar watch for the youth  after this several weeks passed without anything of special interest occurring outside of a stirring baseball match with a club from ithaca which putnam hall won by a score of six to three  in this game dick made a muchneeded home run thus covering himself with glory  the rovers are out of sight was larrys comment  whatever they do they do well  and they hang together like links of a chain added fred  the friend of one is the friend of all and the same can be said of an enemy  one morning a telegraph messenger from cedarville was seen approaching the hall just as the boys were forming for the rollcall  heres a telegram for somebody said sam  i hope its not bad news  a message for richard rover announced george strong after receiving it and handed over the yellow envelope  wondering what the message could contain and who had sent it dick tore open the envelope and read the brief communication  as his eyes met the words his head seemed to swim around so bewildered was he by what was written there  what is it dick came from tom and sam  its from uncle randolph  he wants us to come home at once  he says  but read it for yourselves and the elder rover handed over the message which ran as follows  have just received a strange message from the sea supposed to be written by your father  come home at once randolph rover  my gracious  news from father gasped tom  is he really alive burst out sam  oh i pray heaven the news is true  a strange message from the sea repeated dick  i wonder what he can mean  perhaps its a message that was picked up by some steamer suggested sam  anyway uncle wants us to come home at once  he doesnt say all of us  the message is addressed to me  but of course he wanted all of us to come put in tom  anyway four horses couldnt hold me back he continued determinedly  nor me chimed in sam  he drew a long breath  if we hurry up we can catch the noon boat at cedarville for ithaca  yes and the evening train for oak run finished tom  hurry up dick  dick was willing  to tell the truth that message had fired him as he had never been fired before  he burst into the captains office pellmell with tom and sam on his heels to explain the situation  ten minutes later  and even this time seemed an age to the brothers  they were hurrying into their ordinary clothing and packing their satchels while peleg snuggers was hitching up to take them to the landing at cedarville  goodby to you and good luck shouted frank as they clambered into the wagon and many other cadets set up a shout  then the wagon rattled off  the rover boys had turned their backs on dear old putnam hall for a long while to come      chapter xi  the rovers reach a conclusion  for the three rover boys the golden star could not make the trip from cedarville to ithaca fast enough  they fretted over every delay and continually wondered if there was any likelihood of their missing the train which was to take them to oak run the nearest railroad station to valley brook farm their uncles home  but the train was not missed instead they had to wait half an hour for it  during this time they procured dinner although dick felt so strange he could scarcely eat a mouthful  uncle randolph doesnt say much he murmured to tom  he might have said more  well know everything before we go to bed dick answered his brother  i dont believe uncle randolph would telegraph unless the news was good  they indulged in all sorts of speculation as the train sped on its way to oak run  when the latter place was reached it was dark and they found jack ness the hired man waiting for them with the carriage  there i  knowed it grinned jack  mr rover calculated that only dick would come but i said wed have em all  and what is this news of my father questioned dick  its a message as was picked up off the coast of africky replied ness  mr rover didnt explain very clearly to me  hes a good deal excited and so is the missus  and so are we remarked sam  can it be that father is on his way home  i calculate not master sam  leaswise your uncle didnt say so concluded the hired man  never had the horses made better time than they did now and yet the boys urged ness continually to drive faster  swift river was soon crossed  that stream where sam had once had such a stirring adventure  and they bowled along past the fox and other farms  here we are shouted dick at last  there is uncle randolph out on the porch to greet us  and there is aunt martha added sam  i do believe they look happy dont you tom  they certainly dont look sad was the noncommittal answer and then the carriage swept up to the horseblock and the three boys alighted  all of you eh were randolph rovers first words  well perhaps it is just as well so  we simply couldnt stay behind uncle  said sam  and we are dying to know what it all means  but you must have supper first put in aunt martha as she gave one and another a motherly kiss  i know riding on the cars usually makes tom tremendously hungry  well eat after we have had the news said tom  were dying to know all as sam says  the news is rather perplexing to tell the truth said randolph rover as he led the way into the library of the spacious home i hardly know what to make of it  who brought it questioned dick  it came by mail  a bulky letter all the way from cape town africa  from father  no from a captain townsend who it seems commands the clipper ship rosabel  he sent me one letter inclosing another  the first letter is from himself  and is the second letter from father burst out tom  yes my boy  oh let us see it came in a shout from all three of the rover boys  you had better read the captains communication first answered randolph rover  then you will be more apt to understand the other  or shall i read it for the benefit of all  yes yes you read it uncle randolph was the answer  the letter is dated at cape town and was written a little over a month ago  it is addressed to randolph rover or to richard thomas or samuel rover new york city and is further marked highly importantdo not lose or destroy  and what is in it asked the impatient tom  do hurry and tell us uncle randolph  and then his uncle read as follows  to the rover family new york  i am a stranger to you but i deem it my duty to write to you on account of something which occurred on the 12th day of april last while my clipper ship rosabel bound from boston u s a to cape town africa was sailing along the coast of congo but a few miles due west from the mouth of the congo river  our ship had been sent in by a heavy gale but the wind had gone down and we were doing more drifting than sailing to the southward when the lookout espied a man on a small raft which was drifting toward us  on coming closer we discovered that the man was white and that he looked half starved  we put out a boat and rescued the poor creature  but he had suffered so much from spear wounds and starvation that on being taken on board of our ship he immediately relapsed into insensibility and out of this we failed to arouse him  he died at sundown and we failed even to learn him name or home address  on searching the dead mans pockets we came across the enclosed letter addressed to you and much soiled from water  as you will see it is dated more than a year back and was evidently in the possession of the man who died for some time  probably he started out to deliver it or to reach some point from which it could be mailed  i trust that the message becomes the means of rescuing the anderson rover mentioned in the letter and i will be pleased to learn if this letter of mine is received  the rosabel sails from cape town to brazil as soon as her cargo can be discharged and another taken on  very truly yours  john v townsend captain  as randolph rover ceased reading there was a brief silence broken by tom  so the man who died held a letter  and what is in that uncle randolph  i will read it to you boys although that is a difficult matter for the writing is uneven and much blurred  on one part of the sheet there is a blot of blood  the blood i presume  of the poor fellow who was trying to deliver the communication  unfolding the stained document randolph rover bent closer to the table lamp that he might read the more easily  as for the boys they fairly held their breaths that no spoken word might escape them  the letter is addressed to me said the uncle  but the envelope is as you can see very much torn  i will read and he did so  niwili camp on the congo  july the 18th 189  dear brother randolph  if by the goodness of god this reaches you i trust that you will set out without delay to my assistance  i write under great difficulties as a prisoner of the bumwo tribe of natives ruled by king susko  i have discovered the secret of a gold mine here and the king will not let me go fearing that i will tell the outside world of my discovery and bring the english or french here to slay him and his followers  they know nothing here of americans  i entrust this to the care of an english sailor who is going to try to make his escape  i cannot go myself having had my leg broken by a blow from one of my jailers  i am sick and weak in body and it may be that i will soon die yet i beg of you to do what you can for me  if i die i trust you to be a father to my dear boys dick tom and sam and ask martha for me to be a mother to them  the king expects soon to remove to another camp at a place called rhunda konoka the water well  perhaps he will take me along or else he may slay me  all those who were with me are dead excepting several natives who have joined the burnwo tribe  goodby and do what you can until you are certain that i am dead  your loving brother  anderson rover  when randolph rover ceased reading he saw that there were tears in the eyes of all of the boys and that his wife was also crying his own voice had had to be cleared continually  to all the letter was like a message from the grave  and that is all questioned dick breaking the silence  that is all my boy  and the letter was written about a year ago  but well go in search of him put in tom quickly  he may be alive yet  i thought i would go answered randolph rover and i thought possibly that i might take dick with me  oh you must take me too burst out tom  i could never bear to be left behind  and you must take me interrupted sam  we always go together you know  at this talk randolph rover was somewhat taken aback  all he cried  why what would three boys do in the heart of africa  look for father cried tom  i shant stay behind  you cant make me he went on half defiantly  we have been through lots of adventures uncle you know that came from sam  we are not afraid  but the danger boys  began the uncle  what danger wouldnt we face for fathers sake said tom  id go through fire and water for him  you had better let us all go said dick  if you dont let tom and sam go why the chances are theyll   run away and go anyway finished sam  oh uncle randolph say we can go please do  at this enthusiasm the uncle smiled sadly  allright boys as you are bound to have it so you shall all go  but dont blame me if the perils are greater than you anticipate and if the undertaking costs one or more of you your lives      chapter xii  off for africa  it was long after midnight before the conversation in relation to the proposed trip to africa came to an end  mrs rover insisted that the boys should eat something and they sat around the table discussing the viands and the two letters at the same time  have you any idea where this niwili camp is asked dick of his uncle  it is on the congo but how far froth the mouth of that stream is a question lad  probably we can learn all about it when we reach boma the capital of the congo free state  the congo is a pretty big stream isnt it questioned sam  very large indeed  at its mouth it is about ten miles wide and it is from twelve to fourteen hundred miles long  stanley traced its course after an expedition in which he fought over thirty battles with the natives  they must be fearfully savage  those in the interior are  the natives that live close to the ocean are peaceable enough so i have been told  and how are we going to get there asked tom  i dont suppose there are any regular steamers running to the congo  no indeed tom  i have written to a shipping firm in new york for information and they will probably send word by morning was the answer  it can well be imagined that the boys slept but little that night in the morning they telegraphed to putnam hall for their trunks and also let captain putnam and their chums know how matters stood  then began preparations for such a tour as none of them had ever before anticipated  word came from new york in the early afternoon mail and the information sent was highly satisfactory to randolph rover  the french steamer republique was in port loading for boma and other african ports and would set sail on the coming saturday  the firm had taken upon itself the responsibility to speak of passage for mr rover and one or two others  hurrah cried tom  uncle randolph you had better telegraph to them at once for passage for the four of us  i will answered mr rover and the telegram was sent within the hour  the next day was a busy one  as but little in the way of outfits could be procured in oak run or the adjoining villages it was decided that they should go down to new york on thursday afternoon and spend all of friday in purchasing in the metropolis whatever was needed  the only person who was really sober was mrs rover for she hated to see her husband start on such a journey which was bound to be full of grave perils  i am afraid you will never come back she said with tears in her eyes  and if you and anderson are both dead to me what will i do  be brave martha said mr rover tenderly  i feel certain that a kind providence will watch over us and bring us all back in safety  at last the party was ready to set off  a fond goodby was said and away they rattled in the carryall for the railroad station at oak run  goodby to home shouted tom as he waved his cap to his aunt who stood beside the gateway  and when we come back may we bring father with us added dick and sam muttered an amen  the journey down to new york was without incident and as the rovers had lived in the metropolis for years they felt thoroughly at home and knew exactly where to go for their outfit and suitable clothing for use in such a warm country was procured and in addition each was armed with a revolver  mr rover also purchased a shotgun and a rifle and likewise a number of cheap gold and silver trinkets  the natives are becoming civilized he explained  but for all that i am certain a small gift now and then will go a long way toward making friends  the found that the republique was a stanchbuilt steamer of eight thousand tons burden  her captain jules cambion spoke english quite fluently and soon made them feel at home  he was much interested in the story randolph rover had to tell concerning his missing brother  tis a strange happening truly he remarked  i sincerely trust that your search for him proves successful and that he returns to the arms of his family unharmed  but it is a fierce country  i have visited it twice and i know  i am glad to learn that you have been up the congo replied randolph rover  perhaps during your leisure hours on the trip you will not mind giving me such information as conics to your mind  i will tell you all i know willingly answered captain cambion  exactly at noon on saturday the republique was ready to sail and with a shout from those on the wharf who had come to see the few passengers off she sheered away and started down the bay past bedloe island and the statue of liberty before night the shore line had faded from view and they were standing out boldly into the atlantic ocean  off for africa at last murmured sam who had been standing at the rail watching the last speck of land as it disappeared  what a big trip this is going to be  never mind how big it is sam came from tom  if only it is successful  the first few days on board were spent in settling themselves the party had two connecting staterooms and mr rover and sam occupied one while dick and tom had settled themselves in the other  the passengers were mostly french people who were going to try their fortunes in french congo  there was however one englishman a man named mortimer blaze who was bound out simply for adventure   im tired of england and tired of america too he explained ive hunted through the rocky mountains and up in canada as well as at home and now im going to try for a lion or a tiger in africa  perhaps the lion or tiger will try for you smiled tom  what then  it will be a pitched battle thats all drawled mortimer blaze he was rather a sleepy looking man but quick to act when the occasion demanded  the weather was all that could be wished and during the first week out the republique made good progress  on a steamer there was but little for the boys to do and they spent all of their spare time in reading the books on africa which captain cambion had in his library and which were printed in english often they persuaded the genial captain to tell them of his adventures in that faraway country  you have many strange sights before you he said to them one day  the strange vegetation the immense trees the wonderful waterfalls some larger than your own niagara and then the odd people  some of the natives are little better than dwarfs while others are six feet and more in height and as straight as arrows  did you ever hear of this king susko questioned tom  yes i have heard of him several times  he is known as the wanderer because he and his tribe wander from place to place making war on the other tribes  the captain knew nothing of niwili camp and expressed the opinion that it had been like many other camps only a temporary affair he said that the best the party could do was to strike straight up the congo along the south shore and question the different natives met concerning king suskos present whereabouts  on the beginning of the second week a storm was encountered which lasted for three days  at first the wind blew at a lively rate and this was followed by thunder and lightning and a regular deluge of rain which made all of the boys stay below  the steamer pitched from side to side and more than one wave broke over her decks  this is the worse storm i ever saw remarked dick as he held fast to a chair in the cabin  they wont be able to set any table for dinner today  dinner came from sam with a groan  who wants any dinner when a fellow feels as if he was going to be turned inside out  so far none of the boys had suffered from seasickness but now poor sam was catching it and the youngest rover felt thoroughly miserable  never mind the storm wont last forever said dick sympathetically  perhaps you had better lie down sam  how can i with the ship tossing like a cork  ive got to hold on same as the rest and be glad i suppose that i am alive and poor sam looked utterly miserable  it was very close in the cabin but neither door nor porthole could be opened for fear of the water coming in  dinner was a farce to use toms way of expressing it for everything was cold and had to be eaten out of hand or from a tin cup  yet what was served tasted very good to those who were hungry  i believe well go to the bottom before we are done began sam when a loud shout from the deck reached the ears of all of the rovers and made tom and dick leap to their feet  whats that cried dick  they are calling to somebody  above the wind they could hear a yell from a distance and then came more cries from the deck followed by a bump on the side of the steamer  weve struck something ejaculated tom  but i guess it wasnt hard enough to do much damage  that remains to be seen answered dick  storm or no storm im gong on deck to learn what it means and he hurried up the companionway      chapter xiii  a rescue in midocean  dick found that he could remain on the deck only with the greatest of difficulty  several life lines had been stretched around and he clung to one of these  what has happened he asked of one of the sailors  what did we strike  struck a small boat was the answer  it had a colored man in it  weve just hauled the fellow on deck  is he all right  no hes about half dead  but the captain thinks he may get over it with care and the sailor hurried away  dick now saw several men approaching carrying the form of the rescued one between them  he looked at the unconscious man and gave a cry of amazement  alexander pop  what a strange happening  do you know the man questioned captain cambion  i know him very well answered dick  he used to work at the military academy where my brothers and i were cadets  and the boy told captain cambion the particulars of alexander pops disappearance from putnam hall  i am glad that i will be able to tell him that his innocence is established he concluded  all providing we are able to bring him around to himself master rover returned the captain gravely  you think then that he is in bad shape  i hardly know what to think  we will take him below and do all we can for him  it was no easy matter to transfer pop to one of the lower staterooms but once placed on a soft berth the rovers did all they could for him  it is like a romance said sam while randolph rover was administering some medicine to the unconscious man  how thin he looks  hes been suffering from starvation put in dick  i suppose he gave that yell we heard with his last breath  all of the party watched over the colored man with tender care and feeling that he could be in no better hands the captain left him entirely in his friends charge  when he comes to his senses you can let me know he said  dick was watching by pops side and tom was at the foot of the berth when the colored man opened his eyes  as they rested on first one rover and then the other he stared in utter astonishment  my gracious sakes alive he gasped  am i dreamin or am i back to putnam hall again  neither aleck replied dick  you are safe on board an ocean steamer  an yo  whar yo dun come from  we are passengers on the steamer said tom  you were picked up several hours ago  yes but  but i cant undersand dis nohow persisted the colored man and tried to sit up only to fall back exhausted  dont try to understand it aleck until you are stronger said dick  would you like some hot soup  anyting sah anyting  why i aint had no reglar meal in most a week moaned the sufferer  glory to heaben dat i am sabed  and then he said no more for quite a long while  the soup was already at hand and it was dick who fed it slowly and carefully seeing to it that pop should have no more than his enfeebled stomach could take care of for overfeeding so mr rover had said might kill the man  the next day pop was able to sit up although still too weak to stand on his legs  he was continually praising heaven for his safety  i dun vink i was a goner more dan once he said  i was on de ocean all alone about a week i reckon although i lost time ob days after id been out two or vree nights  i vink i was most crazy  perhaps you were aleck said sam  but tell us how you got in that position  dat am de queerest part ob it master rober  de queerest part of it  i got into de small boat fo a sleep and de fust ving i knowed i was miles an miles away from eberyting yes sahmiles an miles away on de boundless ocean an not so much as a fishin smack sail in sight  golly but wasnt i scared  i reckon i dun most turn white  and aleck rolled his eyes around impressively  you were in a small boat attached to some steamer  dats it  da had been usin de small boat fo surnting and left her overboard  were you cut adrift  i dont tink i was  but i aint shuah nohow  what boat was it  de harrison from brooklyn bound to cuba  did you ship on her after you left putnam hall in such a hurry  i did cos i didnt want de police to coted me  but say as true as i stand heah  mean sit heah  i aint guilty of stealin dem watches an tings no i aint  and aleck raised both hands earnestly  captain putnam made a great mistake when he dun suspect me  we know it answered dick quietly  we thought you innocent all along aleck  tank yo fo dat master rober  ise glad to see dat ise got one friend   three friends aleck  we all stood up for you interrupted tom  tank yo tank yo  and we discovered who the real thief was added sam  wot yo dun found dat out burst out pop  an who was de blackhearted rascal  jim caven  dat cadet wot tried to be funny wid me an i had to show him his place  hol on  i dun see him comin from de attic one day  when he must have put those stolen articles in your trunk said tom  yes he was guilty captain putnam was going to have him arrested but he got away  nothing would do for alexander pop after this but that the boys give him the full particulars of the affair to which he listened with the closest attention but at the conclusion his face fell  ise mighty glad i am cleared he said  but id give a good deal to face de capnjest to see wot he would say eh  he said he was sorry he had suspected you said dick  what a big fool dis darkey was to run away murmured aleck meditatively  i wasnt cut out fo no sailer man  ise been sick most ebery day since i left shoah  by de way whar is dis ship bound he went on  to africa  africa  shuah yo is foolin massah dick  no i am not  we and our uncle are bound for the congo river  de congo  dats whar my great gran fadder dun come from  so i heard my mammy tell years ago  i dont

 im sure i dont know  perhaps the captain will let you remain on the republique  what wid dern frenchmen  i dont tink i could stand dat  an what am yo going to do in africa  we are going on a hunt for my father who has been missing for years  again aleck had to be told the particulars and again he was tremendously interested  when the boys had finished he sat in silence for several minutes  ive got itjest de ting he cried suddenly  got what asked tom  de right idea massah tom  foah genmen like yo dont want to go to africa widout a valet nohow  let me be de workin man fe de crowd  ill take de job

de school pleaded the colored man  i dont want to be driftin around jess nowhar wid nuffin to do an no money comin in  not but what ill work cheap as i dun said i would he added hastily  a little later randolph rover joined the group and alecks proposition was laid before him  strange to say he accepted the colored mans offer immediately greatly to the wonder of the boys and from that minute on pop be came a member of the searching party  i will tell you why i did it explained randolph rover to the boys in private when we get into the jungle we will need a man we can trust and one who is used to american ways  moreover if there is any spying to be done among the natives the chances are that a black man can do it better than a white man  uncle randolph youve got a long head remarked tom  no doubt aleck will prove just the fellow desired  and tom was right as later events proved      chapter xiv  a strange meeting in boma  the storm delayed the passage of the republique nearly a week in a manner that was totally unexpected by the captain  the fierce waves running mountain high wrenched the screw and it was found next to impossible to repair the accident  consequently the steamer had to proceed under a decreased rate of speed  this was tantalizing to the boys and also to randolph rover for everyone wished to get ashore to start up the congo as early as possible  but all the chafing in the world could not help matters and they were forced to take things as they came  a place was found among the sailors for aleck and soon he began to feel like himself once more  but the sea did not suit the colored man and he was as anxious as his masters to reach shore once more  its a pity da cant build a mighty bridge over de ocean an run kyars he said  den nobody would git seasick  perhaps theyll have a bridge some day resting on boats aleck answered tom  but i dont expect to live to see it  yo dont know about dat chile look at uddertings  did yogranfadder expect to ride at de rate ob sixty miles an hour did he expect to send a telegram to san francisco in a couple ob minutes  did he eber dream ob talkin to sumboddy in chicago froo a telephone  did he knew anyting about electric lights or movin pictures or carriages wot aint got no bosses but run wid gasoline or sumfing like dat  i tell yo massah tom we dont know wot we is comin to  you are quite right alexander said mr rover who had overheard the talk  science is making wonderful strides  some day i expect to grow com and wheat yes potatoes and other vegetables by electricity and then randolph rover branched off into a long discourse on scientific farming that almost took away poor alecks breath  hes a most wonderful man yo uncle whispered the colored man to sam afterward  fust ting yo know hell be growin corn in de com crib already shucked and he laughed softly to himself  on and on over the mighty atlantic bounded the steamer  one day was very much like another excepting that on sundays there was a religious service which nearly everybody attended the boys had become quite attached to mortimer blaze and listened eagerly to the many hunting tales he had to tell  i wish you were going with us said tom to him  i like your style as you englishman put it  thanks rover and i must say i cotton to you as the americans put it laughed the hunter  well perhaps well meet in the interior who knows  are you going up the congo  i havent decided yet  i am hoping to meet some friends at boma otherwise i may go further down the coast  the steamer bad now struck the equator and as it was midsummer the weather was extremely warm and the smell of the oozing tar pouring from every joint was sickening  but the weather suited alexander pop perfectly  dis am jest right he said  i could sleep eall de time ceptin when de meal gong rings  blood will tell laughed randolph rover  when you land alexander you ought to feel perfectly at home  perhaps sah but i dun reckon de united states am good enough for any man sah white or colored  right you are put in dick  its the greatest country on the globe  it was a clear day a week later when the lookout announced land dead ahead  it proved to be a point fifteen miles above the mouth of the congo and at once the course was altered to the southward and they made the immense mouth of the river before nightfall  it was a beautiful scene  far away dashed the waves against an immense golden strand backed up by gigantic forests of tropical growth and distant mountains veiled in a bluish mist the river was so broad that they were scarcely aware that they were entering its mouth until the captain told them  when night came the lights of boma could be distinctly seen twinkling silently over the bay of the town  they dropped anchor among a score of other vessels and the long ocean trip became a thing of the past  im all ready to go ashore said tom  my but wont it feel good to put foot on land again  indeed it will cried dick  the ocean is all well enough but a fellow doesnt want too much of it  and yet i heard one of the french sailors say that he hated the land put in sam  he hadnt set foot on shore for three years when they reach port he always remains on deck duty until they leave again  mortimer blaze went ashore at once after bidding all of the party a hearty goodby  hope we meet again he said  and anyway good luck to you  and good luck to you cried tom  hope you bag all of the lions and tigers you wish and so they parted not to meet again for many a day  it was decided that the rovers should not leave the ship until morning  it can well be imagined that none of the boys slept soundly that night  all wondered what was before them and if they should succeed or fail in their hunt  dis aint much ob a town remarked aleck as they landed a little before noon in a hot gentle shower of rain  nuffin like new york  there is only one new york as there is but one london answered randolph rover  our architecture would never do for such a hot climate  along the river front was a long line of squatty warehouses backed up by narrow and far from clean streets where the places of business were huddled together and where a good share of the trading was done on the sidewalk  the population was a very much mixed one but of the europeans the english and french predominated  the natives were short fat and exceedingly greasy appearing hardly a one of them could speak english  i dont see any americans remarked dick  i suppose   there is an american store burst out sam pointing across the way  he had discovered a general trading store the dilapidated sign of which read            simon hook         dealer in everything      english spoken by an american        horn of all kinds bought      yankee boots are the best  he believes in advertising laughed dick  id like to go in and see simon hook  perhaps hell remember something about father he added suddenly  thats an idea returned tom  let us go in uncle randolph  mr rover was willing and they entered the low and dingylooking establishment which was filled with boxes barrels and bags of goods  they found the proprietor sitting in an easy chair his feet on a desk and a pipe in his mouth  is this mr hook asked randolph rover  thats me was the answer but mr hook did not offer to rise nor indeed to even shift his position  we saw your sign and as we are americans we thought we would drop in went on mr rover  thats right glad to see you came from the man in the chair but still he did not offer to shift his position  been here many years asked dick  about twenty  how is business put in tom bound to say something  aint none sonny  you dont look very busy  its a fools place to come to sonny  when these goods are sold im going to quit  mr simon hook paused long enough to take an extra whiff from his pipe   what brought you here  we are on a hunt for a missing man answered randolph rover did you ever meet him  his name is anderson rover and he is my brother  anderson rover simon hook thought for a moment  i remember him  he was a gold hunter from californy or somethin like that  yes he was a mine owner  went up the congo four or five years ago  maybe longer  yes  i remember him  he had lots of money and took several guides and a number of other natives along  have you seen or heard of him since questioned dick eagerly  simon hook shook his head  no sonny  twasnt to be expected  and why not put in tom  because them as goes up the congo never comes back  its a fools trip among those wild people of the interior  stanley went up but look at the big party he took with him and the many fights he had to get back alive  at this announcement the hearts of the rover boys fell  you never heard one word of him persisted sam  nary a word sonny  i reckon hes either lost in the jungle or among the mountains or else the natives have taken care of him  did he say anything about the trail he was going to take asked randolph rover  i understand there are several  he was going to take the rumbobo trail most all of em do simon hook drew a long breath  say can i sell you any of these old things of mine cheap  perhaps you can said randolph rover  we are bound for the hotel now  we will come in later  glad to see you and as they left the shopkeeper waved them a pleasant adieu with his hand  but he never stirred from his chair  i guess he has grown tired of trying to sell goods observed tom  perhaps he knows that if folks want the things he has to sell they are bound to come to him said dick  his store seems to be the only one of its sort around  the hotel for which they were bound was several squares away located in something of a park with pretty flowers and a fountain  it was a twostory affair with spacious verandas and large rooms and frequented mostly by english and french people  they had just entered the office and randolph rover was writing his name in the register when dick caught sight of somebody in the reading room that nearly took away his breath  well i never  what is it dick asked tom quickly  look at that boy reading a newspaper  it is dan baxter  dan baxter just as sure as you are born      chapter xv  captain villaires little plot  dick was right the boy in the readingroom was indeed dan baxter but so changed in appearance that for the minute neither tom nor sam recognized him  in the past baxter had always been used to fine clothing which he had taken care should be in good repair  now his clothing was dilapidated and his shoes looked as if they were about ready to fall apart  more than this his face was hollow and careworn and one eye looked as if it had suffered severe blow of some sort  altogether he was most wretchedlooking specimen of humanity and it was a wonder that he was allowed at the hotel  but the truth of the matter was that he had told the proprietor a long tale of sufferings in the interior and of a delayed remittance from home and the hotel keeper was keeping him solely on this account  how he is changed muttered tom  he looks like a regular tramp  hes been in hard luck thats certain came from sam  i wonder how he drifted out here  while sam was speaking dan baxter raised his eyes from the newspaper and glanced around  as his gaze fell upon the three rover boys he started and the paper fell to the floor then he got up and strode toward them  dick rover he cried  where did you fellows come from  from putnam hall baxter answered dick quietly  and what brought you here  ordinarily dan baxter would have retorted that that was none of dicks business but now he was in thoroughly low spirits and he answered meekly  ive been playing in hard luck  i went down to new york and one night when i was in a sailors boarding house i drank more than was good for me and when i woke up in the morning i found myself on a vessel bound for africa  you were shanghaied as a sailor asked tom  thats it and while i was on board the costelk the captain and mate treated me worse than a dog  see that eye  the captain did that and when i struck back he put me in irons and fed me nothing but stale biscuits and water  and the ship left you here  no she was bound for cape town but stopped here for supplies and i jumped overboard at night and swam ashore and here i am and sorry for it and dan baxter drew a long breath  the rovers were astonished at his meek manner  was this really the domineering baxter who had always insisted on having his own way and who had done so many wrong deeds in the past  youve had a hard time of it i suppose said dick hardly knowing how to go on  hard dick aint no word came from the former bully of putnam hall  ive run up against the worst luck that anybody could ever imagine  but i reckon you dont care about that  do you think we ought to care baxter  well it aint fair to take advantage of a chap when hes down on his luck grumbled the former bully  i guess ive learnt my lesson all right enough  do you mean to say you are going to turn over a new leaf queried sam with interest  yes if i ever get the chance  randolph rover now joined the group and dick explained the situation  mr rover questioned baxter closely and found that he was without a cent in his pocket and that the hotel keeper had threatened to put him out if he was not able to pay up inside of the next twentyfour hours  see here baxter you never were my friend and you never deserved any good from me but i dont like to see a dog suffer said dick  ill give you thirty shillings and that will help you along a little and he drew out his purse  and ill give you the same came from tom  ditto from me said sam  but dont forget that what dick says is true nevertheless  ninety english shillings  about twentytwo dollars of our money  was more cash than dan baxter had seen in some time his other money having been spent before he had taken his unexpected ocean trip and his eyes brightened up wonderfully  ill be much obliged to you for the  the loan he stammered ill pay you back some time remember  never mind about that replied dick  my advice to you is to take the first ship you can for home  and what brought you out here  going on a hunt for your father  yes  youll have a big job finding him  i understand the natives of the congo are going on the warpath before long  they have had some difficulty with the settlers  i guess well manage to take care of ourselves answered tom and then he and his brothers followed their uncle up to the rooms which had been engaged for them during their stay in the town  hes down in the mouth and no mistake was toms comment when the boys were left to themselves  i never saw him so humble before  perhaps knocking around has taught him a lesson said dick  i hope he really does turn over a new leaf  the day proved to be a busy one  randolph rover gathered all the information he could concerning the trail along the congo and also tried to locate niwili camp  he likewise purchased several additions to his outfits from simon hook and engaged the services of several natives the leader of whom was a brawny black named cujo a fellow who declared that he knew every foot of the territory to be covered and who said he was certain that he could locate king susko sooner or later  him bad man he said soberly  no et him catch you or you suffer big lot  cujo took to aleck from the start and the pair soon became warm friends  the african inspected their outfits with interest and offered several suggestions regarding additional purchases  three days were spent in boma and during that time the rovers saw a good deal of dan baxter who having nothing better to do hung around them continually he remained as meek as before but our friends did not know that this was merely the meekness of a savage cur while under the whip  baxter was naturally a brute and lacked the backbone necessary far genuine reformation  say why cant you take me with you he asked on the day that the rover expedition was to start out  im willing to do my share of the work and the fighting and i wont charge you a cent for my service  i dont know as my uncle wants anybody along said sam to whom baxter addressed his remarks  well wont you speak to him about it sam  i cant find anything to do here and the captains to whom ive applied dont want me on their ships pleaded the former bully of putnam hall  sam was easily touched at all times and he knew that baxter must feel lonely and wretched so far from home and without friends or capital  he at once went to his brothers and his uncle and laid the big youths proposition before them  we dont want him said dick promptly  i dont believe he would be of any use to us  i would rather give him some more money just for him to stay behind added tom  mr rover was thoughtful for a moment  and what do you say sam he asked at length  well i dont like baxter any more than the others do  but it seems awfully hard on him  i dont believe he knows how to turn  we might give him enough money to get back to the united states with  id rather have you do that uncle randolph said dick  i dont want him with me  i will have a talk with the misguided boy was the conclusion reached by randolph rover but he got no chance to speak to dan baxter until late in the afternoon and then to his astonishment baxters manner had changed entirely he intimating that he wanted nothing more to do with them  for in the meantime something which was bound to be of great importance to the rovers had occurred  in boma were a number of persons of mixed french and native blood who were little better than the oldtime brigands of italy  they were led by a wicked wretch who went by the name of captain villaire  villaire had been watching the rovers for two days when he noticed the coldness which seemed to exist between our friends and baxter  at once he threw himself in baxters way and began to it pump the youth regarding the americans  zay are going into the interior you have remarked he said in very bad english  are zay verra rich people  yes they are well fixed answered the tall youth  and zay do carry zare money wid zem  i guess not  at least not much of it  you are zare friend eh  hardly  out in america we were enemies  so  you hata zem  yes i hate them muttered dan and his eyes shone wickedly im only treating them in a friendly way now because im out of money and must do something  i see  it ees a good head you have  verra good murmured captain villaire  do you know i heara dem talk about you  did you  what did they say  de one boy say you should be in ze jail didnt you robba somebody  he had better keep his mouth shut  you lika do someting wid me continued the french native closing one eye suggestively  he was a close reader of human nature and had read baxters character as if it was an open book  what do you mean  we gitta dem people into trouble  maka big lot of money  all right  ill do anything answered baxter savagely  so they said i ought to be in jail eh  ill fix em yet  you helpa me i helpa you went on the wily french native  he had his plan all ready and after sounding baxter some more revealed what was in his mind which was simply to follow the rovers into the interior and then make them prisoners  once this was done they would hold the prisoners for a handsome ransom  thats a big job answered the big youth  but i like your plan firstrate if you can carry it out  trust me replied captain villaire  i have half a dozen of ze best of killowersza nevair fail me  but as you knowa dem you will have to do ze lettair writing for us so zat we git ze money from zare people at home  trust me for that responded baxter quickly  the plot pleased him immensely   you do the capturing and ill make mrs rover or somebody else pay up handsomely never fear  and so a compact was formed which was to give the rovers a good deal of trouble in the near future      chapter xvi  the start up the congo  it was queer dan baxter should act so said sam to his uncle when mr rover came back from his interview with the bully  i thought he wanted to go the worst way  he acted as if he had struck something else answered randolph rover  he didnt even want the money i offered  perhaps he has received a remittance from home  who would send it to him put in dick  his father is still in jail  perhaps he got mumps to send it to him said sam  but i forgot mumps is away  there was no time to discuss the situation further for they were to start early on the following morning and there were yet a dozen small matters which must be given attention  all were busy and it was not until after eleven that evening that they turned in  the day for the departure from boma dawned bright and clear and cujo appeared with his assistants while they were still eating breakfast  werry good day for um journey he said with a grin  make good many miles if nothing go wrong  you cant do any too well for me answered dick  i hope our expedition into the interior is both short and successful  at eight oclock they were off  at first they had thought to go on horseback but this was abandoned by the advice of the native who declared that horses would prove more of a drag than a help in many places  horse canno climb tree bridge he explained  no climb high rock no go around bad hill we go on foot an make better time  the town was soon left behind and they struck a highway which for several miles afforded easy traveling  on all sides were dense groves of tropical growth palms mangoes and the like with enormous vines festooned from one tree to the next  underneath were a great variety of ferns and mosses the homes of countless insects and small animals  the ground was black and wherever turned up gave forth a sickly odor of decayed vegetation  that is regular fever territory explained randolph rover boys do not sleep on the ground if you can possibly avoid it  i sincerely trust that none of us take the tropical fever  if i feel it coming on ill take a good dose of quinine declared tom  fortunately they had brought along a good supply of that valuable drug  two days traveling passed without special incident  on one side of the highway was the broad river which glinted like molten lead in the sunshine  they could not travel very close to its bank for here the ground was uncertain once sam left the highway to get a better view of the stream and before cujo noticed it found himself up to his knees in a muck which stuck to him like so much glue  hi help me out roared the youngest rover and all of the party turned to behold him waving his hand frantically toward them  he dun got stuck in de mud exclaimed aleck and started to go to sams assistance when cujo called him back  must be werry careful said the native  ground bad over dare   lose life if urn dont have a care  wait fo me  and he approached sam by a circuitous route over the tufts of grass which grew like so many dots amid the swamp  soon he was close enough to throw the youth the end of a rope he carried  the pull that followed nearly took sams arms out by the sockets but the boy was saved to return to the others of the party with an experience which was destined to be very useful to him in the future  it will teach me to be careful of where i am going after this he declared  why that bog looked almost as safe as the ground over here  tropical places are all full of just such treacherous swamps returned randolph rover  it will be wise for all of us to remember that we are now in a strange territory and that we must have our eyes and ears wide open  at halfpast eleven they came to a halt for dinner  the sun was now almost overhead and they were glad enough to seek the shelter of a number of palms standing in front of a  native hostelry  we will rest here until two oclock said mr rover  it is all out of the question to travel in the heat of the day as we did yesterday in such a climate as this  even the natives cannot stand that  they found the hostelry presided over by a short fat native who scarcely spoke a word of english  but he could speak french and mr rover spoke to him in that language while cujo carried on a talk in the native tongue  the midday repast was cooked over a fire built between several stones  the boys watched the cooking process with interest and were surprised to find when it came to eating that the food prepared tasted so good  they had antelope steak and a generous supply of native bread and pure cocoa which tom declared as good as chocolate  after the meal they took it easy in a number of grass hammocks stretched beneath the wide spreading palms surrounding the wayside inn if such it might be called  aleck and cujo fell to smoking and telling each other stories while the rovers dozed away lulled to sleep by the warm gentle breeze which was blowing  i dont wonder the natives are lazy remarked dick when his uncle aroused him  i rarely slept in the daytime at home and here i fell off without half trying  the climate is very enervating dick  that is why this section of the globe makes little or no progress toward civilization energetic men come here with the best intention in the world of hustling as it is termed but soon their ambition oozes out of them like  well like molasses out of a barrel lying on a hot dock in the sun  a good comparison laughed dick  come tom come sam he called out and soon the party was on its way again  the highway was still broad but now it was not as even as before and here and there they had to leap over just such a treacherous swamp as had caused sam so much trouble  its a good thing we didnt bring the horses said mr rover  i didnt think so before but i do now  the jungle was filled with countless birds of all sorts sizes and colors  some of these sang in a fairly tuneful fashion but the majority uttered only sounds which were as painful to the hearing as they were tiresome  the sound is enough to drive a nervous fellow crazy declared tom  its a good thing nature fixed it so that a man cant grow up nervous here  perhaps those outrageous cries are meant to wake a chap up suggested dick  ive a good mind to shoot some of the little pests  you may take a few shots later on and see what you can bring down for supper answered his uncle  but just now let us push on as fast as we can  yes put in tom  remember we are out here to find father not to hunt  as if i would ever forget that answered dick with a reproachful glance  they were now traveling a bit of a hill which took them temporarily out of sight of the congo  cujo declared this was a short route and much better to travel than the other  the way was through a forest of african teak wood immense trees which seemed to tower to the very skies  they are as large as the immense trees of california of which you have all heard remarked randolph rover  it is a very useful wood used extensively in ship building  after all i think a boat on the congo would have been better to use than shoe leather said sam who was beginning to grow tired  no use a boat when come to falls grinned cujo  soon come to dem too  aleck had been dragging behind carrying a heavy load to which he was unaccustomed  now he rejoined the others with the announcement that another party was in their rear  they are on foot too he said  cujo whar you dun tink da be gwine  to the next settlement maybe was randolph rovers comment and cujo nodded  they waited a bit for the other party to come up but it did not and after walking back cujo returned with the announcement that they were nowhere in sight  perhaps they turned off on a side road said tom and there the matter was dropped to be brought to their notice very forcibly that night  evening found them at another hostelry presided over by a frenchman who had a giant negress for a wife  the pair were a crafty looking couple and did not at all please the rovers  perhaps we may as well sleep with one eye open tonight said randolph rover upon retiring  we are in a strange country and its good advice to consider every man an enemy until he proves himself a friend  the hostelry was divided into half a dozen rooms all on the ground floor  the rovers were placed in two adjoining apartments while the natives and aleck were quartered in an addition of bamboo in the rear  keep your eyes and ears open aleck whispered dick on separating from the faithful colored man  and if you find anything wrong let us know at once  do you suspect anyting massah rober was pops anxious question  i do and i dont  something in the air seems to tell me that everything is not as it should be  dat frenchman dont look like no angel sah and aleck shook his head doubtfully  youre right aleck and his wife is a terror or else i miss my guess  dats right massah rober nebber saw sech sharp eyes  yes ill look outfo my own sake as well as fo de sake ob ye and de rest concluded aleck      chapter xvii  the attack at the hostelry  the night was exceptionally cool for that locality and utterly worn out by their tiresome journey all of the rovers slept more soundly than they had anticipated  but not for long  dick had scarcely dropped off when he heard a noise at the doorway which was covered with a rough grass curtain  who is there he demanded sitting up  dats all right came in a whisper from aleck  is dat yo massah dick  yes aleck  what brings you  i dun discovered someting sah  what  dat udder party dun come up an is in de woods back ob dis house  in camp  no dare is a frenchman wot is talkin to dah chap wot runs dis shebang sah  perhaps he wants accommodations mused dick  cant say about dat sah  but de fellers who come up hab a lot ob ropes wid em  thats certainly queer  whats the row came sleepily from tom and presently randolph rover and sam likewise awoke  in a few words the colored man explained the situation  he had just finished when the wife of the proprietor of the resort came up to the doorway  the gentleman is wanted outside by my husband she said in broken french  what does he want asked mr rover  i cant say  but he says please to step out for a moment  mr rover repeated the womans words to the boys  what do you make of this he asked  i tell you something is wrong declared dick  i have felt it all along  but what can be wrong my lad  if you go outside ill go with you uncle randolph  well you can do that if you wish  the pair arose and speedily slipped on the few garments which they had taken off  then dick pulled out his pistol  do you think it is as bad as that asked sam  i dont know what to think  but im going to take uncles advice and count every man an enemy until he proves himself a friend  soon mr rover and dick were ready to go out and they did so followed by aleck and preceded by the native woman  as it was dark the rovers easily concealed their weapons in the bosoms of their coats  they walked past the bamboo addition and to the grove of trees aleck had mentioned  there they found the frenchman in conversation with captain villaire  you wish to see me demanded randolph rover  very much answered villaire in french  if you are mr randolph rover are you not  i am  and this is one of your nephews  yes  i believe you are hunting for the young mans father went on villaire  we are  do you know anything of him demanded randolph rover eagerly  i do  he sent me to you  he sent you cried randolph rover in amazement  he is then alive  yes but a prisoner and very sick  he heard of your being in boma by accident through a native of king suskos tribe who was sent to the town for some supplies  i heard the story and i have been employed to lead you to him and at once  but  but this is marvelous stammered randolph rover  i must say i do not understand it  it is a very queer turn of affairs i admit  the other mr rover must explain to you when you meet  he wishes you to come to him alone  it will not be safe for more  as well as he was able randolph rover explained matters to dick in the meantime however the youth had been looking around sharply and had noted several forms gliding back and forth in the gloom under the trees  dick was more suspicious than ever  uncle randolph i dont believe this man he said briefly  the story he tells is too unnatural  i think so myself dick but still   why didnt this man come straight to the house to tell us this  im sure i dont know  ask him  randolph rover put the question to captain villaire  the frenchman scowled deeply and shrugged his shoulders  i had my reason he said briefly  will you come with me  before randolph rover could answer there came a shout from behind several trees  look out fo yourselves came in alecks voice  dis am a trap  a trap repeated dick when of a sudden a half dozen men rushed at him and randolph rover and surrounded the pair  in a twinkle before either could use his pistol he was hurled flat and made a prisoner  bind them men ordered villaire sternly  and bind them well so that escape is impossible  run for the house aleck yelled out dick before those on top of him could choke him off  save tom and sam  i will came from the faithful black  and off he sped at top speed with three or four of captain villaires party after him cujo also went to the house bewildered by what was going on and hardly knowing how to turn  randolph rover fought desperately and so did dick  but the two were no match for the six men who had attacked them and ere they knew it the rovers were close prisoners with their hands bound behind them and each with a dirty gag of grass stuffed in his mouth  now march or you will be shot came in bad english from one of the villaire party  and as there seemed nothing better to do they marched wondering why they had been attacked and where they were to be taken  their arms had been confiscated so further resistance was useless  when dick lagged behind he received a cruel blow on the back which nearly sent him headlong  a journey of several hours brought the party to a small clearing overlooking the congo at a point where the bank was fully fifty feet above the surface of the stream  here in years gone by a rough log hut had been built which the african international association had once used as a fort during a war with the natives the log hut was in a state of decay but still fit for use and almost hidden from view by the dense growth of vines which covered it  the men who had brought randolph rover and dick hither evidently knew all about the hut for they proceeded to make themselves at home without delay  taking the rovers into one of the apartments of the dilapidated building they tied each to the logs of the walls one several yards from the other  now you must wait until captain villaire returns said the leader of the party in french  he will be here before daylight  but what does this mean demanded randolph rover  he will tell you what it means grinned the brigand and walked away to another part of the hut which was built in a long rambling fashion and contained a dozen or more divisions  we are in a pickle remarked dick dismally  this is hunting up father with a vengeance  we wont despair yet dick  but i would like to know what this means  it probably means robbery for one thing uncle randolph  and it may mean death  and the youth shuddered  if i am not mistaken i saw some of these rascals hanging around the hotel in boma  that is more than likely  they have been watching their chance to attack us ever since we left the town  slowly the hours wore away until morning dawned  the positions of both dick and his uncle were most uncomfortable ones and the youth was ready to groan aloud at the strain put upon his shoulders through having his arms tied behind him  at last they heard footsteps approaching from the opposite end of the rambling building  somebody at last cried dick  he had scarcely spoken when captain villaire appeared followed by  dan baxter      chapter xviii  a demand of importance  dick could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyesight as he gazed at the former bully of putnam hall and the frenchman who stood beside him  baxter  is it possible he gasped  what brought you here  are you a prisoner too put in randolph rover  a prisoner laughed baxter  well thats a good one i must say  no i am not a prisoner  and what brought you here went on mr rover  cant you imagine  he is in with these rascals who have captured us came quickly from dick  this is how you repay our kindness baxter  your kindness  bah  i want none of it  didnt i refuse your offer made just before you went away  but you didnt refuse the first money we gave you baxter  at this the bully bit his lip  we wont talk about that dick rover  do you realize that you are absolutely in my power  how do you like it  it was not you who captured us baxter  well it amounts to the same thing eh capitan villaire and the big boy turned to the french brigand who nodded  we collared you nicely  what of sam and tom asked randolph rover anxiously  ve will not speak of zem udders broke in captain villaire  ve vill speak apout you  did baxter put up this plot against us queried dick  to be sure i did answered baxter who loved to brag just as much as ever  and before i let you go im going to make you pay up dearly for all that i have suffered  captain villaire have you had them searched he asked turning again to his companion  yees baxter but za had not mooch monish wid zem  how much  only about a hundred pounds  then they left it behind at binotos place was the quick answer  now if those others arent captured   hush ve vill not speak of zat put in the brigand hastily tell zeni what i haf tole you  all right i will  dan baxter turned once more to the prisoners  do you know why you were brought here  to be robbed i presume answered randolph rover  or that and worse said dick significantly  i reckon i have a right to all of your money dick rover  i dont see how you make that out baxter  years ago your father robbed mine out of the rights to a rich gold mine in the united states  thats your side of the story  i claim and so did my father that the mine was ours  its a falsehood  the mine was discovered by my fattier and if everything had gone right he would have had the income from it  this is ancient history baxter  come to business  what do you intend to do with us  we intend to make money out of you was the answer given with a rude laugh  in what manner  first you will have to answer a few questions  zat ees it put in captain villaire  how mooch morlish you bring wid you from america  we didnt bring much answered randolph rover who began to smell a mouse  how mooch  about two hundred pounds  humph a thousand dollars sneered baxter  that wont do at all  you must haf brought more cried the french brigand angrily  not much more  you leave zat in boma wid ze bankers eh  yes  but you haf von big lettair of credit not so  yes we have a letter of credit answered randolph rover  but that wont do you any good nor the money at the bankers neither  ve see about zat monsieur proceed and captain villaire waved his hand toward dan baxter  this is the situation in a nutshell to come right down to business said the former bully of putnam hall coolly  you are our prisoners and you cant get away no matter how hard you try captain villaire and his men as well as myself are in this affair to make money  the question is what is your liberty worth to you  so you intend to work such a game demanded dick  thats the game yes  well i shant pay you a cent  dont be a fool dick rover  we are not to be trifled with  well i havent any money and that ends it  you already have all i had  then you will have to foot the bill continued dan baxter turning to randolph rover  if you value your liberty you will pay us what we demand  and what do you demand questioned mr rover  we demand twenty thousand dollars  ten thousand for the liberty of each  this demand nearly took away randolph rovers breath  twenty thousand dollars he gasped  it is  is preposterous  is it  you are worth a good deal more than that mr rover  and i am demanding only what is fair  you shall never get the money  wont we  never  perhaps youll sing a different tune in a few days  after your stomachs get empty responded dan baxter with a malicious gleam in his fishy eyes  so you mean to starve us into acceding to your demands said dick  baxter i always did put you down as a firstclass rascal  if you keep on youll be more of a one than your father  in high rage the former bully of putnam hall strode forward and without warning struck the defenseless dick a heavy blow on the cheek  that for your impudence he snarled  you keep a civil tongue in your head if you dont   he finished with a shake of his fist  you had bettair make up your mind to pay ze monish said captain villaire after a painful pause  it will be ze easiest way out of ze situation for you  dont you pay a cent uncle randolph interrupted dick quickly then baxter hit him again such a stinging blow that he almost lost consciousness  for shame ejaculated mr rover  he is tied up otherwise you would never have the courage to attack him  baxter have you no spirit of fairness at all in your composition  dont preach  i wont listen to it fumed the bully  you have got to pay that money  if you dont  well i dont believe youll ever reach america alive thats all  with these words dan baxter withdrew followed by captain villaire  you think za will pay queried the french brigand anxiously  to be sure they will pay  they value their lives too much to refuse  just wait until they have suffered the pangs of hunger and thirst and youll see how they change their tune  you are certain za have ze monish  yes they are rich  it will only be a question of waiting for the money after they send for it  i vill not mind zat  neither will i  if we are safe here  you dont think anybody will follow us  not unless za find ze way up from ze rivair  za cannot come here by land because of ze swamps answered the frenchman  and ze way from ze rivair shall be well guarded from now on he added      chapter xix  what happened to tom and sam  let us return to tom and sam at the time they were left alone at binotos hostelry  i wish we had gone with dick and uncle randolph said tom as he slipped into his coat and shoes  i dont like this thing at all  oh dont get scared before you are hurt tom laughed his younger brother  these people out here may be peculiar but   sam did not finish  a loud call from the woods had reached his ears and in alarm he too began to dress at the same time reaching for his pistol and the money belt which randolph rover had left behind  i  i guess something is wrong he went on after a pause  if we   tom  sam  look out fo yourselves came from aleck and in a second more the negro burst on their view  come if yo is dressed he added  where to asked tom hurriedly  anywhar massah tom  de others is took prisoners  come  and aleck almost dragged the boy along  the rover boys could readily surmise that aleck would not act in this highly excited manner unless there was good cause for it consequently as sam said afterward they didnt stand on the order of their going but just flew  pellmell out of the hostelry they tumbled and ran up the highway as rapidly as their nimble limbs would permit  they heard several men coming after them and heard the command halt yelled after them in both french and bad english  but they did not halt until a sudden tumble on toms part made the others pause in dismay  oh great caesar groaned the funloving rover and tried to stand up  i guess ive twisted my ankle  cant you even walk asked sam  we aint got no time ter lose panted aleck who was almost winded  if we stay here well be gobbled up  in no time dats shuah  let us try to carry tom said sam and attempted to lift his brother up  but the load made him stagger  de trees  let us dun hide in de trees went on the negro struck by a certain idea  come on quick  yes  yes  anything groaned tom and then shut his teeth hard to keep himself from screaming with pain  together they carried the suffering youth away from the highway to where there was a thick jungle of trees and tropical vines  the vines made convenient ladders by which to get up into the trees and soon sam and aleck were up and pulling poor tom after them  now we must be still said aleck when they were safe for the time being  hear dem aconun dis way  the three listened and soon made out the footsteps of the approaching party they soon passed on up the road  weve fooled them whispered sam  but oh aleck what does it all mean  it means dat yo uncle an dick am prisoners  took by a lot of rascals under a tall frenchman  yes but i dont understand   no more do i massah sam but it war best to git out dats as shuah as yo is born added the colored man solemnly  poor torn was having a wretched time of it with his ankle which hurt as badly as ever and had begun to swell  as he steadied himself on one of the limbs of the tree sam removed his shoe which gave him a little relief  from a distance came a shouting and they made out through the trees the gleam of a torch  but soon the sounds died out and the light disappeared  what should they do next  this was a question impossible to answer  one thing is certain i cant walk just yet said tom  when i put my foot down its like a thousand needles darting through my leg  let us go below and hunt up some water said sam and after waiting a while longer they descended into the small brush  aleck soon found a pool not far distant and to this they carried tom and after all had had a drink the swollen ankle was bathed much to the sufferers relief  slowly the time dragged by until morning  as soon as the sun was up aleck announced that he was going back to the hostelry to see how the land lay  but dont expose yourself said tom  i am certain now that is a regular robbers resort or worse  aleck was gone the best part of three hours  when he returned he was accompanied by cujo  the latter announced that all of the other natives had fled for parts unknown  the inn is deserted announced aleck  even that colored wife of the proprietor is gone  and did you find any trace of dick and my uncle asked sam  we found out where dat struggle took place answered aleck and cujo reckons as how he can follow de trail if we dont wait too long to do it  must go soon put in cujo for himself  maybe tomorrow come big storm  den track all washed away  tom sighed and shook his head  you can go on but youll have to leave me behind  i couldnt walk a hundred yards for a barrel of gold  oh we cant think of leaving you behind cried sam  ill tell you wot  ise dun carry him at least fe a spell said aleck and so it was arranged  under the new order of things cujo insisted on making a scouting tour first that he might strike the trail before carrying them off on a circuitous route thus tiring aleck out before the real tracking began  the african departed to be gone the best part of an hour  when he came back there was a broad grin of satisfaction on his homely features  cujo got a chicken he announced producing the fowl  and here am some werry good roots too  now va dinner befo we start out  right yo am cujo cried pop and began to start up a fire without delay while cujo cleaned the fowl and mashed up the roots which when baked on a hot stone tasted very much like sweet potatoes  the meal was enjoyed by all even tom eating his full share in spite of his swollen ankle which was now gradually resuming its normal condition  cujo had found the trail at a distance of an eighth of a mile above the wayside hostelry  him dont lead to de ribber dare he said  but i dun think someting of him  and what do you think asked tom from his seat on alecks back  i tink he go to de kolobo  and what is the kolobo asked sam with interest  de kolobo old place on ribberplace where de white soldiers shoot from big forthouse  a fort cried tom  but would the authorities allow them to go there  no soldiers dare now  leave kolobo years ago  place most tumble down now  but good place fo robbers  i see  well follow the trail as best you can  and well see what we will see  and let us get along just as fast as we can added sam  on they went through a forest that in spots was so thick they could scarcely pass  the jungle contained every kind of tropical growth including ferns which were beautiful beyond description and tiny vines so wiry that they cut like a knife  this is tough remarked sam  but i suppose it doesnt hold a candle to what is beyond  werry bad further on answered cujo  see here am de trail and he pointed it out  several miles were covered when they came to a halt in order to rest and to give aleck a let up in carrying tom  the youth now declared his foot felt much better and hobbled along for some distance by leaning on sams shoulder  presently they were startled by hearing a cry from a distance they listened intently then cujo held up his hand  me go an see about dat he said  keep out ob sight all ob you  and he glided into the bushes with the skill and silence of a snake  another wait ensued and tom improved the time by again bathing his foot in a pool which was discovered not far from where cujo had left them  the water seemed to do much good and the youth declared that by the morrow he reckoned he would be able to do a fair amount of walking if they did not progress too rapidly  but what a country this is he murmured  i declare they could burn wood night and day for a century and never miss a stick  i thought i heard some monkeys chattering a while ago answered sam  i suppose the interior is alive with them  i dun see a monkey lookin at us now from dat tree observed aleck  see dem shinin eyes back ob de leaves  he pointed with his long forefinger and both boys gazed in the direction  then tom gave a yell  a monkey  thats a snake  look out for yourselves  he started back and the others did the same  and they were none too soon for an instant later the leaves were thrust apart and a serpents form appeared swaying slowly to and fro as if contemplating a drop upon their very heads      chapter xx  the fight at the old fort  for the instant after the serpent appeared nobody spoke or moved the waving motion of the reptile was fascinating to the last degree as was also that beady stare from its glittering eyes the stare was fixed upon poor tom and having retreated but a few feet he now stood as though rooted to the spot  slowly the form of the snake was lowered until only the end of its tail kept it up on the tree branch  then the head and neck began to swing back and forth in a straight line with toms face  the horrible fascination held the poor boy as by a spell and he could do nothing but look at those eyes which seemed to bum themselves upon his very brain  closer and closer and still closer they came to his face until at last the reptile prepared to strike  crack  it was sams pistol that spoke up at just the right instant and those beady eyes were ruined forever and the wounded head twisted in every direction while the body of the serpent dropping from the tree lashed and dashed hither and thither in its agony  then the spell was broken and tom let out such a yell of terror as had never before issued from his lips  crack came a second shot from sams pistol  but the serpent was moving around too rapidly for a good aim to be taken and only the tip of the tail was struck then in a mad blind fashion the snake coiled itself upon alecks foot and began with lightninglike rapidity to encircle the colored mans body  help shrieked aleck trying to pull the snake off with his hands  help or ise a dead man shuah  catch him by the neck aleck ejaculated tom and brought out his own pistol  watching his chance he pulled the trigger twice sending both bullets straight through the reptiles body  then sam fired again and the mangled head fell to the ground  but dead or alive the body still encircled aleck and the contraction threatened to cave in the colored mans ribs  pull him off somehow he gasped  pull him off  crack went toms pistol once more and now the snake had evidently had enough of it for it uncoiled slowly and fell to the ground in a heap where it slowly shifted from one spot to another until life was extinct  but neither the boys nor the colored man waited to see if it was really dead  instead they took to their heels and kept on running until the locality was left a considerable distance behind  that was a close shave said tom as he dropped on the ground and began to nurse his lame ankle once more  ugh but that snake was enough to give one the nightmare  dont say a word groaned aleck who had actually turned pale i vought shuah i was a goner i did fo a fac  i dont want to meet no mo snakes  the two boys reloaded their pistols with all rapidity and this was scarcely accomplished when they heard cujo calling to them soon the native put in an appearance  when told of what had happened he would not believe the tale until he had gone back to look at the dead snake  you werry lucky he said  him big wonder um snake didnt kill all of yo  cujo had made an important discovery  he had located captain villaires party at the old fort and said that several french brigands were on guard by the trail leading from the swamp and at the cliff overlooking the river  i see white boy dare too he added  same boy wot yo give money to in boma  dan baxter ejaculated sam  can it be possible that he is mixed up in this affair  i cant understand it at all returned tom  but the question is now we have tracked the rascals what is to be done next  after a long talk it was resolved to get as close to the old fort as possible  cujo said they need not hurry for it would be best to wait until nightfall before making any demonstration against their enemies  the african was very angry to think that the other natives had deserted the party but this anger availed them nothing  four oclock in the afternoon found them on the edge of the swamp and not far from the bank of the congo  beyond was the cliff overgrown in every part with rank vegetation and the everpresent vines which hung down like so many ropes of green  if we want to get up the wall we wont want any scaling ladders remarked tom grimly  oh if only we knew that dick and uncle randolph were safe  im going to find out pretty soon replied sam  ill tell you what i think  i think they are being held for ransom  i was thinking of that too  but i didnt dream of such a thing being done down here although i know it is done further north in africa among the moors and algerians  cujo now went off on another scout and did not return until the sun was setting again he was full of smiles  i can show you a way up de rocks he said  we can get to the walls of um fort as you call um without being seen  soon night was upon them for in the tropics there is rarely any twilight  tom now declared himself able to walk once more and they moved off silently like so many shadows beside the swamp and then over a fallen palm to where a series of rocks led up to the cliff proper  shah came presently from cujo  man ahead  they came to a halt and through the gloom saw a solitary figure sitting on a rock  the sentinel held a gun over his knees and was smoking a cigarette  if he sees us he will give the alarm whispered tom  cant we capture him without making a noise  dats de talk returned aleck  cujo let us dun try dat trick  cujo nodded  urn boys stay here he said  cujo fix dat feller  and off he crawled through the wet grass taking a circuitous route which brought him up on the sentinels left  presently the sentinel started to rise  as he did so cujo leaped from the grass and threw him to the earth  then a long knife flashed in the air  no speak or um diet came softly but the frenchman realized that the african meant what he said  i will be silent he growled in the language of the african dont  dont choke me  cujo let out a low whistle which the others rightly guessed was a signal for them to come up  finding himself surrounded the frenchman gave up his gun and other weapons without a struggle he could talk no english so what followed had to be translated by cujo  yes de man an boy are dare explained cujo pointing to the fort  da chained up so dis rascal say  de captain ob de band want heap money to let um go  ask him how many of the band there are asked sam  but at this question the frenchman shook his head  either he did not know or would not tell  after a consultation the rascal was made to march back to safer ground  then he was strapped to a tree and gagged the straps were not fastened very tightly so that the man was sure to gain his liberty sooner or later  if we didnt come back and he was too tight he might starve to death said tom  not but wot he deserves to starve said aleck with a scowl at the crestfallen prisoner  at the foot of the cliff all was as dark and silent as a tomb we go slow now or maybe take a big tumble cautioned cujo perhaps him better if me climb up first and he began the dangerous ascent of the cliff by means of the numerous vines already mentioned  he was halfway up when the others started after him sam first tom next and aleck bringing up in the rear  slowly they arose until the surface of the stream was a score or more of feet below them  then came the sounds of footsteps from above and suddenly a torch shone down into their upturned faces  hullo whos this came in english and the rover boys recognized dan baxter  silence on your life cried tom  tom rover gasped the bully  how came you   silence baxter  i have a pistol and you know i am a good shot stand where you an and put both hands over your head  will i stand  not much yelled the bully and flung his torch straight at tom  then he turned and ran for the fort giving the alarm at the top of his lungs  the torch struck tom on the neck and for the moment the youth was in danger of losing his hold on the vines and tumbling to the jagged rocks below  but then the torch slipped away past sam and aleck and went hissing into the dark waters of the congo  by this time cujo had reached the top of the cliff and was making after baxter  both gained the end of the fort at the same time and one mighty blow from cujos club laid baxter senseless near the doorway  help  help  the cry came in dicks voice and was plainly heard by sam and tom  then captain villaire appeared and a rough and tumble battle ensued which the rovers well remember to this day  but tom was equal to the occasion and after the first onslaught he turned as if summoning help from the cliff  this way he cried  tell the company to come up here and the other company can surround the swamp  several pistol shots rang out and the boys saw a frenchman go down with a broken arm  then captain villaire shouted we have been betrayed  we must flee  the cry came in french and as if by magic the brigands disappeared into the woods behind the old fort and victory was upon the side of our friends      chapter xxi  into the heart of africa  well i sincerely trust we have no more such adventures  the speaker was randolph rover  he was seated on an old bench in one of the rooms of the fort binding up a finger which had been bruised in the fray  it was two hours later and the fight had come to an end some time previous  nobody was seriously hurt although sam dick and aleck were suffering from several small wounds  aleck had had his ear clipped by a bullet from captain villaires pistol and was thankful that he had not been killed  baxter the picture of misery was a prisoner  the bullys face was much swollen and one eye was in deep mourning  he sat huddled up in a heap in a corner and wondering what punishment would be dealt out to him  i suppose theyll kill me he groaned and it may be added that he thought he almost deserved that fate  you came just in time said dick  captain villaire was about to torture us into writing letters home asking for the money he wanted as a ransom  baxter put it into his head that we were very rich  oh please dont say anything more about it groaned the unfortunate bully  i  that frenchman put up this job all on his own hook  i dont believe it came promptly from randolph rover  you met him at boma you cannot deny it  so i did but be didnt say he was going to capture you and i   we dont care to listen to your falsehoods baxter interrupted dick sternly  you are fully as guilty as anybody you admitted it before  cujo had gone off to watch captain villaire and his party  he now came back bringing word that the brigand had taken a fallen tree and put out on the congo and was drifting down the stream along with several of his companions in crime  him wont come back said the tall african  him had enough of urn fight  nevertheless the whole party remained on guard until morning their weapons ready for instant use  but no alarm came and when day dawned they soon made sure that they had the entire locality around the old fort to themselves the frenchman with a broken arm having managed to crawl off and reach his friends  what to do with dan baxter was a conundrum  we cant take him with us and if we leave him behind he will only be up to more evil said dick  we ought to turn him over to the british authorities  no no dont do that pleaded the tall youth  let me go and ill promise never to interfere with you again  your promises are not worth the breath used in uttering them replied tom  baxter a worse rascal than you could not be imagined  why dont you try to turn over a new leaf  i will  if youll only give me one more chance pleaded the former bully of putnam hall  the matter was discussed in private and it was at last decided to let baxter go providing he would promise to return straight to the coast  and remember said dick if we catch you following us again we will shoot you on sight  i wont follow  dont be alarmed was the low answer and then baxter was released and conducted to the road running down to boma  he was given the knife he had carried but the rovers kept his pistol that he might not be able to take a longrange shot at them  soon he was out of their sight not to turn up again for a long while to come  it was not until the heat of the day had been spent that the expedition resumed its journey after an excellent meal made from the supplies captain villaires party had left behind in their hurried flight  some of the remaining supplies were done up into bundles by cujo to replace those which had been lost when the natives hired by randolph rover had deserted  its queer we didnt see anything of that man and woman from the inn remarked dick as they set off  i reckon they got scared at the very start  they journeyed until long after nightfall to make up for lost time as mr rover expressed it and so steadily did cujo push on that when a halt was called the boys were glad enough to rest they had reached a native village called rowimu  here cujo was well known and he readily procured good accommodations for all hands  the next week passed without special incident excepting that one afternoon the whole party went hunting bringing down a large quantity of birds and several small animals including an antelope which to the boys looked like a maine deer excepting for the peculiar formation of its horns  i wonder how mr blaze is making out said tom when they were returning to camp from the hunt   oh i reckon he is blasting away at game laughed sam and tom at once groaned over the attempted joke  perhaps we will meet him some day  if hes in this territory put in dick  but just now i am looking for nobody but father  and so are all of us said tom and sam promptly  they were getting deeper and deeper into the jungle and had to take good care that they did not become separated  yet cujo said he understood the way perfectly and often proved his words by mentioning something which they would soon reach a stream a little lake or a series of rocks with a tiny waterfall  been ober dis ground many times said the guide  i suppose this is the ground stanley covered in his famous expedition along the congo remarked dick as they journeyed along  but who really discovered the country uncle randolph  that is a difficult question to answer dick  the portuguese the spanish and the french all claim that honor along with the english  i fancy different sections were discovered by different nationalities  this free state you know is controlled by half a dozen nations  i wonder if the country will ever be thoroughly civilized  it will take a long while i am afraid  christianity will have to come first  many of the tribes in africa are you must remember without any form of religion whatever being even worse than what we call heathens who worship some sort of a god  dont they believe in anything asked sam  nothing sam  and their morality is of the lowest grade in consequence  they murder and steal whenever the chance offers and when they think the little children too much care for them they pitch them into the rivers for the crocodiles to feed upon  the beasts murmured tom  well i reckon at that rate civilization cant come too quick even if it has to advance behind bayonets and cannon      chapter xxii  a hurricane in the jungle  on and on went the expedition  in the past many small towns and villages had been visited where there were more or less white people but now they reached a territory where the blacks held full sway with  but this was rarely  a christian missionary among them  at all of the places which were visited cujo inquired about king susko and his people and at last learned that the african had passed to the southeast along the kassai river driving before him several hundred head of cattle which he had picked up here and there  him steal dat cattle explained cujo but him dont say dat stealin him say um  um   a tax on the people suggested dick  yes um tax  but him big vief  he must be unless he gives the people some benefit for the tax they are forced to pay said tom  at one of the villages they leaned that there was another american party in that territory one sent out by an eastern college to collect specimens of the flora of central africa  it was said that the party consisted of an elderly man and half a dozen young fellows  i wouldnt mind meeting that crowd said sam  they might brighten up things a bit  never mind things will pick up when once we meet king susko said dick  but i would like to know where the crowd is from and who is in it  its not likely we would know them if they are from the east said sam  probably they hail from yale or harvard  two days later the storm which cujo had predicted for some time caught them while they were in the midst of an immense forest of teak and rosewood  it was the middle of the afternoon yet the sky became as black as night while from a distance came the low rumble of thunder  there was a wind rushing high up in the air but as yet this had not come down any further than the treetops the birds of the jungle took up the alarm and filled the forest with their discordant cries and even the monkeys which were now numerous sit up a jabber which would have been highly trying to the nerves of a nervous person  yes we catch um said cujo in reply to dicks question  me look for safe place too stay  you think the storm will be a heavy one asked randolph rover anxiously  werry heavy massah werry heavy returned cujo  come wid me all ob you  and he set off on a run  all followed as quickly as they could and soon found themselves under a high mass of rocks overlooking the kassai river  they had hardly gained the shelter when the storm burst over their heads in all of its wild fury  my but this beats anything that i ever saw before cried sam as the wind began to rush by them with everincreasing velocity  him blow big bymeby said cujo with a sober face  him big storm dis  the air was full of a moanin sound to use alecks way of expressing it  it came from a great distance and caused the monkeys and birds to set up more of a noise than ever  the trees were now swaying violently and presently from a distance came a crack like that of a big pistol  was that a tree went down asked randolph rover and cujo nodded  it is a good thing then that we got out of the forest  big woods werry dangerous in heap storm like dis answered the african  tree come down maybe kill um hark now um comin  he crouched down between two of the largest rocks and instinctively the others followed suit  the moanin increased until with a roar and a rush a regular tropical hurricane was upon them the blackness of the atmosphere was filled with flying tree branches and scattered vines while the birds large and small swept past like chips on a swiftly flowing river powerless to save themselves in those fierce gusts  keep down for your lives shouted randolph rover but the roar of the elements drowned out his voice completely  however nobody thought of rising and the tree limbs and vines passed harmlessly over their heads  the first rush of wind over the rain began to fall at first in drops as big as a quarterdollar and then in a deluge which speedily converted the hollows among the rocks into deep pools and soaked everybody to his very skin  soon the water was up to their knees and pouring down into the river like a regular cataract  this is a soaker and no mistake said sam during a brief lull in the downpour  why i never saw so much water come down in my life  its a hurricane answered randolph rover it may keep on   he got no further for at that instant a blinding flash of lightning caused everybody to jump in alarm  then came an earsplitting crack of thunder and up the river they saw a magnificent baobab tree which had reared its stately head over a hundred feet high from the ground come crashing down split in twain as by a titans ax  the blackened stump was left standing and soon  this burst into flames to blaze away until another downpour of rain put out the conflagration  my but that dun been awful murmured aleck with a shiver  ise glad we didnt take no shelter under dat tree  amen said tom  he had been on the point of making some joke about the storm but now the fun was knocked completely out of him  it rained for the rest of the day and all of the night and for once all hands felt thoroughly miserable  several times they essayed to start a fire by which to dry themselves and make something hot to drink but each time the rain put out the blaze what they had to eat was not only cold but more or less water soaked and it was not until the next noon that they managed to cook a meal  when at last the sun did come out however it shone so sam put it with a vengeance  there was not a cloud left and the direct rays of the great orb of day caused a rapid evaporation of the rain so that the ground seemed to be covered with a sort of mist  on every side could be seen the effects of the hurricane broken trees washedout places along the river and dead birds and small animals including countless monkeys  the monkeys made the boys hearts ache especially one big female that was found tightly clasping two little baby monkeys to her breast  the storm had swollen the river to such an extent that they were forced to leave the beaten track cujo had been pursuing and take to another trail which reached out to the southward  here they passed a small village occupied entirely by negroes and cujo learned from them that king susko had passed that way but five days before  he had had no cattle with him the majority of his followers having taken another route  it was thought by some of the natives that king susko was bound for a mountain known as the hakiwaupi  or ghostofgold  the ghostofgold repeated dick  can that be the mountain father was searching for when he came to africa  inquiries from cujo elicited the information that the mountain mentioned was located about one hundred miles away in the center of an immense plain  it was said to be full of gold but likewise haunted by the ghost of a departed warrior known to the natives as gnuhomumoli  manofthegnueye  i reckon that ghost story was started by somebody who wanted to keep the wealth of che mountain to himself observed tom  i dont believe in ghosts do you cujo  the tall african shrugged his ebony shoulders maybe no ghost  but if dare is no want to see um he said laconically nevertheless he did not object to leading them in the direction of the supposedly haunted mountain  so far the natives had been more or less friendly but now those that were met said but little to cujo while scowls at the whites were frequent  it was learned that the college party from the east was in the vicinity  perhaps they did something to offend the natives observed randolph rover  as you can see they are simple and childlike in their ways and as quickly offended on one hand as they are pleased on the other  all of you must be careful in your treatment of them otherwise we may get into serious trouble      chapter xxiii  dick meets an old enemy  one afternoon dick found himself alone near the edge of a tiny lake situated on the southern border of the jungle through which the party had passed  the others had gone up the lake shore leaving him to see what he could catch for supper  he had just hooked a magnificent fish of a reddishbrown color when on looking up he espied an elderly man gazing at him intently from a knoll of watergrass a short distance away  richard rover is it  ahem  possible came slowly from the mans thin lips  surely i must be dreaming  josiah crabtree ejaculated dick so surprised that he let the fish fall into the water again  how on earth did you get out here  i presume i might  er  ask that same question returned the former teacher of putnam hall  did you follow me to africa  do you imagine i would be fool enough to do that mr crabtree no the stanhopes and i were content to let you go  so long as you minded your own business in the future  do not grow saucy boy i will not stand it  i am not saucy as you see fit to term it josiah crabtree  you know as well as i do that you ought to be in prison this minute for plotting the abduction of dora  i know nothing of the kind and will not waste words on you  but if you did not follow me why are you here  i am here on business and not ashamed to own it  indeed  and you  did you come in search of your missing father  i did  you once said he was missing  it is a long journey for one so young  its a queer place for you to come to  i am with an exploring party from yale college  we are studying the fauna and flora of central africa  at least they are doing so under my guidance  they must be learning a heap  under you  do you mean to say i am not capable of teaching them cried josiah crabtree wrathfully  well if i was in their place i would want somebody else besides the man who was discharged by captain putnam and who failed to get the appointment he wanted at columbia college because he could not stand the examination  boy  boy  you know nothing of my ability fumed crabtree coming closer and shaking his fist in dicks face  well i know something of your lack of ability  you are doing your best to insult me  such an old fraud as you cannot be insulted josiah crabtree  i read your real character the first time i met you and you have never done anything since which has caused me to alter my opinion of you  you have a small smattering of learning and you can put on a very wise look when occasion requires  but that is all there is to it except that behind it all you are a thoroughpaced scoundrel and only lack a certain courage to do some daring bit of rascality  this statement of plain truths fairly set josiah crabtree to boiling with rage  he shook his fist in dicks face again  dont dare to talk that way rover dont dare  or  ill  ill   what will you do  never mind ill show you when the proper time comes  i told you once before that i was not afraid of you  and i am not afraid of you now  you did not come to africa alone did you  to be sure i did not  i have a large party with me  in this vicinity  yes within calling distance  i tell you that  and its the truth  so that you wont try any underhand game on me  you  you   josiah crabtree broke off and suddenly grew nervous  see here rover let us be friends he said abruptly let us drop the past and be friendsat least so long as we are so far away from home and in the country of the enemy  this sudden change in manner astonished dick  was crabtree serious  certainly the mans manner would indicate as much  well im willing to let past matters drop  just for the present he answered hardly knowing what to say  i wish to pay all my attention to finding my father  exactly richard  and  er  you  who is with you  anybody i know  sam and dick and alexander pop  is it possible  and that black how is it be came along  he joined us by accident  but what of your party  they are a set of rich young students from yale in their senior year who engaged me to bring them hither for study and  er  recreation  and that puts me in mind you will not  ahem  say anything about the past to them will you      chapter xxiv  josiah crabtree makes a move  as quick as a flash of lightning dick saw through josiah crabtrees scheme for letting matters of the past drop  the former teacher of putnam hall was afraid the youth would hunt up the college students from yale and expose him to them  as a matter of fact crabtree was already on the outs with two of the students and he was afraid that if the truth regarding his character became known his present position would be lost to him and he would be cast off to shift for himself  you dont want me to speak to the students under your charge said dick slowly  oh of course you can speak to them if you wish  but i  ahem   i would not care to  er  er   to let them know what a rascal you are finished dick crabtree let me tell you once for all that you can expect no friendship from me  you are not worthy of it  when i meet those students i will tell them whatever i see fit  at these words josiah crabtree grew as white as a sheet  then setting his teeth he suddenly recovered  are those your friends he demanded pointing up the lake shore  as was perfectly natural dick turned to gaze in the direction as be did so crabtree swung a stick that be carried into the air and brought it down with all force on the youths head  dick felt a terrific pain saw a million or more dancing lights flash through his brainand then be knew no more  i guess ive fixed him muttered the former teacher of putnam hall grimly  he knelt beside the fallen boy and felt of his heart  not dead but pretty well knocked out  now what had i best do with him  he thought for a moment then remembered a deep hollow which he had encountered but a short while before  gazing around to make certain that nobody was watching him he picked up the unconscious lad and stalked off with the form back into the jungle and up a small hill  at the top there was a split between the rocks and dirt and into this he dropped poor dick a distance of twenty or more feet then he threw down some loose leaves and dead tree branches  now i reckon i am getting square with those rovers he muttered as he hurried away  the others of the rover party wondered why dick did not join them when they gathered around the campfire that night  he must be done fishing by this time said tom  i wonder if anything has happened to him  let us take a walk up de lake an see put in aleck and the pair started off without delay  they soon found the spot where dick had been fishing  his rod and line lay on the bank just as he had dropped it upon josiah crabtrees approach  dick  dick  where are you called out tom  no answer came back at first  then to toms astonishment a strange voice answered from the woods here i am  where are you  dat aint dick muttered aleck  dats sumbuddy else massah tom  so it is replied tom and presently saw a tall and wellbuilt young man struggling forth from the tall grass of the jungle  hullo what are you demanded the newcomer as he stalked toward them  i guess i can ask the same question laughed tom  are you the dick who just answered me  i am dick chester  and who are you  tom rover  i am looking for my brother dick who was fishing here a while ago are you one of that party of college students we have heard about  yes im a college student from yale  may i ask where you come from  in a brief manner tom told dick chester  we cant imagine what has become of my brother dick he went on  perhaps a lion ate him up answered the yale student  no you neednt smile we saw a lion only yesterday  it nearly scared mr crabtree into a fit  mr crabtree burst torn  josiah crabtree  the same  do you know him  indeed i do  to my sorrow  he used to be a teacher at the academy i and my brothers attend  but he was discharged  hes a regular rascal  you are sure of that queried dick chester  i have thought so all along but the others would hardly believe it  i am telling the truth and can prove all i say  but just now i am anxious about my brother  you say you saw a lion  yes  he was across the lake but mr crabtree was scared to death and ran away  frank rand and i took shots at the beast but i cant say if we hit him  it would be too bad if dick dunh fell into dat lions clutches put in aleck  i reckon de lion would chaw him up in no time  go back and call cujo said tom  he may be able to track my brothers footsteps  at once aleck loped off  while he was gone tom told dick chester much concerning himself and the college student related several facts in connection with the party to which he belonged  there are six of us students he said  we were going to have a professor from yale with us but he got sick at the last moment and we hired josiah crabtree  i wish we hadnt done it now for he has proved more of a hindrance than a help and his real knowledge of fauna and flora could be put in a peanut shell with room to spare  hes a big brag answered tom  take my advice and never trust him too far  or you may be sorry for it  presently aleck came back with cujo following  the brawny african began at once to examine the footprints along the lake shore  him been here he said  him came up dis way  but him no walk away  didnt walk away ejaculated tom  no  udder footprints walk away but not um massah dick  i dont understand cujo  do you think he  fell into the lake  perhaps massah tom  or maybe he get into boat  tom shook his head  i dont know of any boats around here  do you he asked of dick chester  no returned the young man from yale  but the natives living in the vicinity may have them  perhaps a native dun carry him off said aleck  he must be sumwhar dat am certain  yes he must be somewhere repeated tom sadly  by this time sam and randolph rover were coming up and also one of dick chesters friends  the college students were introduced to the others by tom and then a general hunt began for dick which lasted until the shades of night had fallen  but poor dick was not found and all wondered greatly what had become of him  tom and the others retired at ten oclock  but not to sleep for with dick missing none of the rovers could close an eye  we must find him in the morning said sam  we simply must  and the others agreed with him      chapter xxv  dick and the lion  when poor dick came to his senses he was lying in a heap on the decayed leaves at the bottom of the hollow between the rocks  the stuff josiah crabtree had thrown down still lay on top of him and it was a wonder that he had not been smothered  where in the world am i was the first thought which crossed his confused mind  he tried to sit up but found this impossible until he had scattered the dead leaves and tree branches  even then he was so bewildered that he hardly knew what to do excepting to stare around at his strange surroundings  slowly the truth dawned upon him  how josiah crabtree had struck him down on the lake shore  he must have brought me here he murmured  perhaps he thought i was dead  although dick did not know it he had been at the bottom of the hollow all evening and all night  the sun was now up once more but it was a day later than he imagined  the hollow was damp and full of ants and other insects and as soon as he felt able the youth got up  there was a big lump behind his left ear where the stick had descended and this hurt not a little  ill get square with him some day he muttered as he tried to crawl out of the hollow  he has more courage to play the villain than i gave him credit for  sometime ill face him again and then things will be different  it was no easy matter to get out of the hollow  the sides were steep and slippery and four times poor dick tried only to slip back to the bottom  he was about to try a fifth time when a sound broke upon his ears which caused him great alarm  from only a short distance away came the muffled roar of a lion  dick had never heard this sound out in the open before but he had heard it a number of times at the circus and at the menagerie in central park new york and he recognized the roar only too well  a lion he thought  my gracious  i trust he isnt coming this way  but he was coming that way as dick soon discovered  a few seconds of silence were followed by another roar which to the alarmed youth appeared to come from almost over his head  then came a low whine which was kept up for fully a minute followed by another roar  dick hardly knew what was best  to remain at the bottom of the hollow or try to escape to some tree at the top of the opening  if i go up now he may nab me on sight he thought dismally  oh if only i had my  thank heaven i have  dick had felt for his pistol before to find it gone  but now he spotted the glint of the shiny barrel among the leaves  the weapon had fallen from his person at the time crabtree had pitched him into the hollow  he reached for it and to his joy found that it was fully loaded and ready for use  presently he heard the bushes overhead thrust aside and then came a half roar half whine that made him jump  looking up he saw a lion standing on the edge of the hollow facing him  the monarch of the forest was holding one of his forepaws up and now he sat down on his haunches to lick the limb  then he set up another whine and shook the limb painfully  he has hurt that paw thought dick  wonder if he sees me  yes he did see just at that instant and started back in astonishment  then his face took on a fierce look and he gave a roar which could be heard for miles around  crack it was the report of dicks pistol but the youth was nervous and the bullet merely glanced along the lions body doing little or no damage  the beast roared again then crouched down and prepared to leap upon the youth  but the wounded forepaw was a hindrance to the lions movements and he began to crawl along the hollows edge seeking a better point from which to make a leap  then dicks pistol spoke up a second time  this shot was a far better one and the bullet passed directly through the kneejoint of the lions left forepaw  he was now wounded in both fore limbs and set up a roar which seemed to fairly make the jungle tremble  twice he started to leap down into the hollow but each time retreated to shake one wounded limb after another into the air with whines of pain and distress  as soon as the great beast reappeared once more dick continued his firing  soon his pistol was empty but the lion had not been hit again  in nervous haste the lad started to reload only to find that his cartridge box was empty  get out he yelled at the lion and threw a stone at the beast but the lion was now determined to descend into the hollow and paused only to calculate a sure leap to the boys head  but that pause brief as it was was fatal to the calculations of the monarch of the jungle  from his rear came two shots in rapid succession each hitting him in a vulnerable portion of his body he leaped up into the air rolled over on the edge of the hollow and then came down head first just grazing dicks arm and landing at the boys feet stone dead  hurrah  i reckon i hit him came in tom rovers voice  and so did i came from randolph rover  but he has disappeared  this way tom cried dick with all the strength he could command  he was shaking like a reed in the wind and all of the color had deserted his face  its dick ejaculated tom  i told you that i had heard several pistol shots  soon tom and mr rover presented themselves at the top of the hollow followed by aleck and cujo  the latter procured a rope made of twisted vines and by this dick was raised up without much difficulty      chapter xxvi  the last of josiah crabtree  all listened intently to the story dick had to tell and he had not yet finished when dick chester presented himself having been attracted to the vicinity by the roars of the lion and the various pistol and gun shots  this crabtree must certainly be as bad as you represent he said  i will have a talk with him when i get back to our camp  it wont be necessary for you to talk to him answered dick grimly  if youll allow me ill do the talking  all right grinned the yale student  do as you please  we are a getting tired of him  chester and cujo descended into the hollow to examine the lion there was a bullet in his right foreleg which chester proved had come from his rifle  he must be the beast frank rand and i fired at from across the lake  probably he had his home in the hollow and limped over to it during the night  in that case you are entitled to your fair share of the meat  if you wish any said randolph rover with a smile  but i think the pelt goes to tom for he fired the shot that was really fatal  and that skin did go to tom and lies on his parlor floor at home today  several of the students from yale had been out on a long tour the afternoon before in the direction of the mountain and they had reported meeting several natives who had seen king susko  he was reported to have but half a dozen of his tribe with him including a fellow known as poison eye  thats a bad enough title for anybody said sam with a shudder i suppose his job is to poison their enemies if they cant overcome them in regular battle  um tell de thruf put in cujo  once de mimi tribe fight king susko and whip him  den susko send poison eye to de mimi camp next day all drinkwater get bad an men women an children die off like um flies  thats cheerful information said tom  and why didnt they slay the poisoner  eberybody fraid to touch him  fraid he be poisoned  id run my chances  providing i had a knife or a club muttered tom  or a pistol finished sam  such rascals are not fit to live  dick as can readily be imagined was hungry and before the party started back for the lake the youth was provided with some food which aleck had very thoughtfully carried with him  it was learned that the two parties were encamped not far apart and dick chester said he would bring his friends to see them before the noon hour was passed  i dont believe be will bring josiah crabtree said tom  i reckon crabtree will take good care to keep out of sight  tom was right  when chester came over with his friends he said that the former teacher of putnam hall was missing having left word that he was going around the lake to look for a certain species of flower which so far they had been unable to add to their specimens  but he will have to come back said the vale student  he has no outfit with which to go it alone  he was right  crabtree put in an appearance just before the sun set over the jungle to the westward  he presented a most woebegone appearance having fallen into a muddy swamp on his face  i  i met with an  an unfortunate accident he said to chester i fell into the  ahem  mud and it was only with great difficulty that i managed to  er  to extricate myself  josiah crabtree you didnt expect to see me here did you said dick sternly as he stepped forward  and then the others of his party also came out from where they had been hiding in the brush  the former teacher of putnam hall started as if confronted by a ghost  why  er  where did you come from rover he faltered  you know well enough where i came from josiah crabtree cried dick wrathfully  you dropped me into the hollow for dead didnt you  why i  er  that  is  stammered crabtree but could actually go no further  dont waste words on him dick put in tom  give him the thrashing he deserves  thrashing gasped crabtree  yes thrashing replied dick  if we were in america i would have you locked up  but out here we must take the law into our own hands  i am going to thrash you to the very best of my ability and after that if i meet you again ill ill   dun shoot him on sight suggested aleck  you shall not touch me said the former teacher with a shiver chester  rand  will you not aid me against this  er  savage young brute  dont you call dick a brute put in sam  if there is any brute here it is you and everyone in our party will back up what i say  mr crabtree i have nothing to say in this matter said dick chester  it would seem that your attack on rover was a most atrocious one and out here you will have to take what punishment comes  but you will help me wont you rand pleaded the former teacher nervously  no i shall stand by chester answered rand  and will you too see me humiliated asked crabtree turning to the other yale students  i the head of your expedition into equatorial africa  mr crabtree we may as well come to an understanding said one of the students a heavyset young man named sanders  we hired you to do certain work for us and we paid you well for that work since we left america you have found fault with nearly everything and in a good many instances which i need not recall just now you have not done as you agreed  you are not the learned scientist you represented yourself to be  instead if we are to believe our newly made friends here you are a pretender a big sham and a brute in the bargain  this being so we intend to dispense with your services from this day forth  we will pay you what is coming to you give you your share of our outfit and then you can go your way and we will go ours  we absolutely want nothing more to do with you  this long speech on sanders part was delivered amid a deathlike silence  as the student went on josiah crabtree bit his lip until the blood came  once his baneful eyes fairly flashed fire at sanders and then at dick rover but then they fell to the ground  and so you  ahem  throw me off he said drawing a long breath  very well  but i demand all that is coming to me  you shall have every cent  and a complete outfit so that i can make my way back to the coast  all that is coming to you  no more and no less said sanders firmly  but he shant go without that thrashing cried dick and catching up a long whip he had had cujo cut for him he leaped upon josiah crabtree and brought down the lash with stinging effect across the former teachers face leaving a livid mark that crabtree was doomed to wear to the day of his death  there you are and there is another for the way you treated stanhope and another for what you did to dora and one for tom and another for sam and another   oh oh let up  the boy will kill me shrieked crabtree trying to run away  dont  i will be cut to pieces  dont  dont and as the lash came down over his head neck and shoulders he danced madly around in pain  at last he broke for cover and disappeared not to show himself again until morning when he called chester to him asked for and received what was coming to him and departed vowing vengeance on the rovers and all of the others  he will remember you for that dick said sam when the affair was over  he will be your enemy for life  let him be  i am not afraid of him responded the elder brother      chapter xxvii  the journey to the mountain  by noon of the day following the rover expedition was on its way to the mountain said to be so rich in gold  the students from yale went with them  its like a romance this search after your father said chester to dick  i hope you find him  you can rest assured that our party will do all we can for you  specimen hunting is all well enough but man hunting is far more interesting  i would like to go on a regular hunt for big game some day said tom  he had already mentioned mortimer blaze to the yale students  yes thats nice  if you are a crack shot like sanders  he can knock the spots from a playing card at a hundred yards  maybe hes a western boy laughed sam  he is  his father owns a big cattle ranch there and sanders learned to shoot while rounding up cattle  hes a tiptop fellow  they had passed over a small plain and were now working along a series of rough rocks overgrown with scrub brush and creeping vines full of thorns  the thorns stuck everybody but cujo who knew exactly how to avoid them  ise dun got scratched in steen thousand places groaned aleck dis am worse dan a bramble bush twice ober by golly  for two days the united expeditions kept on their way up the mountain side  which sloped gradually at its base the steeper portion still being several days journey distant  during these days they shot several wild animals including a beautiful antelope while sam caught a monkey  but the monkey bit the boy in the shoulder and sam was glad enough to get rid of the mischievous creature  on the afternoon of the second day cujo who was slightly in advance of the others called a halt  two men ahead ob us up um mountain he said  cujo vink one of dern king susko  i hope it is cried dick quickly  the discovery was talked over for a few minutes and it was decided that cujo should go ahead accompanied by randolph rover and dick  the others were to remain on guard for anything which might turn up  dick felt his heart beat rapidly as he advanced with his uncle and the african guide through the tangle of thorns and over the rough rocks  he felt that by getting closer to king susko he was also getting closer to the mystery which surrounded his fathers disappearance  dar him am whispered cujo presently  see da is gwine up into a big hole in de side ob de mountain  can you make out if it is susko or not  not fo certain massah dick  but him belong to de burnwo tribe an de udder man too  if they are all alone it will be an easy matter to capture them said randolph rover  all told we are twelve to two  they have disappeared into the cave cried dick a minute later come on and well soon know something worth knowing i feel certain of it  cujo now asked that he be allowed to proceed alone to make certain that no others of the burnwo tribe were in the vicinity  we must be werry careful he said  burnwos kill eberybody wot da find around here if not dare people  evidently they want to keep the whole mountain of gold to themselves observed dick  all right cujo do as you think best  i know we can rely upon you  after this they proceeded with more care than everalong a rocky edge covered with loose stones  to one side was the mountain to the other a sheer descent of several hundred feet and the footpath was not over a yard wide  a tumble here would be a serious matter said randolph rover take good care dick that you dont step on a rolling stone  but the ledge was passed in safety and in fifteen minutes more they were close to the opening is the side of the mountain  it was an irregular hole about ten feet wide and twice as high  the a rocks overhead stuck out for several yards and from these hung numerous vines forming a sort of japanese curtain over the opening  while the two rovers waited behind a convenient rock cujo crawled forward on his hand and knees into the cave  they waited for ten minutes just then it seemed an hour but he did not reappear  he is taking his time whispered dick  perhaps something has happened to him returned randolph rover i do not like this oppressive silence  have your pistol ready for use  we may need our weapons  ive had my pistol ready all along answered the boy exhibiting the weapon  that encounter with the lion taught me a lesson  if cujo  whats that  dick broke off short for a sound on the rocks above the cave entrance had reached his ears  both gazed in the direction but could see nothing  what alarmed you asked randolph rover hurriedly  i heard a rustling in the bushes up there perhaps though it was only a bird or some small animal  i can see nothing dick  neither can i but i am certain  out of sight uncle randolph quick  dick caught his uncle by the arm and both threw themselves flat behind the rocks  scarcely had they gone down than two spears came whizzing forward one hitting the rocks and the other sailing over their heads and burying itself in a tree trunk several yards away  they caught a glance of two natives on the rocks over them but with the launching of the spears the africans disappeared      chapter xxviii  king susko  my gracious this is getting at close range burst out dick when he could catch his breath again  uncle randolph they meant to kill us  indeed they did dick  and this is no safe place for stopping we must retreat  but cujo   he must be cautioned  randolph rover raised his voice  cujo cujo  they have discovered us  take care that they do not spear you  no reply came back to this call which was several times repeated then came a crash as a big stone was hurled down to split into a score of pieces on the rock which sheltered them  they mean to dislodge us said dick  if they would only show themselves   he stopped for he had seen one of the bumwos peering over a mass of short brush directly over the cave entrance  taking hasty aim with his pistol be fired  a yell of pain followed proving that the african had been hit but the bumwo was not seriously wounded and soon he sent another stone at them this time hitting randolph rover on the leg  oh gasped dicks uncle and drew up that member with a wry face  did he hurt you much uncle randolph  he hurt me enough  you villain take that  and now the man fired but the bullet flew wide of its mark for randolph rover had practiced but little with firearms  they now thought it time to retreat and watching their chance they ran from the rocks to the trees beyond  while they were exposed another spear was sent after them cutting its way through mr rovers hat brim and causing that gentleman to turn as pale as a sheet  a few inches closer and it would have been my head he ejaculated  this is growing too warm for comfort  perhaps we had better rejoin the others dick  cujo  cujo  where are you cried the boy once more  but as before no answer came back  the shots had alarmed the others of the expedition and all were hurrying along the rocky ledge when randolph rover and dick met them  we must turn back exclaimed randolph rover  if you go ahead we may be caught in an ambush  the bumwos have discovered our presence and mean to kill us if they can  suddenly a loud deep voice broke upon them coming from the rocks over the cave entrance  white men must leave this mountain cried the voice  this country belongs to the bumwos  white man has no right here  go go before it is too late  who is that who speaks demanded randolph rover  i am king susko chief of the bumwos  will you come and have a talk with us  no want to talk  want the white man to leave answered the african chief talking in fairly good english  we do not wish to quarrel with you king susko but you will find it best for you if you will grant us an interview went on randolph rover  the white man must go away from this mountain  i will not talk with him replied the african angrily  do you know why we are here  to rob the bumwos of their gold  no we are looking for a lost man one who came to this country years ago and one who was your prisoner   the white man is no longer here  he went home long time ago  we do not believe you cried tom  you have him a prisoner and unless you deliver him up you shall suffer dearly for it  this threat evidently angered the african chief greatly for suddenly a spear was launched at the boy which pierced toms shoulder  as tom went down a shout went up from the rocks and suddenly a dozen or more bumwos appeared shaking their spears and acting as if they meant to rush down on the party below without further warning      chapter xxix  the village on the mountain  tom is wounded shouted sam  he ran to his brother to find the blood flowing freely over toms shoulder  is it bad he asked  i  i guess not answered tom with a gasp of pain  then as full of pluck as usual tom raised his pistol and fired hitting one of the bumwos in the breast and sending him to the rear seriously wounded  it was evident that cujo had been mistaken and that there were far more of their enemies around the mountain than they had anticipated  from behind the rover expedition a cry arose telling that more of the natives were coming from that direction  we are being hemmed in said dick chester nervously  perhaps we had better retreat  no let us make a stand came from rand  i think a concerted volley from our pistols and guns will check their movements  dats de talk cried aleck  give it to em hot  it was decided to await the closer approach of the bumwos and each of the party improved the next minute in seeing to it that his weapon was ready for use  suddenly a bloodcurdling yell arose on the sultry air and the bumwos were seen to be approaching from two directions at right angles to each other  now then stand firm cried dick rover and began to fire at one of the approaching forces  the fight that followed was however short and full of consternation to the africans  one of the parties was led by king susko himself and the chief had covered less than half the distance to where the americans stood when a bullet from tom rovers pistol reached him wounding him in the thigh and causing him to pitch headlong on the grass  the fall of the leader made the africans set up a howl of dismay and instead of keeping up the fight they gathered around their leader  then as the americans continued to fire they picked king susko up and ran off with him  a few spears were hurled at our friends but the whole battle to use sams way of summing up afterward was a regular twoforacent affair  soon the bumwos were out of sight down the mountain side  the first work of our friends after they had made certain that the africans had really retreated was to attend to toms wound and the bruise randolph rover had received from the stone  fortunately neither man nor boy was seriously hurt although tom carries the mark of the spears thrust to this day  but i dont care said tom  i hit old king susko and that was worth a good deal for it stopped the battle  if the fight had kept on there is no telling how many of us might have been killed  while the party was deliberating about what to do next cujo reappeared  i go deep into de cabe when foah bumwos come on me from behind he explained  da fight an fight an knock me down an tie me wid vines an den run away  but i broke loose from de vines an cum just as quick as could run  werry big cabe dat an strange waterfall in de back  let us explore the cave said dick  somebody can remain on guard outside  some demurred to this but the rover boys could not be held back and on they went with aleck with them  soon randolph rover hobbled after them leaving cujo and the college students to remain on the watch  the cave proved to be a large affair running all of half a mile under the mountain  there were numerous holes in the roof through which the sun shone down making the use of torches unnecessary  to one side was a deep and swiftly flowing stream coming from the waterfall cujo had mentioned and disappearing under the rocks near the entrance to the cavern  gold true enough shouted dick as he gazed on the walls of the cave  am i not right uncle randolph  you are dick this is a regular cave of gold and no mistake no wonder king susko wanted to keep us away  soon the waterfall was gained  it was a fascinating scene to watch the sparkling sheet as it thundered downward a distance of fully a hundred feet  at the bottom was a pool where the water was lashed into a milky foam which went swirling round and round  look  look  the ghost suddenly cried sam and pointed into the falling water  oh uncle randolph did you ever see anything like it and he gave a shiver  there are no such things as ghosts sam replied his uncle  i see nothing  stand here and look answered sam and his uncle did as requested presently from out of the mist came the form of a man  the likeness of randolph rover himself  it is nothing but an optical illusion sam such as are produced by some magicians on the theater stage  the sun comes down through yonder hole and reflects your image on the wet rock which in turn reflects the form on the sheet of water  gracious  and that must be the ghost the natives believe in answered sam  im glad you explained it  i can tell you i was startled  here is a path leading up past the waterfall said dick who had been making an investigation  let us see what is beyond  take care of where you go warned randolph rover  there may be some nasty pitfall there  ill keep my eyes open responded dick  he ascended the rocks followed by sam while the others brought up in the rear  up over the waterfall was another cave long and narrow  there was now but little light from overhead but far in the distance could be seen a long narrow opening as if the mountain top had been by some convulsion of nature split in half  we are coming into the outer world again cried dick and ran forward  well i never he ejaculated  for beyond the opening was a small plain covered with short grass and surrounded on every side by jagged rocks which arose to the height of fifty or sixty feet  in the center of the plain were a number of native huts of logs thatched with palm      chapter xxx  finding the longlost  a village said randolph rover  and not a soul in sight  there are several women and children returned tom pointing to one of the huts  i guess the men went away to fight us  probably you are right tom  let us investigate but with caution  as they advanced the women and children set up a cry of alarm which was quickly taken up in several of the other huts  go away white men dont touch us cried one old woman  have the white men come at last cried a voice in the purest english  thank god  help me  help  it is my brothers voice gasped randolph rover  anderson anderson  we have come to save you  father came from the three rover boys and they rushed off in all haste toward the nut from which the welcome cry had proceeded  anderson rover was found in the center of the hut bound fast by a heavy iron chain to a post set deeply into the ground  his face was haggard and thin and his beard was all of a foot and a half long while his hair fell thickly over his shoulders  he was dressed in the merest rags and had evidently suffered much from starvation and from other cruel treatment  my sons he gasped as the boys appeared  do i see aright or is it only another of those wild dreams that have entered my brain lately  father poor father burst out dick and hugged his parent around the neck  its no dream father we are really here put in tom as he caught one of the slender hands while sam caught the other  how thin you are said sam  and then he added tenderly but well take good care of you now we have found you  and randolph murmured anderson rover as the brother came up oh thank god  thank god for this and the tears began to flow down his cheeks  how long i have waited  many a time i thought to give up in despair  we came as soon as we got that message you sent answered dick but that was long after you had sent it  and is the sailor converse safe  no the sailor is dead  too bad  he was the one friend i had here  and king susko has kept you a prisoner all this while asked randolph rover  yes and he has treated me shamefully in the bargain  he imagined i knew all of the secrets of this mountain of a gold mine of great riches and he would not let me go but instead tried to wring the supposed secret from me by torture  we will settle accounts with him some day muttered dick  its a pity tom didnt kill him  the native women and children were looking in at the doorway curiously not knowing what to say or do  turning swiftly dick caught one by the arm  the key to the lock he demanded pointing to the lock on the iron chain which bound anderson rover  give it to me  but the woman shook her head and pointed off in the distance  king susko has the key explained anderson rover  you will have to break the chain  and this was at last done although not without great difficulty  in the meantime the natives were ordered to prepare a meal for anderson rover and all of the others and cujo was called that he might question the africans in their own language  the meal was soon forthcoming the bumwo women fearing that they would be slaughtered if they did not comply with the demands of the whites  to make sure that the food had not been poisoned dick made several of the natives eat portions of each dish this made cujo grin  um know a good deal he remarked  cujo was goin to tell dick to do dat  i am glad the women and children are here said randolph rover we can take them with us when we leave and warn king susko that if he attacks us we will kill them  i think he will rather let us go than see all of the women and children slaughtered  while they ate anderson rover told his story which is far too long to insert here  he had found a gold mine further up the country and also this mountain of gold but had been unable to do anything since king susko had made him and the sailor prisoners during his captivity he had suffered untold cruelties but all this was now forgotten in the joy of the reunion with his brother and his three sons  it was decided that the party should leave the mountain without delay and cujo told the female natives to get ready to move  at this they set up a loud protest but it availed them nothing and they soon quieted down when assured that no harm would befall them if they behaved      chapter xxxi  home again  conclusion  nightfall found the entire expedition including the women and children on the mountain side below the caves  as the party went down the mountain a strict watch was kept for the bumwo warriors and just as the sun was setting they were discovered in camp on the trail to the northwest  we will send out a flag of truce said randolph rover  cujo can talk to them  this was done and presently a tall bumwo under chief came out in a plain to hold a mujobo or law talk  in a few words cujo explained the situation stating that they now held in bondage eighteen women and children including king suskos favorite wife afgona  if the whites were allowed to pass through the country unharmed until they reached the village of kwa where the kassai river joins the congo they would release all of the women and children at that point and they could go back to rejoin their husbands and fathers  if on the other hand the expedition was attacked the whites would put all of those in bondage to instant death  it is not likely that this horrible threat would have been put into execution as dick said when relating the particulars of the affair afterward  we couldnt have done such a terrible thing for it would not have been human  but the threat had the desired effect and in the morning king susko who was now on a sick bed sent word that they should go through unmolested  and go through they did through jungles and over plains across rivers and lakes and treacherous swamps watching continually for their enemies and bringing down many a savage beast that showed itself  on the return they fell in with mortimer blaze and he being a crack shot added much to the strength of their command  at last kwa was reached and here they found themselves under the protection of several european military organizations  the native women and children were released much to their joy and my readers can rest assured that these africans lost no time in getting back to that portion of the dark continent which they called home  from kwa to boma the journey was comparatively easy  at stanley pool they rested for a week and all in the party felt the better for it  some day i will go back and open up the mines i have discovered said anderson rover  but not now  i want to see my own dear native land first  at boma news awaited them  josiah crabtree had turned up and been joined by dan baxter and both had left for parts unknown  i hope we never see them again said dick and his brothers said the same  an american ship was in port bound for baltimore and all of our party including the yale students succeeded in obtaining passage on her for home  the trip was a most delightful one and no days could have been happier than those which the rover boys spent grouped around their lather listening to all he had to tell of the numerous adventures which had befallen him since he had left home a long letter was written to captain townsend telling of the finding of anderson rover and the master of the rosabel was later on sent a gift of one hundred dollars for his goodness to the rovers  of course anderson rover was greatly interested in what his sons had been doing and was glad to learn that they were progressing so finely at putnam hall  we will let arnold baxter drop he said  he is our enemy i know but just now we will let the law take its course for the rascality he practiced in albany  all right father answered dick  we can afford to let him drop seeing how well things have terminated for ourselves  and how happy we are going to be chimed in sam  and how rich  when father settles up that mining claim in the west put in tom  here i must bring to a finish the story of the rover boys adventures in the jungles of africa  they had started out to find their father and they had found him and for the time being all went well  the homecoming of the rovers was the occasion of a regular celebration at valley brook farm  the neighbors came in from far and wide and with them several people from the city who in former years had known anderson rover well  it was a time never to be forgotten and the celebration was kept up for several days  captain putnam was there and with him came frank fred larry and several others  the captain apologized handsomely to aleck for the way he had treated the colored man  i wish i had been with you said fred  you rover boys are wonders for getting around  where will you go next  i think well go west next answered dick  father wants to look up his mining interests you know  we are going to ask him to take us along  they did go west and what adventures they had will be related in a new volume entitled the rover boys out west or the search for a lost mine  but we are coming back to putnam hall first added tom  dear old putnam hall  i thought of it even in the heart of africa  and so did i put in sam  ill tell you fellows its good enough to roam around but after all there is no place like home  and with this truthful remark from the youngest rover let us close this volume kind reader hoping that all of us may meet again in the next book of the series to be entitled the rover boys out west or the search for a lost mine  in this story all of our friends will once more play important parts and we will learn what the baxters father and son did toward wresting the rover boys valuable mining property from them  but for the time being all went well and so goodby  the end
