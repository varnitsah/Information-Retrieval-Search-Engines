valleys dear from long ago to all who hear the whisperd spell of ken and tweed like music swell hard by the land debatable    or gleaming shannon seaward go       to all old friends  to all that yet remember well what secrets isis had to tell    how lazy cherwell loiterd slow    sweet aisles of blossomd may below whateer befall whateer befell       to all old friends     book ithe coming of paris   of the coming of paris to the house of menelaus king of lacedaemon and of the tale paris told concerning his past life  i  all day within the palace of the king    in lacedaemon was there revelry since menelaus with the dawn did spring    forth from his carven couch and climbing high    the tower of outlook gazed along the dry white road that runs to pylos through the plain    and markd thin clouds of dust against the sky and gleaming bronze and robes of purple stain  ii  then cried he to his serving men and all    obeyd him and their labour did not spare and women set out tables through the hall    light polishd tables with the linen fair    and water from the well did others bear and the good housewife busily brought forth    meats from her store and stinted not the rare wine from ismarian vineyards of the north  iii  the men drave up a heifer from the field    for sacrifice and sheathd her horns with gold and strong boethous the axe did wield    and smote her on the fruitful earth she rolld    and they her limbs divided fold on fold they laid the fat and cast upon the fire    the barley grain  such rites were wrought of old when all was orderd as the gods desire  iv  and now the chariots came beneath the trees    hard by the palace portals in the shade and menelaus knew king diocles    of pherae sprung of an unhappy maid    whom the great elian river god betrayd in the still watches of a summer night    when by his deep green watercourse she strayd and leand to pluck his waterlilies white  v  besides king diocles there sat a man    of all men mortal sure the fairest far for oer his purple robe sidonian    his yellow hair shone brighter than the star    of the long golden locks that bodeth war his face was like the sunshine and his blue    glad eyes no sorrow had the spell to mar were clear as skies the storm hath thunderd through  vi  then menelaus spake unto his folk    and eager at his word they ran amain and loosed the sweating horses from the yoke    and cast before them spelt and barley grain    and leand the polishd car with golden rein against the shining spaces of the wall    and called the searovers who followd fain within the pillard forecourts of the hall  vii  the strangerprince was followd by a band    of men all clad like rovers of the sea and brownd were they as is the desert sand    loud in their mirth and of their bearing free    and gifts they bore from the deep treasury and forests of some faroff eastern lord    vases of gold and bronze and ivory that might the pythian fane have overstored  viii  now when the king had greeted diocles    and him that seemd his guest the twain were led to the dim polishd baths where for their ease    cool water oer their lustrous limbs was shed    with oil anointed was each goodly head by asteris and phylo fair of face    next like two gods for loveliness they sped to menelaus in the banquetplace  ix  there were they seated at the kings right hand    and maidens bare them bread and meat and wine within that fair hall of the argive land    whose doors and roof with gold and silver shine    as doth the dwellingplace of zeus divine and helen came from forth her fragrant bower    the fairest lady of immortal line like morning when the rosy dawn doth flower  x  adraste set for her a shining chair    wellwrought of cedarwood and ivory and beautiful alcippe led the fair    the wellbeloved child hermione    a little maiden of long summers three her starlike head on helens breast she laid    and peepd out at the strangers wistfully as is the wont of children half afraid  xi  now when desire of meat and drink was done    and ended was the joy of minstrelsy queen helen spake beholding how the sun    within the heaven of bronze was riding high    truly my friends methinks the hour is nigh when men may crave to know what need doth bring    to lacedaemon oer wet ways and dry this prince that bears the sceptre of a king  xii  yea or perchance a god is he for still    the great gods wander on our mortal ways and watch their altars upon mead or hill    and taste our sacrifice and hear our lays    and now perchance will heed if any prays and now will vex us with unkind control    but anywise must man live out his days for fate hath given him an enduring soul  xiii  then tell us prithee all that may be told    and if thou art a mortal joy be thine and if thou art a god then rich with gold    thine altar in our palace court shall shine    with roses garlanded and wet with wine and we shall praise thee with unceasing breath    ah then be gentle as thou art divine and bring not on us baneful love or death  xiv  then spake the strangeras when to a maid    a young man speaks his voice was soft and low alas no god am i be not afraid    for even now the nodding daisies grow    whose seed above my grassy cairn shall blow when i am nothing but a drift of white    dust in a cruse of gold and nothing know but darkness and immeasurable night  xv  the dawn or noon or twilight draweth near    when one shall smite me on the bridge of war or with the ruthless sword or with the spear    or with the bitter arrow flying far    but as a mans heart so his good days are that zeus the lord of thunder giveth him    wherefore i follow fortune like a star whateer may wait me in the distance dim  xvi  now all men call me paris priams son    who widely rules a peaceful folk and still nay though ye dwell afar off there is none    but hears of ilios on the windy hill    and of the plain that the two rivers fill with murmuring sweet streams the whole year long    and walls the gods have wrought with wondrous skill where cometh never man to do us wrong  xvii  wherefore i saild not here for help in war    though well the argives in such need can aid the force that comes on me is other far    one that on all men comes i seek the maid    whom golden aphrodite shall persuade to lay her hand in mine and follow me    to my white halls within the cedar shade beyond the waters of the barren sea  xviii  then at the goddess name grew helen pale    like golden stars that flicker in the dawn or like a child that hears a dreadful tale    or like the roses on a rich mans lawn    when now the suns of summer are withdrawn and the loose leaves with a sad wind are stirrd    till the wet grass is strewn with petals wan so paled the golden helen at his word  xix  but swift the rose into her cheek returnd    and for a little moment like a flame the perfect face of argive helen burnd    as doth a womans when some spoken name    brings back to mind some ancient love or shame but none save paris markd the thing who said    my tale no more must weary this fair dame with telling why i wander all unwed  xx  but helen bending on him gracious brows    besought him for the story of his quest for sultry is the summer that allows    to mortal men no sweeter boon than rest    and surely such a tale as thine is best to make the daintyfooted hours go by    till sinks the sun in darkness and the west and soft stars lead the night along the sky  xxi  then at the word of helen paris spoke    my tale is shorter than a summer day my mother ere i saw the light awoke    at dawn in ilios shrieking in dismay    who dreamd that twixt her feet there fell and lay a flaming brand that utterly burnd down    to dust of crumbling ashes red and grey the coronal of towers and all troy town  xxii  then the interpretation of this dream    my father sought at many priestly hands where the white temple doth in pytho gleam    and at the fane of ammon in the sands    and where the oak tree of dodona stands with boughs oracular against the sky    and with one voice the gods from all the lands cried out the child must die the child must die  xxiii  then was i born to sorrow and in fear    the dark priest took me from my sire and bore a wailing child through beech and pinewood drear    up to the knees of ida and the hoar    rocks whence a fountain breaketh evermore and leaps with shining waters to the sea    through black and rockwalld pools without a shore and there they deemd they took farewell of me  xxiv  but round my neck they tied a golden ring    that fell from ganymedes when he soard high over ida on the eagles wing    to dwell for ever with the gods adored    to be the cupbearer beside the board of zeus and kneel at the eternal throne    a jewel twas from old king tross hoard that ruled in ilios ages long agone  xxv  and there they left me in that dell untrod    shepherd nor huntsman ever wanders there for dread of pan that is a jealous god    yea and the ladies of the streams forbear    the naiad nymphs to weave their dances fair or twine their yellow tresses with the shy    fronds of forgetmenot and maidenhair there had the priests appointed me to die  xxvi  but vainly doth a man contend with fate    my father had less pity on his son than wild things of the woodland desolate    tis said that ere the autumn day was done    a great shebear that in these rocks did wonn beheld a sleeping babe she did convey    down to a den beheld not of the sun the cavern where her own soft litter lay  xxvii  and therein was i nurtured wondrously    so rumour saith i know not of these things for mortal men are ever wont to lie    wheneer they speak of sceptrebearing kings    i tell what i was told for memory brings no record of those days that are as deep    lost as the lullaby a mother sings in ears of children that are fallen on sleep  xxviii  men say that now five autumn days had passd    when agelaus following a hurt deer trod soft on crackling acorns and the mast    that lay beneath the oak and beechwood sere    in dread lest angry pan were sleeping near then heard a cry from forth a cavern grey    and peeping round the fallen rocks in fear beheld where in the wild beasts tracks i lay  xxix  so agelaus bore me from the wild    down to his hut and with his children i was nurtured being as was deemd the child    of hermes or some mountain deity    for these with the wild nymphs are wont to lie within the holy caverns where the bee    can scarcely find a darkling path to fly through veils of bracken and the ivytree  xxx  so with the shepherds on the hills i strayd    and drave the kine to feed where rivers run and playd upon the reedpipe in the shade    and scarcely knew my manhood was begun    the pleasant years still passing one by one till i was chiefest of the mountain men    and clomb the peaks that take the snow and sun and braved the angerd lion in his den  xxxi  now in my herd of kine was one more dear    by far than all the rest and fairer far a milkwhite bull the captive of my spear    and all the wondering shepherds called him star    and still he led his fellows to the war when the lean wolves against the herds came down    then would he charge and drive their hosts afar beyond the pastures to the forests brown  xxxii  now so it chanced that on an autumn morn    king priam sought a goodly bull to slay in memory of his child no sooner born    than midst the lonely mountains cast away    to die ere scarce he had beheld the day and priams men came wandering afar    to that green pool where by the flocks i lay and straight they coveted the goodly star  xxxiii  and drave him no word spoken to the town    one man mine arrow lit on and he fell his comrades held me off and down and down    through golden windings of the autumn dell    they spurrd along the beast that loved me well till red were his white sides i following    wrath in my heart their evil deeds to tell in ilios at the footstool of the king  xxxiv  but ere they came to the godbuilded wall    they spied a meadow by the waterside and there the men of troy were gathered all    for joust and play and priams sons defied    all other men in all maeonia wide to strive with them in boxing and in speed    victorious with the shepherds had i vied so boldly followed to that flowery mead  xxxv  maeonia phrygia troia there were met    and there the king child of laomedon rich prizes for the vanquishers had set    damsels and robes and cups that like the sun    shone but the white bull was the chiefest one and him the victor in the games should slay    to zeus the king of gods when all was done and so with sacrifice should crown the day  xxxvi  now it were over long methinks to tell    the contest of the heady charioteers of them the goal that turnd and them that fell    but i outran the young men of my years    and with the bow did i outdo my peers and wrestling and in boxing overbold    i strove with hector of the ashen spears yea till the deepvoiced heralds bade us hold  xxxvii  then priam haild me winner of the day    mine were the maid the cup and chiefest prize mine own fair milkwhite bull was mine to slay    but then the murmurs waxd to angry cries    and hard men set on me in deadly wise my brethren though they knew it not i turnd    and fled unto the place of sacrifice where altars to the god of strangers burnd  xxxviii  at mine own funeral feast had i been slain    but fearing zeus they halted for a space and lo apollos priestess with a train    of holy maidens came into that place    and far did she outshine the rest in grace but in her eyes such dread was frozen then    as glares eternal from the gorgons face wherewith athene quells the ranks of men  xxxix  she was old priams daughter long ago    apollo loved her and did not deny his giftsthe things that are to be to know    the tongue of soothsaying that cannot lie    and knowledge gave he of all birds that fly neath heaven and yet his prayer did she disdain    so he his gifts confounded utterly and sooth she saith but evermore in vain  xl  she when her dark eyes fell on me did stand    at gaze a while with wan lips murmuring and then came nigh to me and took my hand    and led me to the footstool of the king    and calld me brother and drew forth the ring that men had found upon me in the wild    for still i bore it as a precious thing the token of a father to his child  xli  this sign cassandra showd to priam straight    the king waxd pale and askd what this might be and she made answer sir and king thy fate    that comes to all men born hath come on thee    this shepherd is thine own child verily how like to thine his shape his brow his hands    nay there is none but hath the eyes to see that here the child long lost to troia stands  xlii  then the king bare me to his lofty hall    and there we feasted in much love and mirth and priam to the mountain sent for all    that knew me and the manner of my birth    and now among the great ones of the earth in royal robe and state behold me set    and one fell thing i fear not even dearth whateer the gods remember or forget  xliii  my new rich life had grown a common thing    the pleasant years still passing one by one when deep in ida was i wandering    the glare of wellbuilt ilios to shun    in summer ere the day was wholly done when i beheld a goodly princethe hair    to bloom upon his lip had scarce begun the season when the flower of youth is fair  xliv  then knew i hermes by his golden wand    wherewith he lulls the eyes of men to sleep but nodding with his brows he bade me stand    and spake tonight thou hast a tryst to keep    with goddesses within the forest deep and paris lovely things shalt thou behold    more fair than they for which men war and weep kingdoms and fame and victories and gold  xlv  for lo tonight within the forest dim    do aphrodite and athene meet and hera who to thee shall bare each limb    each grace from golden head to ivory feet    and thee fair shepherd paris they entreat as thou mongst men art beauteous to declare    which queen of queens immortal is most sweet and doth deserve the meed of the most fair  xlvi  for late between them rose a bitter strife    in peleus halls upon his wedding day when peleus took him an immortal wife    and there was bidden all the gods array    save discord only yet she brought dismay and cast an apple on the bridal board    with let the fairest bear the prize away deep on its golden rind and gleaming scored  xlvii  now in the sudden night whenas the sun    in tethys silver arms hath slept an hour shalt thou be had into the forest dun    and brought unto a dark enchanted bower    and there of goddesses behold the flower with very beauty burning in the night    and these will offer wisdom love and power then paris be thou wise and choose aright  xlviii  he spake and passd and night without a breath    without a star drew on and now i heard the voice that in the springtime wandereth    the crying of dame heras shadowy bird    and soon the silence of the trees was stirred by the wise fowl of pallas and anigh    more sweet than is a girls first loving word the doves of aphrodite made reply  xlix  these voices did i follow through the trees    threading the coppice neath a starless sky when lo the very queen of goddesses    in golden beauty gleaming wondrously    even she that hath the heaven for canopy and in the arms of mighty zeus doth sleep    and then for dread methought that i must die but hera called me with soft voice and deep  l  paris give me the prize and thou shalt reign    oer many lordly peoples far and wide from them that till the black and crumbling plain    where the sweet waters of aegyptus glide    to those that on the northern marches ride and the ceteians and the blameless men    that round the risingplace of morn abide and all the dwellers in the asian fen  li  and i will love fair ilios as i love    argos and rich mycenae that doth hoard deep wealth and i will make thee king above    a hundred peoples men shall call thee lord    in tongues thou knowst not thou shalt be adored with sacrifice as are the gods divine    if only thou wilt speak a little word and say the prize of loveliness is mine  lii  then as i doubted like a sudden flame    of silver came athene and methought beholding her how stately as she came    that dim wood to a fragrant fane was wrought    so pure the warlike maiden seemd that nought but her own voice commanding made me raise    mine eyes to see her beauty who besought in briefest words the guerdon of all praise  liii  she spake nor wealth nor crowns are in my gift    but wisdom but the eyes that glance afar but courage and the spirit that is swift    to cleave her path through all the waves of war    endurance that the fates can never mar these and my loving friendshipthese are thine    and these shall guide thee steadfast as a star if thou hast eyes to know the prize is mine  liv  last in a lovely mist of rosy fire    came aphrodite through the forest glade the queen of all delight and all desire    more fair than when her naked foot she laid    on the blind meres wild wave that sank dismayd what time the sea grew smoother than a lake    i was too happy to be sore afraid and like a song her voice was when she spake  lv  oh paris what is power  tantalus    and sisyphus were kings long time ago but now they lie in the lake dolorous    the hills of hell are noisy with their woe    ay swift the tides of empire ebb and flow and that is quickly lost was hardly won    as ilios herself oerwell did know when high walls helpd not king laomedon  lvi  and what are strength and courage for the child    of mighty zeus the strong man herakles knew many days and evil ere men piled    the pyre in oeta where he got his ease    in death where all the ills of brave men cease nay love i proffer thee beyond the brine    of all the currents of the western seas the fairest woman in the world is thine  lvii  she spake and touched the prize and all grew dim    i heard no voice of angerd deity but round me did the night air swoon and swim    and when i wakend lo the sun was high    and in that place accursed did i lie where agelaus found the naked child    then with swift foot i did arise and fly forth from the deeps of that enchanted wild  lviii  and down i sped to ilios down the dell    where years agone the white bull guided me and through green boughs beheld where foamd and fell    the merry waters of the western sea    of love the sweet birds sang from sky and tree and swift i reachd the haven and the shore    and calld my mariners and followd free where love might lead across the waters hoar  lix  three days with fair winds ran we then we drave    before the north that made the long waves swell round malea but hardly from the wave    we scaped at pylos nestors citadel    and there the son of neleus loved us well and brought us to the high prince diocles    who led us hither and it thus befell that here below thy roof we sit at ease  lx  then all men gave the stranger thanks and praise    and menelaus for red wine bade call and the sun fell and dark were all the ways    then maidens set forth braziers in the hall    and heapd them high with lighted brands withal but helen passd as doth the fading day    pass from the world and softly left them all loud oer their wine amid the twilight grey  lxi  so night drew on with rain nor yet they ceased    within the hall to drink the gleaming wine and late they pourd the last cup of the feast    to argusbane the messenger divine    and last neath torches tall that smoke and shine the maidens strewd the beds with purple oer    that diocles and paris might recline all night beneath the echoing corridor     book iithe spell of aphrodite   the coming of aphrodite and how she told helen that she must depart in company with paris but promised withal that helen having fallen into a deep sleep should awake forgetful of her old life and ignorant of her shame and blameless of those evil deeds that the goddess thrust upon her  i  now in the upper chamber oer the gate    lay menelaus on his carven bed and swift and sudden as the stroke of fate    a deep sleep fell upon his weary head    but the softwinged god with wand of lead came not near helen wistful did she lie    till dark should change to grey and grey to red and golden throned morn sweep oer the sky  ii  slow passd the heavy night like one who fears    the step of murder she lies quivering if any cry of the night bird she hears    and strains her eyes to mark some dreadful thing    if but the curtains of the window swing stirrd by the breath of night and still she wept    as she were not the daughter of a king and no strong king her lord beside her slept  iii  now in that hour the folk who watch the night    shepherds and fishermen and they that ply strange arts and seek their spells in the starlight    beheld a marvel in the sea and sky    for all the waves of all the seas that sigh between the straits of helle and the nile    flushd with a flame of silver suddenly from soft cythera to the cyprian isle  iv  and hesperus the kindest star of heaven    that bringeth all things good waxd pale and straight there fell a flash of white malignant levin    among the gleaming waters desolate    the lights of sea and sky did mix and mate and change to rosy flame and thence did fly    the lovely queen of love that turns to hate like summer lightnings twixt the sea and sky  v  and now the bower of helen filld with light    and now she knew the thing that she did fear was close upon her for the black of night    doth burn like fire wheneer the gods are near    then shone like flame each helm and shield and spear that hung within the chamber of the king    but hethough all the bower as day was clear slept as they sleep that know no wakening  vi  but helen leapd from her fair carven bed    as some tormented thing that fear makes bold and on the ground she beat her golden head    and prayd with bitter moanings manifold    yet knew that she could never move the cold heart of the lovely goddess standing there    her feet upon a little cloud a fold of silver cloud about her bosom bare  vii  so stood queen aphrodite as she stands    unmoved in her bright mansion when in vain some naked maiden stretches helpless hands    and shifts the magic wheel and burns the grain    and cannot win her lover back again nor her old heart of quiet any more    where moonlight floods the dim sicilian main and the cool wavelets break along the shore  viii  then helen ceased from unavailing prayer    and rose and faced the goddess steadily till even the laughterloving lady fair    half shrank before the anger of her eye    and helen cried with an exceeding cry why does zeus live if we indeed must be    no more than sullen spoils of destiny and slaves of an adulteress like thee  ix  what wilt thou with me mistress of all woe    say wilt thou bear me to another land where thou hast other lovers  rise and go    where dark the pine trees upon ida stand    for there did one unloose thy girdle band or seek the forest where adonis bled    or wander wander on the yellow sand where thy first lover strewd thy bridal bed  x  ah thy first lover who is first or last    of men and gods unnumberd and unnamed lover by lover in the race is passd    lover by lover outcast and ashamed    oh thou of many names and evil famed what wilt thou with me  what must i endure    whose soul for all thy craft is never tamed whose heart for all thy wiles is ever pure  xi  behold my heart is purer than the plume    upon the stainless pinions of the swan and thou wilt smirch and stain it with the fume    of all thy hateful lusts idalian    my name shall be a hissing that a man shall smile to speak and women curse and hate    and on my little child shall come a ban and all my lofty home be desolate  xii  is it thy will that like a golden cup    from lip to lip of heroes i must go and be but as a banner lifted up    to beckon where the winds of war may blow    have i not seen fair athens in her woe and all her homes aflame from sea to sea    when my fierce brothers wrought her overthrow because athenian theseus carried me  xiii  me in my bloomless youth a maiden child    from artemis pure altars and her fane and bare me with pirithous the wild    to rich aphidna  many a man was slain    and wet with blood the fair athenian plain and fired was many a goodly temple then    but fire nor blood can purify the stain nor make my name reproachless among men  xiv  then helen ceased her passion like a flame    that slays the thing it lives by blazed and fell as faint as waves at dawn though fierce they came    by night to storm some rocky citadel    for aphrodite answerdlike a spell her voice makes strength of mortals pass away    dost thou not know that i have loved thee well and never loved thee better than today  xv  behold thine eyes are wet thy cheeks are wan    yet art thou born of an immortal sire the child of nemesis and of the swan    thy veins should run with ichor and with fire    yet this is thy delight and thy desire to love a mortal lord a mortal child    to live unpraised of lute unhymnd of lyre as any woman pure and undefiled  xvi  thou art the toy of gods an instrument    wherewith all mortals shall be plagued or blest even at my pleasure yea thou shalt be bent    this way and that howeer it like me best    and following thee as tides the moon the west shall flood the eastern coasts with waves of war    and thy vexd soul shall scarcely be at rest even in the havens where the deathless are  xvii  the instruments of men are blind and dumb    and this one gift i give thee to be blind and heedless of the thing that is to come    and ignorant of that which is behind    bearing an innocent forgetful mind in each new fortune till i visit thee    and stir thy heart as lightning and the wind bear fire and tumult through a sleeping sea  xviii  thou shalt forget hermione forget    thy lord thy lofty palace and thy kin thy hand within a strangers shalt thou set    and follow him nor deem it any sin    and many a strange land wandring shalt thou win and thou shalt come to an unhappy town    and twenty long years shalt thou dwell therein before the argives mar its towery crown  xix  and of thine end i speak not but thy name    thy name which thou lamentestthat shall be a song in all mens speech a tongue of flame    between the burning lips of poesy    and the nine daughters of mnemosyne with prince apollo leader of the nine    shall make thee deathless in their minstrelsy yea for thou shalt outlive the race divine  xx  the race of gods for like the sons of men    we gods have but our season and go by and cronos passd and uranus and then    shall zeus and all his children utterly    pass and new gods be born and reign and die but thee shall lovers worship evermore    what gods soeer usurp the changeful sky or flit to the irremeable shore  xxi  now sleep and dream not sleep the long day through    and the brief watches of the summer night and then go forth amid the flowers and dew    where the red rose of dawn outburns the white    then shalt thou learn my mercy and my might between the drowsy lily and the rose    there shalt thou spell the meaning of delight and know such gladness as a goddess knows  xxii  then sleep came floating from the lemnian isle    and over helen crushd his poppy crown her soft lids waverd for a little while    then on her carven bed she laid her down    and sleep the comforter of king and clown kind sleep the sweetest near akin to death    held her as close as death doth men that drown so close that none might hear her inward breath  xxiii  so close no man might tell she was not dead    and then the goddess took her zonewhere lies all her enchantment love and lustihead    and the glad converse that beguiles the wise    and grace the very gods may not despise and sweet desire that doth the whole world move    and therewith touchd she helens sleeping eyes and made her lovely as the queen of love  xxiv  then laughterloving aphrodite went    to far idalia over land and sea and scarce the fragrant cedarbranches bent    beneath her footsteps faring daintily    and in idalia the graces three anointed her with oil ambrosial    so to her house in sidon wended she to mock the prayers of lovers when they call  xxv  and all day long the incense and the smoke    lifted and fell and soft and slowly rolld and many a hymn and musical awoke    between the pillars of her house of gold    and rosecrownd girls and fair boys linenstoled did sacrifice her fragrant courts within    and in dark chapels wrought rites manifold the loving favour of the queen to win  xxvi  but menelaus waking suddenly    beheld the dawn was white the day was near and rose and kissd fair helen no goodbye    he spake and never markd a fallen tear    men know not when they part for many a year he graspd a bronzeshod lance in either hand    and merrily went forth to drive the deer with paris through the dewy morning land  xxvii  so up the steep sides of taygetus    they fared and to the windy hollows came while from the streams of deep oceanus    the sun arose and on the fields did flame    and through wet glades the huntsmen drave the game and with them paris swayd an ashen spear    heavy and long and shod with bronze to tame the mountaindwelling goats and forest deer  xxviii  now in a copse a mighty boar there lay    for through the boughs the wet winds never blew nor lit the bright sun on it with his ray    nor rain might pierce the woven branches through    but leaves had fallen deep the lair to strew then questing of the hounds and mens footfall    aroused the boar and forth he sprang to view with eyes that burnd at bay before them all  xxix  then paris was the first to rush on him    with spear aloft in his strong hand to smite and through the monster pierced the point and dim    the flame fell in his eyes and all his might    with his last cry went forth forgetting fight forgetting strength he fell and gladly then    they gatherd round and dealt with him aright then left his body with the serving men  xxx  now birds were long awake that with their cry    were wont to waken helen and the dew where fell the sun upon the lawn was dry    and all the summer land was glad anew    and maidens footsteps rang the palace through and with their footsteps chimed their happy song    and one to other cried a marvel new that softwingd sleep hath held the queen so long  xxxi  then phylo brought the child hermione    and close unto her mothers side she crept and oer her godlike beauty tumbled she    chiding her sweetly that so late she slept    and babbling still a merry coil she kept but like a woman stiff beneath her shroud    lay helen till the young child feard and wept and ran and to her nurses cried aloud  xxxii  then came the women quickly and in dread    gatherd round helen but might naught avail to wake her moveless as a maiden dead    that artemis hath slain yet nowise pale    she lay but aethra did begin the wail and all the women with sad voice replied    who deemd her passd unto the poplar vale wherein doth dread persephone abide  xxxiii  ah slowly passd the miserable day    in the rich house that late was full of pride then the sun fell and all the paths were grey    and menelaus from the mountainside    came and through palace doors all open wide rang the wild dirge that told him of the thing    that helen that the queen had strangely died then on his threshold fell he grovelling  xxxiv  and cast the dust upon his yellow hair    and but that paris leapd and held his hand his hunters knife would he have clutchd and there    had slain himself to follow to that land    where flit the ghosts of men a shadowy band that have no more delight no more desire    when once the flesh hath burnd down like a brand drenchd by the dark wine on the funeral pyre  xxxv  so on the ashen threshold lay the king    and all within the house was chill and drear the women watchers gatherd in a ring    about the bed of helen and her bier    and much had they to tell and much to hear of happy queens and fair untimely dead    such joy they took amid their evil cheer while the low thunder muttered overhead     book iiithe flight of helen   the flight of helen and paris from lacedaemon and of what things befell them in their voyaging and how they came to troy  i  the grey dawns daughter rosy morn awoke    in old tithonus arms and suddenly let harness her swift steeds beneath the yoke    and drave her shining chariot through the sky    then men might see the flocks of thunder fly all gold and rose the azure pastures through    what time the lark was carolling on high above the gardens drenchd with rainy dew  ii  but aphrodite sent a slumber deep    on all in the kings palace young and old and one by one the women fell asleep    their lamentable tales left half untold    before the dawn when folk wax weak and cold but helen wakend with the shining morn    forgetting quite her sorrows manifold and light of heart as was the day newborn  iii  she had no memory of unhappy things    she knew not of the evil days to come forgotten were her ancient wanderings    and as lethaean waters wholly numb    the sense of spirits in elysium that no remembrance may their bliss alloy    even so the rumour of her days was dumb and all her heart was ready for new joy  iv  the young day knows not of an elder dawn    joys of old noons old sorrows of the night and so from helen was the past withdrawn    her lord her child her home forgotten quite    lost in the marvel of a new delight she was as one who knows he shall not die    when earthly colours melt into the bright pure splendour of his immortality  v  then helen rose and all her body fair    she bathd in the spring water pure and cold and with her hand bound up her shining hair    and clothed her in the raiment that of old    athene wrought with marvels manifold a bridal gift from an immortal hand    and all the front was claspd with clasps of gold and for the girdle was a golden band  vi  next from her upper chamber silently    went helen moving like a morning dream she did not know the golden roof the high    walls and the shields that on the pillars gleam    only she heard the murmur of the stream that waters all the gardens wide expanse    this song and cry of singing birds did seem to guide her feet as music guides the dance  vii  the music drew her on to the glad air    from forth the chamber of enchanted death and lo the world was waking everywhere    the wind went by a cool delicious breath    like that which in the gardens wandereth the golden gardens of the hesperides    and in its song unheard of things it saith the myriad marvels of the fairy seas  viii  so through the courtyard to the garden close    went helen where she heard the murmuring of water twixt the lily and the rose    for thereby doth a double fountain spring    to one stream do the women pitchers bring by menelaus gates at close of day    the other through the close doth shine and sing then to the swift eurotas fleets away  ix  and helen sat her down upon the grass    and pluckd the little daisies white and red and tossd them where the running waters pass    to watch them racing from the fountainhead    and whirld about where little streams dispread and still with merry birds the garden rang    and marry marry in their song they said or so do maids interpret that they sang  x  then stoopd she down and watchd the crystal stream    and fishes poising where the waters ran and lo upon the glass a golden gleam    and purple as of robes sidonian    then sudden turning she beheld a man that knelt beside her as her own face fair    was his and oer his shoulders for a span fell the bright tresses of his yellow hair  xi  then either lookd on other with amaze    as each had seen a god for no long while they marvelld but as in the first of days    the first of men and maids did meet and smile    and aphrodite did their hearts beguile so hands met hands lips lips with no word said    were they enchanted neath that leafy aisle and silently were wood betrothd and wed  xii  ah slowly did their silence wake to words    that scarce had more of meaning than the song pourd forth of the innumerable birds    that fill the palace gardens all day long    so innocent so ignorant of wrong was she so happy each in others eyes    thus wrought the mighty goddess that is strong even to make naught the wisdom of the wise  xiii  now in the midst of that enchanted place    right gladly had they lingerd all day through and fed their love upon each others face    but aphrodite had a counsel new    and silently to paris side she drew in guise of aethra whispering that the day    passd on while his ship waited and his crew impatient in the narrow gythian bay  xiv  for thither had she brought them by her skill    but helen saw her notnay who can see a goddess come or go against her will    then paris whisperd come ah love with me    come to a shore beyond the barren sea there doth the bridal crown await thy head    and there shall all the land be glad of thee then like a child she followd where he led  xv  for like a childs her gentle heart was glad    so through the courtyard passd they to the gate and even there as aphrodite bade    the steeds of paris and the chariots wait    then to the wellwrought car he led her straight and grasped the shining whip and golden rein    and swift they drave until the day was late by clear eurotas through the fruitful plain  xvi  but now within the halls the magic sleep    was broken and men sought them everywhere yet aphrodite cast a cloud so deep    about their chariot none might see them there    and strangely did they hear the trumpets blare and noise of racing wheels yet saw they nought    then died the sounds upon the distant air and safe they won the haven that they sought  xvii  beneath a grassy cliff beneath the down    where swift eurotas mingles with the sea there climbd the grey walls of a little town    the sleepy waters washd it languidly    for tempests in that haven might not be the isle across the inlet guarded all    and the shrill winds that roam the ocean free broke and were broken on the rocky wall  xviii  then paris did a point of hunting blow    nor yet the sound had died upon the hill when round the isle they spied a scarlet prow    and oars that flashd into that haven still    the oarsmen bending forward with a will and swift their black ship to the havenside    they brought and steerd her in with goodly skill and bare on board the strange achaean bride  xix  now while the swift ship through the waters clave    all happy things that in the waters dwell arose and gambolld on the glassy wave    and nereus led them with his sounding shell    yea the seanymphs their dances weaving well in the green water gave them greeting free    ah long light lingerd late the darkness fell that night upon the isle of cranae  xx  and hymen shook his fragrant torch on high    till all its waves of smoke and tongues of flame like clouds of rosy gold fulfilld the sky    and all the nereids from the waters came    each maiden with a musical sweet name doris and doto and amphithoe    and their shrill bridal song of love and shame made music in the silence of the sea  xxi  for this was like that night of summer weather    when mortal men and maidens without fear and forestnymphs and forestgods together    do worship pan in the long twilight clear    and artemis this one night spares the deer and every cave and dell and every grove    is glad with singing soft and happy cheer with laughter and with dalliance and with love        xxii  now when the goldenthroned dawn arose    to waken gods and mortals out of sleep queen aphrodite sent the wind that blows    from fairy gardens of the western deep    the sails are spread the oars of paris leap past many a headland many a haunted fane    and merrily all from isle to isle they sweep oer the wet ways across the barren plain  xxiii  by many an island fort and many a haven    they sped and many a crowded arsenal they saw the loves of gods and men engraven    on friezes of astartes temple wall    they heard that ancient shepherd proteus call his flock from forth the green and tumbling lea    and saw white thetis with her maidens all sweep up to high olympus from the sea  xxiv  they saw the vain and weary toil of men    the ships that win the rich man all he craves they passd the redprowd barks egyptian    and heard afar the moaning of the slaves    pent in the dark hot hold beneath the waves and scatheless the sardanian fleets among    they saild by men that sow the sea with graves bearing black fate to folk of alien tongue  xxv  then all day long a rolling cloud of smoke    would hang on the sealimits faint and far but through the night the beaconflame upbroke    from some rich islandtown begirt with war    and all these things could neither make nor mar the joy of lovers wandering but they    sped happily and heedless of the star that hung oer their glad haven far away  xxvi  the fishersentinel upon the height    watchd them with vacant eyes and little knew they bore the fate of troy to him the bright    plashed waters with the silver shining through    when tunny shoals came cruising in the blue was more than love that doth the world unmake    and listless gazed he as the gulls that flew and shriekd and chatterd in the vessels wake  xxvii  so the wind drave them and the waters bare    across the great green plain unharvested till through an afterglow they knew the fair    faint rose of snow on distant idas head    and swifter then the joyous oarsmen sped but night was ended and the waves were fire    beneath the fleet feet of a dawning red or ere they won the land of their desire  xxviii  now when the folk about the haven knew    the scarlet prow of paris swift they ran and the good ship within the haven drew    and merrily their welcoming began    but none the face of helen dared to scan their bold eyes fell before they had their fill    for all men deemd her that idalian who loved anchises on the lonely hill  xxix  but when her sweet smile and her gentleness    and her kind speech had won them from dismay they changed their minds and gan the gods to bless    who brought to ilios that happy day    and all the folk fair helen must convey crownd like a bride and clad with flamehued pall    through the rich plain along the waterway right to the great gates of the ilian wall  xxx  and through the vines they passd where old and young    had no more heed of the glad vintaging but all unpluckd the purple clusters hung    nor more of linus did the minstrel sing    for he and all the folk were following winestaind and garlanded in merry bands    like men when dionysus came as king and led his revel from the sunburnt lands  xxxi  so from afar the music and the shout    rolld up to ilios and the scaean gate and at the sound the city folk came out    and bore sweet helensuch a fairy weight    as none might deem the burden of troys fate across the threshold of the town and all    flockd with her where king priam sat in state girt by his elders on the ilian wall  xxxii  no man but knew him by his crown of gold    and goldenstudded sceptre and his throne ay strong he seemd as those great kings of old    whose image is eternal on the stone    won from the dust that once was babylon but kind of mood was he withal and mild    and when his eyes on argive helen shone he loved her as a father doth a child  xxxiii  round him were set his peers as panthous    antenor and agenor hardly grey scarce touchd as yet with age nor garrulous    as are cicalas on a sunny day    such might they be when years had slippd away and made them overweak for war or joy    content to watch the leaguer as it lay beside the ships beneath the walls of troy  xxxiv  then paris had an easy tale to tell    which then might win upon mens wondring ears who deemd that gods with mortals deign to dwell    and that the water of the west enspheres    the happy isles that know not death nor tears yea and though monsters do these islands guard    yet men within their coasts had dwelt for years uncounted with a strange love for reward  xxxv  and there had paris ventured so said he    had known the sirens song and circes wile and in a cove of that hesperian sea    had found a maiden on a lonely isle    a sacrifice if so men might beguile the wrath of some beastgod they worshippd there    but paris twixt the sea and strait defile had slain the beast and won the woman fair  xxxvi  then while the happy people cried well done    and priams heart was melted by the tale for paris was his bestbeloved son    came a wild woman with wet eyes and pale    sad face men lookd on when she cast her veil not gladly and none markd the thing she said    yet must they hear her long and boding wail that followd still however fleet they fled  xxxvii  she was the priestess of apollos fane    cassandra and the god of prophecy spurrd her to speak and rent her but in vain    she tossd her wasted arms against the sky    and brake her golden circlet angrily and shriekd that they had brought within the gate    helen a serpent at their hearts to lie helen a hell of people king and state  xxxviii  but ere the god had left her ere she fell    and foamd among her maidens on the ground the air was ringing with a merry swell    of flute and pipe and every sweetest sound    in aphrodites fane and all around were roses tossd beneath the glimmering green    of that high roof and helen there was crownd the goddess of the trojans and their queen     book ivthe death of corythus      how helen was made an outcast by the trojan women and how oenone the    old love of paris sent her son corythus to him as her messenger and    how paris slew him unwittingly and of the curses of oenone and the    coming of the argive host against troy  i  for long in troia was there peace and mirth    the pleasant hours still passing one by one and helen joyd at each fresh mornings birth    and almost wept at setting of the sun    for sorrow that the happy day was done nor dreamd of years when she should hate the light    and mourn afresh for every day begun nor fare abroad save shamefully by night  ii  and paris was not one to backward cast    a fearful glance nor pluck sour fruits of sin half ripe but seized all pleasures while they last    nor boded evil ere ill days begin    nay nor lamented much when caught therein in each adventure always finding joy    and hopeful still through waves of war to win by strength of hector and the star of troy  iii  now as the storms drive white seabirds afar    within green upland glens to seek for rest so rumours pale of an approaching war    were blown across the islands from the west    for agamemnon summond all the best from towns and tribes he ruled and gave command    that free men all should gather at his hest through coasts and islets of the argive land  iv  sidonian merchantmen had seen the fleet    black wargalleys that sped from town to town had heard the hammers of the bronzesmiths beat    the long day through and when the sun went down    and thin said they would show the leafy crown on many a sacred mountainpeak in spring    for men had felld the pinetrees tall and brown to fashion them curved ships for seafaring  v  and still the rumour grew for heralds came    old men from argos bearing holy boughs demanding great atonement for the shame    and sore despite done menelaus house    but homeward soon they turnd their scarlet prows and all their weary voyaging was vain    for troy had bound herself with awful vows to cleave to helen till the walls were taen  vi  and now like swallows ere the winter weather    the women in shrill groups were gathering with eager tongues still communing together    and many a taunt at helen would they fling    ay through her innocence she felt the sting and shamed was now her gentle face and sweet    for een the children evil songs would sing to mock her as she hasted down the street  vii  also the men who worshippd her of old    as she had been a goddess from above gazed at her now with lustful eyes and bold    as she were naught but paris lightolove    and though in truth they still were proud enough of that fair gem in their old city set    yet well she knew that wanton word and scoff went round the campfire when the warriors met  viii  there came a certain holiday when troy    was wont to send her noble matrons all young wives and old with clamour and with joy    to clothe athene in her temple hall    and robe her in a stately broiderd pall but now they drove fair helen from their train    better they screamd to cast her from the wall than mock the gods with offerings in vain  ix  one joy she had that paris yet was true    ay fickle paris true unto the end and in the court of ilios were two    kind hearts still eager helen to defend    and help and comfort in all need to lend the gentle hector with soft speech and mild    and the old king that ever was her friend and loved her as a father doth his child  x  these though they knew not all these blamed her not    but cast the heavy burden on the god whose wrath they deemd had verily waxed hot    against the painful race on earth that trod    and in gods hand was helen but the rod to scourge a people that in unknown wise    had vexd the far olympian abode with secret sin or stinted sacrifice         xi  the days grew into months and months to years    and still the argive army did delay till folk in troia half forgot their fears    and almost as of old were glad and gay    and men and maids on ida dared to stray but helen dwelt within her inmost room    and there from dawning to declining day wrought at the patient marvels of her loom  xii  yet even there in peace she might not be    there was a nymph oenone in the hills the daughter of a rivergod was she    of cebrenthat the mountain silence fills    with murmurd music for the countless rills of ida meet him dancing to the plain    her paris wooed yet ignorant of ills among the shepherds huts nor wooed in vain  xiii  nay summer often found them by the fold    in these glad days ere paris was a king and oft the autumn in his car of gold    had passd them merry at the vintaging    and scarce they felt the breath of the white wing of winter in the cave where they would lie    on beds of heather by the fire till spring should crown them with her buds in passing by  xiv  for elbowdeep their flowery bed was strown    with fragrant leaves and with crushd asphodel and sweetly still the shepherdpipe made moan    and many a tale of love they had to tell    how daphnis loved the strange shy maiden well and how she loved him not and how he died    and oaktrees moand his dirge and blossoms fell like tears from lindens by the waterside  xv  but colder fleeter than the winters wing    time passd and paris changed and now no more oenone heard him on the mountain sing    not now she met him in the forest hoar    nay but she knew that on an alien shore an alien love he sought yet was she strong    to live who deemd that even as of yore in days to come might paris love her long  xvi  for dark oenone from her father drew    a power beyond all price the gift to deal with wounded men though now the dreadful dew    of death anoint them and the secret seal    of fate be set on them these might she heal and thus oenone trusted still to save    her lover at the point of death and steal his life from helen and the amorous grave  xvii  and she had borne though paris knew it not    a child fair corythus to be her shame and still she mused whenas her heart was hot    he hath no child by that achaean dame    but when her boy unto his manhood came then sorer yet oenone did repine    and bade him fare to ilios and claim thy fathers love and all that should be thine  xviii  therewith a golden bodkin from her hair    she drew and from a greentressd birchen tree she pluckd a strip of smooth white bark and fair    and many signs and woful graved she    a message of the evil things to be then deftly closed the birchbark fold on fold    and bound the tokens well and cunningly three times and four times with a thread of gold  xix  give these to argive helens hand she cried    and so embraced her child and with no fear beheld him leaping down the mountainside    like a kings son that goes to hunt the deer    clad softly and in either hand a spear with two swiftfooted hounds that followd him    so leapd he down the grassy slopes and sheer and won the precinct of the forest dim  xx  he trod that ancient path his sire had trod    far far below he saw the sea the town he moved as light as an immortal god    for mansions in olympus gliding down    he left the shadow of the forest brown and through the shallow waters did he cross    and stood ere twilight fell within the crown of towers the sacred keep of ilios  xxi  now folk that markd him hasting deemd that he    had come to tell the host was on its way as one that from the hills had seen the sea    beclouded with the danaan array    so straight to paris house with no delay they led him and did eagerly await    within the forecourt in the twilight grey to hear some certain message of their fate  xxii  now paris was asleep upon his bed    tired with a listless day but all along the palace chambers corythus was led    and still he heard a music shrill and strong    that seemd to clamour of an oldworld wrong and hearts a long time broken last they came    to helens bower the fountain of the song that cried so loud against an ancient shame  xxiii  and helen fared before a mighty loom    and sang and cast her shuttle wrought of gold and forth unto the utmost secret room    the wave of her wild melody was rolld    and still she fashiond marvels manifold strange shapes of fish and serpent bear and swan    the loves of the immortal gods of old wherefrom the peoples of the world began  xxiv  now helen met the stranger graciously    with gentle speech and bade set forth a chair well wrought of cedar wood and ivory    that wise icmalius had fashiond fair    but when young corythus had drunk the rare wine of the princes and had broken bread    then helen took the word and bade declare his instant tidings and he spake and said  xxv  lady and queen i have a secret word    and bear a token sent to none but thee also i bring message to my lord    that spoken to another may not be    then helen gave a sign unto her three bowermaidens and they went forth from that place    silent they went and all forebodingly they left the man and woman face to face  xxvi  then from his breast the birchen scroll he took    and gave to helen and she read therein oh thou that on those hidden runes dost look    hast thou forgotten quite thine ancient sin    thy lord thy lofty palace and thy kin even as thy love forgets the words he spoke    the strong oath broken one weak heart to win the lips that kissd him and the heart that broke  xxvii  nay but methinks thou shalt not quite forget    the curse wherewith i curse thee till i die the tears that on the woodnymphs cheeks are wet    shall burn thy hateful beauty deathlessly    nor shall god raise up seed to thee but i have borne thy love this messenger my son    who yet shall make him glad for time goes by and soon shall thine enchantments all be done  xxviii  ay soon twixt me and death must be his choice    and little in that hour will paris care for thy sweet lips and for thy singing voice    thine arms of ivory thy golden hair    nay me will he embrace and will not spare but bid the folk that hate thee have their joy    and give thee to the mountain beasts to tear or burn thy body on a tower of troy  xxix  even as she read by aphrodites will    the cloud rolld back from helens memory she saw the city of the rifted hill    fair lacedaemon neath her mountain high    she knew the swift eurotas running by to mix his sacred waters with the sea    and from the garden close she heard the cry of her beloved child hermione  xxx  then instantly the horror of her shame    fell on her and she saw the coming years famine and fire and plague and all mens blame    the wounds of warriors and the womens fears    and through her heart her sorrow smote like spears and in her soul she knew the utmost smart    of wives left lonely sires bereaved the tears of maidens desolate of loves that part  xxxi  she draind the dregs out of the cup of hate    the bitterness of sorrow shame and scorn whereer the tongues of mortals curse their fate    she saw herself an outcast and forlorn    and hating sore the day that she was born down in the dust she cast her golden head    there with rent raiment and fair tresses torn at feet of corythus she lay for dead  xxxii  but corythus beholding her sweet face    and her most lovely body lying low had pity on her grief and on her grace    nor heeded now she was his mothers foe    but did what might be done to ease her woe while as he thought with death for life she strove    and loosed the necklet round her neck of snow as who that saw had deemd with hands of love  xxxiii  and there was one that saw for paris woke    halfdeeming and halfdreaming that the van of the great argive host had scared the folk    and down the echoing corridor he ran    to helens bower and there beheld the man that kneeld beside his lady lying there    no word he spake but drove his sword a span through corythus fair neck and clusterd hair  xxxiv  then fell fair corythus as falls the tower    an earthquake shaketh from a citys crown or as a tall white fragrant lilyflower    a child hath in the garden trampled down    or as a pinetree in the forest brown felld by the searovers on mountain lands    when they to harry foreign folk are boune taking their own lives in their reckless hands  xxxv  but still in paris did his anger burn    and still his sword was lifted up to slay when like a lot leapd forth of fates own urn    he markd the graven tokens where they lay    mid helens hair in golden disarray and looking on them knew what he had done    knew what dire thing had fallen on that day knew how a fathers hand had slain a son  xxxvi  then paris on his face fell grovelling    and the night gatherd and the silence grew within the darkened chamber of the king    but helen rose and a sad breath she drew    and her new woes came back to her anew ah where is he but knows the bitter pain    to wake from dreams and find his sorrow true and his ill life returned to him again  xxxvii  she needed none to tell her whence it fell    the thick red rain upon the marble floor she knew that in her bower she might not dwell    alone with her own heart for ever more    no sacrifice no spell no priestly lore could banish quite the melancholy ghost    of corythus a herald sent before them that should die for her a dreadful host  xxxviii  but slowly paris raised him from the earth    and read her face and knew that she knew all no more her eyes in tenderness or mirth    should answer his in bower or in hall    nay love had fallen when his child did fall the stream love cannot cross ran twixt them red    no more was helen his whateer befall not though the goddess drove her to his bed  xxxix  this word he spake the fates are hard on us    then bade the women do what must be done to the fair body of dead corythus    and then he hurld into the night alone    wailing unto the spirit of his son that somewhere in dark mist and sighing wind    must dwell nor yet to hades had it won nor quite had left the world of men behind  xl  but wild oenone by the mountainpath    saw not her son returning to the wold and now was she in fear and now in wrath    she cried he hath forgot the mountain fold    and goes in ilios with a crown of gold but even then she heard mens axes smite    against the beeches slim and ashtrees old these ancient trees wherein she did delight  xli  then she arose and silently as sleep    unseen she followd the slowrolling wain beneath an ashen sky that gan to weep    too heavy laden with the latter rain    and all the folk of troy upon the plain she found all gatherd round a funeral pyre    and thereon lay her son her darling slain the goodly corythus her hearts desire  xlii  among the spices and fair robes he lay    his arm beneath his head as though he slept for so the goddess wrought that no decay    no loathly thing about his body crept    and all the people lookd on him and wept and weeping paris lit the pinewood dry    and lo a rainy wind arose and swept the flame and fragrance far into the sky  xliii  but when the force of flame was burning low    then did they drench the pyre with ruddy wine and the white bones of corythus bestow    within a gold cruse wrought with many a sign    and wrappd the cruse about with linen fine and bare it to the tomb when lo the wild    oenone sprang with burning eyes divine and shriekd unto the slayer of her child  xliv  oh thou that like a god art sire and slayer    that like a god dost give and take away methinks that even now i hear the prayer    thou shalt beseech me with some later day    when all the world to thy dim eyes grow grey and thou shalt crave thy healing at my hand    then gladly will i mock and say thee nay and watch thine hours run down like running sand  xlv  yea thou shalt die and leave thy love behind    and little shall she love thy memory but oh ye foolish people deaf and blind    what death is coming on you from the sea    then all men turned and lo upon the lee of tenedos beneath the driving rain    the countless argive ships were racing free the wind and oarsmen speeding them amain  xlvi  then from the barrow and the burial    back like a bursting torrent all men fled back to the city and the sacred wall    but paris stood and lifted not his head    alone he stood and brooded oer the dead as broods a lion when a shaft hath flown    and through the strong heart of his mate hath sped then will he face the hunters all alone  xlvii  but soon the voice of men on the seasand    came round him and he turned and gazed and lo the argive ships were dashing on the strand    then stealthily did paris bend his bow    and on the string he laid a shaft of woe and drew it to the point and aimd it well    singing it sped and through a shield did go and from his barque protesilaus fell  xlviii  half gladdened by the omen through the plain    went paris to the walls and mighty gate and little heeded he that arrowy rain    the argive bowmen showerd in helpless hate    nay not yet featherd was the shaft of fate his bane the gift of mighty heracles    to philoctetes lying desolate within a far off island of the seas     book vthe war   the war round troy and how many brave men fell and chiefly sarpedon patroclus hector memnon and achilles  the coming of the amazon and the wounding of paris and his death and concerning the good end that oenone made  i  for ten long years the argive leaguer lay    round priams folk and wrought them many woes while as a lion crouchd above his prey    the trojans yet made head against their foes    and as the swift seawater ebbs and flows between the straits of helle and the main    even so the tide of battle sank and rose and filld with waifs of war the ilian plain  ii  and horse on horse was driven as wave on wave    like rain upon the deep the arrows fell and like the wind the warcry of the brave    rang out above the battles ebb and swell    and long the tale of slain and sad to tell yet seemd the end scarce nearer than of yore    when nine years passd and still the citadel frownd on the argive huts beside the shore  iii  and still the watchers on the citys crown    afar from sacred ilios might spy the flame from many a fallen subject town    flare on the starry verges of the sky    and still from rich maeonia came the cry of cities sackd whereer achilles led    yet none the more men deemd the end was nigh while knightly hector fought unvanquished  iv  but ever as each dawn bore grief afar    and further back waxd paris glad and gay and on the fringes of the cloud of war    his arrows like the lightning still would play    yet fled he menelaus on a day and there had died but aphrodites power    him in a golden cloud did safe convey within the walls of helens fragrant bower  v  but she in longing for her lord and home    and scorn of her wild lover did withdraw from all mens eyes but in the night would roam    till drowsy watchmen of the city saw    a shadowy shape that chilld the night with awe treading the battlements and like a ghost    she stretchd her lovely arms without a flaw in shame and longing to the argive host  vi  but all day long within her bower she wept    still dreaming of the dames renownd of old whom hate or love of the immortals swept    within the toils of ate manifold    and most she loved the ancient tales that told how the great gods at length to pity stirrd    changed niobe upon the mountains cold to a cold stone and procne to a bird  vii  and myrrha to an incensebreathing tree    and ah she murmurd that the gods were kind and bade the harpies lay their hands on me    and bear me with the currents of the wind    to the dim end of all things and the blind land where the ocean turneth in his bed    then should i leave mine evil days behind and sleep should fold his wings above my head  viii  and once she heard a trojan woman bless    the fairhaired menelaus her good lord as brave among brave men not merciless    not swift to slay the captives of his sword    nor wont was he to win the gold abhorrd of them that sell their captives over sea    and helen sighed and blessd her for that word yet will he neer be merciful to me  ix  in no wise found she comfort to abide    in ilios was to dwell with shame and fear and if unto the argive host she hied    then should she die by him that was most dear    and still the days draggd on with bitter cheer till even the great gods had little joy    so fast their children fell beneath the spear below the windy battlements of troy  x  yet many a prince of south lands or of east    for dark cassandras love came trooping in and priam made them merry at the feast    and all night long they dreamd of wars to win    and with the morning hurld into the din and cried their ladys name for battlecry    and won no more than this for paris sin by diomedes or aias hand to die  xi  but for one hour within the night of woes    the hope of troy burnd steadfast as a star when strife among the argive lords arose    and dread achilles held him from the war    yea and apollo from his golden car and silver bow his shafts of evil sped    and all the plain was darkend near and far with smoke above the pyres of heroes dead  xii  and many a time through vapour of that smoke    the shafts of troy fell fast and on the plain all night the trojan watch fires burnd and broke    like evil stars athwart a mist of rain    and through the arms and blood and through the slain like wolves among the fragments of the fight    crept spies to slay whoeer forgat his pain one hour and fell on slumber in the night  xiii  and once when wounded chiefs their tents did keep    and only aias might his weapons wield came hector with his host and smiting deep    brake bow and spear brake axe and glaive and shield    bulwark and battlement must rend and yield and by the ships he smote the foe and cast    fire on the ships and oer the stricken field the trojans saw that flame arise at last  xiv  but when achilles saw the soaring flame    and knew the ships in peril suddenly a change upon his wrathful spirit came    nor willd he that the danaans should die    but calld his myrmidons and with a cry they followd where like foam on a seawave    patroclus crest was dancing white and high above the tide that back the trojans drave  xv  but like a rock amid the shifting sands    and changing springs and tumult of the deep sarpedon stood till neath patroclus hands    smitten he fell then death and gentle sleep    bare him from forth the battle to the steep where shines his castle oer the lycian dell    there hath he burial due while all folk weep around the kindly prince that loved them well  xvi  not unavenged he fell nor all alone    to hades did his soul indignant fly for soon was keen patroclus overthrown    by hector and the god of archery    and hector strippd his shining panoply bright arms achilles lent ah naked then    forgetful wholly of his chivalry patroclus lay nor heard the strife of men  xvii  then hector from the war a little space    withdrew and clad him in achilles gear and braced the gleaming helmet on his face    and donnd the corslet and that mighty spear    he graspedthe lance that makes the boldest fear and home his comrades bare his arms of gold    those priam once had worn his father dear but in his fathers arms he waxed not old  xviii  then round patroclus body like a tide    that storms the swollen outlet of a stream when the winds blow and the rains fall and wide    the river runs and white the breakers gleam    trojans and argives battled till the beam of helios was sinking to the wave    and now they neard the ships yet few could deem that arms of argos might the body save  xix  but even then the tidings sore were borne    to great achilles of patroclus dead and all his goodly raiment hath he torn    and cast the dust upon his golden head    and many a tear and bitter did he shed ay there by his own sword had he been slain    but swift his goddessmother thetis sped forth with her lovely seanymphs from the main  xx  for as a mother when her young child calls    hearkens to that and hath no other care so thetis from her green and windless halls    rose at the first word of achilles prayer    to comfort him and promise gifts of fair new armour wrought by an immortal hand    then like a silver cloud she scaled the air where bright the dwellings of olympus stand  xxi  but as a beacon from a leaguerd town    within a seagirt isle leaps suddenly a cloud by day but when the sun goes down    the tongues of fire flash out and soar on high    to summon warlike men that dwell thereby and bid them bring a rescue overseas    so now athene sent a flame to fly from brow and temples of aeacides  xxii  then all unarmd he sped and through the throng    he passd to the dykes edge beyond the wall nor leapd the ranks of fighting men among    but shouted clearer than the clarions call    when foes on a beleaguerd city fall three times he cried and terror fell on these    that heard him and the trojans one and all fled from that shouting of aeacides  xxiii  backward the trojans reeld in headlong flight    chariots and men and left their bravest slain and the sun fell but troy through all the night    watchd by her fires upon the ilian plain    for hector did the sacred walls disdain of ilios nor knew that he should stand    ere night returnd and burial crave in vain unarmd forsaken at achilles hand  xxiv  but all that night within his chamber high    hephaestus made his iron anvils ring and ere the dawn had wrought a panoply    the goodliest ever worn by mortal king    this to the argive camp did thetis bring and when her child had proved it like the star    that heralds day he went forth summoning the host achaean to delight of war  xxv  and as a mountain torrent leaves its bed    and seaward sweeps the toils of men in spate or as a forestfire that overhead    burns in the boughs a thing insatiate    so raged the fierce achilles in his hate and xanthus angry for his trojans slain    brake forth while fire and wind made desolate what war and wave had spared upon the plain  xxvi  now through the fume and vapour of the smoke    between the winds voice and the waters cry the battle shouting of the trojans broke    and reached the ilian walls confusedly    but over soon the folk that watchd might spy thin broken bands that fled avoiding death    yet many a man beneath the spear must die ere by the sacred gateway they drew breath  xxvii  and as when fire doth on a forest fall    and hot winds bear it raging in its flight and beechen boughs and pines are ruind all    so raged achilles anger in that fight    and many an empty car with none to smite the maddend horses oer the bridge of war    was wildly whirled and many a maids delight that day to the red wolves was dearer far        xxviii  some muse that loved not troy hath done thee wrong    homer who whisperd thee that hector fled thrice round the sacred walls he kept so long    nay when he saw his people vanquished    alone he stood for troy alone he sped one moment to the struggle of the spear    and by the gods deserted fell and bled a warrior stainless of reproach and fear  xxix  then all the people from the battlement    beheld what dreadful things achilles wrought for on the body his revenge he spent    the anger of the high gods heeding nought    to whom was hector dearest while he fought of all the trojan men that were their joy    but now no more their favour might be bought by savour of his hecatombs in troy  xxx  so for twelve days rejoiced the argive host    and now patroclus hath to hades won but hector naked lay and still his ghost    must wail where waters of cocytus run    till priam did what no man born hath done who dared to pass among the argive bands    and claspd the knees of him that slew his son and kissd his awful homicidal hands  xxxi  at such a price was hectors body sent    to ilios where the women waild him shrill and helens sorrow brake into lament    as bursts a lake the barriers of a hill    for lost lost lost was that one friend who still stood by her with kind speech and gentle heart    the sword of war pure faith and steadfast will that strove to keep all evil things apart        xxxii  and so men buried hector  but they came    the amazons from frozen fields afar a match for heroes in the dreadful game    of spears the darlings of the god of war    whose coming was to priam dearer far than light to him that is a long while blind    when leechs hand hath taen away the bar that vexd him or the healing god is kind  xxxiii  and troy was glad and with the morning light    the amazons went forth to slay and slay and wondrously they drave the foe in flight    until the sun had wanderd half his way    but when he stoopd to twilight and the grey hour when men loose the steer beneath the yoke    no more achilles held him from the fray but dreadful through the womens ranks he broke  xxxiv  then comes eclipse upon the crescent shield    and death on them that bear it and they fall one here one there about the stricken field    as in that art of love memorial    which moulders on the holy carian wall ay still we see still love still pity there    the warriormaids so brave so godlike tall in times despite imperishably fair  xxxv  but as a dove that braves a falcon stood    penthesilea wrath outcasting fear or as a hind that in the darkling wood    withstands a lion for her younglings dear    so stood the girl before achilles spear in vain for singing from his hand it sped    and crashd through shield and breastplate till the sheer cold bronze drank blood and down the queen fell dead  xxxvi  then from her locks the helm achilles tore    and boasted oer the slain but lo the face of her thus lying in the dust and gore    seemd lovelier than is the maiden grace    of artemis when weary from the chase she sleepeth in a haunted dell unknown    and all the argives marvelld for a space but most achilles made a heavy moan  xxxvii  and in his heart there came the weary thought    of all that was and all that might have been of all the sorrow that his sword had wrought    of death that now drew near him of the green    vales of larissa where with such a queen with such a love as now his spear had slain    he had been happy who must wind the skein of grievous wars and neer be glad again  xxxviii  yea now waxd fate half weary of her game    and had no care but aye to kill and kill and many young kings to the battle came    and of that joy they quickly had their fill    and last came memnon and the trojans still took heart like wearied mariners that see    long tossd on unknown waves at the winds will through clouds the gleaming crest of helike  xxxix  for memnon was the child of the bright dawn    a goddess wedded to a mortal king who dwells for ever on the shores withdrawn    that border on the land of sunrising    and he was nurtured nigh the sacred spring that is the hidden fountain of all seas    by them that in the gods own garden sing the lilymaidens calld hesperides  xl  but him the child of thetis in the fight    met on a windy winter day when high the dust was whirled and wrappd them like the night    that falleth on the mountains stealthily    when the floods come and down their courses dry the torrents roar and lightning flasheth far    so rang so shone their harness terribly beneath the blinding thundercloud of war  xli  then the dawn shudderd on her golden throne    and called unto the west wind and he blew and brake the cloud asunder and alone    achilles stood but memnon smitten through    lay beautiful amid the dreadful dew of battle and a deathless heart was fain    of tears to gods impossible that drew from mortal hearts a little of their pain  xlii  but now their leader slain the trojans fled    and fierce achilles drove them in his hate avenging still his dear patroclus dead    nor knew the hour with his own doom was great    nor trembled standing in the scaean gate where ancient prophecy foretold his fall    then suddenly there sped the bolt of fate and smote achilles by the ilian wall  xliii  from paris bow it sped and even there    even as he graspd the skirts of victory achilles fell nor any man might dare    from forth the trojan gateway to draw nigh    but as the woodmen watch a lion die pierced with the hunters arrow nor come near    till death hath veild his eyelids utterly even so the trojans held aloof in fear  xliv  but there his fellows on his wondrous shield    laid the fair body of achilles slain and sadly bare him through the trampled field    and lo the deathless maidens of the main    rose up with thetis from the windy plain and round the dead man beautiful they cried    lamenting and with melancholy strain the sweetvoiced muses mournfully replied  xlv  yea muses and seamaidens sang his dirge    and mightily the chant arose and shrill and wondrous echoes answerd from the surge    of the grey sea and from the holy hill    of ida and the heavy clouds and chill were gathering like mourners sad and slow    and zeus did thunder mightily and fill the dells and glades of ida deep with snow  xlvi  now paris was not sated with the fame    and rich reward troy gave his archery but oer the wine he boasted that the game    that very night he deemd to win or die    for scarce their watch the tempest will defy he said and all undreamd of might we go    and fall upon the argives where they lie unseen unheard amid the silent snow  xlvii  so flushd with wine and clad in raiment white    above their mail the young men followd him their guide a fading campfire in the night    and the seas moaning in the distance dim    and still with eddying snow the air did swim and darkly did they wend they knew not where    white in that cursed night an army grim wilderd with wine and blind with whirling air  xlviii  there was an outcast in the argive host    one philoctetes whom odysseus wile for save he helpd the leaguer all was lost    drew from his lair within the lemnian isle    but him the people as a leper vile hated and drave to a lone hut afar    for wounded sore was he and many a while his cries would wake the host foredone with war  xlix  now philoctetes was an archer wight    but in his quiver had he little store of arrows tippd with bronze and featherd bright    nay his were blue with mould and fretted oer    with many a spell melampus wrought of yore singing above his task a song of bane    and they were venomd with the centaurs gore and tippd with bones of men a long while slain  l  this wretch for very pain might seldom sleep    and that night slept not in the moaning blast he deemd the dead about his hut did creep    and silently he rose and round him cast    his raiment foul and from the door he passd and peerd into the night and soothly heard    a whisperd voice then grippd his arrows fast and strung his bow and cried a bitter word  li  art thou a gibbering ghost with war outworn    and thy faint life in hades not begun art thou a man that holdst my grief in scorn    and yet dost live and look upon the sun    if manmethinks thy pleasant days are done and thou shalt writhe in torment worse than mine    if ghostnew pain in hades hast thou won and there with double woe shalt surely pine  lii  he spake and drew the string and sent a shaft    at venture through the midnight and the snow a little while he listend then he laughd    within himself a dreadful laugh and low    for over well the answer did he know that midnight gave his message the sharp cry    and armour rattling on a fallen foe that now was learning what it is to die  liii  then philoctetes crawld into his den    and huggd himself against the bitter cold while round their leader came the trojan men    and bound his wound and bare him oer the wold    back to the lights of ilios but the gold of dawn was breaking on the mountains white    or ere they won within the guarded fold long wilderd in the tempest and the night  liv  and through the gate and through the silent street    and houses where men dreamd of war no more the bearers wanderd with their weary feet    and paris to his highroofd house they bore    but vainly leeches on his wound did pore and vain was argive helens magic song    ah vain her healing hands and all her lore to help the life that wrought her endless wrong  lv  slow passd the feverd hours until the grey    cold light was paling and a sullen glow of livid yellow crownd the dying day    and brooded on the wastes of mournful snow    then paris whisperd faintly i must go and face that wild woodmaiden of the hill    for none but she can win from overthrow troys life and mine that guards it if she will  lvi  so through the dumb white meadows deep with snow    they bore him on a pallet shrouded white and sore they dreaded lest an ambushd foe    should hear him moan or mark the moving light    that waved before their footsteps in the night and much they joyd when idas knees were won    and neath the pines upon an upland height they watchd the star that heraldeth the sun  lvii  for under woven branches of the pine    the soft dry needles like a carpet spread and high above the arching boughs did shine    in frosty fret of silver that the red    new dawn fired into goldwork overhead within that vale where paris oft had been    with fair oenone ere the hills he fled to be the sinful lover of a queen  lviii  not here they found oenone nay not here    said paris faint and low shall she be found nay bear me up the mountain where the drear    winds walk for ever on a haunted ground    methinks i hear her sighing in their sound or some god calls me there a dying man    perchance my latest journeying is bound back where the sorrow of my life began  lix  they reachd the gateway of that highest glen    and halted wondring what the end should be but paris whisperd helen while his men    fell back here judged i gods here shalt thou see    what judgment mine old love will pass on me but hide thee here thou soon the end shalt know    whether the gods at length will set thee free from that old net they wove so long ago  lx  ah there with wide snows round her like a pall    oenone crouchd in sable robes as still as winter brooding oer the summers fall    or niobe upon her haunted hill    a woman changed to stone by grief where chill the raindrops fall like tears and the wind sighs    and paris deemd he saw a deadly will unmoved in wild oenones frozen eyes  lxi  nay prayer to her were vain as prayer to fate    he murmurd almost glad that it was so like some sick man that need no longer wait    but his pain lulls as death draws near his woe    and paris beckond to his men and slow they bore him dying from that fatal place    and did not turn again and did not know the soft repentance on oenones face  lxii  but paris spake to helen long ago    dear we were glad who never more shall be together where the west winds fainter blow    round that elysian island of the sea    where zeus from evil days shall set thee free nay kiss me once it is a weary while    ten weary years since thou hast smiled on me but helen say goodbye with thine old smile  lxiii  and as the dying sunset through the rain    will flush with rosy glow a mountain height even so at his last smile a blush again    passd over helens face so changed and white    and through her tears she smiled his last delight the last of pleasant life he knew for grey    the veil of darkness gatherd and the night closed oer his head and paris passd away  lxiv  then for one hour in helens heart reborn    awoke the fatal love that was of old ere she knew all and the cold cheeks outworn    she kissd she kissd the hair of wasted gold    the hands that neer her body should enfold then slow she followd where the bearers led    followd dead paris through the frozen wold back to the town where all men wishd her dead  lxv  perchance it was a sin i know not this    howeer it be she had a womans heart and not without a tear without a kiss    without some strange new birth of the old smart    from her old love of the brief days could part for ever though the dead meet neer shall they    meet and be glad by aphrodites art whose souls have wanderd each its several way        lxvi  and now was come the day when on a pyre    men laid fair paris in a broiderd pall and fragrant spices cast into the fire    and round the flame slew many an argive thrall    when like a ghost there came among them all a woman once beheld by them of yore    when first through storm and driving rain the tall black ships of argos dashd upon the shore  lxvii  not now in wrath oenone came but fair    like a young bride when nigh her bliss she knows and in the soft night of her fallen hair    shone flowers like stars more white than idas snows    and scarce men dared to look on her of those the pyre that guarded suddenly she came    and sprang upon the pyre and shrill arose her song of death like incense through the flame  lxviii  and still the song and still the flame went up    but when the flame waxd fierce the singing died and soon with red wine from a golden cup    priests drenchd the pyre but no man might divide    the ashes of the bridegroom from the bride nay they were wedded and at rest again    as in those old days on the mountainside before the promise of their youth was vain     book vithe sack of troy  the return of helen   the sack of troy and of how menelaus would have let stone helen but aphrodite saved her and made them at one again and how they came home to lacedaemon and of their translation to elysium  i  there came a day when trojan spies beheld    how oer the argive leaguer all the air was pure of smoke no battledin there swelld    nor any clarioncall was sounding there    yea of the serried ships the strand was bare and sea and shore were still as long ago    when ilios knew not helen and the fair sweet face that makes immortal all her woe  ii  so for a space the watchers on the wall    were silent wondring what these things might mean but at the last sent messengers to call    priam and all the elders and the lean    remnant of goodly chiefs that once had been the shield and stay of ilios and her joy    nor yet despaird but trusted gods unseen and cast their spears and shed their blood for troy  iii  they came the more part grey grown early old    in war and plague but with them was the young coroebus that but late had left the fold    and flocks of sheep maeonian hills among    and valiantly his lot with priam flung for love of a lost cause and a fair face    the eyes that once the god of pytho sung that now lookd darkly to the slaughterplace  iv  now while the elders kept their long debate    coroebus stole unheeded to his band and led a handful by a postern gate    across the plain across the barren land    where once the happy vines were wont to stand and mid the clusters once did maidens sing    but now the plain was waste on every hand though here and there a flower would breathe of spring  v  so swift across the trampled battlefield    unchallenged still but wary did they pass by many a broken spear or shatterd shield    that in fates hour appointed faithless was    only the heron cried from the morass by xanthus side and ravens and the grey    wolves left their feasting in the tangled grass grudging and loiterd nor fled far away  vi  there lurkd no spears in the high riverbanks    no ambush by the cairns of men outworn but empty stood the huts in dismal ranks    where men through all these many years had borne    fierce summer and the biting winters scorn and here a sword was left and there a bow    but ruinous seemd all things and forlorn as in some camp forsaken long ago  vii  gorged wolves crept round the altars and did eat    the flesh of victims that the priests had slain and wild dogs fought above the sacred meat    late offerd to the deathless gods in vain    by men that for reward of all their pain must haul the ropes and weary at the oar    or drowning clutch at foam amid the main nor win their haven on the argive shore  viii  not long the young men marvelld at the sight    but grasping one a sword and one the spear aias or tydeus son had borne in fight    they sped and filld the town with merry cheer    for folk were quick the happy news to hear and pourd through all the gates into the plain    rejoicing as they wanderd far and near oer the long argive toils endured in vain  ix  ah sweet it was without the city walls    to hear the doves coo and the finches sing ah sweet to twine their trueloves coronals    of woven windflowers and each fragrant thing    that blossoms in the footsteps of the spring and sweet to lie forgetful of their grief    where violets trail by waters wandering and the wild figtree putteth forth his leaf  x  now while they wanderd as they would they found    a wondrous thing a marvel of mans skill that stood within a vale of hollow ground    and bulkd scarce smaller than the bitterhill    the common barrow that the dead men fill who died in the long leaguernot of earth    was this new portent but of tree and still the trojans stood and marvelld mid their mirth  xi  ay much they wonderd what this thing might be    shaped like a horse it was and many a stain there showd upon the mighty beams of tree    for some with fire were blackend some with rain    were dank and dark amid white planks of plane new cut among the trees that now were few    on wasted ida but men gazed in vain nor truth thereof for all their searching knew  xii  at length they deemd it was a sacred thing    vowd to poseidon monarch of the deep and that herewith the argives prayd the king    of wind and wave to lull the seas to sleep    so this they cried within the sacred keep of troy must rest memorial of the war    and sturdily they haled it up the steep and draggd the monster to their walls afar  xiii  all day they wrought and children crownd with flowers    laid light hands on the ropes old men would ply their feeble force so through the merry hours    they toild midst laughter and sweet minstrelsy    and late they drew the great horse to the high crest of the hill and wide the tall gates swang    but thrice for all their force it stood thereby unmoved and thrice like smitten armour rang  xiv  natheless they wrought their will then altar fires    the trojans built and did the gods implore to grant fulfilment of all glad desires    but from the cups the wine they might not pour    the flesh upon the spits did writhe and roar the smoke grew red as blood and many a limb    of victims leapd upon the temple floor trembling and groans amid the chapels dim  xv  rang low and from the fair gods images    and from their eyes droppd sweat and many a tear the walls with blood were dripping and on these    that sacrificed came horror and great fear    the holy laurels to apollo dear beside his temple faded suddenly    and wild wolves from the mountains drew anear and ravens through the temples seemd to fly  xvi  yet still the men of troy were glad at heart    and oer strange meat they revelld like folk fey though each would shudder if he glanced apart    for round their knees the mists were gatherd grey    like shrouds on men that hellward take their way but merrily withal they feasted thus    and laughd with crooked lips and oft would say some evilsounding word and ominous  xvii  and hecuba among her children spake    let each man choose the meat he liketh best for bread no more together shall we break    nay soon from all my labour must i rest    but eat ye well and drink the red wine lest ye blame my housewifery among men dead    and all they took her saying for a jest and sweetly did they laugh at that she said  xviii  then like a raven on the of night    the wild cassandra flitted far and near still crying gather gather for the fight    and brace the helmet on and grasp the spear    for lo the legions of the night are here so shriekd the dreadful prophetess divine    but all men mockd and were of merry cheer safe as the gods they deemd them oer their wine  xix  for now with minstrelsy the air was sweet    the soft spring air and thick with incense smoke and bands of happy dancers down the street    flew from the flowercrownd doors and wheeld and broke    and loving words the youths and maidens spoke for aphrodite did their hearts beguile    as when beneath grey cavern or green oak the shepherd men and maidens meet and smile  xx  no guard they set for truly to them all    did love and slumber seem exceeding good there was no watch by open gate nor wall    no sentinel by pallas image stood    but silence grew as in an autumn wood when tempests die and the vexd boughs have ease    and wind and sunlight fade and soft the mood of sacred twilight falls upon the trees  xxi  then the stars crossd the zenith and there came    on troy that hour when slumber is most deep but any man that watchd had seen a flame    spring from the tall crest of the trojan keep    while from the belly of the horse did leap men armd and to the gates went stealthily    while up the rocky way to ilios creep the argives new returnd across the sea  xxii  now when the silence broke and in that hour    when first the dawn of war was blazing red there came a light in helens fragrant bower    as on that evil night before she fled    from lacedaemon and her marriage bed and helen in great fear lay still and cold    for aphrodite stood above her head and spake in that sweet voice she knew of old  xxiii  beloved one that dost not love me wake    helen the night is over the dawn is near and safely shalt thou fare with me and take    thy way through fire and blood and have no fear    a little hour and ended is the drear tale of thy sorrow and thy wandering    nay long hast thou to live in happy cheer by fair eurotas with thy lord the king  xxiv  then helen rose and in a cloud of gold    unseen amid the vapour of the fire did aphrodite veil her fold on fold    and through the darkness thronged with faces dire    and oer mens bodies fallen in a mire of new spilt blood and wine the twain did go    where lust and hate were mingled in desire and dreams and death were blended in one woe  xxv  fire and the foe were masters now the sky    flared like the dawn of that last day of all when men for pity to the sea shall cry    and vainly on the mountain tops shall call    to fall and end the horror in their fall and through the vapour dreadful things saw they    the maidens leaping from the city wall the sleeping children murderd where they lay  xxvi  yea cries like those that make the hills of hell    ring and reecho sounded through the night the screams of burning horses and the yell    of young men leaping naked into fight    and shrill the women shriekd as in their flight shriek the wild cranes when overhead they spy    between the dusky cloudland and the bright blue air an eagle stooping from the sky  xxvii  and now the red glare of the burning shone    on deeds so dire the pure gods might not bear save ares only long to look thereon    but with a cloud they darkend all the air    and even then within the temple fair of chaste athene did cassandra cower    and cried aloud an unavailing prayer for aias was the master in that hour  xxviii  mans lust won what a gods love might not win    and heroes trembled and the temple floor shook when one cry went up into the din    and shamed the night to silence then the roar    of war and fire waxd great as heretofore till each roof fell and every palace gate    was shatterd and the kings blood shed nor more remaind to do for troy was desolate  xxix  then dawn drew near and changed to clouds of rose    the dreadful smoke that clung to idas head but ilios was ashes and the foes    had left the embers and the plunderd dead    and down the steep they drove the prey and sped back to the swift ships with a captive train    while menelaus slow with drooping head followd like one lamenting through the plain  xxx  where death might seem the surest by the gate    of priam where the spears raged and the tall towers on the foe were falling sought he fate    to look on helen once and then to fall    nor see with living eyes the end of all what time the host their vengeance should fulfil    and cast her from the cliff below the wall or burn her body on the windy hill  xxxi  but helen found he never where the flame    sprang to the roofs and helen neer he found where flockd the wretched women in their shame    the helpless altars of the gods around    nor lurkd she in deep chambers underground where the priests trembled oer their hidden gold    nor where the armed feet of foes resound in shrines to silence consecrate of old  xxxii  so wounded to his hut and wearily    came menelaus and he bowd his head beneath the lintel neither fair nor high    and lo  queen helen lay upon his bed    flushd like a child in sleep and rosyred and at his footstep did she wake and smile    and spake my lord how hath thy hunting sped methinks that i have slept a weary while  xxxiii  for aphrodite made the past unknown    to helen as of old when in the dew of that fair dawn the net was round her thrown    nay now no memory of troy brake through    the mist that veild from her sweet eyes and blue the dreadful days and deeds all overpast    and gladly did she greet her lord anew and gladly would her arms have round him cast  xxxiv  then leapd she up in terror for he stood    before her like a lion of the wild his rusted armour all bestaind with blood    his mighty hands with blood of men defiled    and strange was all she saw the spears the piled raw skins of slaughterd beasts with many a stain    and low he spake and bitterly he smiled the hunt is ended and the spoil is taen  xxxv  no more he spake for certainly he deemd    that aphrodite brought her to that place and that of her loved archer helen dreamd    of paris at that thought the mood of grace    died in him and he hated her fair face and bound her hard not slacking for her tears    then silently departed for a space to seek the ruthless counsel of his peers  xxxvi  now all the kings were feasting in much joy    seated or couchd upon the carpets fair that late had strown the palace floors of troy    and lovely trojan ladies served them there    and meat from off the spits young princes bare but menelaus burst among them all    strange mid their revelry and did not spare but bade the kings a sudden council call  xxxvii  to mar their feast the kings had little will    yet did they as he bade in grudging wise and heralds calld the host unto the hill    heapd of sharp stones where ancient ilus lies    and forth the people flockd as throngd as flies that buzz about the milkingpails in spring    when life awakens under april skies and birds from dawning into twilight sing  xxxviii  then helen through the camp was driven and thrust    till even the trojan women cried in glee ah where is she in whom thou putst thy trust    the queen of love and laughter where is she    behold the last gift that she giveth thee thou of the many loves to die alone    and round thy flesh for robes of price to be the cold closeclinging raiment of sharp stone  xxxix  ah slowly through that trodden field and bare    they passd where scarce the daffodil might spring for war had wasted all but in the air    high overhead the mounting lark did sing    then all the army gatherd in a ring round helen round their torment trappd at last    and many took up mighty stones to fling from shards and flints on ilus barrow cast  xl  then menelaus to the people spoke    and swift his wingd words came as whirling snow oh ye that overlong have borne the yoke    behold the very fountain of your woe    for her ye left your dear homes long ago on argive valley or boeotian plain    but now the black ships rot from stern to prow who knows if ye shall see your own again  xli  ay and if home ye win ye yet may find    ye that the winds waft and the waters bear to argos ye are quite gone out of mind    your fathers dear and old dishonourd there    your children deem you dead and will not share their lands with you on mainland or on isle    strange men are wooing now the women fair and love doth lightly womans heart beguile  xlii  these sorrows hath this woman wrought alone    so fall upon her straightway that she die and clothe her beauty in a cloak of stone    he spake and truly deemd to hear her cry    and see the sharp flints straight and deadly fly but each man stood and mused on helens face    and her undreamdof beauty brought so nigh on that bleak plain within that ruind place  lxiii  and as in far off days that were to be    the sense of their own sin did men constrain that they must leave the sinful woman free    who by their law had verily been slain    so helens beauty made their anger vain and one by one his gatherd flints let fall    and like men shamed they stole across the plain back to the swift ships and their festival  xliv  but menelaus lookd on her and said    hath no man then condemnd theeis there none to shed thy blood for all that thou hast shed    to wreak on thee the wrongs that thou hast done    nay as mine own soul liveth there is one that will not set thy barren beauty free    but slay thee to poseidon and the sun before a ship achaian takes the sea  xlv  therewith he drew his sharp sword from his thigh    as one intent to slay her but behold a sudden marvel shone across the sky    a cloud of rosy fire a flood of gold    and aphrodite came from forth the fold of wondrous mist and sudden at her feet    lotus and crocus on the trampled wold brake and the slender hyacinth was sweet  xlvi  then fell the point that never bloodless fell    when spear bit harness in the battle din for aphrodite spake and like a spell    wrought her sweet voice persuasive till within    his heart there lived no memory of sin no thirst for vengeance more but all grew plain    and wrath was molten in desire to win the golden heart of helen once again  xlvii  then aphrodite vanishd as the day    passes and leaves the darkling earth behind and overhead the april sky was grey    but helens arms about her lord were twined    and his round her as clingingly and kind as when sweet vines and ivy in the spring    join their glad leaves nor tempests may unbind the woven boughs so lovingly they cling        xlviii  noon long was overpast but sacred night    beheld them not upon the ilian shore nay for about the waning of the light    their swift ships wanderd on the waters hoar    nor stayd they the olympians to adore so eagerly they left that cursed land    but many a toil and tempests great and sore befell them ere they won the argive strand  xlix  to cyprus and phoenicia wandering    they came and many a ship and many a man they lost and perishd many a precious thing    while bare before the stormy north they ran    and further far than when their quest began from argos did they seema weary while    becalmd in sultry seas egyptian a long days voyage from the mouths of nile  l  but there the gods had pity on them and there    the ancient proteus taught them how to flee from that so distant deepthe fowls of air    scarce in one year can measure out that sea    yet first within aegyptus must they be and hecatombs must offerquickly then    the gods abated of their jealousy wherewith they scourge the negligence of men  li  and strong and fair the south wind blew and fleet    their voyaging so merrily they fled to win that haven where the waters sweet    of clear eurotas with the brine are wed    and swift their chariots and their horses sped to pleasant lacedaemon lying low    grey in the shade of sunset but the head of tall taygetus like fire did glow  lii  and what but this is sweet at last to win    the fields of home that change not while we change to hear the birds their ancient song begin    to wander by the wellloved streams that range    where not one pool one mossclad stone is strange nor seem we older than long years ago    though now beneath the grey roof of the grange the children dwell of them we used to know  liii  came there no trouble in the later days    to mar the life of helen when the old crowns and dominions perishd and the blaze    lit by returning heraclidae rolld    through every vale and every happy fold of all the argive land  nay peacefully    did menelaus and the queen behold the counted years of mortal life go by  liv  death ends all tales but this he endeth not    they grew not grey within the valley fair of hollow lacedaemon but were brought    to rhadamanthus of the golden hair    beyond the wide worlds end ah never there comes storm nor snow all grief is left behind    and men immortal in enchanted air breathe the cool current of the western wind  lv  but helen was a saint in heathendom    a kinder aphrodite without fear maidens and lovers to her shrine would come    in fair therapnae by the waters clear    of swift eurotas gently did she hear all prayers of love and not unheeded came    the broken supplication and the tear of man or maiden overweighd with shame   oer helens shrine the grass is growing green    in desolate therapnae none the less her sweet face now unworshippd and unseen    abides the symbol of all loveliness    of beauty ever stainless in the stress of warring lusts and fearsand still divine    still ready with immortal peace to bless them that with pure hearts worship at her shrine     note   in this story in rhyme of the fortunes of helen the theory that she was an unwilling victim of the gods has been preferred  many of the descriptions of manners are versified from the iliad and the odyssey  the description of the events after the death of hector and the account of the sack of troy is chiefly borrowed from quintus smyrnaeus  the character and history of helen of troy have been conceived of in very different ways by poets and mythologists  in attempting to trace the chief current of ancient traditions about helen we cannot really get further back than the homeric poems the iliad and odyssey  philological conjecture may assure us that helen like most of the characters of old romance is merely the dawn or light or some other bright being carried away by paris who represents night or winter or the cloud or some other power of darkness  without discussing these ideas it may be said that the greek poets at all events before allegorical explanations of mythology came in about five hundred years before christ regarded helen simply as a woman of wonderful beauty  homer was not thinking of the dawn or the cloud when he described helen among the elders on the ilian walls or repeated her lament over the dead body of hector  the homeric poems are our oldest literary documents about helen but it is probable enough that the poet has modified and purified more ancient traditions which still survive in various fragments of greek legend  in homer helen is always the daughter of zeus  isocrates tells us helena 211 b that while many of the demigods were children of zeus he thought the paternity of none of his daughters worth claiming save that of helen only  in homer then helen is the daughter of zeus but homer says nothing of the famous legend which makes zeus assume the form of a swan to woo the mother of helen  unhomeric as this myth is we may regard it as extremely ancient  very similar tales of pursuit and metamorphosis for amatory or other purposes among the old legends of wales and in the arabian nights as well as in the myths of australians and red indians  again the belief that different families of mankind descend from animals as from the swan or from gods in the shape of animals is found in every quarter of the world and among the rudest races  many australian natives of today claim descent like the royal house of sparta from the swan  the greek myths hesitated as to whether nemesis or leda was the bride of the swan  homer only mentions leda among the wives and daughters of mighty men whose ghosts odysseus beheld in hades and i saw leda the famous bedfellow of tyndareus who bare to tyndareus two sons hardy of heart castor tamer of steeds and the boxer polydeuces  these heroes helen in the iliad iii 238 describes as her mothers sons  thus if homer has any distinct view on the subject he holds that leda is the mother of helen by zeus of the dioscuri by tyndareus  greek ideas as to the character of helen varied with the various moods of greek literature  homers own ideas about his heroine are probably best expressed in the words with which priam greets her as she appears among the assembled elders who are watching the argive heroes from the wall of troyin nowise dear child do i blame thee nay the gods are to blame who have roused against me the woful war of the achaeans  homer like priam throws the guilt of helen on the gods but it is not very easy to understand exactly what he means by saying the gods are to blame  in the first place homer avoids the psychological problems in which modern poetry revels by attributing almost all changes of the moods of men to divine inspiration  thus when achilles in a famous passage of the first book of the iliad puts up his halfdrawn sword in the sheath and does not slay agamemnon homer assigns his repentance to the direct influence of athene  again he says in the odyssey about clytemnestra that she would none of the foul deed that is of the love of aegisthus till the doom of the gods bound her to her ruin  so far the same excuse is made for the murderous clytemnestra as for the amiable helen  again homer is in the strictest sense and in strong contrast to the greek tragedians and to virgil a chivalrous poet  it would probably be impossible to find a passage in which he speaks harshly or censoriously of the conduct of any fair and noble lady  the sordid treachery of eriphyle who sold her lord for gold wins for her the epithet hateful and achilles in a moment of strong grief applies a term of abhorrence to helen  but homer is too chivalrous to judge the life of any lady and only shows the other side of the chivalrous characterits cruelty to persons not of noble birthin describing the foul death of the waiting women of penelope  god forbid that i should take these womens lives by a clean death says telemachus odyssey xxii 462  so about all their necks nooses were cast that they might die by the death most pitiful  and they writhed with their feet for a little space but for no long while  in trying to understand homers estimate of helen therefore we must make allowance for his theory of divine intervention and for his chivalrous judgment of ladies  but there are two passages in the iliad which may be taken as indicating homers opinion that helen was literally a victim an unwilling victim of aphrodite and that she was carried away by force a captive from lacedaemon  these passages are in the iliad ii 356 590  in the former text nestor says let none be eager to return home ere he has couched with a trojans wife and avenged the longings and sorrows of helengreek text  it is thus that mr gladstone a notable champion of helens would render this passage and the same interpretation was favoured by the ancient separatists chorizontes who wished to prove that the iliad and odyssey were by different authors but many authorities prefer to translate to avenge our labours and sorrows for helens saketo avenge all that we have endured in the attempt to win back helen  thus the evidence of this passage is ambiguous  the fairer way to seek for homers real view of helen is to examine all the passages in which she occurs  the result will be something like thishomer sees in helen a being of the rarest personal charm and grace of character a woman who imputes to herself guilt much greater than the real measure of her offence  she is ever gentle except with the goddess who betrayed her and the unworthy lover whose lot she is compelled to share  against them her helpless anger breaks out in flashes of eloquent scorn  homer was apparently acquainted with the myth of helens capture by theseus a myth illustrated in the decorations of the coffer of cypselus  but we first see helen the cause of the war when menelaus and paris are about to fight their duel for her sake in the tenth year of the leaguer iliad iii 121  iris is sent to summon helen to the walls  she finds helen in her chamber weaving at a mighty loom and embroidering on tapestry the adventures of the siegethe battles of horsetaming trojans and bronzeclad achaeans  the message of iris renews in helens heart a sweet desire for her lord and her own city and them that begat her so draped in silvery white helen goes with her three maidens to the walls there above the gate like some king in the old testament paris sits among his counsellors and they are all amazed at helens beauty no marvel is it that trojans and achaeans suffer long and weary toils for such a woman so wondrous like to the immortal goddesses  then priam assuring helen that he holds her blameless bids her name to him her kinsfolk and the other achaean warriors  in her reply helen displays that grace of penitence which is certainly not often found in ancient literaturewould that evil death had been my choice when i followed thy son and left my bridal bower and my kin and my daughter dear and the maidens of like age with me  agamemnon she calls the husbands brother of me shameless alas that such an one should be  she names many of the warriors but misses her brothers castor and polydeuces own brothers of mine one mother bare us  either they followed not from pleasant lacedaemon or hither they followed in swift ships but now they have no heart to go down into the battle for dread of the shame and many reproaches that are mine  so spake she but already the lifegiving earth did cover them there in lacedaemon in their own dear country  menelaus and paris fought out their duel the trojan was discomfited but was rescued from death and carried to helens bower by aphrodite  then the goddess came in disguise to seek helen on the wall and force her back into the arms of her defeated lover  helen turned on the goddess with an abruptness and a force of sarcasm and invective which seem quite foreign to her gentle nature  wilt thou take me further yet to some city of phrygia or pleasant maeonia if there any man is dear to thee    nay go thyself and sit down by paris and forswear the paths of the gods but ever lament for him and cherish him till he make thee his wife yea or perchance his slave but to him will i never go  but this anger of helen is soon overcome by fear when the goddess in turn waxes wrathful and helen is literally driven by threatsfor the daughter of zeus was afraidinto the arms of paris  yet even so she taunts her lover with his cowardice a cowardice which she never really condones  in the sixth book of the iliad she has been urging him to return to the war she then expresses her penitence to hector would that the fury of the wind had borne me afar to the mountains or the wave of the roaring seaere ever these ill deeds were done  in this passage too she prophesies that her fortunes will be greek text famous in the songs good or evil of men unborn  in the last book of the iliad we meet helen once more as she laments over the dead body of hector  never in all the twenty years since i came hither have i heard from thee one taunt or one evil word nay but if any other rebuked me in the halls any one of my husbands brothers or of their sisters or their wives or the mother of my husband but the king was ever gentle to me as a father then wouldst thou restrain them with thy loving kindness and thy gentle speech  so spake she weeping  in the odyssey helen is once more in lacedaemon the honoured but still penitent wife of menelaus  how they became reconciled an extremely difficult point in the story there is nothing in homer to tell us  sir john lubbock has conjectured that in the morals of the heroic age helen was not really regarded as guilty  she was lawfully married by capture to paris  unfortunately for this theory there is abundant proof that in the heroic age wives were nominally bought for so many cattle or given as a reward for great services  there is no sign of marriage by capture and again marriage by capture is a savage institution which applies to unmarried women not to women already wedded as helen was to menelaus  perhaps the oldest evidence we have for opinion about the later relations of helen and menelaus is derived from pausaniass 174 ad description of the chest of cypselus  this ancient coffer a work of the seventh century bc was still preserved at olympia in the time of pausanias  on one of the bands of cedar or of ivory was represented pausanias v 18 menelaus with a sword in his hand rushing on to kill helenclearly at the sacking of ilios  how menelaus passed from a desire to kill helen to his absolute complacency in the odyssey homer does not tell us  according to a statement attributed to stesichorus 635 554 bc the army of the achaeans purposed to stone helen but was overawed and compelled to relent by her extraordinary beauty when they beheld her they cast down their stones on the ground  it may be conjectured that the reconciliation followed this futile attempt at punishing a daughter of zeus  homer then leaves us without information about the adventures of helen between the sack of tiny and the reconciliation with menelaus  he hints that she was married to deiphobus after the death of paris and alludes to the tradition that she mimicked the voices of the wives of the heroes and so nearly tempted them to leave their ambush in the wooden horse  but in the fourth book of the odyssey when telemachus visits lacedaemon he finds helen the honoured wife of menelaus rich in the marvellous gifts bestowed on her in her wanderings from troy by the princes of egypt  while yet he pondered these things in his mind and in his heart helen came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber like artemis of the golden arrows and with her came adraste and set for her the wellwrought chair and alcippe bare a rug of soft wool and phylo bare a silver basket which alcandre gave her the wife of polybus who dwelt in thebes of egypt where is the chiefest store of wealth in the houses  he gave two silver baths to menelaus and tripods twain and ten talents of gold  and besides all this his wife bestowed on helen lovely gifts a golden distaff did she give and a silver basket with wheels beneath and the rims thereof were finished with gold  this it was that the handmaid phylo bare and set beside her filled with dressed yarn and across it was laid a distaff charged with wool of violet blue  so helen sat her down in the chair and beneath was a footstool for the feet  when the host and guests begin to weep the ready tears of the heroic age over the sorrows of the past and dread of the dim future helen comforts them with a magical potion  then helen daughter of zeus turned to new thoughts  presently she cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank a drug to lull all pain and anger and bring forgetfulness of every sorrow  whoso should drink a draught thereof when it is mingled in the bowl on that day he would let no tear fall down his cheeks not though his mother and his father died not though men slew his brother or dear son with the sword before his face and his own eyes beheld it  medicines of such virtue and so helpful had the daughter of zeus which polydamna the wife of thon had given her a woman of egypt where earth the graingiver yields herbs in greatest plenty many that are healing in the cup and many baneful  so telemachus was kindly entertained by helen and menelaus and when he left them it was not without a gift  and helen stood by the coffers wherein were her robes of curious needlework which she herself had wrought  then helen the fair lady lifted one and brought it out the widest and most beautifully embroidered of all and it shone like a star and lay far beneath the rest  presently we read helen of the fair face came up with the robe in her hands and spake lo  i too give thee this gift dear child a memorial of the hands of helen for thy bride to wear upon the day of thy desire even of thy marriage  but meanwhile let it lie with thy mother in her chamber  and may joy go with thee to thy wellbuilded house and thine own country  helens last words in homer are words of good omen her prophecy to telemachus that odysseus shall return home after long wanderings and take vengeance on the rovers  we see helen no more but homer does not leave us in doubt as to her later fortunes  he quotes the prophecy which proteus the ancient one of the sea delivered to menelaus  but thou menelaus son of zeus art not ordained to die and meet thy fate in argos the pastureland of horses but the deathless gods will convey thee to the elysian plain and the worlds end where is rhadamanthus of the fair hair where life is easiest for men  no snow is there nor yet great storm nor any rain but alway ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill west to blow cool on men yea for thou hast helen to wife and thereby they deem thee to be son of zeus  we must believe with isocrates that helen was translated with her lord to that field of elysium where falls not hail or rain or any snow  this version of the end of helens history we have adopted but many other legends were known in greece  pausanias tells us that in a battle between the crotoniats and the locrians one leonymus charged the empty space in the locrian line which was entrusted to the care of the ghost of aias  leonymus was wounded by the invisible spear of the hero and could not be healed of the hurt  the delphian oracle bade him seek the isle of leuke in the euxine sea where aias would appear to him and heal him  when leonymus returned from leuke he told how achilles dwelt there with his ancient comrades and how he was now wedded to helen of troy  yet the local tradition of lacedaemon showed the sepulchre of helen in therapnae  according to a rhodian legend adopted by the author of the epic of hades helen was banished from sparta by the sons of menelaus came wandering to rhodes and was there strangled by the servants of the queen polyxo who thus avenged the death of her husband at troy  it is certain as we learn both from herodotus vi 61 and from isocrates that helen was worshipped in therapnae  in the days of ariston the king a deformed child was daily brought by her nurse to the shrine of helen  and it is said that as the nurse was leaving the shrine a woman appeared unto her and asked what she bore in her arms who said she bore a child  then the woman said show it to me which the nurse refused for the parents of the child had forbidden that she should be seen of any  but the woman straitly commanding that the child should be shown and the other beholding her eagerness at length the nurse showed the child and the woman caressed its face and said she shall be the fairest woman in sparta  and from that day the fashion of its countenance was changed and the child became the fairest of all the spartan women  it is a characteristic of greek literature that with the rise of democracy the old epic conception of the ancient heroes altered  we can scarcely recognize the odysseus of homer in the odysseus of sophocles the kings are regarded by the tragedians with some of the distrust and hatred which the unconstitutional tyrants of athens had aroused  just as the later chansons de geste of france the poems written in an age of feudal opposition to central authority degraded heroes like charles so rhetorical republican and sophistical greece put its quibbles into the lips of agamemnon and helen and slandered the stainless and fearless patroclus and achilles  the helen of euripides in the troades is a pettifogging sophist who pleads her cause to menelaus with rhetorical artifice  in the helena again euripides quite deserts the homeric traditions and adopts the late myths which denied that helen ever went to troy  she remained in egypt and achaeans and trojans fought for a mere shadow formed by the gods out of clouds and wind  in the cyclops of euripides a satirical drama the cynical giant is allowed to speak of helen in a strain of coarse banter  perhaps the essay of isocrates on helen may be regarded as a kind of answer to the attacks of several speakers in the works of the tragedians  isocrates defends helen simply on the plea of her beauty to heracles zeus gave strength to helen beauty which naturally rules over even strength itself  beauty he declares the gods themselves consider the noblest thing in the world as the goddesses showed when they contended for the prize of loveliness  and so marvellous says isocrates was the beauty of helen that for her glory zeus did not spare his beloved son sarpedon and thetis saw achilles die and the dawn bewailed her memnon  beauty has raised more mortals to immortality than all the other virtues together  and that helen is now a goddess isocrates proves by the fact that the sacrifices offered to her in therapnae are such as are given not to heroes but to immortal gods  when rome took up the legends of greece she did so in no chivalrous spirit  few poets are less chivalrous than virgil no hero has less of chivalry than his pious and tearful aeneas  in the second book of the aeneid the pious one finds helen hiding in the shrine of vesta and determines to slay the common curse of troy and of her own country there is no glory he admits in murdering a woman     extinxisse nefas tamen et sumpsisse merentis    laudabor poenas animumqne explesse juvabit    ultricis flammae et cineres satiasse meorum  but venus appears and rescues the unworthy lover of dido from the crowning infamy which he contemplates  hundreds of years later helen found a worthier poet in quintus smyrnaeus who in a late age sang the swansong of greek epic minstrelsy  it is thus that in the fourth century ad quintus describes helen as she is led with the captive women of ilios to the ships of the achaeansnow helen lamented not but shame dwelt in her dark eyes and reddened her lovely cheeks    while around her the people marvelled as they beheld the flawless grace and winsome beauty of the woman and none dared upbraid her with secret taunt or open rebuke  nay as she had been a goddess they beheld her gladly for dear and desired was she in their sight  and as when their own country appeareth to men long wandering on the sea and they being escaped from death and the deep gladly put forth their hands to greet their own native place even so all the danaans were glad at the sight of her and had no more memory of all their woful toil and the din of war such a spirit did cytherea put into their hearts out of favour to fair helen and father zeus  thus quintus makes amends for the trivial verses in which coluthus describes the flight of a frivolous helen with an effeminate paris  to follow the fortunes of helen through the middle ages would demand much space and considerable research  the poets who read dares phrygius believed with the scholar of dr faustus that helen of greece was the admirablest lady that ever lived  when english poetry first found the secret of perfect music her sweetest numbers were offered by marlowe at the shrine of helen  the speech of faustus is almost too hackneyed to be quoted and altogether too beautiful to be omitted     was this the face that launched a thousand ships    and burnt the topless towers of ilium    sweet helen make me immortal with a kiss    her lips suck forth my soul see where it flies    come helen come give me my soul again    here will i dwell for heaven is in those lips    and all is dross that is not helena              oh thou art fairer than the evening air    clad in the beauty of a thousand stars  the loves of faustus and helen are readily allegorized into the passion of the renaissance for classical beauty the passion to which all that is not beauty seemed very dross  this is the idea of the second part of faust in which helen once more became as she prophesied in the iliad a song in the mouths of later men  almost her latest apparition in english poetry is in the hellenics of landor  the sweetness of the character of helen the tragedy of the death of corythus by the hand of his father paris and the omnipotence of beauty and charm which triumph over the wrath of menelaus are the subjects of landors verse  but helen as a woman has hardly found a nobler praise in three thousand years than helen as a child has received from mr swinburne in atalanta in calydon  meleager is the speaker     even such for sailing hither i saw far hence    and where eurotas hollows his moist rock    nigh sparta with a strenuoushearted stream    even such i saw their sisters one swanwhite    the little helen and less fair than she    fair clytemnestra grave as pasturing fawns    who feed and fear some arrow but at whiles    as one smitten with love or wrung with joy    she laughs and lightens with her eyes and then    weeps whereat helen having laughed weeps too    and the other chides her and she being chid speaks naught    but cheeks and lips and eyelids kisses her    laughing so fare they as in their bloomless bud    and full of unblown life the blood of gods  there is all the irony of fate in althaeas reply     sweet days befall them and good loves and lords    tender and temperate honours of the hearths    peace and a perfect life and blameless bed
