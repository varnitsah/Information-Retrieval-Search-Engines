6316041	little novels  by wilkie collins     mrs zant and the ghost  i  the course of this narrative describes the return of a disembodied spirit to earth and leads the reader on new and strange ground  not in the obscurity of midnight but in the searching light of day did the supernatural influence assert itself neither revealed by a vision nor announced by a voice it reached mortal knowledge through the sense which is least easily selfdeceived the sense that feels  the record of this event will of necessity produce conflicting impressions it will raise in some minds the doubt which reason asserts it will invigorate in other minds the hope which faith justifies and it will leave the terrible question of the destinies of man where centuries of vain investigation have left itin the dark  having only undertaken in the present narrative to lead the way along a succession of events the writer declines to follow modern examples by thrusting himself and his opinions on the public view he returns to the shadow from which he has emerged and leaves the opposing forces of incredulity and belief to fight the old battle over again on the old ground  ii  the events happened soon after the first thirty years of the present century had come to an end  on a fine morning early in the month of april a gentleman of middle age named rayburn took his little daughter lucy out for a walk in the woodland pleasureground of western london called kensington gardens  the few friends whom he possessed reported of mr rayburn not unkindly that he was a reserved and solitary man he might have been more accurately described as a widower devoted to his only surviving child although he was not more than forty years of age the one pleasure which made life enjoyable to lucys father was offered by lucy herself  playing with her ball the child ran on to the southern limit of the gardens at that part of it which still remains nearest to the old palace of kensington observing close at hand one of those spacious covered seats called in england alcoves mr rayburn was reminded that he had the mornings newspaper in his pocket and that he might do well to rest and read at that early hour the place was a solitude  go on playing my dear he said but take care to keep where i can see you  lucy tossed up her ball and lucys father opened his newspaper he had not been reading for more than ten minutes when he felt a familiar little hand laid on his knee  tired of playing he inquiredwith his eyes still on the newspaper  im frightened papa  he looked up directly the childs pale face startled him he took her on his knee and kissed her  you oughtnt to be frightened lucy when i am with you he said gently what is it he looked out of the alcove as he spoke and saw a little dog among the trees is it the dog he asked  lucy answered  its not the dogits the lady  the lady was not visible from the alcove  has she said anything to you mr rayburn inquired  no  what has she done to frighten you  the child put her arms round her fathers neck  whisper papa she said im afraid of her hearing us i think shes mad  why do you think so lucy  she came near to me i thought she was going to say something she seemed to be ill  well and what then  she looked at me  there lucy found herself at a loss how to express what she had to say nextand took refuge in silence  nothing very wonderful so far her father suggested  yes papabut she didnt seem to see me when she looked  well and what happened then  the lady was frightenedand that frightened me i think the child repeated positively shes mad  it occurred to mr rayburn that the lady might be blind he rose at once to set the doubt at rest  wait here he said and ill come back to you  but lucy clung to him with both hands lucy declared that she was afraid to be by herself they left the alcove together  the new point of view at once revealed the stranger leaning against the trunk of a tree she was dressed in the deep mourning of a widow the pallor of her face the glassy stare in her eyes more than accounted for the childs terrorit excused the alarming conclusion at which she had arrived  go nearer to her lucy whispered  they advanced a few steps it was now easy to see that the lady was young and wasted by illnessbut arriving at a doubtful conclusion perhaps under the present circumstances apparently possessed of rare personal attractions in happier days as the father and daughter advanced a little she discovered them after some hesitation she left the tree approached with an evident intention of speaking and suddenly paused a change to astonishment and fear animated her vacant eyes if it had not been plain before it was now beyond all doubt that she was not a poor blind creature deserted and helpless at the same time the expression of her face was not easy to understand she could hardly have looked more amazed and bewildered if the two strangers who were observing her had suddenly vanished from the place in which they stood  mr rayburn spoke to her with the utmost kindness of voice and manner  i am afraid you are not well he said is there anything that i can do  the next words were suspended on his lips it was impossible to realize such a state of things but the strange impression that she had already produced on him was now confirmed if he could believe his senses her face did certainly tell him that he was invisible and inaudible to the woman whom he had just addressed she moved slowly away with a heavy sigh like a person disappointed and distressed following her with his eyes he saw the dog once morea little smoothcoated terrier of the ordinary english breed the dog showed none of the restless activity of his race with his head down and his tail depressed he crouched like a creature paralyzed by fear his mistress roused him by a call he followed her listlessly as she turned away  after walking a few paces only she suddenly stood still  mr rayburn heard her talking to herself  did i feel it again she said as if perplexed by some doubt that awed or grieved her after a while her arms rose slowly and opened with a gentle caressing actionan embrace strangely offered to the empty air no she said to herself sadly after waiting a moment more perhaps when tomorrow comesno more today she looked up at the clear blue sky the beautiful sunlight the merciful sunlight she murmured i should have died if it had happened in the dark  once more she called to the dog and once more she walked slowly away  is she going home papa the child asked  we will try and find out the father answered  he was by this time convinced that the poor creature was in no condition to be permitted to go out without some one to take care of her from motives of humanity he was resolved on making the attempt to communicate with her friends  iii  the lady left the gardens by the nearest gate stopping to lower her veil before she turned into the busy thoroughfare which leads to kensington advancing a little way along the high street she entered a house of respectable appearance with a card in one of the windows which announced that apartments were to let  mr rayburn waited a minutethen knocked at the door and asked if he could see the mistress of the house the servant showed him into a room on the ground floor neatly but scantily furnished one little white object varied the grim brown monotony of the empty table it was a visitingcard  with a childs unceremonious curiosity lucy pounced on the card and spelled the name letter by letter z a n t she repeated what does that mean  her father looked at the card as he took it away from her and put it back on the table the name was printed and the address was added in pencil mr john zant purleys hotel  the mistress made her appearance mr rayburn heartily wished himself out of the house again the moment he saw her the ways in which it is possible to cultivate the social virtues are more numerous and more varied than is generally supposed this ladys way had apparently accustomed her to meet her fellowcreatures on the hard ground of justice without mercy something in her eyes when she looked at lucy said i wonder whether that child gets punished when she deserves it  do you wish to see the rooms which i have to let she began  mr rayburn at once stated the object of his visitas clearly as civilly and as concisely as a man could do it he was conscious he added that he had been guilty perhaps of an act of intrusion  the manner of the mistress of the house showed that she entirely agreed with him he suggested however that his motive might excuse him the mistresss manner changed and asserted a difference of opinion  i only know the lady whom you mention she said as a person of the highest respectability in delicate health she has taken my firstfloor apartments with excellent references and she gives remarkably little trouble i have no claim to interfere with her proceedings and no reason to doubt that she is capable of taking care of herself  mr rayburn unwisely attempted to say a word in his own defense  allow me to remind you he began  of what sir  of what i observed when i happened to see the lady in kensington gardens  i am not responsible for what you observed in kensington gardens if your time is of any value pray dont let me detain you  dismissed in those terms mr rayburn took lucys hand and withdrew he had just reached the door when it was opened from the outer side the lady of kensington gardens stood before him in the position which he and his daughter now occupied their backs were toward the window would she remember having seen them for a moment in the gardens  excuse me for intruding on you she said to the landlady your servant tells me my brotherinlaw called while i was out he sometimes leaves a message on his card  she looked for the message and appeared to be disappointed there was no writing on the card  mr rayburn lingered a little in the doorway on the chance of hearing something more the landladys vigilant eyes discovered him  do you know this gentleman she said maliciously to her lodger  not that i remember  replying in those words the lady looked at mr rayburn for the first time and suddenly drew back from him  yes she said correcting herself i think we met  her embarrassment overpowered her she could say no more  mr rayburn compassionately finished the sentence for her  we met accidentally in kensington gardens he said  she seemed to be incapable of appreciating the kindness of his motive after hesitating a little she addressed a proposal to him which seemed to show distrust of the landlady  will you let me speak to you upstairs in my own rooms she asked  without waiting for a reply she led the way to the stairs mr rayburn and lucy followed they were just beginning the ascent to the first floor when the spiteful landlady left the lower room and called to her lodger over their heads take care what you say to this man mrs zant he thinks youre mad  mrs zant turned round on the landing and looked at him not a word fell from her lips she suffered she feared in silence something in the sad submission of her face touched the springs of innocent pity in lucys heart the child burst out crying  that artless expression of sympathy drew mrs zant down the few stairs which separated her from lucy  may i kiss your dear little girl she said to mr rayburn the landlady standing on the mat below expressed her opinion of the value of caresses as compared with a sounder method of treating young persons in tears if that child was mine she remarked i would give her something to cry for  in the meantime mrs zant led the way to her rooms  the first words she spoke showed that the landlady had succeeded but too well in prejudicing her against mr rayburn  will you let me ask your child she said to him why you think me mad  he met this strange request with a firm answer  you dont know yet what i really do think will you give me a minutes attention  no she said positively the child pities me i want to speak to the child what did you see me do in the gardens my dear that surprised you lucy turned uneasily to her father mrs zant persisted i first saw you by yourself and then i saw you with your father she went on when i came nearer to you did i look very oddlyas if i didnt see you at all  lucy hesitated again and mr rayburn interfered  you are confusing my little girl he said allow me to answer your questionsor excuse me if i leave you  there was something in his look or in his tone that mastered her she put her hand to her head  i dont think im fit for it she answered vacantly my courage has been sorely tried already if i can get a little rest and sleep you may find me a different person i am left a great deal by myself and i have reasons for trying to compose my mind can i see you tomorrow or write to you where do you live  mr rayburn laid his card on the table in silence she had strongly excited his interest he honestly desired to be of some service to this forlorn creatureabandoned so cruelly as it seemed to her own guidance but he had no authority to exercise no sort of claim to direct her actions even if she consented to accept his advice as a last resource he ventured on an allusion to the relative of whom she had spoken downstairs  when do you expect to see your brotherinlaw again he said  i dont know she answered i should like to see himhe is so kind to me  she turned aside to take leave of lucy  goodby my little friend if you live to grow up i hope you will never be such a miserable woman as i am she suddenly looked round at mr rayburn have you got a wife at home she asked  my wife is dead  and you have a child to comfort you please leave me you harden my heart oh sir dont you understand you make me envy you  mr rayburn was silent when he and his daughter were out in the street again lucy as became a dutiful child was silent too but there are limits to human enduranceand lucys capacity for selfcontrol gave way at last  are you thinking of the lady papa she said  he only answered by nodding his head his daughter had interrupted him at that critical moment in a mans reflections when he is on the point of making up his mind before they were at home again mr rayburn had arrived at a decision mrs zants brotherinlaw was evidently ignorant of any serious necessity for his interferenceor he would have made arrangements for immediately repeating his visit in this state of things if any evil happened to mrs zant silence on mr rayburns part might be indirectly to blame for a serious misfortune arriving at that conclusion he decided upon running the risk of being rudely received for the second time by another stranger  leaving lucy under the care of her governess he went at once to the address that had been written on the visitingcard left at the lodginghouse and sent in his name a courteous message was returned mr john zant was at home and would be happy to see him  iv  mr rayburn was shown into one of the private sittingrooms of the hotel  he observed that the customary position of the furniture in a room had been in some respects altered an armchair a sidetable and a footstool had all been removed to one of the windows and had been placed as close as possible to the light on the table lay a large open roll of morocco leather containing rows of elegant little instruments in steel and ivory waiting by the table stood mr john zant he said goodmorning in a bass voice so profound and so melodious that those two commonplace words assumed a new importance coming from his lips his personal appearance was in harmony with his magnificent voicehe was a tall finelymade man of dark complexion with big brilliant black eyes and a noble curling beard which hid the whole lower part of his face having bowed with a happy mingling of dignity and politeness the conventional side of this gentlemans character suddenly vanished and a crazy side to all appearance took its place he dropped on his knees in front of the footstool had he forgotten to say his prayers that morning and was he in such a hurry to remedy the fault that he had no time to spare for consulting appearances the doubt had hardly suggested itself before it was set at rest in a most unexpected manner mr zant looked at his visitor with a bland smile and said  please let me see your feet  for the moment mr rayburn lost his presence of mind he looked at the instruments on the sidetable  are you a corncutter was all he could say  excuse me sir returned the polite operator the term you use is quite obsolete in our profession he rose from his knees and added modestly i am a chiropodist  i beg your pardon  dont mention it you are not i imagine in want of my professional services to what motive may i attribute the honor of your visit  by this time mr rayburn had recovered himself  i have come here he answered under circumstances which require apology as well as explanation  mr zants highly polished manner betrayed signs of alarm his suspicions pointed to a formidable conclusiona conclusion that shook him to the innermost recesses of the pocket in which he kept his money  the numerous demands on me he began  mr rayburn smiled  make your mind easy he replied i dont want money my object is to speak with you on the subject of a lady who is a relation of yours  my sisterinlaw mr zant exclaimed pray take a seat  doubting if he had chosen a convenient time for his visit mr rayburn hesitated  am i likely to be in the way of persons who wish to consult you he asked  certainly not my morning hours of attendance on my clients are from eleven to one the clock on the mantelpiece struck the quarterpast one as he spoke i hope you dont bring me bad news he said very earnestly when i called on mrs zant this morning i heard that she had gone out for a walk is it indiscreet to ask how you became acquainted with her  mr rayburn at once mentioned what he had seen and heard in kensington gardens not forgetting to add a few words which described his interview afterward with mrs zant  the ladys brotherinlaw listened with an interest and sympathy which offered the strongest possible contrast to the unprovoked rudeness of the mistress of the lodginghouse he declared that he could only do justice to his sense of obligation by following mr rayburns example and expressing himself as frankly as if he had been speaking to an old friend  the sad story of my sisterinlaws life he said will i think explain certain things which must have naturally perplexed you my brother was introduced to her at the house of an australian gentleman on a visit to england she was then employed as governess to his daughters so sincere was the regard felt for her by the family that the parents had at the entreaty of their children asked her to accompany them when they returned to the colony the governess thankfully accepted the proposal  had she no relations in england mr rayburn asked  she was literally alone in the world sir when i tell you that she had been brought up in the foundling hospital you will understand what i mean oh there is no romance in my sisterinlaws story she never has known or will know who her parents were or why they deserted her the happiest moment in her life was the moment when she and my brother first met it was an instance on both sides of love at first sight though not a rich man my brother had earned a sufficient income in mercantile pursuits his character spoke for itself in a word he altered all the poor girls prospects as we then hoped and believed for the better her employers deferred their return to australia so that she might be married from their house after a happy life of a few weeks only  his voice failed him he paused and turned his face from the light  pardon me he said i am not able even yet to speak composedly of my brothers death let me only say that the poor young wife was a widow before the happy days of the honeymoon were over that dreadful calamity struck her down before my brother had been committed to the grave her life was in danger from brainfever  those words placed in a new light mr rayburns first fear that her intellect might be deranged looking at him attentively mr zant seemed to understand what was passing in the mind of his guest  no he said if the opinions of the medical men are to be trusted the result of the illness is injury to her physical strengthnot injury to her mind i have observed in her no doubt a certain waywardness of temper since her illness but that is a trifle as an example of what i mean i may tell you that i invited her on her recovery to pay me a visit my house is not in londonthe air doesnt agree with memy place of residence is at st sallinsonsea i am not myself a married man but my excellent housekeeper would have received mrs zant with the utmost kindness she was resolvedobstinately resolved poor thingto remain in london it is needless to say that in her melancholy position i am attentive to her slightest wishes i took a lodging for her and at her special request i chose a house which was near kensington gardens  is there any association with the gardens which led mrs zant to make that request  some association i believe with the memory of her husband by the way i wish to be sure of finding her at home when i call tomorrow did you say in the course of your interesting statement that she intendedas you supposedto return to kensington gardens tomorrow or has my memory deceived me  your memory is perfectly accurate  thank you i confess i am not only distressed by what you have told me of mrs zanti am at a loss to know how to act for the best my only idea at present is to try change of air and scene what do you think yourself  i think you are right  mr zant still hesitated  it would not be easy for me just now he said to leave my patients and take her abroad  the obvious reply to this occurred to mr rayburn a man of larger worldly experience might have felt certain suspicions and might have remained silent mr rayburn spoke  why not renew your invitation and take her to your house at the seaside he said  in the perplexed state of mr zants mind this plain course of action had apparently failed to present itself his gloomy face brightened directly  the very thing he said i will certainly take your advice if the air of st sallins does nothing else it will improve her health and help her to recover her good looks did she strike you as having been in happier days a pretty woman  this was a strangely familiar question to askalmost an indelicate question under the circumstances a certain furtive expression in mr zants fine dark eyes seemed to imply that it had been put with a purpose was it possible that he suspected mr rayburns interest in his sisterinlaw to be inspired by any motive which was not perfectly unselfish and perfectly pure to arrive at such a conclusion as this might be to judge hastily and cruelly of a man who was perhaps only guilty of a want of delicacy of feeling mr rayburn honestly did his best to assume the charitable point of view at the same time it is not to be denied that his words when he answered were carefully guarded and that he rose to take his leave  mr john zant hospitably protested  why are you in such a hurry must you really go i shall have the honor of returning your visit tomorrow when i have made arrangements to profit by that excellent suggestion of yours goodby god bless you  he held out his hand a hand with a smooth surface and a tawny color that fervently squeezed the fingers of a departing friend is that man a scoundrel was mr rayburns first thought after he had left the hotel his moral sense set all hesitation at restand answered youre a fool if you doubt it  v  disturbed by presentiments mr rayburn returned to his house on foot by way of trying what exercise would do toward composing his mind  the experiment failed he went upstairs and played with lucy he drank an extra glass of wine at dinner he took the child and her governess to a circus in the evening he ate a little supper fortified by another glass of wine before he went to bedand still those vague forebodings of evil persisted in torturing him looking back through his past life he asked himself if any woman his late wife of course excepted had ever taken the predominant place in his thoughts which mrs zant had assumedwithout any discernible reason to account for it if he had ventured to answer his own question the reply would have been never  all the next day he waited at home in expectation of mr john zants promised visit and waited in vain  toward evening the parlormaid appeared at the family teatable and presented to her master an unusually large envelope sealed with black wax and addressed in a strange handwriting the absence of stamp and postmark showed that it had been left at the house by a messenger  who brought this mr rayburn asked  a lady sirin deep mourning  did she leave any message  no sir  having drawn the inevitable conclusion mr rayburn shut himself up in his library he was afraid of lucys curiosity and lucys questions if he read mrs zants letter in his daughters presence  looking at the open envelope after he had taken out the leaves of writing which it contained he noticed these lines traced inside the cover    my one excuse for troubling you when i might have consulted my brotherinlaw will be found in the pages which i inclose to speak plainly you have been led to fear that i am not in my right senses for this very reason i now appeal to you your dreadful doubt of me sir is my doubt too read what i have written about myselfand then tell me i entreat you which i am a person who has been the object of a supernatural revelation or an unfortunate creature who is only fit for imprisonment in a madhouse    mr rayburn opened the manuscript with steady attention which soon quickened to breathless interest he read what follows  vi  the ladys manuscript  yesterday morning the sun shone in a clear blue skyafter a succession of cloudy days counting from the first of the month  the radiant light had its animating effect on my poor spirits i had passed the night more peacefully than usual undisturbed by the dream so cruelly familiar to me that my lost husband is still livingthe dream from which i always wake in tears never since the dark days of my sorrow have i been so little troubled by the selftormenting fancies and fears which beset miserable women as when i left the house and turned my steps toward kensington gardensfor the first time since my husbands death  attended by my only companion the little dog who had been his favorite as well as mine i went to the quiet corner of the gardens which is nearest to kensington  on that soft grass under the shade of those grand trees we had loitered together in the days of our betrothal it was his favorite walk and he had taken me to see it in the early days of our acquaintance there he had first asked me to be his wife there we had felt the rapture of our first kiss it was surely natural that i should wish to see once more a place sacred to such memories as these i am only twentythree years old i have no child to comfort me no companion of my own age nothing to love but the dumb creature who is so faithfully fond of me  i went to the tree under which we stood when my dear ones eyes told his love before he could utter it in words the sun of that vanished day shone on me again it was the same noontide hour the same solitude was around me i had feared the first effect of the dreadful contrast between past and present no i was quiet and resigned my thoughts rising higher than earth dwelt on the better life beyond the grave some tears came into my eyes but i was not unhappy my memory of all that happened may be trusted even in trifles which relate only to myselfi was not unhappy  the first object that i saw when my eyes were clear again was the dog he crouched a few paces away from me trembling pitiably but uttering no cry what had caused the fear that overpowered him  i was soon to know  i called to the dog he remained immovableconscious of some mysterious coming thing that held him spellbound i tried to go to the poor creature and fondle and comfort him  at the first step forward that i took something stopped me  it was not to be seen and not to be heard it stopped me  the still figure of the dog disappeared from my view the lonely scene round me disappearedexcepting the light from heaven the tree that sheltered me and the grass in front of me a sense of unutterable expectation kept my eyes riveted on the grass suddenly i saw its myriad blades rise erect and shivering the fear came to me of something passing over them with the invisible swiftness of the wind the shivering advanced it was all round me it crept into the leaves of the tree over my head they shuddered without a sound to tell of their agitation their pleasant natural rustling was struck dumb the song of the birds had ceased the cries of the waterfowl on the pond were heard no more there was a dreadful silence  but the lovely sunshine poured down on me as brightly as ever  in that dazzling light in that fearful silence i felt an invisible presence near me it touched me gently  at the touch my heart throbbed with an overwhelming joy exquisite pleasure thrilled through every nerve in my body i knew him from the unseen worldhimself unseenhe had returned to me oh i knew him  and yet my helpless mortality longed for a sign that might give me assurance of the truth the yearning in me shaped itself into words i tried to utter the words i would have said if i could have spoken oh my angel give me a token that it is you but i was like a person struck dumbi could only think it  the invisible presence read my thought i felt my lips touched as my husbands lips used to touch them when he kissed me and that was my answer a thought came to me again i would have said if i could have spoken are you here to take me to the better world  i waited nothing that i could feel touched me  i was conscious of thinking once more i would have said if i could have spoken are you here to protect me  i felt myself held in a gentle embrace as my husbands arms used to hold me when he pressed me to his breast and that was my answer  the touch that was like the touch of his lips lingered and was lost the clasp that was like the clasp of his arms pressed me and fell away the gardenscene resumed its natural aspect i saw a human creature near a lovely little girl looking at me  at that moment when i was my own lonely self again the sight of the child soothed and attracted me i advanced intending to speak to her to my horror i suddenly ceased to see her she disappeared as if i had been stricken blind  and yet i could see the landscape round me i could see the heaven above me a time passedonly a few minutes as i thoughtand the child became visible to me again walking handinhand with her father i approached them i was close enough to see that they were looking at me with pity and surprise my impulse was to ask if they saw anything strange in my face or my manner before i could speak the horrible wonder happened again they vanished from my view  was the invisible presence still near was it passing between me and my fellowmortals forbidding communication in that place and at that time  it must have been so when i turned away in my ignorance with a heavy heart the dreadful blankness which had twice shut out from me the beings of my own race was not between me and my dog the poor little creature filled me with pity i called him to me he moved at the sound of my voice and followed me languidly not quite awakened yet from the trance of terror that had possessed him  before i had retired by more than a few steps i thought i was conscious of the presence again i held out my longing arms to it i waited in the hope of a touch to tell me that i might return perhaps i was answered by indirect means i only know that a resolution to return to the same place at the same hour came to me and quieted my mind  the morning of the next day was dull and cloudy but the rain held off i set forth again to the gardens  my dog ran on before me into the streetand stopped waiting to see in which direction i might lead the way when i turned toward the gardens he dropped behind me in a little while i looked back he was following me no longer he stood irresolute i called to him he advanced a few stepshesitatedand ran back to the house  i went on by myself shall i confess my superstition i thought the dogs desertion of me a bad omen  arrived at the tree i placed myself under it the minutes followed each other uneventfully the cloudy sky darkened the dull surface of the grass showed no shuddering consciousness of an unearthly creature passing over it  i still waited with an obstinacy which was fast becoming the obstinacy of despair how long an interval elapsed while i kept watch on the ground before me i am not able to say i only know that a change came  under the dull gray light i saw the grass movebut not as it had moved on the day before it shriveled as if a flame had scorched it no flame appeared the brown underlying earth showed itself winding onward in a thin stripwhich might have been a footpath traced in fire it frightened me i longed for the protection of the invisible presence i prayed for a warning of it if danger was near  a touch answered me it was as if a hand unseen had taken my handhad raised it little by littlehad left it pointing to the thin brown path that wound toward me under the shriveled blades of grass  i looked to the far end of the path  the unseen hand closed on my hand with a warning pressure the revelation of the coming danger was near mei waited for it i saw it  the figure of a man appeared advancing toward me along the thin brown path i looked in his face as he came nearer it showed me dimly the face of my husbands brotherjohn zant  the consciousness of myself as a living creature left me i knew nothing i felt nothing i was dead  when the torture of revival made me open my eyes i found myself on the grass gentle hands raised my head at the moment when i recovered my senses who had brought me to life again who was taking care of me  i looked upward and sawbending over mejohn zant  vii  there the manuscript ended  some lines had been added on the last page but they had been so carefully erased as to be illegible these words of explanation appeared below the canceled sentences  i had begun to write the little that remains to be told when it struck me that i might unintentionally be exercising an unfair influence on your opinion let me only remind you that i believe absolutely in the supernatural revelation which i have endeavored to describe remember thisand decide for me what i dare not decide for myself  there was no serious obstacle in the way of compliance with this request  judged from the point of view of the materialist mrs zant might no doubt be the victim of illusions produced by a diseased state of the nervous system which have been known to existas in the celebrated case of the bookseller nicolai of berlinwithout being accompanied by derangement of the intellectual powers but mr rayburn was not asked to solve any such intricate problem as this he had been merely instructed to read the manuscript and to say what impression it had left on him of the mental condition of the writer whose doubt of herself had been in all probability first suggested by remembrance of the illness from which she had sufferedbrainfever  under these circumstances there could be little difficulty in forming an opinion the memory which had recalled and the judgment which had arranged the succession of events related in the narrative revealed a mind in full possession of its resources  having satisfied himself so far mr rayburn abstained from considering the more serious question suggested by what he had read  at any time his habits of life and his ways of thinking would have rendered him unfit to weigh the arguments which assert or deny supernatural revelation among the creatures of earth but his mind was now so disturbed by the startling record of experience which he had just read that he was only conscious of feeling certain impressionswithout possessing the capacity to reflect on them that his anxiety on mrs zants account had been increased and that his doubts of mr john zant had been encouraged were the only practical results of the confidence placed in him of which he was thus far aware in the ordinary exigencies of life a man of hesitating disposition his interest in mrs zants welfare and his desire to discover what had passed between her brotherinlaw and herself after their meeting in the gardens urged him into instant action in half an hour more he had arrived at her lodgings he was at once admitted  viii  mrs zant was alone in an imperfectly lighted room  i hope you will excuse the bad light she said my head has been burning as if the fever had come back again oh dont go away after what i have suffered you dont know how dreadful it is to be alone  the tone of her voice told him that she had been crying he at once tried the best means of setting the poor lady at ease by telling her of the conclusion at which he had arrived after reading her manuscript the happy result showed itself instantly her face brightened her manner changed she was eager to hear more  have i produced any other impression on you she asked  he understood the allusion expressing sincere respect for her own convictions he told her honestly that he was not prepared to enter on the obscure and terrible question of supernatural interposition grateful for the tone in which he had answered her she wisely and delicately changed the subject  i must speak to you of my brotherinlaw she said he has told me of your visit and i am anxious to know what you think of him do you like mr john zant  mr rayburn hesitated  the careworn look appeared again in her face if you had felt as kindly toward him as he feels toward you she said i might have gone to st sallins with a lighter heart  mr rayburn thought of the supernatural appearances described at the close of her narrative you believe in that terrible warning he remonstrated and yet you go to your brotherinlaws house  i believe she answered in the spirit of the man who loved me in the days of his earthly bondage i am under his protection what have i to do but to cast away my fears and to wait in faith and hope it might have helped my resolution if a friend had been near to encourage me she paused and smiled sadly i must remember she resumed that your way of understanding my position is not my way i ought to have told you that mr john zant feels needless anxiety about my health he declares that he will not lose sight of me until his mind is at ease it is useless to attempt to alter his opinion he says my nerves are shatteredand who that sees me can doubt it he tells me that my only chance of getting better is to try change of air and perfect reposehow can i contradict him he reminds me that i have no relation but himself and no house open to me but his ownand god knows he is right  she said those last words in accents of melancholy resignation which grieved the good man whose one merciful purpose was to serve and console her he spoke impulsively with the freedom of an old friend  i want to know more of you and mr john zant than i know now he said my motive is a better one than mere curiosity do you believe that i feel a sincere interest in you  with my whole heart  that reply encouraged him to proceed with what he had to say when you recovered from your faintingfit he began mr john zant asked questions of course  he asked what could possibly have happened in such a quiet place as kensington gardens to make me faint  and how did you answer  answer i couldnt even look at him  you said nothing  nothing i dont know what he thought of me he might have been surprised or he might have been offended  is he easily offended mr rayburn asked  not in my experience of him  do you mean your experience of him before your illness  yes since my recovery his engagements with country patients have kept him away from london i have not seen him since he took these lodgings for me but he is always considerate he has written more than once to beg that i will not think him neglectful and to tell me what i knew already through my poor husband that he has no money of his own and must live by his profession  in your husbands lifetime were the two brothers on good terms  always the one complaint i ever heard my husband make of john zant was that he didnt come to see us often enough after our marriage is there some wickedness in him which we have never suspected it may bebut how can it be i have every reason to be grateful to the man against whom i have been supernaturally warned his conduct to me has been always perfect i cant tell you what i owe to his influence in quieting my mind when a dreadful doubt arose about my husbands death  do you mean doubt if he died a natural death  oh no no he was dying of rapid consumptionbut his sudden death took the doctors by surprise one of them thought that he might have taken an overdose of his sleeping drops by mistake the other disputed this conclusion or there might have been an inquest in the house oh dont speak of it any more let us talk of something else tell me when i shall see you again  i hardly know when do you and your brotherinlaw leave london  tomorrow she looked at mr rayburn with a piteous entreaty in her eyes she said timidly do you ever go to the seaside and take your dear little girl with you  the request at which she had only dared to hint touched on the idea which was at that moment in mr rayburns mind  interpreted by his strong prejudice against john zant what she had said of her brotherinlaw filled him with forebodings of peril to herself all the more powerful in their influence for this reasonthat he shrank from distinctly realizing them if another person had been present at the interview and had said to him afterward that mans reluctance to visit his sisterinlaw while her husband was living is associated with a secret sense of guilt which her innocence cannot even imagine he and he alone knows the cause of her husbands sudden death his feigned anxiety about her health is adopted as the safest means of enticing her into his houseif those formidable conclusions had been urged on mr rayburn he would have felt it his duty to reject them as unjustifiable aspersions on an absent man and yet when he took leave that evening of mrs zant he had pledged himself to give lucy a holiday at the seaside and he had said without blushing that the child really deserved it as a reward for general good conduct and attention to her lessons  ix  three days later the father and daughter arrived toward evening at st sallinsonsea they found mrs zant at the station  the poor womans joy on seeing them expressed itself like the joy of a child oh i am so glad so glad was all she could say when they met lucy was halfsmothered with kisses and was made supremely happy by a present of the finest doll she had ever possessed mrs zant accompanied her friends to the rooms which had been secured at the hotel she was able to speak confidentially to mr rayburn while lucy was in the balcony hugging her doll and looking at the sea  the one event that had happened during mrs zants short residence at st sallins was the departure of her brotherinlaw that morning for london he had been called away to operate on the feet of a wealthy patient who knew the value of his time his housekeeper expected that he would return to dinner  as to his conduct toward mrs zant he was not only as attentive as everhe was almost oppressively affectionate in his language and manner there was no service that a man could render which he had not eagerly offered to her he declared that he already perceived an improvement in her health he congratulated her on having decided to stay in his house and as a proof perhaps of his sincerity he had repeatedly pressed her hand have you any idea what all this means she said simply  mr rayburn kept his idea to himself he professed ignorance and asked next what sort of person the housekeeper was  mrs zant shook her head ominously  such a strange creature she said and in the habit of taking such liberties that i begin to be afraid she is a little crazy  is she an old woman  noonly middleaged this morning after her master had left the house she actually asked me what i thought of my brotherinlaw i told her as coldly as possible that i thought he was very kind she was quite insensible to the tone in which i had spoken she went on from bad to worse do you call him the sort of man who would take the fancy of a young woman was her next question she actually looked at me i might have been wrong and i hope i was as if the young woman she had in her mind was myself i said i dont think of such things and i dont talk about them still she was not in the least discouraged she made a personal remark next excuse mebut you do look wretchedly pale i thought she seemed to enjoy the defect in my complexion i really believe it raised me in her estimation we shall get on better in time she said i am beginning to like you she walked out humming a tune dont you agree with me dont you think shes crazy  i can hardly give an opinion until i have seen her does she look as if she might have been a pretty woman at one time of her life  not the sort of pretty woman whom i admire  mr rayburn smiled i was thinking he resumed that this persons odd conduct may perhaps be accounted for she is probably jealous of any young lady who is invited to her masters houseand till she noticed your complexion she began by being jealous of you  innocently at a loss to understand how she could become an object of the housekeepers jealousy mrs zant looked at mr rayburn in astonishment before she could give expression to her feeling of surprise there was an interruptiona welcome interruption a waiter entered the room and announced a visitor described as a gentleman  mrs zant at once rose to retire  who is the gentleman mr rayburn askeddetaining mrs zant as he spoke  a voice which they both recognized answered gayly from the outer side of the door  a friend from london  x  welcome to st sallins cried mr john zant i knew that you were expected my dear sir and i took my chance at finding you at the hotel he turned to his sisterinlaw and kissed her hand with an elaborate gallantry worthy of sir charles grandison himself when i reached home my dear and heard that you had gone out i guessed that your object was to receive our excellent friend you have not felt lonely while i have been away thats right thats right he looked toward the balcony and discovered lucy at the open window staring at the magnificent stranger your little daughter mr rayburn dear child come and kiss me  lucy answered in one positive word no  mr john zant was not easily discouraged  show me your doll darling he said sit on my knee  lucy answered in two positive wordsi wont  her father approached the window to administer the necessary reproof mr john zant interfered in the cause of mercy with his best grace he held up his hands in cordial entreaty dear mr rayburn the fairies are sometimes shy and this little fairy doesnt take to strangers at first sight dear child all in good time and what stay do you make at st sallins may we hope that our poor attractions will tempt you to prolong your visit  he put his flattering little question with an ease of manner which was rather too plainly assumed and he looked at mr rayburn with a watchfulness which appeared to attach undue importance to the reply when he said what stay do you make at st sallins did he really mean how soon do you leave us inclining to adopt this conclusion mr rayburn answered cautiously that his stay at the seaside would depend on circumstances mr john zant looked at his sisterinlaw sitting silent in a corner with lucy on her lap exert your attractions he said make the circumstances agreeable to our good friend will you dine with us today my dear sir and bring your little fairy with you  lucy was far from receiving this complimentary allusion in the spirit in which it had been offered im not a fairy she declared im a child  and a naughty child her father added with all the severity that he could assume  i cant help it papa the man with the big beard puts me out  the man with the big beard was amusedamiably paternally amusedby lucys plain speaking he repeated his invitation to dinner and he did his best to look disappointed when mr rayburn made the necessary excuses  another day he said without however fixing the day i think you will find my house comfortable my housekeeper may perhaps be eccentricbut in all essentials a woman in a thousand do you feel the change from london already our air at st sallins is really worthy of its reputation invalids who come here are cured as if by magic what do you think of mrs zant how does she look  mr rayburn was evidently expected to say that she looked better he said it mr john zant seemed to have anticipated a stronger expression of opinion  surprisingly better he pronounced infinitely better we ought both to be grateful pray believe that we are grateful  if you mean grateful to me mr rayburn remarked i dont quite understand  you dont quite understand is it possible that you have forgotten our conversation when i first had the honor of receiving you look at mrs zant again  mr rayburn looked and mrs zants brotherinlaw explained himself  you notice the return of her color the healthy brightness of her eyes no my dear i am not paying you idle compliments i am stating plain facts for that happy result mr rayburn we are indebted to you  surely not  surely yes it was at your valuable suggestion that i thought of inviting my sisterinlaw to visit me at st sallins ah you remember it now forgive me if i look at my watch the dinner hour is on my mind not as your dear little daughter there seems to think because i am greedy but because i am always punctual in justice to the cook shall we see you tomorrow call early and you will find us at home  he gave mrs zant his arm and bowed and smiled and kissed his hand to lucy and left the room recalling their interview at the hotel in london mr rayburn now understood john zants object on that occasion in assuming the character of a helpless man in need of a sensible suggestion if mrs zants residence under his roof became associated with evil consequences he could declare that she would never have entered the house but for mr rayburns advice  with the next day came the hateful necessity of returning this mans visit  mr rayburn was placed between two alternatives in mrs zants interests he must remain no matter at what sacrifice of his own inclinations on good terms with her brotherinlawor he must return to london and leave the poor woman to her fate his choice it is needless to say was never a matter of doubt he called at the house and did his innocent bestwithout in the least deceiving mr john zantto make himself agreeable during the short duration of his visit descending the stairs on his way out accompanied by mrs zant he was surprised to see a middleaged woman in the hall who looked as if she was waiting there expressly to attract notice  the housekeeper mrs zant whispered she is impudent enough to try to make acquaintance with you  this was exactly what the housekeeper was waiting in the hall to do  i hope you like our wateringplace sir she began if i can be of service to you pray command me any friend of this ladys has a claim on meand you are an old friend no doubt i am only the housekeeper but i presume to take a sincere interest in mrs zant and i am indeed glad to see you here we none of us knowdo wehow soon we may want a friend no offense i hope thank you sir goodmorning  there was nothing in the womans eyes which indicated an unsettled mind nothing in the appearance of her lips which suggested habits of intoxication that her strange outburst of familiarity proceeded from some strong motive seemed to be more than probable putting together what mrs zant had already told him and what he had himself observed mr rayburn suspected that the motive might be found in the housekeepers jealousy of her master  xi  reflecting in the solitude of his own room mr rayburn felt that the one prudent course to take would be to persuade mrs zant to leave st sallins he tried to prepare her for this strong proceeding when she came the next day to take lucy out for a walk  if you still regret having forced yourself to accept your brotherinlaws invitation was all he ventured to say dont forget that you are perfect mistress of your own actions you have only to come to me at the hotel and i will take you back to london by the next train  she positively refused to entertain the idea  i should be a thankless creature indeed she said if i accepted your proposal do you think i am ungrateful enough to involve you in a personal quarrel with john zant no if i find myself forced to leave the house i will go away alone  there was no moving her from this resolution when she and lucy had gone out together mr rayburn remained at the hotel with a mind ill at ease a man of readier mental resources might have felt at a loss how to act for the best in the emergency that now confronted him while he was still as far as ever from arriving at a decision some person knocked at the door  had mrs zant returned he looked up as the door was opened and saw to his astonishmentmr john zants housekeeper  dont let me alarm you sir the woman said mrs zant has been taken a little faint at the door of our house my master is attending to her  where is the child mr rayburn asked  i was bringing her back to you sir when we met a lady and her little girl at the door of the hotel they were on their way to the beachand miss lucy begged hard to be allowed to go with them the lady said the two children were playfellows and she was sure you would not object  the lady is quite right mrs zants illness is not serious i hope  i think not sir but i should like to say something in her interests may i thank you she advanced a step nearer to him and spoke her next words in a whisper take mrs zant away from this place and lose no time in doing it  mr rayburn was on his guard he merely asked why  the housekeeper answered in a curiously indirect mannerpartly in jest as it seemed and partly in earnest  when a man has lost his wife she said theres some difference of opinion in parliament as i hear whether he does right or wrong if he marries his wifes sister wait a bit im coming to the point my master is one who has a long head on his shoulders he sees consequences which escape the notice of people like me in his way of thinking if one man may marry his wifes sister and no harm done wheres the objection if another man pays a compliment to the family and marries his brothers widow my master if you please is that other man take the widow away before she marries him  this was beyond endurance  you insult mrs zant mr rayburn answered if you suppose that such a thing is possible  oh i insult her do i listen to me one of three things will happen she will be entrapped into consenting to itor frightened into consenting to itor drugged into consenting to it  mr rayburn was too indignant to let her go on  you are talking nonsense he said there can be no marriage the law forbids it  are you one of the people who see no further than their noses she asked insolently wont the law take his money is he obliged to mention that he is related to her by marriage when he buys the license she paused her humor changed she stamped furiously on the floor the true motive that animated her showed itself in her next words and warned mr rayburn to grant a more favorable hearing than he had accorded to her yet if you wont stop it she burst out i will if he marries anybody he is bound to marry me will you take her away i ask you for the last timewill you take her away  the tone in which she made that final appeal to him had its effect  i will go back with you to john zants house he said and judge for myself  she laid her hand on his arm  i must go firstor you may not be let in follow me in five minutes and dont knock at the street door  on the point of leaving him she abruptly returned  we have forgotten something she said suppose my master refuses to see you his temper might get the better of him he might make it so unpleasant for you that you would be obliged to go  my temper might get the better of me mr rayburn replied andif i thought it was in mrs zants interestsi might refuse to leave the house unless she accompanied me  that will never do sir  why not  because i should be the person to suffer  in what way  in this way if you picked a quarrel with my master i should be blamed for it because i showed you upstairs besides think of the lady you might frighten her out of her senses if it came to a struggle between you two men  the language was exaggerated but there was a force in this last objection which mr rayburn was obliged to acknowledge  and after all the housekeeper continued he has more right over her than you have he is related to her and you are only her friend  mr rayburn declined to let himself be influenced by this consideration mr john zant is only related to her by marriage he said if she prefers trusting in mecome what may of it i will be worthy of her confidence  the housekeeper shook her head  that only means another quarrel she answered the wise way with a man like my master is the peaceable way we must manage to deceive him  i dont like deceit  in that case sir ill wish you goodby we will leave mrs zant to do the best she can for herself  mr rayburn was unreasonable he positively refused to adopt this alternative  will you hear what i have got to say the housekeeper asked  there can be no harm in that he admitted go on  she took him at his word  when you called at our house she began did you notice the doors in the passage on the first floor very well one of them is the door of the drawingroom and the other is the door of the library do you remember the drawingroom sir  i thought it a large welllighted room mr rayburn answered and i noticed a doorway in the wall with a handsome curtain hanging over it  thats enough for our purpose the housekeeper resumed on the other side of the curtain if you had looked in you would have found the library suppose my master is as polite as usual and begs to be excused for not receiving you because it is an inconvenient time and suppose you are polite on your side and take yourself off by the drawingroom door you will find me waiting downstairs on the first landing do you see it now  i cant say i do  you surprise me sir what is to prevent us from getting back softly into the library by the door in the passage and why shouldnt we use that second way into the library as a means of discovering what may be going on in the drawingroom safe behind the curtain you will see him if he behaves uncivilly to mrs zant or you will hear her if she calls for help in either case you may be as rough and ready with my master as you find needful it will be he who has frightened her and not you and who can blame the poor housekeeper because mr rayburn did his duty and protected a helpless woman there is my plan sir is it worth trying  he answered sharply enough i dont like it  the housekeeper opened the door again and wished him goodby  if mr rayburn had felt no more than an ordinary interest in mrs zant he would have let the woman go as it was he stopped her and after some further protest which proved to be useless he ended in giving way  you promise to follow my directions she stipulated  he gave the promise she smiled nodded and left him true to his instructions mr rayburn reckoned five minutes by his watch before he followed her  xii  the housekeeper was waiting for him with the streetdoor ajar  they are both in the drawingroom she whispered leading the way upstairs step softly and take him by surprise  a table of oblong shape stood midway between the drawingroom walls at the end of it which was nearest to the window mrs zant was pacing to and fro across the breadth of the room at the opposite end of the table john zant was seated taken completely by surprise he showed himself in his true character he started to his feet and protested with an oath against the intrusion which had been committed on him  heedless of his action and his language mr rayburn could look at nothing could think of nothing but mrs zant she was still walking slowly to and fro unconscious of the words of sympathy which he addressed to her insensible even as it seemed to the presence of other persons in the room  john zants voice broke the silence his temper was under control again he had his reasons for still remaining on friendly terms with mr rayburn  i am sorry i forgot myself just now he said  mr rayburns interest was concentrated on mrs zant he took no notice of the apology  when did this happen he asked  about a quarter of an hour ago i was fortunately at home without speaking to me without noticing me she walked upstairs like a person in a dream  mr rayburn suddenly pointed to mrs zant  look at her he said theres a change  all restlessness in her movements had come to an end she was standing at the further end of the table which was nearest to the window in the full flow of sunlight pouring at that moment over her face her eyes looked out straight before hervoid of all expression her lips were a little parted her head drooped slightly toward her shoulder in an attitude which suggested listening for something or waiting for something in the warm brilliant light she stood before the two men a living creature selfisolated in a stillness like the stillness of death  john zant was ready with the expression of his opinion  a nervous seizure he said something resembling catalepsy as you see  have you sent for a doctor  a doctor is not wanted  i beg your pardon it seems to me that medical help is absolutely necessary  be so good as to remember mr john zant answered that the decision rests with me as the ladys relative i am sensible of the honor which your visit confers on me but the time has been unhappily chosen forgive me if i suggest that you will do well to retire  mr rayburn had not forgotten the housekeepers advice or the promise which she had exacted from him but the expression in john zants face was a serious trial to his selfcontrol he hesitated and looked back at mrs zant  if he provoked a quarrel by remaining in the room the one alternative would be the removal of her by force fear of the consequences to herself if she was suddenly and roughly roused from her trance was the one consideration which reconciled him to submission he withdrew  the housekeeper was waiting for him below on the first landing when the door of the drawingroom had been closed again she signed to him to follow her and returned up the stairs after another struggle with himself he obeyed they entered the library from the corridorand placed themselves behind the closed curtain which hung over the doorway it was easy so to arrange the edge of the drapery as to observe without exciting suspicion whatever was going on in the next room  mrs zants brotherinlaw was approaching her at the time when mr rayburn saw him again  in the instant afterward she movedbefore he had completely passed over the space between them her still figure began to tremble she lifted her drooping head for a moment there was a shrinking in heras if she had been touched by something she seemed to recognize the touch she was still again  john zant watched the change it suggested to him that she was beginning to recover her senses he tried the experiment of speaking to her  my love my sweet angel come to the heart that adores you  he advanced again he passed into the flood of sunlight pouring over her  rouse yourself he said  she still remained in the same position apparently at his mercy neither hearing him nor seeing him  rouse yourself he repeated my darling come to me  at the instant when he attempted to embrace herat the instant when mr rayburn rushed into the roomjohn zants arms suddenly turning rigid remained outstretched with a shriek of horror he struggled to draw them backstruggled in the empty brightness of the sunshine as if some invisible grip had seized him  what has got me the wretch screamed who is holding my hands oh the cold of it the cold of it  his features became convulsed his eyes turned upward until only the white eyeballs were visible he fell prostrate with a crash that shook the room  the housekeeper ran in she knelt by her masters body with one hand she loosened his cravat with the other she pointed to the end of the table  mrs zant still kept her place but there was another change little by little her eyes recovered their natural living expressionthen slowly closed she tottered backward from the table and lifted her hands wildly as if to grasp at something which might support her mr rayburn hurried to her before she felllifted her in his armsand carried her out of the room  one of the servants met them in the hall he sent her for a carriage in a quarter of an hour more mrs zant was safe under his care at the hotel  xiii  that night a note written by the housekeeper was delivered to mrs zant  the doctors give little hope the paralytic stroke is spreading upward to his face if death spares him he will live a helpless man i shall take care of him to the last as for youforget him  mrs zant gave the note to mr rayburn  read it and destroy it she said it is written in ignorance of the terrible truth  he obeyedand looked at her in silence waiting to hear more she hid her face the few words she had addressed to him after a struggle with herself fell slowly and reluctantly from her lips  she said no mortal hand held the hands of john zant the guardian spirit was with me the promised protection was with me i know it i wish to know no more  having spoken she rose to retire he opened the door for her seeing that she needed rest in her own room  left by himself he began to consider the prospect that was before him in the future how was he to regard the woman who had just left him as a poor creature weakened by disease the victim of her own nervous delusion or as the chosen object of a supernatural revelationunparalleled by any similar revelation that he had heard of or had found recorded in books his first discovery of the place that she really held in his estimation dawned on his mind when he felt himself recoiling from the conclusion which presented her to his pity and yielding to the nobler conviction which felt with her faith and raised her to a place apart among other women  xiv  they left st sallins the next day  arrived at the end of the journey lucy held fast by mrs zants hand tears were rising in the childs eyes  are we to bid her goodby she said sadly to her father  he seemed to be unwilling to trust himself to speak he only said  my dear ask her yourself  but the result justified him lucy was happy again     miss morris and the stranger  i  when i first saw him he was lost in one of the dead cities of englandsituated on the south coast and called sandwich  shall i describe sandwich i think not let us own the truth descriptions of places however nicely they may be written are always more or less dull being a woman i naturally hate dullness perhaps some description of sandwich may drop out as it were from my report of our conversation when we first met as strangers in the street  he began irritably ive lost myself he said  people who dont know the town often do that i remarked  he went on which is my way to the fleur de lys inn  his way was in the first place to retrace his steps then to turn to the left then to go on until he found two streets meeting then to take the street on the right then to look out for the second turning on the left then to follow the turning until he smelled stablesand there was the inn i put it in the clearest manner and never stumbled over a word  how the devil am i to remember all that he said  this was rude we are naturally and properly indignant with any man who is rude to us but whether we turn our backs on him in contempt or whether we are merciful and give him a lesson in politeness depends entirely on the man he may be a bear but he may also have his redeeming qualities this man had redeeming qualities i cannot positively say that he was either handsome or ugly young or old well or ill dressed but i can speak with certainty to the personal attractions which recommended him to notice for instance the tone of his voice was persuasive did you ever read a story written by one of us in which we failed to dwell on our heros voice then again his hair was reasonably long are you acquainted with any woman who can endure a man with a cropped head moreover he was of a good height it must be a very tall woman who can feel favorably inclined toward a short man lastly although his eyes were not more than fairly presentable in form and color the wretch had in some unaccountable manner become possessed of beautiful eyelashes they were even better eyelashes than mine i write quite seriously there is one woman who is above the common weakness of vanityand she holds the present pen  so i gave my lost stranger a lesson in politeness the lesson took the form of a trap i asked him if he would like me to show him the way to the inn he was still annoyed at losing himself as i had anticipated he bluntly answered yes  when you were a boy and you wanted something i said did your mother teach you to say please  he positively blushed she did he admitted and she taught me to say beg your pardon when i was rude ill say it now beg your pardon  this curious apology increased my belief in his redeeming qualities i led the way to the inn he followed me in silence no woman who respects herself can endure silence when she is in the company of a man i made him talk  do you come to us from ramsgate i began he only nodded his head we dont think much of ramsgate here i went on there is not an old building in the place and their first mayor was only elected the other day  this point of view seemed to be new to him he made no attempt to dispute it he only looked around him and said sandwich is a melancholy place miss he was so rapidly improving in politeness that i encouraged him by a smile as a citizen of sandwich i may say that we take it as a compliment when we are told that our town is a melancholy place and why not melancholy is connected with dignity and dignity is associated with age and we are old i teach my pupils logic among other thingsthere is a specimen whatever may be said to the contrary women can reason they can also wander and i must admit that i am wandering did i mention at starting that i was a governess if not that allusion to pupils must have come in rather abruptly let me make my excuses and return to my lost stranger  is there any such thing as a straight street in all sandwich he asked  not one straight street in the whole town  any trade miss  as little as possibleand that is expiring  a decayed place in short  thoroughly decayed  my tone seemed to astonish him you speak as if you were proud of its being a decayed place he said  i quite respected him this was such an intelligent remark to make we do enjoy our decay it is our chief distinction progress and prosperity everywhere else decay and dissolution here as a necessary consequence we produce our own impression and we like to be original the sea deserted us long ago it once washed our walls it is now two miles away from uswe dont regret the sea we had sometimes ninetyfive ships in our harbor heaven only knows how many centuries ago we now have one or two small coasting vessels half their time aground in a muddy little riverwe dont regret our harbor but one house in the town is daring enough to anticipate the arrival of resident visitors and announces furnished apartments to let what a becoming contrast to our modern neighbor ramsgate our noble marketplace exhibits the laws made by the corporation and every week there are fewer and fewer people to obey the laws how convenient look at our one warehouse by the river sidewith the crane generally idle and the windows mostly boarded up and perhaps one man at the door looking out for the job which his better sense tells him cannot possibly come what a wholesome protest against the devastating hurry and overwork elsewhere which has shattered the nerves of the nation far from me and from my friends to borrow the eloquent language of doctor johnson be such frigid enthusiasm as shall conduct us indifferent and unmoved over the bridge by which you enter sandwich and pay a toll if you do it in a carriage that man is little to be envied doctor johnson again who can lose himself in our labyrinthine streets and not feel that he has reached the welcome limits of progress and found a haven of rest in an age of hurry  i am wandering again bear with the unpremeditated enthusiasm of a citizen who only attained years of discretion at her last birthday we shall soon have done with sandwich we are close to the door of the inn  you cant mistake it now sir i said goodmorning  he looked down at me from under his beautiful eyelashes have i mentioned that i am a little woman and he asked in his persuasive tones must we say goodby  i made him a bow  would you allow me to see you safe home he suggested  any other man would have offended me this man blushed like a boy and looked at the pavement instead of looking at me by this time i had made up my mind about him he was not only a gentleman beyond all doubt but a shy gentleman as well his bluntness and his odd remarks were as i thought partly efforts to disguise his shyness and partly refuges in which he tried to forget his own sense of it i answered his audacious proposal amiably and pleasantly you would only lose your way again i said and i should have to take you back to the inn for the second time  wasted words my obstinate stranger only made another proposal  i have ordered lunch here he said and i am quite alone he stopped in confusion and looked as if he rather expected me to box his ears i shall be forty next birthday he went on i am old enough to be your father i all but burst out laughing and stepped across the street on my way home he followed me we might invite the landlady to join us he said looking the picture of a headlong man dismayed by the consciousness of his own imprudence couldnt you honor me by lunching with me if we had the landlady he asked  this was a little too much quite out of the question sirand you ought to know it i said with severity he half put out his hand wont you even shake hands with me he inquired piteously when we have most properly administered a reproof to a man what is the perversity which makes us weakly pity him the minute afterward i was fool enough to shake hands with this perfect stranger and having done it i completed the total loss of my dignity by running away our dear crooked little streets hid me from him directly  as i rang at the doorbell of my employers house a thought occurred to me which might have been alarming to a better regulated mind than mine  suppose he should come back to sandwich  ii  before many more days passed i had troubles of my own to contend with which put the eccentric stranger out of my head for the time  unfortunately my troubles are part of my story and my early life mixes itself up with them in consideration of what is to follow may i say two words relating to the period before i was a governess  i am the orphan daughter of a shopkeeper of sandwich my father died leaving to his widow and child an honest name and a little income of l80 a year we kept on the shopneither gaining nor losing by it the truth is nobody would buy our poor little business i was thirteen years old at the time and i was able to help my mother whose health was then beginning to fail never shall i forget a certain bright summers day when i saw a new customer enter our shop he was an elderly gentleman and he seemed surprised to find so young a girl as myself in charge of the business and what is more competent to support the charge i answered his questions in a manner which seemed to please him he soon discovered that my education excepting my knowledge of the business had been sadly neglected and he inquired if he could see my mother she was resting on the sofa in the back parlorand she received him there when he came out he patted me on the cheek i have taken a fancy to you he said and perhaps i shall come back again he did come back again my mother had referred him to the rector for our characters in the town and he had heard what our clergyman could say for us our only relations had emigrated to australia and were not doing well there my mothers death would leave me so far as relatives were concerned literally alone in the world give this girl a firstrate education said our elderly customer sitting at our teatable in the back parlor and she will do if you will send her to school maam ill pay for her education my poor mother began to cry at the prospect of parting with me the old gentleman said think of it and got up to go he gave me his card as i opened the shopdoor for him if you find yourself in trouble he whispered so that my mother could not hear him be a wise child and write and tell me of it i looked at the card our kindhearted customer was no less a person than sir gervase damian of garrum park sussexwith landed property in our county as well he had made himself through the rector no doubt far better acquainted than i was with the true state of my mothers health in four months from the memorable day when the great man had taken tea with us my time had come to be alone in the world i have no courage to dwell on it my spirits sink even at this distance of time when i think of myself in those days the good rector helped me with his advicei wrote to sir gervase damian  a change had come over his life as well as mine in the interval since we had met  sir gervase had married for the second timeand what was more foolish still perhaps at his age had married a young woman she was said to be consumptive and of a jealous temper as well her husbands only child by his first wife a son and heir was so angry at his fathers second marriage that he left the house the landed property being entailed sir gervase could only express his sense of his sons conduct by making a new will which left all his property in money to his young wife  these particulars i gathered from the steward who was expressly sent to visit me at sandwich  sir gervase never makes a promise without keeping it this gentleman informed me i am directed to take you to a firstrate ladies school in the neighborhood of london and to make all the necessary arrangements for your remaining there until you are eighteen years of age any written communications in the future are to pass if you please through the hands of the rector of sandwich the delicate health of the new lady damian makes it only too likely that the lives of her husband and herself will be passed for the most part in a milder climate than the climate of england i am instructed to say this and to convey to you sir gervases best wishes  by the rectors advice i accepted the position offered to me in this unpleasantly formal mannerconcluding quite correctly as i afterward discovered that i was indebted to lady damian for the arrangement which personally separated me from my benefactor her husbands kindness and my gratitude meeting on the neutral ground of garrum park were objects of conjugal distrust to this lady shocking shocking i left a sincerely grateful letter to be forwarded to sir gervase and escorted by the steward i went to schoolbeing then just fourteen years old  i know i am a fool never mind there is some pride in me though i am only a small shopkeepers daughter my new life had its trialsmy pride held me up  for the four years during which i remained at the school my poor welfare might be a subject of inquiry to the rector and sometimes even the stewardnever to sir gervase himself his winters were no doubt passed abroad but in the summer time he and lady damian were at home again not even for a day or two in the holiday time was there pity enough felt for my lonely position to ask me to be the guest of the housekeeper i expected nothing more at garrum park but for my pride i might have felt it bitterly my pride said to me do justice to yourself i worked so hard i behaved so well that the mistress of the school wrote to sir gervase to tell him how thoroughly i had deserved the kindness that he had shown to me no answer was received oh lady damian no change varied the monotony of my lifeexcept when one of my schoolgirl friends sometimes took me home with her for a few days at vacation time never mind my pride held me up  as the last halfyear of my time at school approached i began to consider the serious question of my future life  of course i could have lived on my eighty pounds a year but what a lonely barren existence it promised to beunless somebody married me and where if you please was i to find him my education had thoroughly fitted me to be a governess why not try my fortune and see a little of the world in that way even if i fell among illconditioned people i could be independent of them and retire on my income  the rector visiting london came to see me he not only approved of my ideahe offered me a means of carrying it out a worthy family recently settled at sandwich were in want of a governess the head of the household was partner in a business the exact nature of which it is needless to mention having branches out of london he had become superintendent of a new branchtried as a commercial experiment under special circumstances at sandwich the idea of returning to my native place pleased medull as the place was to others i accepted the situation  when the stewards usual halfyearly letter arrived soon afterward inquiring what plans i had formed on leaving school and what he could do to help them acting on behalf of sir gervase a delicious tingling filled me from head to foot when i thought of my own independence it was not ingratitude toward my benefactor it was only my little private triumph over lady damian oh my sisters of the sex can you not understand and forgive me  so to sandwich i returned and there for three years i remained with the kindest people who ever breathed the breath of life under their roof i was still living when i met with my lost gentleman in the street  ah me the end of that quiet pleasant life was near when i lightly spoke to the odd stranger of the expiring trade of the town i never expected that my employers trade was expiring too the speculation had turned out to be a losing one and all his savings had been embarked in it he could no longer remain at sandwich or afford to keep a governess his wife broke the sad news to me i was so fond of the children i proposed to her to give up my salary her husband refused even to consider the proposal it was the old story of poor humanity over again we cried we kissed we parted  what was i to do nextwrite to sir gervase  i had already written soon after my return to sandwich breaking through the regulations by directly addressing sir gervase i expressed my grateful sense of his generosity to a poor girl who had no family claim on him and i promised to make the one return in my power by trying to be worthy of the interest he had taken in me the letter was written without any alloy of mental reserve my new life as a governess was such a happy one that i had forgotten my paltry bitterness of feeling against lady damian  it was a relief to think of this change for the better when the secretary at garrum park informed me that he had forwarded my letter to sir gervase then at madeira with his sick wife she was slowly and steadily wasting away in a decline before another year had passed sir gervase was left a widower for the second time with no child to console him under his loss no answer came to my grateful letter i should have been unreasonable indeed if i had expected the bereaved husband to remember me in his grief and loneliness could i write to him again in my own trumpery little interests under these circumstances i thought and still think that the commonest feeling of delicacy forbade it the only other alternative was to appeal to the everready friends of the obscure and helpless public i advertised in the newspapers  the tone of one of the answers which i received impressed me so favorably that i forwarded my references the next post brought my written engagement and the offer of a salary which doubled my income  the story of the past is told and now we may travel on again with no more stoppages by the way  iii  the residence of my present employer was in the north of england having to pass through london i arranged to stay in town for a few days to make some necessary additions to my wardrobe an old servant of the rector who kept a lodginghouse in the suburbs received me kindly and guided my choice in the serious matter of a dressmaker on the second morning after my arrival an event happened the post brought me a letter forwarded from the rectory imagine my astonishment when my correspondent proved to be sir gervase damian himself  the letter was dated from his house in london it briefly invited me to call and see him for a reason which i should hear from his own lips he naturally supposed that i was still at sandwich and requested me in a postscript to consider my journey as made at his expense  i went to the house the same day while i was giving my name a gentleman came out into the hall he spoke to me without ceremony  sir gervase he said believes he is going to die dont encourage him in that idea he may live for another year or more if his friends will only persuade him to be hopeful about himself  with that the gentleman left me the servant said it was the doctor  the change in my benefactor since i had seen him last startled and distressed me he lay back in a large armchair wearing a grim black dressinggown and looking pitiably thin and pinched and worn i do not think i should have known him again if we had met by accident he signed to me to be seated on a little chair by his side  i wanted to see you he said quietly before i die you must have thought me neglectful and unkind with good reason my child you have not been forgotten if years have passed without a meeting between us it has not been altogether my fault  he stopped a pained expression passed over his poor worn face he was evidently thinking of the young wife whom he had lost i repeatedfervently and sincerely repeatedwhat i had already said to him in writing i owe everything sir to your fatherly kindness saying this i ventured a little further i took his wan white hand hanging over the arm of the chair and respectfully put it to my lips  he gently drew his hand away from me and sighed as he did it perhaps she had sometimes kissed his hand  now tell me about yourself he said  i told him of my new situation and how i had got it he listened with evident interest  i was not selfdeceived he said when i first took a fancy to you in the shop i admire your independent feeling its the right kind of courage in a girl like you but you must let me do something more for yousome little service to remember me by when the end has come what shall it be  try to get better sir and let me write to you now and then i answered indeed indeed i want nothing more  you will accept a little present at least with those words he took from the breastpocket of his dressinggown an enameled cross attached to a gold chain think of me sometimes he said as he put the chain round my neck he drew me to him gently and kissed my forehead it was too much for me dont cry my dear he said dont remind me of another sad young face  once more he stopped once more he was thinking of the lost wife i pulled down my veil and ran out of the room  iv  the next day i was on my way to the north my narrative brightens againbut let us not forget sir gervase damian  i ask permission to introduce some persons of distinctionmrs fosdyke of carsham hall widow of general fosdyke also master frederick miss ellen and miss eva the pupils of the new governess also two ladies and three gentlemen guests staying in the house  discreet and dignified handsome and wellbredsuch was my impression of mrs fosdyke while she harangued me on the subject of her children and communicated her views on education having heard the views before from others i assumed a listening position and privately formed my opinion of the schoolroom it was large lofty perfectly furnished for the purpose it had a big window and a balcony looking out over the garden terrace and the park beyonda wonderful schoolroom in my limited experience one of the two doors which it possessed was left open and showed me a sweet little bedroom with amber draperies and maplewood furniture devoted to myself here were wealth and liberality in the harmonious combination so seldom discovered by the spectator of small means i controlled my first feeling of bewilderment just in time to answer mrs fosdyke on the subject of reading and recitationviewed as minor accomplishments which a good governess might be expected to teach  while the organs are young and pliable the lady remarked i regard it as of great importance to practice children in the art of reading aloud with an agreeable variety of tone and correctness of emphasis trained in this way they will produce a favorable impression on others even in ordinary conversation when they grow up poetry committed to memory and recited is a valuable means toward this end may i hope that your studies have enabled you to carry out my views  formal enough in language but courteous and kind in manner i relieved mrs fosdyke from anxiety by informing her that we had a professor of elocution at school and then i was left to improve my acquaintance with my three pupils  they were fairly intelligent children the boy as usual being slower than the girls i did my bestwith many a sad remembrance of the far dearer pupils whom i had leftto make them like me and trust me and i succeeded in winning their confidence in a week from the time of my arrival at carsham hall we began to understand each other  the first day in the week was one of our days for reciting poetry in obedience to the instructions with which i had been favored by mrs fosdyke i had done with the girls and had just opened perhaps i ought to say profaned shakespeares julius caesar in the elocutionary interests of master freddy half of mark antonys first glorious speech over caesars dead body he had learned by heart and it was now my duty to teach him to the best of my small ability how to speak it the morning was warm we had our big window open the delicious perfume of flowers in the garden beneath filled the room  i recited the first eight lines and stopped there feeling that i must not exact too much from the boy at first now freddy i said try if you can speak the poetry as i have spoken it  dont do anything of the kind freddy said a voice from the garden its all spoken wrong  who was this insolent person a man unquestionablyand strange to say there was something not entirely unfamiliar to me in his voice the girls began to giggle their brother was more explicit oh says freddy its only mr sax  the one becoming course to pursue was to take no notice of the interruption go on i said freddy recited the lines like a dear good boy with as near an imitation of my style of elocution as could be expected from him  poor devil cried the voice from the garden insolently pitying my attentive pupil  i imposed silence on the girls by a lookand then without stirring from my chair expressed my sense of the insolence of mr sax in clear and commanding tones i shall be obliged to close the window if this is repeated having spoken to that effect i waited in expectation of an apology silence was the only apology it was enough for me that i had produced the right impression i went on with my recitation             here under leave of brutus and the rest            for brutus is an honorable man            so are they all all honorable men            come i to speak in caesars funeral            he was my friend faithful and just to me  oh good heavens i cant stand that why dont you speak the last line properly listen to me  dignity is a valuable quality especially in a governess but there are limits to the most highly trained endurance i bounced out into the balconyand there on the terrace smoking a cigar was my lost stranger in the streets of sandwich  he recognized me on his side the instant i appeared oh lord he cried in tones of horror and ran round the corner of the terrace as if my eyes had been mad bulls in close pursuit of him by this time it is i fear useless for me to set myself up as a discreet person in emergencies another woman might have controlled herself i burst into fits of laughter freddy and the girls joined me for the time it was plainly useless to pursue the business of education i shut up shakespeare and allowedno let me tell the truth encouragedthe children to talk about mr sax  they only seemed to know what mr sax himself had told them his father and mother and brothers and sisters had all died in course of time he was the sixth and last of the children and he had been christened sextus in consequence which is latin here freddy interposed for sixth also christened cyril here the girls recovered the lead by his mothers request sextus being such a hideous name and which of his christian names does he use you wouldnt ask if you knew him sextus of course because it is the ugliest sextus sax not the romantic sort of name that one likes when one is a woman but i have no right to be particular my own name is it possible that i have not mentioned it in these pages yet is only nancy morris do not despise meand let us return to mr sax  is he married the eldest girl thought not she had heard mamma say to a lady an old german family my dear and in spite of his oddities an excellent man but so poorbarely enough to live onand blurts out the truth if people ask his opinion as if he had twenty thousand a year your mamma knows him well of course i should think so and so do we he often comes here they say hes not good company among grownup people we think him jolly he understands dolls and hes the best back at leapfrog in the whole of england thus far we had advanced in the praise of sextus sax when one of the maids came in with a note for me she smiled mysteriously and said im to wait for an answer miss  i opened the note and read these lines  i am so ashamed of myself i darent attempt to make my apologies personally will you accept my written excuses upon my honor nobody told me when i got here yesterday that you were in the house i heard the recitation andcan you excuse my stupidityi thought it was a stagestruck housemaid amusing herself with the children may i accompany you when you go out with the young ones for your daily walk one word will do yes or no penitently yourss s  in my position there was but one possible answer to this governesses must not make appointments with strange gentlemeneven when the children are present in the capacity of witnesses i said no am i claiming too much for my readiness to forgive injuries when i add that i should have preferred saying yes  we had our early dinner and then got ready to go out walking as usual these pages contain a true confession let me own that i hoped mr sax would understand my refusal and ask mrs fosdykes leave to accompany us lingering a little as we went downstairs i heard him in the hallactually speaking to mrs fosdyke what was he saying that darling boy freddy got into a difficulty with one of his bootlaces exactly at the right moment i could help him and listenand be sadly disappointed by the result mr sax was offended with me  you neednt introduce me to the new governess i heard him say we have met on a former occasion and i produced a disagreeable impression on her i beg you will not speak of me to miss morris  before mrs fosdyke could say a word in reply master freddy changed suddenly from a darling boy to a detestable imp i say mr sax he called out miss morris doesnt mind you a bitshe only laughs at you  the answer to this was the sudden closing of a door mr sax had taken refuge from me in one of the groundfloor rooms i was so mortified i could almost have cried  getting down into the hall we found mrs fosdyke with her garden hat on and one of the two ladies who were staying in the house the unmarried one whispering to her at the door of the morningroom the ladymiss melburylooked at me with a certain appearance of curiosity which i was quite at a loss to understand and suddenly turned away toward the further end of the hall  i will walk with you and the children mrs fosdyke said to me freddy you can ride your tricycle if you like she turned to the girls my dears its cool under the trees you may take your skippingropes  she had evidently something special to say to me and she had adopted the necessary measures for keeping the children in front of us well out of hearing freddy led the way on his horse on three wheels the girls followed skipping merrily mrs fosdyke opened the business by the most embarrassing remark that she could possibly have made under the circumstances  i find that you are acquainted with mr sax she began and i am surprised to hear that you dislike him  she smiled pleasantly as if my supposed dislike of mr sax rather amused her what the ruling passion may be among men i cannot presume to consider my own sex however i may claim to understand the ruling passion among women is conceit my ridiculous notion of my own consequence was wounded in some way i assumed a position of the loftiest indifference  really maam i said i cant undertake to answer for any impression that mr sax may have formed we met by the merest accident i know nothing about him  mrs fosdyke eyed me slyly and appeared to be more amused than ever  he is a very odd man she admitted but i can tell you there is a fine nature under that strange surface of his however she went on i am forgetting that he forbids me to talk about him in your presence when the opportunity offers i shall take my own way of teaching you two to understand each other you will both be grateful to me when i have succeeded in the meantime there is a third person who will be sadly disappointed to hear that you know nothing about mr sax  may i ask maam who the person is  can you keep a secret miss morris of course you can the person is miss melbury  miss melbury was a dark woman it cannot be because i am a fair woman myselfi hope i am above such narrow prejudices as thatbut it is certainly true that i dont admire dark women  she heard mr sax telling me that you particularly disliked him mrs fosdyke proceeded and just as you appeared in the hall she was asking me to find out what your reason was my own opinion of mr sax i ought to tell you doesnt satisfy her i am his old friend and i present him of course from my own favorable point of view miss melbury is anxious to be made acquainted with his faultsand she expected you to be a valuable witness against him  thus far we had been walking on we now stopped as if by common consent and looked at one another  in my previous experience of mrs fosdyke i had only seen the more constrained and formal side of her character without being aware of my own success i had won the mothers heart in winning the goodwill of her children constraint now seized its first opportunity of melting away the latent sense of humor in the great lady showed itself while i was inwardly wondering what the nature of miss melburys extraordinary interest in mr sax might be easily penetrating my thoughts she satisfied my curiosity without committing herself to a reply in words her large gray eyes sparkled as they rested on my face and she hummed the tune of the old french song cest lamour lamour lamour there is no disguising itsomething in this disclosure made me excessively angry was i angry with miss melbury or with mr sax or with myself i think it must have been with myself  finding that i had nothing to say on my side mrs fosdyke looked at her watch and remembered her domestic duties to my relief our interview came to an end  i have a dinnerparty today she said and i have not seen the housekeeper yet make yourself beautiful miss morris and join us in the drawingroom after dinner  v  i wore my best dress and in all my life before i never took such pains with my hair nobody will be foolish enough i hope to suppose that i did this on mr saxs account how could i possibly care about a man who was little better than a stranger to me no the person i dressed at was miss melbury  she gave me a look as i modestly placed myself in a corner which amply rewarded me for the time spent on my toilet the gentlemen came in i looked at mr sax mere curiosity under shelter of my fan his appearance was greatly improved by evening dress he discovered me in my corner and seemed doubtful whether to approach me or not i was reminded of our first odd meeting and i could not help smiling as i called it to mind did he presume to think that i was encouraging him before i could decide that question he took the vacant place on the sofa in any other manafter what had passed in the morningthis would have been an audacious proceeding he looked so painfully embarrassed that it became a species of christian duty to pity him  wont you shake hands he said just as he had said it at sandwich  i peeped round the corner of my fan at miss melbury she was looking at us i shook hands with mr sax  what sort of sensation is it he asked when you shake hands with a man whom you hate  i really cant tell you i answered innocently i have never done such a thing  you would not lunch with me at sandwich he protested and after the humblest apology on my part you wont forgive me for what i did this morning do you expect me to believe that i am not the special object of your antipathy i wish i had never met with you at my age a man gets angry when he is treated cruelly and doesnt deserve it you dont understand that i dare say  oh yes i do i heard what you said about me to mrs fosdyke and i heard you bang the door when you got out of my way  he received this reply with every appearance of satisfaction so you listened did you im glad to hear that  why  it shows you take some interest in me after all  throughout this frivolous talk i only venture to report it because it shows that i bore no malice on my side miss melbury was looking at us like the basilisk of the ancients she owned to being on the wrong side of thirty and she had a little moneybut these were surely no reasons why she should glare at a poor governess had some secret understanding of the tender sort been already established between mr sax and herself she provoked me into trying to find outespecially as the last words he had said offered me the opportunity  i can prove that i feel a sincere interest in you i resumed i can resign you to a lady who has a far better claim to your attention than mine you are neglecting her shamefully  he stared at me with an appearance of bewilderment which seemed to imply that the attachment was on the ladys side so far it was of course impossible to mention names i merely turned my eyes in the right direction he looked where i lookedand his shyness revealed itself in spite of his resolution to conceal it his face flushed he looked mortified and surprised miss melbury could endure it no longer she rose took a song from the musicstand and approached us  i am going to sing she said handing the music to him please turn over for me mr sax  i think he hesitatedbut i cannot feel sure that i observed him correctly it matters little with or without hesitation he followed her to the piano  miss melbury sangwith perfect selfpossession and an immense compass of voice a gentleman near me said she ought to be on the stage i thought so too big as it was our drawingroom was not large enough for her the gentleman sang next no voice at allbut so sweet such true feeling i turned over the leaves for him a dear old lady sitting near the piano entered into conversation with me she spoke of the great singers at the beginning of the present century mr sax hovered about with miss melburys eye on him i was so entranced by the anecdotes of my venerable friend that i could take no notice of mr sax later when the dinnerparty was over and we were retiring for the night he still hovered about and ended in offering me a bedroom candle i immediately handed it to miss melbury really a most enjoyable evening  vi  the next morning we were startled by an extraordinary proceeding on the part of one of the guests mr sax had left carsham hall by the first trainnobody knew why  nature has laidso at least philosophers saysome heavy burdens upon women do those learned persons include in their list the burden of hysterics if so i cordially agree with them it is hardly worth speaking of in my casea constitutional outbreak in the solitude of my own room treated with eaudecologne and water and quite forgotten afterward in the absorbing employment of education my favorite pupil freddy had been up earlier than the rest of usbreathing the morning air in the fruitgarden he had seen mr sax and had asked him when he was coming back again and mr sax had said i shall be back again next month dear little freddy  in the meanwhile we in the schoolroom had the prospect before us of a dull time in an empty house the remaining guests were to go away at the end of the week their hostess being engaged to pay a visit to some old friends in scotland  during the next three or four days though i was often alone with mrs fosdyke she never said one word on the subject of mr sax once or twice i caught her looking at me with that unendurably significant smile of hers miss melbury was equally unpleasant in another way when we accidentally met on the stairs her black eyes shot at me passing glances of hatred and scorn did these two ladies presume to think  no i abstained from completing that inquiry at the time and i abstain from completing it here  the end of the week came and i and the children were left alone at carsham hall  i took advantage of the leisure hours at my disposal to write to sir gervase respectfully inquiring after his health and informing him that i had been again most fortunate in my engagement as a governess by return of post an answer arrived i eagerly opened it the first lines informed me of sir gervase damians death  the letter dropped from my hand i looked at my little enameled cross it is not for me to say what i felt think of all that i owed to him and remember how lonely my lot was in the world i gave the children a holiday it was only the truth to tell them that i was not well  how long an interval passed before i could call to mind that i had only read the first lines of the letter i am not able to say when i did take it up i was surprised to see that the writing covered two pages beginning again where i had left off my head in a moment more began to swim a horrid fear overpowered me that i might not be in my right mind after i had read the first three sentences here they are to answer for me that i exaggerate nothing  the will of our deceased client is not yet proved but with the sanction of the executors i inform you confidentially that you are the person chiefly interested in it sir gervase damian bequeaths to you absolutely the whole of his personal property amounting to the sum of seventy thousand pounds  if the letter had ended there i really cannot imagine what extravagances i might not have committed but the writer head partner in the firm of sir gervases lawyers had something more to say on his own behalf the manner in which he said it strung up my nerves in an instant i can not and will not copy the words here it is quite revolting enough to give the substance of them  the mans object was evidently to let me perceive that he disapproved of the will so far i do not complain of himhe had no doubt good reason for the view he took but in expressing his surprise at this extraordinary proof of the testators interest in a perfect stranger to the family he hinted his suspicion of an influence on my part exercised over sir gervase so utterly shameful that i cannot dwell on the subject the language i should add was cunningly guarded even i could see that it would bear more than one interpretation and would thus put me in the wrong if i openly resented it but the meaning was plain and part at least of the motive came out in the following sentences  the present sir gervase as you are doubtless aware is not seriously affected by his fathers will he is already more liberally provided for as heir under the entail to the whole of the landed property but to say nothing of old friends who are forgotten there is a surviving relative of the late sir gervase passed over who is nearly akin to him by blood in the event of this person disputing the will you will of course hear from us again and refer us to your legal adviser  the letter ended with an apology for delay in writing to me caused by difficulty in discovering my address  and what did i dowrite to the rector or to mrs fosdyke for advice not i  at first i was too indignant to be able to think of what i ought to do our posttime was late and my head ached as if it would burst into pieces i had plenty of leisure to rest and compose myself when i got cool again i felt able to take my own part without asking any one to help me  even if i had been treated kindly i should certainly not have taken the money when there was a relative living with a claim to it what did i want with a large fortune to buy a husband with it perhaps no no from all that i have heard the great lord chancellor was quite right when he said that a woman with money at her own disposal was either kissed out of it or kicked out of it six weeks after her marriage the one difficulty before me was not to give up my legacy but to express my reply with sufficient severity and at the same time with due regard to my own selfrespect here is what i wrote  siri will not trouble you by attempting to express my sorrow on hearing of sir gervase damians death you would probably form your own opinion on that subject also and i have no wish to be judged by your unenviable experience of humanity for the second time  with regard to the legacy feeling the sincerest gratitude to my generous benefactor i nevertheless refuse to receive the money  be pleased to send me the necessary document to sign for transferring my fortune to that relative of sir gervase mentioned in your letter the one condition on which i insist is that no expression of thanks shall be addressed to me by the person in whose favor i resign the money i do not desire even supposing that justice is done to my motives on this occasion to be made the object of expressions of gratitude for only doing my duty  so it ended i may be wrong but i call that strong writing  in due course of post a formal acknowledgment arrived i was requested to wait for the document until the will had been proved and was informed that my name should be kept strictly secret in the interval on this occasion the executors were almost as insolent as the lawyer they felt it their duty to give me time to reconsider a decision which had been evidently formed on impulse ah how hard men areat least some of them i locked up the acknowledgment in disgust resolved to think no more of it until the time came for getting rid of my legacy i kissed poor sir gervases little keepsake while i was still looking at it the good children came in of their own accord to ask how i was i was obliged to draw down the blind in my room or they would have seen the tears in my eyes for the first time since my mothers death i felt the heartache perhaps the children made me think of the happier time when i was a child myself  vii  the will had been proved and i was informed that the document was in course of preparation when mrs fosdyke returned from her visit to scotland  she thought me looking pale and worn  the time seems to me to have come she said when i had better make you and mr sax understand each other have you been thinking penitently of your own bad behavior  i felt myself blushing i had been thinking of my conduct to mr saxand i was heartily ashamed of it too  mrs fosdyke went on half in jest half in earnest consult your own sense of propriety she said was the poor man to blame for not being rude enough to say no when a lady asked him to turn over her music could he help it if the same lady persisted in flirting with him he ran away from her the next morning did you deserve to be told why he left us certainly notafter the vixenish manner in which you handed the bedroom candle to miss melbury you foolish girl do you think i couldnt see that you were in love with him thank heaven hes too poor to marry you and take you away from my children for some time to come there will be a long marriage engagement even if he is magnanimous enough to forgive you shall i ask miss melbury to come back with him  she took pity on me at last and sat down to write to mr sax his reply dated from a country house some twenty miles distant announced that he would be at carsham hall in three days time  on that third day the legal paper that i was to sign arrived by post it was sunday morning i was alone in the schoolroom  in writing to me the lawyer had only alluded to a surviving relative of sir gervase nearly akin to him by blood the document was more explicit it described the relative as being a nephew of sir gervase the son of his sister the name followed  it was sextus cyril sax  i have tried on three different sheets of paper to describe the effect which this discovery produced on meand i have torn them up one after another when i only think of it my mind seems to fall back into the helpless surprise and confusion of that time after all that had passed between usthe man himself being then on his way to the house what would he think of me when he saw my name at the bottom of the document what in heavens name was i to do  how long i sat petrified with the document on my lap i never knew somebody knocked at the schoolroom door and looked in and said something and went out again then there was an interval then the door was opened again a hand was laid kindly on my shoulder i looked upand there was mrs fosdyke asking in the greatest alarm what was the matter with me  the tone of her voice roused me into speaking i could think of nothing but mr sax i could only say has he come  yesand waiting to see you  answering in those terms she glanced at the paper in my lap in the extremity of my helplessness i acted like a sensible creature at last i told mrs fosdyke all that i have told here  she neither moved nor spoke until i had done her first proceeding after that was to take me in her arms and give me a kiss having so far encouraged me she next spoke of poor sir gervase  we all acted like fools she announced in needlessly offending him by protesting against his second marriage i dont mean youi mean his son his nephew and myself if his second marriage made him happy what business had we with the disparity of years between husband and wife i can tell you this sextus was the first of us to regret what he had done but for his stupid fear of being suspected of an interested motive sir gervase might have known there was that much good in his sisters son  she snatched up a copy of the will which i had not even noticed thus far  see what the kind old man says of you she went on pointing to the words i could not see them she was obliged to read them for me i leave my money to the one person living who has been more than worthy of the little i have done for her and whose simple unselfish nature i know that i can trust  i pressed mrs fosdykes hand i was not able to speak she took up the legal paper next  do justice to yourself and be above contemptible scruples she said sextus is fond enough of you to be almost worthy of the sacrifice that you are making signand i will sign next as the witness  i hesitated  what will he think of me i said  sign she repeated and we will see to that  i obeyed she asked for the lawyers letter i gave it to her with the lines which contained the mans vile insinuation folded down so that only the words above were visible which proved that i had renounced my legacy not even knowing whether the person to be benefited was a man or a woman she took this with the rough draft of my own letter and the signed renunciationand opened the door  pray come back and tell me about it i pleaded  she smiled nodded and went out  oh what a long time passed before i heard the longexpected knock at the door come in i cried impatiently  mrs fosdyke had deceived me mr sax had returned in her place he closed the door we two were alone  he was deadly pale his eyes as they rested on me had a wild startled look with icy cold fingers he took my hand and lifted it in silence to his lips the sight of his agitation encouraged mei dont to this day know why unless it appealed in some way to my compassion i was bold enough to look at him still silent he placed the letters on the tableand then he laid the signed paper beside them when i saw that i was bolder still i spoke first  surely you dont refuse me i said  he answered i thank you with my whole heart i admire you more than words can say but i cant take it  why not  the fortune is yours he said gently remember how poor i am and feel for me if i say no more  his head sank on his breast he stretched out one hand silently imploring me to understand him i could endure it no longer i forgot every consideration which a woman in my position ought to have remembered out came the desperate words before i could stop them  you wont take my gift by itself i said  no  will you take me with it   that evening mrs fosdyke indulged her sly sense of humor in a new way she handed me an almanac  after all my dear she remarked you neednt be ashamed of having spoken first you have only used the ancient privilege of the sex this is leap year     mr cosway and the landlady  i  the guests would have enjoyed their visit to sir peters country housebut for mr cosway and to make matters worse it was not mr cosway but the guests who were to blame they repeated the old story of adam and eve on a larger scale the women were the first sinners and the men were demoralized by the women  mr cosways bitterest enemy could not have denied that he was a handsome wellbred unassuming man no mystery of any sort attached to him he had adopted the navy as a professionhad grown weary of it after a few years serviceand now lived on the moderate income left to him after the death of his parents out of this unpromising material the lively imaginations of the women built up a romance the men only noticed that mr cosway was rather silent and thoughtful that he was not ready with his laugh and that he had a fancy for taking long walks by himself harmless peculiarities surely and yet they excited the curiosity of the women as signs of a mystery in mr cosways past life in which some beloved object unknown must have played a chief part  as a matter of course the influence of the sex was tried under every indirect and delicate form of approach to induce mr cosway to open his heart and tell the tale of his sorrows with perfect courtesy he baffled curiosity and kept his supposed secret to himself the most beautiful girl in the house was ready to offer herself and her fortune as consolations if this impenetrable bachelor would only have taken her into his confidence he smiled sadly and changed the subject  defeated so far the women accepted the next alternative  one of the guests staying in the house was mr cosways intimate friendformerly his brotherofficer on board ship this gentleman was now subjected to the delicately directed system of investigation which had failed with his friend with unruffled composure he referred the ladies one after another to mr cosway his name was stone the ladies decided that his nature was worthy of his name  the last resource left to our fair friends was to rouse the dormant interest of the men and to trust to the confidential intercourse of the smokingroom for the enlightenment which they had failed to obtain by other means  in the accomplishment of this purpose the degree of success which rewarded their efforts was due to a favoring state of affairs in the house the shooting was not good for much the billiardtable was under repair and there were but two really skilled whistplayers among the guests in the atmosphere of dullness thus engendered the men not only caught the infection of the womens curiosity but were even ready to listen to the gossip of the servants hall repeated to their mistresses by the ladies maids the result of such an essentially debased state of feeling as this was not slow in declaring itself but for a lucky accident mr cosway would have discovered to what extremities of illbred curiosity idleness and folly can lead persons holding the position of ladies and gentlemen when he joined the company at breakfast on the next morning  the newspapers came in before the guests had risen from the table sir peter handed one of them to the lady who sat on his right hand  she first looked it is needless to say at the list of births deaths and marriages and then she turned to the general newsthe fires accidents fashionable departures and so on in a few minutes she indignantly dropped the newspaper in her lap  here is another unfortunate man she exclaimed sacrificed to the stupidity of women if i had been in his place i would have used my knowledge of swimming to save myself and would have left the women to go to the bottom of the river as they deserved  a boat accident i suppose said sir peter  oh yesthe old story a gentleman takes two ladies out in a boat after a while they get fidgety and feel an idiotic impulse to change places the boat upsets as usual the poor dear man tries to save themand is drowned along with them for his pains shameful shameful  are the names mentioned  yes they are all strangers to me i speak on principle asserting herself in those words the indignant lady handed the newspaper to mr cosway who happened to sit next to her when you were in the navy she continued i dare say your life was put in jeopardy by taking women in boats read it yourself and let it be a warning to you for the future  mr cosway looked at the narrative of the accidentand revealed the romantic mystery of his life by a burst of devout exclamation expressed in the words  thank god my wifes drowned  ii  to declare that sir peter and his guests were all struck speechless by discovering in this way that mr cosway was a married man is to say very little the general impression appeared to be that he was mad his neighbors at the table all drew back from him with the one exception of his friend mr stone looked at the newspaper pressed mr cosways hand in silent sympathyand addressed himself to his host  permit me to make my friends apologies he said until he is composed enough to act for himself the circumstances are so extraordinary that i venture to think they excuse him will you allow us to speak to you privately  sir peter with more apologies addressed to his visitors opened the door which communicated with his study mr stone took mr cosways arm and led him out of the room he noticed no one spoke to no onehe moved mechanically like a man walking in his sleep  after an unendurable interval of nearly an hours duration sir peter returned alone to the breakfastroom mr cosway and mr stone had already taken their departure for london with their hosts entire approval  it is left to my discretion sir peter proceeded to repeat to you what i have heard in my study i will do so on one conditionthat you all consider yourselves bound in honor not to mention the true names and the real places when you tell the story to others  subject to this wise reservation the narrative is here repeated by one of the company considering how he may perform his task to the best advantage he finds that the events which preceded and followed mr cosways disastrous marriage resolve themselves into certain wellmarked divisions adopting this arrangement he proceeds to relate  the first epoch in mr cosways life  the sailing of her majestys ship albicore was deferred by the severe illness of the captain a gentleman not possessed of political influence might after the doctors unpromising report of him have been superseded by another commanding officer in the present case the lords of the admiralty showed themselves to be models of patience and sympathy they kept the vessel in port waiting the captains recovery  among the unimportant junior officers not wanted on board under these circumstances and favored accordingly by obtaining leave to wait for orders on shore were two young men aged respectively twentytwo and twentythree years and known by the names of cosway and stone the scene which now introduces them opens at a famous seaport on the south coast of england and discloses the two young gentlemen at dinner in a private room at their inn  i think that last bottle of champagne was corked cosway remarked lets try another youre nearest the bell stone ring  stone rang under protest he was the elder of the two by a year and he set an example of discretion  i am afraid we are running up a terrible bill he said we have been here more than three weeks  and we have denied ourselves nothing cosway added we have lived like princes another bottle of champagne waiter we have our ridinghorses and our carriage and the best box at the theater and such cigars as london itself could not produce i call that making the most of life try the new bottle glorious drink isnt it why doesnt my father have champagne at the family dinnertable  is your father a rich man cosway  i should say not he didnt give me anything like the money i expected when i said goodbyand i rather think he warned me solemnly at parting to take the greatest care of it theres not a farthing more for you he said till your ship returns from her south american station your father is a clergyman stone  well and what of that  and some clergymen are rich  my father is not one of them cosway  then let us say no more about him help yourself and pass the bottle  instead of adopting this suggestion stone rose with a very grave face and once more rang the bell ask the landlady to step up he said when the waiter appeared  what do you want with the landlady cosway inquired  i want the bill  the landladyotherwise mrs pounceentered the room she was short and old and fat and painted and a widow students of character as revealed in the face would have discovered malice and cunning in her bright black eyes and a bitter vindictive temper in the lines about her thin red lips incapable of such subtleties of analysis as these the two young officers differed widely nevertheless in their opinions of mrs pounce cosways reckless sense of humor delighted in pretending to be in love with her stone took a dislike to her from the first when his friend asked for the reason he made a strangely obscure answer do you remember that morning in the wood when you killed the snake he said i took a dislike to the snake cosway made no further inquiries  well my young heroes said mrs pounce always loud always cheerful and always familiar with her guests what do you want with me now  take a glass of champagne my darling said cosway and let me try if i can get my arm round your waist thats all i want with you  the landlady passed this over without notice though she had spoken to both of them her cunning little eyes rested on stone from the moment when she appeared in the room she knew by instinct the man who disliked herand she waited deliberately for stone to reply  we have been here some time he said and we shall be obliged maam if you will let us have our bill  mrs pounce lifted her eyebrows with an expression of innocent surprise  has the captain got well and must you go on board tonight she asked  nothing of the sort cosway interposed we have no news of the captain and we are going to the theater tonight  but persisted stone we want if you please to have the bill  certainly sir said mrs pounce with a sudden assumption of respect but we are very busy downstairs and we hope you will not press us for it tonight  of course not cried cosway  mrs pounce instantly left the room without waiting for any further remark from cosways friend  i wish we had gone to some other house said stone you mark my wordsthat woman means to cheat us  cosway expressed his dissent from this opinion in the most amiable manner he filled his friends glass and begged him not to say illnatured things of mrs pounce  but stones usually smooth temper seemed to be ruffled he insisted on his own view shes impudent and inquisitive if she is not downright dishonest he said what right had she to ask you where we lived when we were at home and what our christian names were and which of us was oldest you or i oh yesits all very well to say she only showed a flattering interest in us i suppose she showed a flattering interest in my affairs when i awoke a little earlier than usual and caught her in my bedroom with my pocketbook in her hand do you believe she was going to lock it up for safetys sake she knows how much money we have got as well as we know it ourselves every halfpenny we have will be in her pocket tomorrow and a good thing toowe shall be obliged to leave the house  even this cogent reasoning failed in provoking cosway to reply he took stones hat and handed it with the utmost politeness to his foreboding friend theres only one remedy for such a state of mind as yours he said come to the theater   at ten oclock the next morning cosway found himself alone at the breakfasttable he was informed that mr stone had gone out for a little walk and would be back directly seating himself at the table he perceived an envelope on his plate which evidently inclosed the bill he took up the envelope considered a little and put it back again unopened at the same moment stone burst into the room in a high state of excitement  news that will astonish you he cried the captain arrived yesterday evening his doctors say that the seavoyage will complete his recovery the ship sails todayand we are ordered to report ourselves on board in an hours time wheres the bill  cosway pointed to it stone took it out of the envelope  it covered two sides of a prodigiously long sheet of paper the sum total was brightly decorated with lines in red ink stone looked at the total and passed it in silence to cosway for once even cosway was prostrated in dreadful stillness the two young men produced their pocketbooks added up their joint stores of money and compared the result with the bill their united resources amounted to a little more than onethird of their debt to the landlady of the inn  the only alternative that presented itself was to send for mrs pounce to state the circumstances plainly and to propose a compromise on the grand commercial basis of credit  mrs pounce presented herself superbly dressed in walking costume was she going out or had she just returned to the inn not a word escaped her she waited gravely to hear what the gentlemen wanted cosway presuming on his position as favorite produced the contents of the two pocketbooks and revealed the melancholy truth  there is all the money we have he concluded we hope you will not object to receive the balance in a bill at three months  mrs pounce answered with a stern composure of voice and manner entirely new in the experience of cosway and stone  i have paid ready money gentlemen for the hire of your horses and carriages she said here are the receipts from the livery stables to vouch for me i never accept bills unless i am quite sure beforehand that they will be honored i defy you to find an overcharge in the account now rendered and i expect you to pay it before you leave my house  stone looked at his watch  in threequarters of an hour he said we must be on board  mrs pounce entirely agreed with him and if you are not on board she remarked you will be tried by courtmartial and dismissed the service with your characters ruined for life  my dear creature we havent time to send home and we know nobody in the town pleaded cosway for gods sake take our watches and jewelry and our luggageand let us go  i am not a pawnbroker said the inflexible lady you must either pay your lawful debt to me in honest money or  she paused and looked at cosway her fat face brightenedshe smiled graciously for the first time  cosway stared at her in unconcealed perplexity he helplessly repeated her last words we must either pay the bill he said or what  or answered mrs pounce one of you must marry me  was she joking was she intoxicated was she out of her senses neither of the three she was in perfect possession of herself her explanation was a model of lucid and convincing arrangement of facts  my position here has its drawbacks she began i am a lone widow i am known to have an excellent business and to have saved money the result is that i am pestered to death by a set of needy vagabonds who want to marry me in this position i am exposed to slanders and insults even if i didnt know that the men were after my money there is not one of them whom i would venture to marry he might turn out a tyrant and beat me or a drunkard and disgrace me or a betting man and ruin me what i want you see for my own peace and protection is to be able to declare myself married and to produce the proof in the shape of a certificate a born gentleman with a character to lose and so much younger in years than myself that he wouldnt think of living with methere is the sort of husband who suits my book im a reasonable woman gentlemen i would undertake to part with my husband at the church doornever to attempt to see him or write to him afterwardand only to show my certificate when necessary without giving any explanations your secret would be quite safe in my keeping i dont care a straw for either of you so long as you answer my purpose what do you say to paying my bill one or the other of you in this way i am ready dressed for the altar and the clergyman has notice at the church my preference is for mr cosway proceeded this terrible woman with the cruelest irony because he has been so particular in his attentions toward me the license which i provided on the chance a fortnight since is made out in his name such is my weakness for mr cosway but that dont matter if mr stone would like to take his place he can hail by his friends name oh yes he can i have consulted my lawyer so long as the bride and bridegroom agree to it they may be married in any name they like and it stands good look at your watch again mr stone the church is in the next street by my calculation you have just got five minutes to decide im a punctual woman my little dears and i will be back to the moment  she opened the door paused and returned to the room  i ought to have mentioned she resumed that i shall make you a present of the bill receipted on the conclusion of the ceremony you will be taken to the ship in my own boat with all your money in your pockets and a hamper of good things for the mess after that i wash my hands of you you may go to the devil your own way  with this parting benediction she left them  caught in the landladys trap the two victims looked at each other in expressive silence without time enough to take legal advice without friends on shore without any claim on officers of their own standing in the ship the prospect before them was literally limited to marriage or ruin stone made a proposal worthy of a hero  one of us must marry her he said im ready to toss up for it  cosway matched him in generosity no he answered it was i who brought you here and i who led you into these infernal expenses i ought to pay the penaltyand i will  before stone could remonstrate the five minutes expired punctual mrs pounce appeared again in the doorway  well she inquired which is it to becosway or stone  cosway advanced as reckless as ever and offered his arm  now then fatsides he said come and be married  in fiveandtwenty minutes more mrs pounce had become mrs cosway and the two officers were on their way to the ship   the second epoch in mr cosways life  four years elapsed before the albicore returned to the port from which she had sailed  in that interval the death of cosways parents had taken place the lawyer who had managed his affairs during his absence from england wrote to inform him that his inheritance from his late fathers estate was eight hundred a year his mother only possessed a life interest in her fortune she had left her jewels to her son and that was all  cosways experience of the life of a naval officer on foreign stations without political influence to hasten his promotion had thoroughly disappointed him he decided on retiring from the service when the ship was paid off in the meantime to the astonishment of his comrades he seemed to be in no hurry to make use of the leave granted him to go on shore the faithful stone was the only man on board who knew that he was afraid of meeting his wife this good friend volunteered to go to the inn and make the necessary investigation with all needful prudence four years is a long time at her age he said many things may happen in four years  an hour later stone returned to the ship and sent a written message on board addressed to his brotherofficer in these words pack up your things at once and join me on shore  what news asked the anxious husband  stone looked significantly at the idlers on the landingplace wait he said till we are by ourselves  where are we going  to the railway station  they got into an empty carriage and stone at once relieved his friend of all further suspense  nobody is acquainted with the secret of your marriage but our two selves he began quietly i dont think cosway you need go into mourning  you dont mean to say shes dead  i have seen a letter written by her own lawyer which announces her death stone replied it was so short that i believe i can repeat it word for word dear siri have received information of the death of my client please address your next and last payment on account of the lease and goodwill of the inn to the executors of the late mrs cosway there that is the letter dear sir means the present proprietor of the inn he told me your wifes previous history in two words after carrying on the business with her customary intelligence for more than three years her health failed and she went to london to consult a physician there she remained under the doctors care the next event was the appearance of an agent instructed to sell the business in consequence of the landladys declining health add the death at a later timeand there is the beginning and the end of the story fortune owed you a good turn coswayand fortune has paid the debt accept my best congratulations  arrived in london stone went on at once to his relations in the north cosway proceeded to the office of the family lawyer mr atherton who had taken care of his interests in his absence his father and mr atherton had been schoolfellows and old friends he was affectionately received and was invited to pay a visit the next day to the lawyers villa at richmond  you will be near enough to london to attend to your business at the admiralty said mr atherton and you will meet a visitor at my house who is one of the most charming girls in englandthe only daughter of the great mr restall good heavens have you never heard of him my dear sir hes one of the partners in the famous firm of benshaw restall and benshaw  cosway was wise enough to accept this last piece of information as quite conclusive the next day mrs atherton presented him to the charming miss restall and mrs athertons young married daughter who had been his playfellow when they were children whispered to him half in jest half in earnest make the best use of your time she isnt engaged yet  cosway shuddered inwardly at the bare idea of a second marriage was miss restall the sort of woman to restore his confidence  she was small and slim and darka graceful wellbred brightly intelligent person with a voice exquisitely sweet and winning in tone her ears hands and feet were objects to worship and she had an attraction irresistibly rare among the women of the present timethe attraction of a perfectly natural smile before cosway had been an hour in the house she discovered that his long term of service on foreign stations had furnished him with subjects of conversation which favorably contrasted with the commonplace gossip addressed to her by other men cosway at once became a favorite as othello became a favorite in his day  the ladies of the household all rejoiced in the young officers success with the exception of miss restalls companion supposed to hold the place of her lost mother at a large salary one mrs margery  too cautious to commit herself in words this lady expressed doubt and disapprobation by her looks she had white hair irongray eyebrows and protuberant eyes her looks were unusually expressive one evening she caught poor mr atherton alone and consulted him confidentially on the subject of mr cosways income this was the first warning which opened the eyes of the good lawyer to the nature of the friendship already established between his two guests he knew miss restalls illustrious father well and he feared that it might soon be his disagreeable duty to bring cosways visit to an end  on a certain saturday afternoon while mr atherton was still considering how he could most kindly and delicately suggest to cosway that it was time to say goodby an empty carriage arrived at the villa a note from mr restall was delivered to mrs atherton thanking her with perfect politeness for her kindness to his daughter circumstances he added rendered it necessary that miss restall should return home that afternoon  the circumstances were supposed to refer to a gardenparty to be given by mr restall in the ensuing week but why was his daughter wanted at home before the day of the party  the ladies of the family still devoted to cosways interests entertained no doubt that mrs margery had privately communicated with mr restall and that the appearance of the carriage was the natural result mrs athertons married daughter did all that could be done she got rid of mrs margery for one minute and so arranged it that cosway and miss restall took leave of each other in her own sittingroom  when the young lady appeared in the hall she had drawn her veil down cosway escaped to the road and saw the last of the carriage as it drove away in a little more than a fortnight his horror of a second marriage had become one of the dead and buried emotions of his nature he stayed at the villa until monday morning as an act of gratitude to his good friends and then accompanied mr atherton to london business at the admiralty was the excuse it imposed on nobody he was evidently on his way to miss restall  leave your business in my hands said the lawyer on the journey to town and go and amuse yourself on the continent i cant blame you for falling in love with miss restall i ought to have foreseen the danger and waited till she had left us before i invited you to my house but i may at least warn you to carry the matter no further if you had eight thousand instead of eight hundred a year mr restall would think it an act of presumption on your part to aspire to his daughters hand unless you had a title to throw into the bargain look at it in the true light my dear boy and one of these days you will thank me for speaking plainly  cosway promised to look at it in the true light  the result from his point of view led him into a change of residence he left his hotel and took a lodging in the nearest bystreet to mr restalls palace at kensington  on the same evening he applied with the confidence due to a previous arrangement for a letter at the neighboring postoffice addressed to e cthe initials of edwin cosway pray be careful miss restall wrote i have tried to get you a card for our garden party but that hateful creature margery has evidently spoken to my father i am not trusted with any invitation cards bear it patiently dear as i do and let me hear if you have succeeded in finding a lodging near us  not submitting to this first disappointment very patiently cosway sent his reply to the postoffice addressed to a rthe initials of adela restall the next day the impatient lover applied for another letter it was waiting for him but it was not directed in adelas handwriting had their correspondence been discovered he opened the letter in the street and read with amazement these lines  dear mr cosway my heart sympathizes with two faithful lovers in spite of my age and my duty i inclose an invitation to the party tomorrow pray dont betray me and dont pay too marked attention to adela discretion is easy there will be twelve hundred guests your friend in spite of appearances louisa margery  how infamously they had all misjudged this excellent woman cosway went to the party a grateful as well as a happy man the first persons known to him whom he discovered among the crowd of strangers were the athertons they looked as well they might astonished to see him fidelity to mrs margery forbade him to enter into any explanations where was that best and truest friend with some difficulty he succeeded in finding her was there any impropriety in seizing her hand and cordially pressing it the result of this expression of gratitude was to say the least of it perplexing  mrs margery behaved like the athertons she looked astonished to see him and she put precisely the same question how did you get here cosway could only conclude that she was joking who should know that dear lady better than yourself he rejoined i dont understand you mrs margery answered sharply after a moments reflection cosway hit on another solution of the mystery visitors were near them and mrs margery had made her own private use of one of mr restalls invitation cards she might have serious reasons for pushing caution to its last extreme cosway looked at her significantly the least i can do is not to be indiscreet he whisperedand left her  he turned into a side walk and there he met adela at last  it seemed like a fatality she looked astonished and she said how did you get here no intrusive visitors were within hearing this time my dear cosway remonstrated mrs margery must have told you when she sent me my invitation adela turned pale mrs margery she repeated mrs margery has said nothing to me mrs margery detests you we must have this cleared up no not nowi must attend to our guests expect a letter and for heavens sake edwin keep out of my fathers way one of our visitors whom he particularly wished to see has sent an excuseand he is dreadfully angry about it  she left him before cosway could explain that he and mr restall had thus far never seen each other  he wandered away toward the extremity of the grounds troubled by vague suspicions hurt at adelas cold reception of him entering a shrubbery which seemed intended to screen the grounds at this point from a lane outside he suddenly discovered a pretty little summerhouse among the trees a stout gentleman of mature years was seated alone in this retreat he looked up with a frown cosway apologized for disturbing him and entered into conversation as an act of politeness  a brilliant assembly today sir  the stout gentleman replied by an inarticulate soundsomething between a grunt and a cough  and a splendid house and grounds cosway continued  the stout gentleman repeated the inarticulate sound  cosway began to feel amused was this curious old man deaf and dumb  excuse my entering into conversation he persisted i feel like a stranger here there are so many people whom i dont know  the stout gentleman suddenly burst into speech cosway had touched a sympathetic fiber at last  there are a good many people here whom i dont know he said gruffly you are one of them whats your name  my name is cosway sir whats yours  the stout gentleman rose with fury in his looks he burst out with an oath and added the in tolerable question already three times repeated by others how did you get here the tone was even more offensive than the oath your age protects you sir said cosway with the loftiest composure im sorry i gave my name to so rude a person  rude shouted the old gentleman you want my name in return i suppose you young puppy you shall have it my name is restall  he turned his back and walked off cosway took the only course now open to him he returned to his lodgings  the next day no letter reached him from adela he went to the postoffice no letter was there the day wore on to eveningand with the evening there appeared a woman who was a stranger to him she looked like a servant and she was the bearer of a mysterious message  please be at the gardendoor that opens on the lane at ten oclock tomorrow morning knock three times at the doorand then say adela some one who wishes you well will be alone in the shrubbery and will let you in no sir i am not to take anything and i am not to say a word more she spokeand vanished  cosway was punctual to his appointment he knocked three times he pronounced miss restalls christian name nothing happened he waited a while and tried again this time adelas voice answered strangely from the shrubbery in tones of surprise edwin is it really you  did you expect any one else cosway asked my darling your message said ten oclockand here i am  the door was suddenly unlocked  i sent no message said adela as they confronted each other on the threshold  in the silence of utter bewilderment they went together into the summerhouse at adelas request cosway repeated the message that he had received and described the woman who had delivered it the description applied to no person known to miss restall mrs margery never sent you the invitation and i repeat i never sent you the message this meeting has been arranged by some one who knows that i always walk in the shrubbery after breakfast there is some underhand work going on  still mentally in search of the enemy who had betrayed them she checked herself and considered a little is it possible she began and paused again her eyes filled with tears my mind is so completely upset she said that i cant think clearly of anything oh edwin we have had a happy dream and it has come to an end my father knows more than we think for some friends of ours are going abroad tomorrowand i am to go with them nothing i can say has the least effect upon my father he means to part us foreverand this is his cruel way of doing it  she put her arm round cosways neck and lovingly laid her head on his shoulder with tenderest kisses they reiterated their vows of eternal fidelity until their voices faltered and failed them cosway filled up the pause by the only useful suggestion which it was now in his power to makehe proposed an elopement  adela received this bold solution of the difficulty in which they were placed exactly as thousands of other young ladies have received similar proposals before her time and after  she first said positively no cosway persisted she began to cry and asked if he had no respect for her cosway declared that his respect was equal to any sacrifice except the sacrifice of parting with her forever he could and would if she preferred it die for her but while he was alive he must refuse to give her up upon this she shifted her ground did he expect her to go away with him alone certainly not her maid could go with her or if her maid was not to be trusted he would apply to his landlady and engage a respectable elderly person to attend on her until the day of their marriage would she have some mercy on him and just consider it no she was afraid to consider it did she prefer misery for the rest of her life never mind his happiness it was her happiness only that he had in his mind traveling with unsympathetic people absent from england no one could say for how long married when she did return to some rich man whom she hatedwould she could she contemplate that prospect she contemplated it through tears she contemplated it to an accompaniment of sighs kisses and protestationsshe trembled hesitated gave way at an appointed hour of the coming night when her father would be in the smokingroom and mrs margery would be in bed cosway was to knock at the door in the lane once more leaving time to make all the necessary arrangements in the interval  the one pressing necessity under these circumstances was to guard against the possibility of betrayal and surprise cosway discreetly alluded to the unsolved mysteries of the invitation and the message have you taken anybody into our confidence he asked  adela answered with some embarrassment only one person she saiddear miss benshaw  who is miss benshaw  dont you really know edwin she is richer even than papashe has inherited from her late brother one halfshare in the great business in the city miss benshaw is the lady who disappointed papa by not coming to the gardenparty you remember dear how happy we were when we were together at mr athertons i was very miserable when they took me away miss benshaw happened to call the next day and she noticed it my dear she said miss benshaw is quite an elderly lady now i am an old maid who has missed the happiness of her life through not having had a friend to guide and advise her when she was young are you suffering as i once suffered she spoke so nicelyand i was so wretchedthat i really couldnt help it i opened my heart to her  cosway looked grave are you sure she is to be trusted he asked  perfectly sure  perhaps my love she has spoken about us not meaning any harm to some friend of hers old ladies are so fond of gossip its just possibledont you think so  adela hung her head  i have thought it just possible myself she admitted there is plenty of time to call on her today i will set our doubts at rest before miss benshaw goes out for her afternoon drive  on that understanding they parted  toward evening cosways arrangements for the elopement were completed he was eating his solitary dinner when a note was brought to him it had been left at the door by a messenger the man had gone away without waiting for an answer the note ran thus  miss benshaw presents her compliments to mr cosway and will be obliged if he can call on her at nine oclock this evening on business which concerns himself  this invitation was evidently the result of adelas visit earlier in the day cosway presented himself at the house troubled by natural emotions of anxiety and suspense his reception was not of a nature to compose him he was shown into a darkened room the one lamp on the table was turned down low and the little light thus given was still further obscured by a shade the corners of the room were in almost absolute darkness  a voice out of one of the corners addressed him in a whisper  i must beg you to excuse the darkened room i am suffering from a severe cold my eyes are inflamed and my throat is so bad that i can only speak in a whisper sit down sir i have got news for you  not bad news i hope maam cosway ventured to inquire  the worst possible news said the whispering voice you have an enemy striking at you in the dark  cosway asked who it was and received no answer he varied the form of inquiry and asked why the unnamed person struck at him in the dark the experiment succeeded he obtained a reply  it is reported to me said miss benshaw that the person thinks it necessary to give you a lesson and takes a spiteful pleasure in doing it as mischievously as possible the person as i happen to know sent you your invitation to the party and made the appointment which took you to the door in the lane wait a little sir i have not done yet the person has put it into mr restalls head to send his daughter abroad tomorrow  cosway attempted to make her speak more plainly  is this wretch a man or a woman he said  miss benshaw proceeded without noticing the interruption  you neednt be afraid mr cosway miss restall will not leave england your enemy is allpowerful your enemys object could only be to provoke you into planning an elopementand your arrangements once completed to inform mr restall and to part you and miss adela quite as effectually as if you were at opposite ends of the world oh you will undoubtedly be parted spiteful isnt it and what is worse the mischief is as good as done already  cosway rose from his chair  do you wish for any further explanation asked miss benshaw  one thing more he replied does adela know of this  no said miss benshaw it is left to you to tell her  there was a moment of silence cosway looked at the lamp once roused as usual with men of his character his temper was not to be trifled with  miss benshaw he said i dare say you think me a fool but i can draw my own conclusion for all that you are my enemy  the only reply was a chuckling laugh all voices can be more or less effectually disguised by a whisper but a laugh carries the revelation of its own identity with it cosway suddenly threw off the shade over the lamp and turned up the wick  the light flooded the room and showed himhis wife   the third epoch in mr cosways life  three days had passed cosway sat alone in his lodgingpale and worn the shadow already of his former self  he had not seen adela since the discovery there was but one way in which he could venture to make the inevitable disclosurehe wrote to her and mr athertons daughter took care that the letter should be received inquiries made afterward by help of the same good friend informed him that miss restall was suffering from illness  the mistress of the house came in  cheer up sir said the good woman there is better news of miss restall today  he raised his head  dont trifle with me he answered fretfully tell me exactly what the servant said  the mistress repeated the words miss restall had passed a quieter night and had been able for a few hours to leave her room he asked next if any reply to his letter had arrived no reply had been received  if adela definitely abstained from writing to him the conclusion would be too plain to be mistaken she had given him upand who could blame her  there was a knock at the streetdoor the mistress looked out  heres mr stone come back sir she exclaimed joyfullyand hurried away to let him in  cosway never looked up when his friend appeared  i knew i should succeed said stone i have seen your wife  dont speak of her cried cosway i should have murdered her when i saw her face if i had not instantly left the house i may be the death of the wretch yet if you presist in speaking of her  stone put his hand kindly on his friends shoulder  must i remind you that you owe something to your old comrade he asked i left my father and mother the morning i got your letterand my one thought has been to serve you reward me be a man and hear what is your right and duty to know after that if you like we will never refer to the woman again  cosway took his hand in silent acknowledgment that he was right they sat down together stone began  she is so entirely shameless he said that i had no difficulty in getting her to speak and she so cordially hates you that she glories in her own falsehood and treachery  of course she lies cosway said bitterly when she calls herself miss benshaw  no she is really the daughter of the man who founded the great house in the city with every advantage that wealth and position could give her the perverse creature married one of her fathers clerks who had been deservedly dismissed from his situation from that moment her family discarded her with the money procured by the sale of her jewels her husband took the inn which we have such bitter cause to rememberand she managed the house after his death so much for the past carry your mind on now to the time when our ship brought us back to england at that date the last surviving member of your wifes familyher elder brotherlay at the point of death he had taken his fathers place in the business besides inheriting his fathers fortune after a happy married life he was left a widower without children and it became necessary that he should alter his will he deferred performing his duty it was only at the time of his last illness that he had dictated instructions for a new will leaving his wealth excepting certain legacies to old friends to the hospitals of great britain and ireland his lawyer lost no time in carrying out the instructions the new will was ready for signature the old will having been destroyed by his own hand when the doctors sent a message to say that their patient was insensible and might die in that condition  did the doctors prove to be right  perfectly right our wretched landlady as next of kin succeeded not only to the fortune but under the deed of partnership to her late brothers place in the firm on the one easy condition of resuming the family name she calls herself miss benshaw but as a matter of legal necessity she is set down in the deed as mrs cosway benshaw her partners only now know that her husband is living and that you are the cosway whom she privately married will you take a little breathing time or shall i go on and get done with it  cosway signed to him to go on  she doesnt in the least care stone proceeded for the exposure i am the head partner she says and the rich one of the firm they darent turn their backs on me you remember the information i receivedin perfect good faith on his partfrom the man who keeps the inn the visit to the london doctor and the assertion of failing health were adopted as the best means of plausibly severing the ladys connection the great lady now with a calling so unworthy of her as the keeping of an inn her neighbors at the seaport were all deceived by the stratagem with two exceptions they were both menvagabonds who had pertinaciously tried to delude her into marrying them in the days when she was a widow they refused to believe in the doctor and the declining health they had their own suspicion of the motives which had led to the sale of the inn under very unfavorable circumstances and they decided on going to london inspired by the same base hope of making discoveries which might be turned into a means of extorting money  she escaped them of course said cosway how  by the help of her lawyer who was not above accepting a handsome private fee he wrote to the new landlord of the inn falsely announcing his clients death in the letter which i repeated to you in the railway carriage on our journey to london other precautions were taken to keep up the deception on which it is needless to dwell your natural conclusion that you were free to pay your addresses to miss restall and the poor young ladys innocent confidence in miss benshaws sympathy gave this unscrupulous woman the means of playing the heartless trick on you which is now exposed malice and jealousyi have it mind from herselfwere not her only motives but for that cosway she said i spare you the epithet which she put before your name with my money and position i might have married a needy lord and sunned myself in my old age in the full blaze of the peerage do you understand how she hated you now enough of the subject the moral of it my dear cosway is to leave this place and try what change of scene will do for you i have time to spare and i will go abroad with you when shall it be  let me wait a day or two more cosway pleaded  stone shook his head still hoping my poor friend for a line from miss restall you distress me  i am sorry to distress you stone if i can get one pitying word from her i can submit to the miserable life that lies before me  are you not expecting too much  you wouldnt say so if you were as fond of her as i am  they were silent the evening slowly darkened and the mistress came in as usual with the candles she brought with her a letter for cosway  he tore it open read it in an instant and devoured it with kisses his highly wrought feelings found their vent in a little allowable exaggeration she has saved my life he said as he handed the letter to stone  it only contained these lines  my love is yours my promise is yours through all trouble through all profanation through the hopeless separation that may be before us in this world i live yoursand die yours my edwin god bless and comfort you   the fourth epoch in mr cosways life  the separation had lasted for nearly two years when cosway and stone paid that visit to the country house which is recorded at the outset of the present narrative in the interval nothing had been heard of miss restall except through mr atherton he reported that adela was leading a very quiet life the one remarkable event had been an interview between miss benshaw and herself no other person had been present but the little that was reported placed miss restalls character above all praise she had forgiven the woman who had so cruelly injured her  the two friends it may be remembered had traveled to london immediately after completing the fullest explanation of cosways startling behavior at the breakfasttable stone was not by nature a sanguine man i dont believe in our luck he said let us be quite sure that we are not the victims of another deception  the accident had happened on the thames and the newspaper narrative proved to be accurate in every respect stone personally attended the inquest from a natural feeling of delicacy toward adela cosway hesitated to write to her on the subject the everhelpful stone wrote in his place  after some delay the answer was received it inclosed a brief statement communicated officially by legal authority of the last act of malice on the part of the late headpartner in the house of benshaw and company she had not died intestate like her brother the first clause of her will contained the testators grateful recognition of adela restalls christian act of forgiveness the second clause after stating that there were neither relatives nor children to be benefited by the will left adela restall mistress of mrs cosway benshaws fortuneon the one merciless condition that she did not marry edwin cosway the third clauseif adela restall violated the conditionhanded over the whole of the money to the firm in the city for the extension of the business and the benefit of the surviving partners  some months later adela came of age to the indignation of mr restall and the astonishment of the company the money actually went to the firm the fourth epoch in mr cosways life witnessed his marriage to a woman who cheerfully paid half a million of money for the happiness of passing her life on eight hundred a year with the man whom she loved  but cosway felt bound in gratitude to make a rich woman of his wife if work and resolution could do it when stone last heard of him he was reading for the bar and mr atherton was ready to give him his first brief  notethat most improbable part of the present narrative which is contained in the division called the first epoch is founded on an adventure which actually occurred to no less a person than a cousin of sir walter scott in lockharts delightful life the anecdote will be found as told by sir walter to captain basil hall the remainder of the present story is entirely imaginary the writer wondered what such a woman as the landlady would do under certain given circumstances after her marriage to the young midshipmanand here is the result      mr medhurst and the princess  i  the day before i left london to occupy the post of second secretary of legation at a small german court i took leave of my excellent french singingmaster monsieur bonnefoy and of his young and pretty daughter named jeanne  our farewell interview was saddened by monsieur bonnefoys family anxieties his elder brother known in the household as uncle david had been secretly summoned to paris by order of a republican society anxious relations in london whether reasonably or not i am unable to say were in some fear of the political consequences that might follow  at parting i made mademoiselle jeanne a present in the shape of a plain gold brooch for some time past i had taken my lessons at monsieur bonnefoys house his daughter and i often sang together under his direction seeing much of jeanne under these circumstances the little gift that i had offered to her was only the natural expression of a true interest in her welfare idle rumor assertedquite falselythat i was in love with her i was sincerely the young ladys friend no more no less  having alluded to my lessons in singing it may not be out of place to mention the circumstances under which i became monsieur bonnefoys pupil and to allude to the change in my life that followed in due course of time  our family propertyexcepting the sum of five thousand pounds left to me by my motheris landed property strictly entailed the estates were inherited by my only brother lord medhurst the kindest the best and i grieve to say it the unhappiest of men he lived separated from a bad wife he had no children to console him and he only enjoyed at rare intervals the blessing of good health having myself nothing to live on but the interest of my mothers little fortune i had to make my own way in the world poor younger sons not possessed of the commanding ability which achieves distinction find the roads that lead to prosperity closed to them with one exception they can always apply themselves to the social arts which make a man agreeable in society i had naturally a good voice and i cultivated it i was ready to sing without being subject to the wretched vanity which makes objections and excusesi pleased the ladiesthe ladies spoke favorably of me to their husbandsand some of their husbands were persons of rank and influence after no very long lapse of time the result of this combination of circumstances declared itself monsieur bonnefoys lessons became the indirect means of starting me on a diplomatic careerand the diplomatic career made poor ernest medhurst to his own unutterable astonishment the hero of a love story  the story being true i must beg to be excused if i abstain from mentioning names places and dates when i enter on german ground let it be enough to say that i am writing of a bygone year in the present century when no such thing as a german empire existed and when the revolutionary spirit of france was still an object of wellfounded suspicion to tyrants by right divine on the continent of europe  ii  on joining the legation i was not particularly attracted by my chief the minister his manners were oppressively polite and his sense of his own importance was not sufficiently influenced by diplomatic reserve i venture to describe him mentally speaking as an empty man carefully trained to look full on public occasions  my colleague the first secretary was a far more interesting person bright unaffected and agreeable he at once interested me when we were introduced to each other i pay myself a compliment as i consider when i add that he became my firm and true friend  we took a walk together in the palace gardens on the evening of my arrival reaching a remote part of the grounds we were passed by a lean sallow sourlooking old man drawn by a servant in a chair on wheels my companion stopped whispered to me here is the prince and bowed bareheaded i followed his example as a matter of course the prince feebly returned our salutation is he ill i asked when we had put our hats on again  shakespeare the secretary replied tells us that one man in his time plays many parts under what various aspects the princes character may have presented itself in his younger days i am not able to tell you since i have been here he has played the part of a martyr to illness misunderstood by his doctors  and his daughter the princesswhat do you say of her  ah she is not so easily described i can only appeal to your memory of other women like her whom you must often have seenwomen who are tall and fair and fragile and elegant who have delicate aquiline noses and melting blue eyeswomen who have often charmed you by their tender smiles and their supple graces of movement as for the character of this popular young lady i must not influence you either way study it for yourself  without a hint to guide me  with a suggestion he replied which may be worth considering if you wish to please the princess begin by endeavoring to win the good graces of the baroness  who is the baroness  one of the ladies in waitingbosom friend of her highness and chosen repository of all her secrets personally not likely to attract you short and fat and illtempered and ugly just at this time i happen myself to get on with her better than usual we have discovered that we possess one sympathy in commonwe are the only people at court who dont believe in the princes new doctor  is the new doctor a quack  the secretary looked round before he answered to see that nobody was near us  it strikes me he said that the doctor is a spy mind i have no right to speak of him in that way it is only my impressionand i ought to add that appearances are all in his favor he is in the service of our nearest royal neighbor the grand duke and he has been sent here expressly to relieve the sufferings of the dukes good friend and brother our invalid prince this is an honorable mission no doubt and the man himself is handsome wellbred and i dont quite know whether this is an additional recommendation a countryman of ours nevertheless i doubt him and the baroness doubts him you are an independent witness i shall be anxious to hear if your opinion agrees with ours  i was presented at court toward the end of the week and in the course of the next two or three days i more than once saw the doctor the impression that he produced on me surprised my colleague it was my opinion that he and the baroness had mistaken the character of a worthy and capable man  the secretary obstinately adhered to his own view  wait a little he answered and we shall see  he was quite right we did see  iii  but the princessthe gentle gracious beautiful princesswhat can i say of her highness  i can only say that she enchanted me  i had been a little discouraged by the reception that i met with from her father strictly confining himself within the limits of politeness he bade me welcome to his court in the fewest possible words and then passed me by without further notice he afterward informed the english minister that i had been so unfortunate as to try his temper your new secretary irritates me sirhe is a person in an offensively perfect state of health the princes charming daughter was not of her fathers way of thinking it is impossible to say how graciously how sweetly i was received she honored me by speaking to me in my own language of which she showed herself to be a perfect mistress i was not only permitted but encouraged to talk of my family and to dwell on my own tastes amusements and pursuits even when her highnesss attention was claimed by other persons waiting to be presented i was not forgotten the baroness was instructed to invite me for the next evening to the princesss teatable and it was hinted that i should be especially welcome if i brought my music with me and sang  my friend the secretary standing near us at the time looked at me with a mysterious smile he had suggested that i should make advances to the baronessand here was the baroness under royal instructions making advances to me  we know what that means he whispered  in justice to myself i must declare that i entirely failed to understand him  on the occasion of my second reception by the princess at her little evening party i detected the baroness more than once in the act of watching her highness and myself with an appearance of disapproval in her manner which puzzled me when i had taken my leave she followed me out of the room  i have a word of advice to give you she said the best thing you can do sir is to make an excuse to your minister and go back to england  i declare again that i entirely failed to understand the baroness  iv  before the season came to an end the court removed to the princes countryseat in the interests of his highnesss health entertainments were given at the doctors suggestion with a view of raising the patients depressed spirits the members of the english legation were among the guests invited to me it was a delightful visit i had again every reason to feel gratefully sensible of the princesss condescending kindness meeting the secretary one day in the library i said that i thought her a perfect creature was this an absurd remark to make i could see nothing absurd in itand yet my friend burst out laughing  my good fellow nobody is a perfect creature he said the princess has her faults and failings like the rest of us  i denied it positively  use your eyes he went on and you will see for example that she is shallow and frivolous yesterday was a day of rain we were all obliged to employ ourselves somehow indoors didnt you notice that she had no resources in herself she cant even read  there you are wrong at any rate i declared i saw her reading the newspaper  you saw her with the newspaper in her hand if you had not been deaf and blind to her defects you would have noticed that she couldnt fix her attention on it she was always ready to join in the chatter of the ladies about her when even their stores of gossip were exhausted she let the newspaper drop on her lap and sat in vacant idleness smiling at nothing  i reminded him that she might have met with a dull number of the newspaper he took no notice of this unanswerable reply  you were talking the other day of her warmth of feeling he proceeded she has plenty of sentiment german sentiment i grant you but no true feeling what happened only this morning when the prince was in the breakfastroom and when the princess and her ladies were dressed to go out riding even she noticed the wretchedly depressed state of her fathers spirits a man of that hypochondriacal temperament suffers acutely though he may only fancy himself to be ill the princess overflowed with sympathy but she never proposed to stay at home and try to cheer the old man her filial duty was performed to her own entire satisfaction when she had kissed her hand to the prince the moment after she was out of the roomeager to enjoy her ride we all heard her laughing gayly among the ladies in the hall  i could have answered this also if our discussion had not been interrupted at the moment the doctor came into the library in search of a book when he had left us my colleagues strong prejudice against him instantly declared itself  be on your guard with that man he said  why i asked  havent you noticed he replied that when the princess is talking to you the doctor always happens to be in that part of the room  what does it matter where the doctor is  my friend looked at me with an oddly mingled expression of doubt and surprise do you really not understand me he said  i dont indeed  my dear ernest you are a rare and admirable example to the rest of usyou are a truly modest man  what did he mean  v  events followed on the next day which as will presently be seen i have a personal interest in relating  the baroness left us suddenly on leave of absence the prince wearied of his residence in the country and the court returned to the capital the charming princess was reported to be indisposed and retired to the seclusion of her own apartments  a week later i received a note f rom the baroness marked private and confidential it informed me that she had resumed her duties as ladyinwaiting and that she wished to see me at my earliest convenience i obeyed at once and naturally asked if there were better accounts of her highnesss health  the baronesss reply a little surprised me she said the princess is perfectly well  recovered already i exclaimed  she has never been ill the baroness answered her indisposition was a sham forced on her by me in her own interests her reputation is in peril and youyou hateful englishmanare the cause of it  not feeling disposed to put up with such language as this even when it was used by a lady i requested that she would explain herself she complied without hesitation in another minute my eyes were opened to the truth i knewno that is too positivelet me say i had reason to believe that the princess loved me  it is simply impossible to convey to the minds of others any idea of the emotions that overwhelmed me at that critical moment of my life i was in a state of confusion at the time and when my memory tries to realize it i am in a state of confusion now the one thing i can do is to repeat what the baroness said to me when i had in some degree recovered my composure  i suppose you are aware she began of the disgrace to which the princesss infatuation exposes her if it is discovered on my own responsibility i repeat what i said to you a short time since do you refuse to leave this place immediately  does the man live honored as i was who would have hesitated to refuse find him if you can  very well she resumed as the friend of the princess i have no choice now but to take things as they are and to make the best of them let us realize your position to begin with if you were like your elder brother a nobleman possessed of vast estates my royal mistress might be excused as it is whatever you may be in the future you are nothing now but an obscure young man without fortune or title do you see your duty to the princess or must i explain it to you  i saw my duty as plainly as she did her highnesss secret is a sacred secret i said i am bound to shrink from no sacrifice which may preserve it  the baroness smiled maliciously i may have occasion she answered to remind you of what you have just said in the meanwhile the princesss secret is in danger of discovery  by her father  no by the doctor  at first i doubted whether she was in jest or in earnest the next instant i remembered that the secretary had expressly cautioned me against that man  it is evidently one of your virtues the baroness proceeded to be slow to suspect prepare yourself for a disagreeable surprise the doctor has been watching the princess on every occasion when she speaks to you with some object of his own in view during my absence young sir i have been engaged in discovering what that object is my excellent mother lives at the court of the grand duke and enjoys the confidence of his ministers he is still a bachelor and in the interests of the succession to the throne the time has arrived when he must marry with my mothers assistance i have found out that the doctors medical errand here is a pretense influenced by the princesss beauty the grand duke has thought of her first as his future duchess whether he has heard slanderous stories or whether he is only a cautious man i cant tell you but this i know he has instructed his physicianif he had employed a professed diplomatist his motive might have been suspectedto observe her highness privately and to communicate the result the object of the report is to satisfy the duke that the princesss reputation is above the reach of scandal that she is free from entanglements of a certain kind and that she is in every respect a person to whom he can with propriety offer his hand in marriage the doctor mr ernest is not disposed to allow you to prevent him from sending in a favorable report he has drawn his conclusions from the princesss extraordinary kindness to the second secretary of the english legation and he is only waiting for a little plainer evidence to communicate his suspicions to the prince it rests with you to save the princess  only tell me how i am to do it i said  there is but one way of doing it she answered and that way has comically enough been suggested to me by the doctor himself  her tone and manner tried my patience  come to the point i said  she seemed to enjoy provoking me  no hurry mr ernestno hurry you shall be fully enlightened if you will only wait a little the prince i must tell you believes in his daughters indisposition when he visited her this morning he was attended by his medical adviser i was present at the interview to do him justice the doctor is worthy of the trust reposed in himhe boldly attempted to verify his suspicions of the daughter in the fathers presence  how  oh in the wellknown way that has been tried over and over again under similar circumstances he merely invented a report that you were engaged in a loveaffair with some charming person in the town dont be angry theres no harm done  but there is harm done i insisted what must the princess think of me  do you suppose she is weak enough to believe the doctor her highness beat him at his own weapons not the slightest sign of agitation on her part rewarded his ingenuity all that you have to do is to help her to mislead this medical spy its as easy as lying and easier the doctors slander declares that you have a loveaffair in the town take the hintand astonish the doctor by proving that he has hit on the truth  it was a hot day the baroness was beginning to get excited she paused and fanned herself  do i startle you she asked  you disgust me  she laughed  what a thickheaded man this is she said pleasantly must i put it more plainly still engage in what your english prudery calls a flirtation with some woman herethe lower in degree the better or the princess might be jealousand let the affair be seen and known by everybody about the court sly as he is the doctor is not prepared for that at your age and with your personal advantages he will take appearances for granted he will conclude that he has wronged you and misinterpreted the motives of the princess the secret of her highnesss weakness will be preservedthanks to that sacrifice mr ernest which you are so willing and so eager to make  it was useless to remonstrate with such a woman as this i simply stated my own objection to her artfully devised scheme  i dont wish to appear vain i said but the woman to whom i am to pay these attentions may believe that i really admire herand it is just possible that she may honestly return the feeling which i am only assuming  welland what then  its hard on the woman surely  the baroness was shocked unaffectedly shocked  good heavens she exclaimed how can anything that you do for the princess be hard on a woman of the lower orders there must be an end of this nonsense sir you have heard what i propose and you know what the circumstances are my mistress is waiting for your answer what am i to say  let me see her highness and speak for myself i said  quite impossible today without running too great a risk your reply must be made through me  there was to be a court concert at the end of the week on that occasion i should be able to make my own reply in the meanwhile i only told the baroness i wanted time to consider  what time she asked  until tomorrow do you object  on the contrary i cordially agree your base hesitation may lead to results which i have not hitherto dared to anticipate  what do you mean  between this and tomorrow the horrid woman replied the princess may end in seeing you with my eyes in that hope i wish you goodmorning  vi  my enemies say that i am a weak man unduly influenced by persons of rankbecause of their rank if this we re true i should have found little difficulty in consenting to adopt the baronesss suggestion as it was the longer i reflected on the scheme the less i liked it i tried to think of some alternative that might be acceptably proposed the time passed and nothing occurred to me in this embarrassing position my mind became seriously disturbed i felt the necessity of obtaining some relief which might turn my thoughts for a while into a new channel the secretary called on me while i was still in doubt what to do he reminded me that a new prima donna was advertised to appear on that night and he suggested that we should go to the opera feeling as i did at the time i readily agreed  we found the theater already filled before the performance began two french gentlemen were seated in the row of stalls behind us they were talking of the new singer  she is advertised as mademoiselle fontenay one of them said that sounds like an assumed name  it is an assumed name the other replied she is the daughter of a french singingmaster named bonnefoy  to my friends astonishment i started to my feet and left him without a word of apology in another minute i was at the stagedoor and had sent in my card to mademoiselle fontenay while i was waiting i had time to think was it possible that jeanne had gone on the stage or were there two singingmasters in existence named bonnefoy my doubts were soon decided the french womanservant whom i remembered when i was monsieur bonnefoys pupil made her appearance and conducted me to her young mistresss dressingroom dear good jeanne how glad she was to see me  i found her standing before the glass having just completed her preparations for appearing on the stage dressed in her picturesque costume she was so charming that i expressed my admiration heartily as became her old friend do you really like me she said with the innocent familiarity which i recollected so well see how i look in the glassthat is the great test it was not easy to apply the test instead of looking at her image in the glass it was far more agreeable to look at herself we were interruptedtoo soon interruptedby the callboy he knocked at the door and announced that the overture had begun  i have a thousand things to ask you i told her what has made this wonderful change in your life how is it that i dont see your father  her face instantly saddened her hand trembled as she laid it on my arm to silence me  dont speak of him now she said or you will unnerve me come to me tomorrow when the stage will not be waiting annette will give you my address she opened the door to go out and returned will you think me very unreasonable if i ask you not to make one of my audience tonight you have reminded me of the dear old days that can never come again if i feel that i am singing to you she left me to understand the rest and turned away again to the door as i followed her out to say goodby she drew from her bosom the little brooch which had been my parting gift and held it out to me on the stage or off she said i always wear it goodnight ernest  i was prepared to hear sad news when we met the next morning  my good old friend and master had died suddenly to add to the bitterness of that affliction he had died in debt to a dear and intimate friend for his daughters sake he had endeavored to add to his little savings by speculating with borrowed money on the stock exchange he had failed and the loan advanced had not been repaid when a fit of apoplexy struck him down offered the opportunity of trying her fortune on the operatic stage jeanne made the attempt and was now nobly employed in earning the money to pay her fathers debt  it was the only way in which i could do justice to his memory she said simply i hope you dont object to my going on the stage  i took her hand poor childand let that simple action answer for me i was too deeply affected to be able to speak  it is not in me to be a great actress she resumed but you know what an admirable musician my father was he has taught me to sing so that i can satisfy the critics as well as please the public there was what they call a great success last night it has earned me an engagement for another year to come and an increase of salary i have already sent some money to our good old friend at home and i shall soon send more it is my one consolationi feel almost happy again when i am paying my poor fathers debt no more now of my sad story i want to hear all that you can tell me of yourself she moved to the window and looked out oh the beautiful blue sky we used sometimes to take a walk when we were in london on fine days like this is there a park here  i took her to the palace gardens famous for their beauty in that part of germany  arm in arm we loitered along the pleasant walks the lovely flowers the bright sun the fresh fragrant breeze all helped her to recover her spirits she began to be like the happy jeanne of my past experience as easily pleased as a child when we sat down to rest the lap of her dress was full of daisies do you remember she said when you first taught me to make a daisychain are you too great a man to help me again now  we were still engaged with our chain seated close together when the smell of tobaccosmoke was wafted to us on the air  i looked up and saw the doctor passing us enjoying his cigar he bowed eyed my pretty companion with a malicious smile and passed on  who is that man she asked  the princes physician i replied  i dont like him she said why did he smile when he looked at me  perhaps i suggested he thought we were lovers  she blushed dont let him think that tell him we are only old friends  we were not destined to finish our flower chain on that day  another person interrupted us whom i recognized as the elder brother of monsieur bonnefoyalready mentioned in these pages under the name of uncle david having left france for political reasons the old republican had taken care of his niece after her fathers death and had accepted the position of jeannes business manager in her relations with the stage uncle davids object when he joined us in the garden was to remind her that she was wanted at rehearsal and must at once return with him to the theater we parted having arranged that i was to see the performance on that night  later in the day the baroness sent for me again  let me apologize for having misunderstood you yesterday she said and let me offer you my best congratulations you have done wonders already in the way of misleading the doctor there is only one objection to that girl at the theateri hear she is so pretty that she may possibly displease the princess in other respects she is just in the public position which will make your attentions to her look like the beginning of a serious intrigue bravo mr ernestbravo  i was too indignant to place any restraint on the language in which i answered her  understand if you please i said that i am renewing an old friendship with mademoiselle jeannebegun under the sanction of her father respect that young lady madam as i respect her  the detestable baroness clapped her hands as if she had been at the theater  if you only say that to the princess she remarked as well as you have said it to me there will be no danger of arousing her highnesss jealousy i have a message for you at the concert on saturday you are to retire to the conservatory and you may hope for an interview when the singers begin the second part of the programme dont let me detain you any longer go back to your young lady mr ernestpray go back  vii  on the second night of the opera the applications for places were too numerous to be received among the crowded audience i recognized many of my friends they persisted in believing an absurd report first circulated as i imagine by the doctor which asserted that my interest in the new singer was something more than the interest of an old friend when i went behind the scenes to congratulate jeanne on her success i was annoyed in another wayand by the doctor again he followed me to jeannes room to offer his congratulations and he begged that i would introduce him to the charming prima donna having expressed his admiration he looked at me with his insolently suggestive smile and said he could not think of prolonging his intrusion on leaving the room he noticed uncle david waiting as usual to take care of jeanne on her return from the theaterlooked at him attentivelybowed and went out  the next morning i received a note from the baroness expressed in these terms  more news my rooms look out on the wing of the palace in which the doctor is lodged half an hour since i discovered him at his window giving a letter to a person who is a stranger to me the man left the palace immediately afterward my maid followed him by my directions instead of putting the letter in the post he took a ticket at the railwaystationfor what place the servant was unable to discover here you will observe is a letter important enough to be dispatched by special messenger and written at a time when we have succeeded in freeing ourselves from the doctors suspicions it is at least possible that he has decided on sending a favorable report of the princess to the grand duke if this is the case please consider whether you will not act wisely in her highnesss interests by keeping away from the concert  viewing this suggestion as another act of impertinence on the part of the baroness i persisted in my intention of going to the concert it was for the princess to decide what course of conduct i was bound to follow what did i care for the doctors report to the duke shall i own my folly i do really believe i was jealous of the duke  viii  entering the concert room i found the princess alone on the dais receiving the company nervous prostration had made it impossible for the prince to be present he was confined to his bedchamber and the doctor was in attendance on him  i bowed to the baroness but she was too seriously offended with me for declining to take her advice to notice my salutation passing into the conservatory it occurred to me that i might be seen and possibly suspected in the interval between the first and second parts of the programme when the music no longer absorbed the attention of the audience i went on and waited outside on the steps that led to the garden keeping the glass door open so as to hear when the music of the second part of the concert began  after an interval which seemed to be endless i saw the princess approaching me  she had made the heat in the concert room an excuse for retiring for a while and she had the baroness in attendance on her to save appearances instead of leaving us to ourselves the malicious creature persisted in paying the most respectful attentions to her mistress it was impossible to make her understand that she was not wanted any longer until the princess said sharply go back to the music even then the detestable woman made a low curtsey and answered i will return madam in five minutes  i ventured to present myself in the conservatory  the princess was dressed with exquisite simplicity entirely in white her only ornaments were white roses in her hair and in her bosom to say that she looked lovely is to say nothing she seemed to be the ethereal creature of some higher sphere too exquisitely delicate and pure to be approached by a mere mortal man like myself i was awed i was silent her highnesss sweet smile encouraged me to venture a little nearer she pointed to a footstool which the baroness had placed for her are you afraid of me ernest she asked softly  her divinely beautiful eyes rested on me with a look of encouragement i dropped on my knees at her feet she had asked if i was afraid of her this if i may use such an expression roused my manhood my own boldness astonished me i answered madam i adore you  she laid her fair hand on my head and looked at me thoughtfully forget my rank she whisperedhave i not set you the example suppose that i am nothing but an english miss what would you say to miss  i should say i love you  say it to me  my lips said it on her hand she bent forward my heart beats fast at the bare remembrance of it oh heavens her highness kissed me  there is your reward she murmured for all you have sacrificed for my sake what an effort it must have been to offer the pretense of love to an obscure stranger the baroness tells me this actressthis singerwhat is sheis pretty is it true  the baroness was quite mischievous enough to have also mentioned the false impression prevalent about the court that i was in love with jeanne i attempted to explain the gracious princess refused to hear me  do you think i doubt you she said distinguished by me could you waste a look on a person in that rank of life she laughed softly as if the mere idea of such a thing amused her it was only for a moment her thoughts took a new directionthey contemplated the uncertain future how is this to end she asked dear ernest we are not in paradise we are in a hard cruel world which insists on distinctions in rank to what unhappy destiny does the fascination which you exercise over me condemn us both  she pausedtook one of the white roses out of her bosomtouched it with her lipsand gave it to me  i wonder whether you feel the burden of life as i feel it she resumed it is immaterial to me whether we are united in this world or in the next accept my rose ernest as an assurance that i speak with perfect sincerity i see but two alternatives before us one of them beset with dangers is elopement and the other she added with truly majestic composure is suicide  would englishmen in general have rightly understood such fearless confidence in them as this language implied i am afraid they might have attributed it to what my friend the secretary called german sentiment perhaps they might even have suspected the princess of quoting from some oldfashioned german play under the irresistible influence of that glorious creature i contemplated with such equal serenity the perils of elopement and the martyrdom of love that i was for the moment at a loss how to reply in that moment the evil genius of my life appeared in the conservatory with haste in her steps with alarm in her face the baroness rushed up to her royal mistress and said for gods sake madam come away the prince desires to speak with you instantly  her highness rose calmly superior to the vulgar excitement of her lady in waiting think of it tonight she said to me and let me hear from you tomorrow  she pressed my hand she gave me a farewell look i sank into the chair that she had just left did i think of elopement did i think of suicide the elevating influence of the princess no longer sustained me my nature became degraded horrid doubts rose in my mind did her father suspect us  ix  need i say that i passed a sleepless night  the morning found me with my pen in my hand confronting the serious responsibility of writing to the princess and not knowing what to say i had already torn up two letters when uncle david presented himself with a message from his niece jeanne was in trouble and wanted to ask my advice  my state of mind on hearing this became simply inexplicable here was an interruption which ought to have annoyed me it did nothing of the kindit inspired me with a feeling of relief  i naturally expected that the old frenchman would return with me to his niece and tell me what had happened to my surprise he begged that i would excuse him and left me without a word of explanation i found jeanne walking up and down her little sittingroom flushed and angry fragments of torn paper and heaps of flowers littered the floor and three unopen jewelcases appeared to have been thrown into the empty fireplace she caught me excitedly by the hand the moment i entered the room  you are my true friend she said you were present the other night when i sang was there anything in my behavior on the stage which could justify men who call themselves gentlemen in insulting me  my dear how can you ask the question  i must ask it some of them send flowers and some of them send jewels and every one of them writes lettersinfamous abominable letterssaying they are in love with me and asking for appointments as if i was  she could say no more poor dear jeanneher head dropped on my shoulder she burst out crying who could see her so cruelly humiliatedthe faithful loving daughter whose one motive for appearing on the stage had been to preserve her fathers good nameand not feel for her as i did i forgot all considerations of prudence i thought of nothing but consoling her i took her in my arms i dried her tears i kissed her i said tell me the name of any one of the wretches who has written to you and i will make him an example to the rest she shook her head and pointed to the morsels of paper on the floor oh ernest do you think i asked you to come here for any such purpose as that those jewels those hateful jewels tell me how i can send them back spare me the sight of them  so far it was easy to console her i sent the jewels at once to the manager of the theaterwith a written notice to be posted at the stage door stating that they were waiting to be returned to the persons who could describe them  try my dear to forget what has happened i said try to find consolation and encouragement in your art  i have lost all interest in my success on the stage she answered now i know the penalty i must pay for it when my fathers memory is clear of reproach i shall leave the theater never to return to it again  take time to consider jeanne  i will do anything you ask of me  for a while we were silent without any influence to lead to it that i could trace i found myself recalling the language that the princess had used in alluding to jeanne when i thought of them now the words and the tone in which they had been spoken jarred on me there is surely something mean in an assertion of superiority which depends on nothing better than the accident of birth i dont know why i took jeannes hand i dont know why i said what a good girl you are how glad i am to have been of some little use to you is my friend the secretary right when he reproaches me with acting on impulse like a woman i dont like to think so and yet this i must ownit was well for me that i was obliged to leave her before i had perhaps said other words which might have been alike unworthy of jeanne of the princess and of myself i was called away to speak to my servant he brought with him the secretarys card having a line written on it i am waiting at your rooms on business which permits of no delay  as we shook hands jeanne asked me if i knew where her uncle was i could only tell her that he had left me at my own door she made no remark but she seemed to be uneasy on receiving that reply  x  when i arrived at my rooms my colleague hurried to meet me the moment i opened the door  i am going to surprise you he said and there is no time to prepare you for it our chief the minister has seen the prince this morning and has been officially informed of an event of importance in the life of the princess she is engaged to be married to the grand duke  engaged to the dukeand not a word from her to warn me of it engagedafter what she had said to me no longer ago than the past night had i been made a plaything to amuse a great lady oh what degradation i was furious i snatched up my hat to go to the palaceto force my way to herto overwhelm her with reproaches my friend stopped me he put an official document into my hand  there is your leave of absence from the legation he said beginning from today i have informed the minister in strict confidence of the critical position in which you are placed he agrees with me that the princesss inexcusable folly is alone to blame leave us ernest by the next train there is some intrigue going on and i fear you may be involved in it you know that the rulers of these little german states can exercise despotic authority when they choose  yes yes  whether the prince has acted of his own free willor whether he has been influenced by some person about himi am not able to tell you he has issued an order to arrest an old frenchman known to be a republican and suspected of associating with one of the secret societies in this part of germany the conspirator has taken to flight having friends as we suppose who warned him in time but this ernest is not the worst of it that charming singer that modest pretty girl  you dont mean jeanne  i am sorry to say i do advantage has been taken of her relationship to the old man to include that innocent creature in political suspicions which it is simply absurd to suppose that she has deserved she is ordered to leave the princes domains immediatelyare you going to her  instantly i replied  could i feel a moments hesitation after the infamous manner in which the princess had sacrificed me to the grand duke could i think of the poor girl friendless helplesswith nobody near her but a stupid womanservant unable to speak the language of the countryand fail to devote myself to the protection of jeanne thank god i reached her lodgings in time to tell her what had happened and to take it on myself to receive the police  xi  in three days more jeanne was safe in london having traveled under my escort i was fortunate enough to find a home for her in the house of a lady who had been my mothers oldest and dearest friend  we were separated a few days afterward by the distressing news which reached me of the state of my brothers health i went at once to his house in the country his medical attendants had lost all hope of saving him they told me plainly that his release from a life of suffering was near at hand  while i was still in attendance at his bedside i heard from the secretary he inclosed a letter directed to me in a strange handwriting i opened the envelope and looked for the signature my friend had been entrapped into sending me an anonymous letter  besides addressing me in french a language seldom used in my experience at the legation the writer disguised the identity of the persons mentioned by the use of classical names in spite of these precautions i felt no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion my correspondents special knowledge of court secrets and her malicious way of communicating them betrayed the baroness  i translate the letter restoring to the persons who figure in it the names under which they are already known the writer began in these satirically familiar terms   when you left the princes dominions my dear sir you no doubt believed yourself to be a free agent quite a mistake you were a mere puppet and the strings that moved you were pulled by the doctor  let me tell you how  on a certain night which you well remember the princess was unexpectedly summoned to the presence of her father his physicians skill had succeeded in relieving the illustrious prince prostrate under nervous miseries he was able to attend to a state affair of importance revealed to him by the doctorwho then for the first time acknowledged that he had presented himself at court in a diplomatic as well as in a medical capacity  this state affair related to a proposal for the hand of the princess received from the grand duke through the authorized medium of the doctor her highness being consulted refused to consider the proposal the prince asked for her reason she answered i have no wish to be married naturally irritated by such a ridiculous excuse her father declared positively that the marriage should take place  the impression produced on the grand dukes favorite and emissary was of a different kind  certain suspicions of the princess and yourself which you had successfully contrived to dissipate revived in the doctors mind when he heard the ladys reason for refusing to marry his royal master it was now too late to regret that he had suffered himself to be misled by cleverly managed appearances he could not recall the favorable report which he had addressed to the dukeor withdraw the proposal of marriage which he had been commanded to make  in this emergency the one safe course open to him was to get rid of youand at the same time so to handle circumstances as to excite against you the pride and anger of the princess in the pursuit of this latter object he was assisted by one of the ladies in waiting sincerely interested in the welfare of her gracious mistress and therefore ardently desirous of seeing her highness married to the duke  a wretched old french conspirator was made the convenient pivot on which the intrigue turned  an order for the arrest of this foreign republican having been first obtained the prince was prevailed on to extend his distrust of the frenchman to the frenchmans niece you know this already but you dont know why it was done having believed from the first that you were really in love with the young lady the doctor reckoned confidently on your devoting yourself to the protection of a friendless girl cruelly exiled at an hours notice  the one chance against us was that tender considerations associated with her highness might induce you to hesitate the lady in waiting easily moved this obstacle out of the way she abstained from delivering a letter addressed to you intrusted to her by the princess when the great lady asked why she had not received your reply she was informed quite truly that you and the charming opera singer had taken your departure together you may imagine what her highness thought of you and said of you when i mention in conclusion that she consented the same day to marry the duke  so mr ernest these clever people tricked you into serving their interests blindfold in relating how it was done i hope i may have assisted you in forming a correct estimate of the state of your own intelligence you have made a serious mistake in adopting your present profession give up diplomacyand get a farmer to employ you in keeping his sheep                                         do i sometimes think regretfully of the princess  permit me to mention a circumstance and to leave my answer to be inferred jeanne is lady medhurst     mr lismore and the widow  i  late in the autumn not many years since a public meeting was held at the mansion house london under the direction of the lord mayor  the list of gentlemen invited to address the audience had been chosen with two objects in view speakers of celebrity who would rouse public enthusiasm were supported by speakers connected with commerce who would be practically useful in explaining the purpose for which the meeting was convened money wisely spent in advertising had produced the customary resultevery seat was occupied before the proceedings began  among the late arrivals who had no choice but to stand or to leave the hall were two ladies one of them at once decided on leaving the hall i shall go back to the carriage she said and wait for you at the door her friend answered i shant keep you long he is advertised to support the second resolution i want to see himand that is all  an elderly gentleman seated at the end of a bench rose and offered his place to the lady who remained she hesitated to take advantage of his kindness until he reminded her that he had heard what she said to her friend before the third resolution was proposed his seat would be at his own disposal again she thanked him and without further ceremony took his place he was provided with an operaglass which he more than once offered to her when famous orators appeared on the platform she made no use of it until a speakerknown in the city as a shipownerstepped forward to support the second resolution  his name announced in the advertisements was ernest lismore  the moment he rose the lady asked for the operaglass she kept it to her eyes for such a length of time and with such evident interest in mr lismore that the curiosity of her neighbors was aroused had he anything to say in which a lady evidently a stranger to him was personally interested there was nothing in the address that he delivered which appealed to the enthusiasm of women he was undoubtedly a handsome man whose appearance proclaimed him to be in the prime of lifemidway perhaps between thirty and forty years of age but why a lady should persist in keeping an operaglass fixed on him all through his speech was a question which found the general ingenuity at a loss for a reply  having returned the glass with an apology the lady ventured on putting a question next did it strike you sir that mr lismore seemed to be out of spirits she asked  i cant say it did maam  perhaps you noticed that he left the platform the moment he had done  this betrayal of interest in the speaker did not escape the notice of a lady seated on the bench in front before the old gentleman could answer she volunteered an explanation  i am afraid mr lismore is troubled by anxieties connected with his business she said my husband heard it reported in the city yesterday that he was seriously embarrassed by the failure  a loud burst of applause made the end of the sentence inaudible a famous member of parliament had risen to propose the third resolution the polite old man took his seat and the lady left the hall to join her friend  well mrs callender has mr lismore disappointed you  far from it but i have heard a report about him which has alarmed me he is said to be seriously troubled about money matters how can i find out his address in the city  we can stop at the first stationers shop we pass and ask to look at the directory are you going to pay mr lismore a visit  i am going to think about it  ii  the next day a clerk entered mr lismores private room at the office and presented a visitingcard mrs callender had reflected and had arrived at a decision underneath her name she had written these explanatory words on important business  does she look as if she wanted money mr lismore inquired  oh dear no she comes in her carriage  is she young or old  old sir  to mr lismoreconscious of the disastrous influence occasionally exercised over busy men by youth and beautythis was a recommendation in itself he said show her in  observing the lady as she approached him with the momentary curiosity of a stranger he noticed that she still preserved the remains of beauty she had also escaped the misfortune common to persons at her time of life of becoming too fat even to a mans eye her dressmaker appeared to have made the most of that favorable circumstance her figure had its defects concealed and its remaining merits set off to advantage at the same time she evidently held herself above the common deceptions by which some women seek to conceal their age she wore her own gray hair and her complexion bore the test of daylight on entering the room she made her apologies with some embarrassment being the embarrassment of a stranger and not of a youthful stranger it failed to impress mr lismore favorably  i am afraid i have chosen an inconvenient time for my visit she began  i am at your service he answered a little stiffly especially if you will be so kind as to mention your business with me in few words  she was a woman of some spirit and that reply roused her  i will mention it in one word she said smartly my business isgratitude  he was completely at a loss to understand what she meant and he said so plainly instead of explaining herself she put a question  do you remember the night of the eleventh of march between five and six years since  he considered for a moment  no he said i dont remember it excuse me mrs callender i have affairs of my own to attend to which cause me some anxiety  let me assist your memory mr lismore and i will leave you to your affairs on the date that i have referred to you were on your way to the railwaystation at bexmore to catch the night express from the north to london  as a hint that his time was valuable the shipowner had hitherto remained standing he now took his customary seat and began to listen with some interest mrs callender had produced her effect on him already  it was absolutely necessary she proceeded that you should be on board your ship in the london docks at nine oclock the next morning if you had lost the express the vessel would have sailed without you  the expression of his face began to change to surprise who told you that he asked  you shall hear directly on your way into the town your carriage was stopped by an obstruction on the highroad the people of bexmore were looking at a house on fire  he started to his feet  good heavens are you the lady  she held up her hand in satirical protest  gently sir you suspected me just now of wasting your valuable time dont rashly conclude that i am the lady until you find that i am acquainted with the circumstances  is there no excuse for my failing to recognize you mr lismore asked we were on the dark side of the burning house you were fainting and i  and you she interposed after saving me at the risk of your own life turned a deaf ear to my poor husbands entreaties when he asked you to wait till i had recovered my senses  your poor husband surely mrs callender he received no serious injury from the fire  the firemen rescued him under circumstances of peril she answered and at his great age he sank under the shock i have lost the kindest and best of men do you remember how you parted from himburned and bruised in saving me he liked to talk of it in his last illness at least he said to you tell me the name of the man who has preserved my wife from a dreadful death you threw your card to him out of the carriage window and away you went at a gallop to catch your train in all the years that have passed i have kept that card and have vainly inquired for my brave seacaptain yesterday i saw your name on the list of speakers at the mansion house need i say that i attended the meeting need i tell you now why i come here and interrupt you in business hours  she held out her hand mr lismore took it in silence and pressed it warmly  you have not done with me yet she resumed with a smile do you remember what i said of my errand when i first came in  you said it was an errand of gratitude  something more than the gratitude which only says thank you she added before i explain myself however i want to know what you have been doing and how it was that my inquiries failed to trace you after that terrible night  the appearance of depression which mrs callender had noticed at the public meeting showed itself again in mr lismores face he sighed as he answered her  my story has one merit he said it is soon told i cannot wonder that you failed to discover me in the first place i was not captain of my ship at that time i was only mate in the second place i inherited some money and ceased to lead a sailors life in less than a year from the night of the fire you will now understand what obstacles were in the way of your tracing me with my little capital i started successfully in business as a shipowner at the time i naturally congratulated myself on my own good fortune we little know mrs callender what the future has in store for us  he stopped his handsome features hardenedas if he was suffering and concealing pain before it was possible to speak to him there was a knock at the door another visitor without an appointment had called the clerk appeared again with a card and a message  the gentleman begs you will see him sir he has something to tell you which is too important to be delayed  hearing the message mrs callender rose immediately  it is enough for today that we understand each other she said have you any engagement tomorrow after the hours of business  none  she pointed to her card on the writingtable will you come to me tomorrow evening at that address i am like the gentleman who has just called i too have my reason for wishing to see you  he gladly accepted the invitation mrs callender stopped him as he opened the door for her  shall i offend you she said if i ask a strange question before i go i have a better motive mind than mere curiosity are you married  no  forgive me again she resumed at my age you cannot possibly misunderstand me and yet  she hesitated mr lismore tried to give her confidence pray dont stand on ceremony mrs callender nothing that you can ask me need be prefaced by an apology  thus encouraged she ventured to proceed  you may be engaged to be married she suggested or you may be in love  he found it impossible to conceal his surprise but he answered without hesitation  there is no such bright prospect in my life he said i am not even in love  she left him with a little sigh it sounded like a sigh of relief  ernest lismore was thoroughly puzzled what could be the old ladys object in ascertaining that he was still free from a matrimonial engagement if the idea had occurred to him in time he might have alluded to her domestic life and might have asked if she had children with a little tact he might have discovered more than this she had described her feeling toward him as passing the ordinary limits of gratitude and she was evidently rich enough to be above the imputation of a mercenary motive did she propose to brighten those dreary prospects to which he had alluded in speaking of his own life when he presented himself at her house the next evening would she introduce him to a charming daughter  he smiled as the idea occurred to him an appropriate time to be thinking of my chances of marriage he said to himself in another month i may be a ruined man  iii  the gentleman who had so urgently requested an interview was a devoted friendwho had obtained a means of helping ernest at a serious crisis in his affairs  it had been truly reported that he was in a position of pecuniary embarrassment owing to the failure of a mercantile house with which he had been intimately connected whispers affecting his own solvency had followed on the bankruptcy of the firm he had already endeavored to obtain advances of money on the usual conditions and had been met by excuses for delay his friend had now arrived with a letter of introduction to a capitalist well known in commercial circles for his daring speculations and for his great wealth  looking at the letter ernest observed that the envelope was sealed in spite of that ominous innovation on established usage in cases of personal introduction he presented the letter on this occasion he was not put off with excuses the capitalist flatly declined to discount mr lismores bills unless they were backed by responsible names  ernest made a last effort  he applied for help to two mercantile men whom he had assisted in their difficulties and whose names would have satisfied the moneylender they were most sincerely sorrybut they too refused  the one security that he could offer was open it must be owned to serious objections on the score of risk he wanted an advance of twenty thousand pounds secured on a homewardbound ship and cargo but the vessel was not insured and at that stormy season she was already more than a month overdue could grateful colleagues be blamed if they forgot their obligations when they were asked to offer pecuniary help to a merchant in this situation ernest returned to his office without money and without credit  a man threatened by ruin is in no state of mind to keep an engagement at a ladys teatable ernest sent a letter of apology to mrs call ender alleging extreme pressure of business as the excuse for breaking his engagement  am i to wait for an answer sir the messenger asked  no you are merely to leave the letter  iv  in an hours timeto ernests astonishmentthe messenger returned with a reply  the lady was just going out sir when i rang at the door he explained and she took the letter from me herself she didnt appear to know your handwriting and she asked me who i came from when i mentioned your name i was ordered to wait  ernest opened the letter   dear mr lismoreone of us must speak out and your letter of apology forces me to be that one if you are really so proud and so distrustfull as you seem to be i shall offend you if not i shall prove myself to be your friend  your excuse is pressure of business the truth as i have good reason to believe is want of money i heard a stranger at that public meeting say that you were seriously embarrassed by some failure in the city  let me tell you what my own pecuniary position is in two words i am the childless widow of a rich man   ernest paused his anticipated discovery of mrs callenders charming daughter was in his mind for the moment that little romance must return to the world of dreams he thoughtand went on with the letter   after what i owe to you i dont regard it as repaying an obligationi consider myself as merely performing a duty when i offer to assist you by a loan of money  wait a little before you throw my letter into the wastepaper basket  circumstances which it is impossible for me to mention before we meet put it out of my power to help youunless i attach to my most sincere offer of service a very unusual and very embarrassing condition if you are on the brink of ruin that misfortune will plead my excuseand your excuse too if you accept the loan on my terms in any case i rely on the sympathy and forbearance of the man to whom i owe my life  after what i have now written there is only one thing to add i beg to decline accepting your excuses and i shall expect to see you tomorrow evening as we arranged i am an obstinate old womanbut i am also your faithful friend and servant  mary callender   ernest looked up from the letter what can this possibly mean he wondered  but he was too sensible a man to be content with wonderinghe decided on keeping his engagement  v  what doctor johnson called the insolence of wealth appears far more frequently in the houses of the rich than in the manners of the rich the reason is plain enough personal ostentation is in the very nature of it ridiculous but the ostentation which exhibits magnificent pictures priceless china and splendid furniture can purchase good taste to guide it and can assert itself without affording the smallest opening for a word of depreciation or a look of contempt if i am worth a million of money and if i am dying to show it i dont ask you to look at mei ask you to look at my house  keeping his engagement with mrs callender ernest discovered that riches might be lavishly and yet modestly used  in crossing the hall and ascending the stairs look where he might his notice was insensibly won by proofs of the taste which is not to be purchased and the wealth which uses but never exhibits its purse conducted by a manservant to the landing on the first floor he found a maid at the door of the boudoir waiting to announce him mrs callender advanced to welcome her guest in a simple evening dress perfectly suited to her age all that had looked worn and faded in her fine face by daylight was now softly obscured by shaded lamps objects of beauty surrounded her which glowed with subdued radiance from their background of sober color the influence of appearances is the strongest of all outward influences while it lasts for the moment the scene produced its impression on ernest in spite of the terrible anxieties which consumed him mrs callender in his office was a woman who had stepped out of her appropriate sphere mrs callender in her own house was a woman who had risen to a new place in his estimation  i am afraid you dont thank me for forcing you to keep your engagement she said with her friendly tones and her pleasant smile  indeed i do thank you he replied your beautiful house and your gracious welcome have persuaded me into forgetting my troublesfor a while  the smile passed away from her face then it is true she said gravely  only too true  she led him to a seat beside her and waited to speak again until her maid had brought in the tea  have you read my letter in the same friendly spirit in which i wrote it she asked when they were alone again  i have read your letter gratefully but  but you dont know yet what i have to say let us understand each other before we make any objections on either side will you tell me what your present position isat its worst i can and will speak plainly when my turn comes if you will honor me with your confidence not if it distresses you she added observing him attentively  he was ashamed of his hesitationand he made amends for it  do you thoroughly understand me he asked when the whole truth had been laid before her without reserve  she summed up the result in her own words  if your overdue ship returns safely within a month from this time you can borrow the money you want without difficulty if the ship is lost you have no alternative when the end of the month comes but to accept a loan from me or to suspend payment is that the hard truth  it is  and the sum you require istwenty thousand pounds  yes  i have twenty times as much money as that mr lismore at my sole disposalon one condition  the condition alluded to in your letter  yes  does the fulfillment of the condition depend in some way on any decision of mine  it depends entirely on you  that answer closed his lips  with a composed manner and a steady hand she poured herself out a cup of tea  i conceal it from you she said but i want confidence here she pointed to the cup is the friend of women rich or poor when they are in trouble what i have now to say obliges me to speak in praise of myself i dont like itlet me get it over as soon as i can my husband was very fond of me he had the most absolute confidence in my discretion and in my sense of duty to him and to myself his last words before he died were words that thanked me for making the happiness of his life as soon as i had in some degree recovered after the affliction that had fallen on me his lawyer and executor produced a copy of his will and said there were two clauses in it which my husband had expressed a wish that i should read it is needless to say that i obeyed  she still controlled her agitationbut she was now unable to conceal it ernest made an attempt to spare her  am i concerned in this he asked  yes before i tell you why i want to know what you would doin a certain case which i am unwilling even to suppose i have heard of men unable to pay the demands made on them who began business again and succeeded and in course of time paid their creditors  and you want to know if there is any likelihood of my following their example he said have you also heard of men who have made that second effortwho have failed againand who have doubled the debts they owed to their brethren in business who trusted them i knew one of those men myself he committed suicide  she laid her hand for a moment on his  i understand you she said if ruin comes  if ruin comes he interposed a man without money and without credit can make but one last atonement dont speak of it now  she looked at him with horror  i didnt mean that she said  shall we go back to what you read in the will he suggested  yesif you will give me a minute to compose myself  vi  in less than the minute she had asked for mrs callender was calm enough to go on  i now possess what is called a lifeinterest in my husbands fortune she said the money is to be divided at my death among charitable institutions excepting a certain event  which is provided for in the will ernest added helping her to go on  yes i am to be absolute mistress of the whole of the four hundred thousand pounds her voice dropped and her eyes looked away from him as she spoke the next wordson this one condition that i marry again  he looked at her in amazement  surely i have mistaken you he said you mean on this one condition that you do not marry again  no mr lismore i mean exactly what i have said you now know that the recovery of your credit and your peace of mind rests entirely with yourself  after a moment of reflection he took her hand and raised it respectfully to his lips you are a noble woman he said  she made no reply with drooping head and downcast eyes she waited for his decision he accepted his responsibility  i must not and dare not think of the hardship of my own position he said i owe it to you to speak without reference to the future that may be in store for me no man can be worthy of the sacrifice which your generous forgetfulness of yourself is willing to make i respect you i admire you i thank you with my whole heart leave me to my fate mrs callenderand let me go  he rose she stopped him by a gesture  a young woman she answered would shrink from sayingwhat i as an old woman mean to say now i refuse to leave you to your fate i ask you to prove that you respect me admire me and thank me with your whole heart take one day to thinkand let me hear the result you promise me this  he promised now go she said  vii  next morning ernest received a letter from mrs callender she wrote to him as follows   there are some considerations which i ought to have mentioned yesterday evening before you left my house  i ought to have reminded youif you consent to reconsider your decisionthat the circumstances do not require you to pledge yourself to me absolutely  at my age i can with perfect propriety assure you that i regard our marriage simply and solely as a formality which we must fulfill if i am to carry out my intention of standing between you and ruin  thereforeif the missing ship appears in time the only reason for the marriage is at an end we shall be as good friends as ever without the encumbrance of a formal tie to bind us  in the other event i should ask you to submit to certain restrictions which remembering my position you will understand and excuse  we are to live together it is unnecessary to say as mother and son the marriage ceremony is to be strictly private and you are so to arrange your affairs that immediately afterward we leave england for any foreign place which you prefer some of my friends and perhaps some of your friends will certainly misinterpret our motivesif we stay in our own countryin a manner which would be unendurable to a woman like me  as to our future lives i have the most perfect confidence in you and i should leave you in the same position of independence which you occupy now when you wish for my company you will always be welcome at other times you are your own master i live on my side of the house and you live on yoursand i am to be allowed my hours of solitude every day in the pursuit of musical occupations which have been happily associated with all my past life and which i trust confidently to your indulgence  a last word to remind you of what you may be too kind to think of yourself  at my age you cannot in the course of nature be troubled by the society of a grateful old woman for many years you are young enough to look forward to another marriage which shall be something more than a mere form even if you meet with the happy woman in my lifetime honestly tell me of itand i promise to tell her that she has only to wait  in the meantime dont think because i write composedly that i write heartlessly you pleased and interested me when i first saw you at the public meeting i dont think i could have proposed what you call this sacrifice of myself to a man who had personally repelled methough i might have felt my debt of gratitude as sincerely as ever whether your ship is saved or whether your ship is lost old mary callender likes youand owns it without false shame  let me have your answer this evening either personally or by letterwhichever you like best  viii  mrs callender received a written answer long before the evening it said much in few words  a man impenetrable to kindness might be able to resist your letter i am not that man your great heart has conquered me   the few formalities which precede marriage by special license were observed by ernest while the destiny of their future lives was still in suspense an unacknowledged feeling of embarrassment on either side kept ernest and mrs callender apart every day brought the lady her report of the state of affairs in the city written always in the same words no news of the ship  ix  on the day before the shipowners liabilities became due the terms of the report from the city remained unchangedand the special license was put to its contemplated use mrs callenders lawyer and mrs callenders maid were the only persons trusted with the secret leaving the chief clerk in charge of the business with every pecuniary demand on his employer satisfied in full the strangely married pair quitted england  they arranged to wait for a few days in paris to receive any letters of importance which might have been addressed to ernest in the interval on the evening of their arrival a telegram from london was waiting at their hotel it announced that the missing ship had passed up channelundiscovered in a fog until she reached the downson the day before ernests liabilities fell due  do you regret it mrs lismore said to her husband  not for a moment he answered  they decided on pursuing their journey as far as munich  mrs lismores taste for music was matched by ernests taste for painting in his leisure hours he cultivated the art and delighted in it the picturegalleries of munich were almost the only galleries in europe which he had not seen true to the engagements to which she had pledged herself his wife was willing to go wherever it might please him to take her the one suggestion she made was that they should hire furnished apartments if they lived at an hotel friends of the husband or the wife visitors like themselves to the famous city might see their names in the book or might meet them at the door  they were soon established in a house large enough to provide them with every accommodation which they required  ernests days were passed in the galleries mrs lismore remaining at home devoted to her music until it was time to go out with her husband for a drive living together in perfect amity and concord they were nevertheless not living happily without any visible reason for the change mrs lismores spirits were depressed on the one occasion when ernest noticed it she made an effort to be cheerful which it distressed him to see he allowed her to think that she had relieved him of any further anxiety whatever doubts he might feel were doubts delicately concealed from that time forth  but when two people are living together in a state of artificial tranquillity it seems to be a law of nature that the element of disturbance gathers unseen and that the outburst comes inevitably with the lapse of time  in ten days from the date of their arrival at munich the crisis came ernest returned later than usual from the picturegallery andfor the first time in his wifes experienceshut himself up in his own room  he appeared at the dinnerhour with a futile excuse mrs lismore waited until the servant had withdrawn now ernest she said its time to tell me the truth  her manner when she said those few words took him by surprise she was unquestionably confused and instead of lookin g at him she trifled with the fruit on her plate embarrassed on his side he could only answer  i have nothing to tell  were there many visitors at the gallery she asked  about the same as usual  any that you particularly noticed she went on i mean among the ladies  he laughed uneasily you forget how interested i am in the pictures he said  there was a pause she looked up at himand suddenly looked away again but he saw it plainly there were tears in her eyes  do you mind turning down the gas she said my eyes have been weak all day  he complied with her requestthe more readily having his own reasons for being glad to escape the glaring scrutiny of the light  i think i will rest a little on the sofa she resumed in the position which he occupied his back would have been now turned on her she stopped him when he tried to move his chair i would rather not look at you ernest she said when you have lost confidence in me  not the words but the tone touched all that was generous and noble in his nature he left his place and knelt beside herand opened to her his whole heart  am i not unworthy of you he asked when it was over  she pressed his hand in silence  i should be the most ungrateful wretch living he said if i did not think of you and you only now that my confession is made we will leave munich tomorrowand if resolution can help me i will only remember the sweetest woman my eyes ever looked on as the creature of a dream  she hid her face on his breast and reminded him of that letter of her writing which had decided the course of their lives  when i thought you might meet the happy woman in my lifetime i said to you tell me of itand i promise to tell her that she has only to wait time must pass ernest before it can be needful to perform my promise but you might let me see her if you find her in the gallery tomorrow you might bring her here  mrs lismores request met with no refusal ernest was only at a loss to know how to grant it  you tell me she is a copyist of pictures his wife reminded him she will be interested in hearing of the portfolio of drawings by the great french artists which i bought for you in paris ask her to come and see them and to tell you if she can make some copies and say if you like that i shall be glad to become acquainted with her  he felt her breath beating fast on his bosom in the fear that she might lose all control over herself he tried to relieve her by speaking lightly what an invention yours is he said if my wife ever tries to deceive me i shall be a mere child in her hands  she rose abruptly from the sofakissed him on the foreheadand said wildly i shall be better in bed before he could move or speak she had left him  x  the next morning he knocked at the door of his wifes room and asked how she had passed the night  i have slept badly she answered and i must beg you to excuse my absence at breakfasttime she called him back as he was about to withdraw remember she said when you return from the gallery today i expect that you will not return alone                                     three hours later he was at home again the young ladys services as a copyist were at his disposal she had returned with him to look at the drawings  the sittingroom was empty when they entered it he rang for his wifes maidand was informed that mrs lismore had gone out refusing to believe the woman he went to his wifes apartments she was not to be found  when he returned to the sittingroom the young lady was not unnaturally offended he could make allowances for her being a little out of temper at the slight that had been put on her but he was inexpressibly disconcerted by the manneralmost the coarse mannerin which she expressed herself  i have been talking to your wifes maid while you have been away she said i find you have married an old lady for her money she is jealous of me of course  let me beg you to alter your opinion he answered you are wronging my wife she is incapable of any such feeling as you attribute to her  the young lady laughed at any rate you are a good husband she said satirically suppose you own the truth wouldnt you like her better if she was young and pretty like me  he was not merely surprisedhe was disgusted her beauty had so completely fascinated him when he first saw her that the idea of associating any want of refinement and good breeding with such a charming creature never entered his mind the disenchantment to him was already so complete that he was even disagreeably affected by the tone of her voice it was almost as repellent to him as the exhibition of unrestrained bad temper which she seemed perfectly careless to conceal  i confess you surprise me he said coldly  the reply produced no effect on her on the contrary she became more insolent than ever  i have a fertile fancy she went on and your absurd way of taking a joke only encourages me suppose you could transform this sour old wife of yours who has insulted me into the sweetest young creature that ever lived by only holding up your fingerwouldnt you do it  this passed the limits of his endurance i have no wish he said to forget the consideration which is due to a woman you leave me but one alternative he rose to go out of the room  she ran to the door as he spoke and placed herself in the way of his going out  he signed to her to let him pass  she suddenly threw her arms round his neck kissed him passionately and whispered with her lips at his ear oh ernest forgive me could i have asked you to marry me for my money if i had not taken refuge in a disguise  xi  when he had sufficiently recovered to think he put her back from him is there an end of the deception now he asked sternly am i to trust you in your new character  you are not to be harder on me than i deserve she answered gently did you ever hear of an actress named miss max  he began to understand her forgive me if i spoke harshly he said you have put me to a severe trial  she burst into tears love she murmured is my only excuse  from that moment she had won her pardon he took her hand and made her sit by him  yes he said i have heard of miss max and of her wonderful powers of personationand i have always regretted not having seen her while she was on the stage  did you hear anything more of her ernest  yes i heard that she was a pattern of modesty and good conduct and that she gave up her profession at the height of her success to marry an old man  will you come with me to my room she asked i have something there which i wish to show you  it was the copy of her husbands will  read the lines ernest which begin at the top of the page let my dead husband speak for me  the lines ran thus   my motive in marrying miss max must be stated in this place in justice to herand i will venture to add in justice to myself i felt the sincerest sympathy for her position she was without father mother or friends one of the poor forsaken children whom the mercy of the foundling hospital provides with a home her after life on the stage was the life of a virtuous woman persecuted by profligates insulted by some of the baser creatures associated with her to whom she was an object of envy i offered her a home and the protection of a fatheron the only terms which the world would recognize as worthy of us my experience of her since our marriage has been the experience of unvarying goodness sweetness and sound sense she has behaved so nobly in a trying position that i wish her even in this life to have her reward i entreat her to make a second choice in marriage which shall not be a mere form i firmly believe that she will choose well and wiselythat she will make the happiness of a man who is worthy of herand that as wife and mother she will set an example of inestimable value in the social sphere that she occupies in proof of the heartfelt sincerity with which i pay my tribute to her virtues i add to this my will the clause that follows  with the clause that followed ernest was already acquainted  will you now believe that i never loved till i saw your face for the first time said his wife i had no experience to place me on my guard against the fascinationthe madness some people might call itwhich possesses a woman when all her heart is given to a man dont despise me my dear remember that i had to save you from disgrace and ruin besides my old stage remembrances tempted me i had acted in a play in which the heroine didwhat i have done it didnt end with me as it did with her in the story she was represented as rejoicing in the success of her disguise i have known some miserable hours of doubt and shame since our marriage when i went to meet you in my own person at the picturegalleryoh what relief what joy i felt when i saw how you admired meit was not because i could no longer carry on the disguise i was able to get hours of rest from the effort not only at night but in the daytime when i was shut up in my retirement in the musicroom and when my maid kept watch against discovery no my love i hurried on the disclosure because i could no longer endure the hateful triumph of my own deception ah look at that witness against me i cant bear even to see it  she abruptly left him the drawer that she had opened to take out the copy of the will also contained the false gray hair which she had discarded it had only that moment attracted her notice she snatched it up and turned to the fireplace  ernest took it from her before she could destroy it give it to me he said  why  he drew her gently to his bosom and answered i must not forget my old wife     miss jeromette and the clergyman  i  my brother the clergyman looked over my shoulder before i was aware of him and discovered that the volume which completely absorbed my attention was a collection of famous trials published in a new edition and in a popular form  he laid his finger on the trial which i happened to be reading at the moment i looked up at him his face startled me he had turned pale his eyes were fixed on the open page of the book with an expression which puzzled and alarmed me  my dear fellow i said what in the world is the matter with you  he answered in an odd absent manner still keeping his finger on the open page  i had almost forgotten he said and this reminds me  reminds you of what i asked you dont mean to say you know anything about the trial  i know this he said the prisoner was guilty  guilty i repeated why the man was acquitted by the jury with the full approval of the judge what call you possibly mean  there are circumstances connected with that trial my brother answered which were never communicated to the judge or the jurywhich were never so much as hinted or whispered in court i know themof my own knowledge by my own personal experience they are very sad very strange very terrible i have mentioned them to no mortal creature i have done my best to forget them youquite innocentlyhave brought them back to my mind they oppress they distress me i wish i had found you reading any book in your library except that book  my curiosity was now strongly excited i spoke out plainly  surely i suggested you might tell your brother what you are unwilling to mention to persons less nearly related to you we have followed different professions and have lived in different countries since we were boys at school but you know you can trust me  he considered a little with himself  yes he said i know i can trust you he waited a moment and then he surprised me by a strange question  do you believe he asked that the spirits of the dead can return to earth and show themselves to the living  i answered cautiouslyadopting as my own the words of a great english writer touching the subject of ghosts  you ask me a question i said which after five thousand years is yet undecided on that account alone it is a question not to be trifled with  my reply seemed to satisfy him  promise me he resumed that you will keep what i tell you a secret as long as i live after my death i care little what happens let the story of my strange experience be added to the published experience of those other men who have seen what i have seen and who believe what i believe the world will not be the worse and may be the better for knowing one day what i am now about to trust to your ear alone  my brother never again alluded to the narrative which he had confided to me until the later time when i was sitting by his deathbed he asked if i still remembered the story of jeromette tell it to others he said as i have told it to you  i repeat it after his deathas nearly as i can in his own words  ii  on a fine summer evening many years since i left my chambers in the temple to meet a fellowstudent who had proposed to me a nights amusement in the public gardens at cremorne  you were then on your way to india and i had taken my degree at oxford i had sadly disappointed my father by choosing the law as my profession in preference to the church at that time to own the truth i had no serious intention of following any special vocation i simply wanted an excuse for enjoying the pleasures of a london life the study of the law supplied me with that excuse and i chose the law as my profession accordingly  on reaching the place at which we had arranged to meet i found that my friend had not kept his appointment after waiting vainly for ten minutes my patience gave way and i went into the gardens by myself  i took two or three turns round the platform devoted to the dancers without discovering my fellowstudent and without seeing any other person with whom i happened to be acquainted at that time  for some reason which i cannot now remember i was not in my usual good spirits that evening the noisy music jarred on my nerves the sight of the gaping crowd round the platform irritated me the blandishments of the painted ladies of the profession of pleasure saddened and disgusted me i opened my cigarcase and turned aside into one of the quiet bywalks of the gardens  a man who is habitually careful in choosing his cigar has this advantage over a man who is habitually careless he can always count on smoking the best cigar in his case down to the last i was still absorbed in choosing my cigar when i heard these words behind mespoken in a foreign accent and in a womans voice  leave me directly sir i wish to have nothing to say to you  i turned round and discovered a little lady very simply and tastefully dressed who looked both angry and alarmed as she rapidly passed me on her way to the more frequented part of the gardens a man evidently the worse for the wine he had drunk in the course of the evening was following her and was pressing his tipsy attentions on her with the coarsest insolence of speech and manner she was young and pretty and she cast one entreating look at me as she went by which it was not in manhoodperhaps i ought to say in youngmanhoodto resist  i instantly stepped forward to protect her careless whether i involved myself in a discreditable quarrel with a blackguard or not as a matter of course the fellow resented my interference and my temper gave way fortunately for me just as i lifted my hand to knock him down at policeman appeared who had noticed that he was drunk and who settled the dispute officially by turning him out of the gardens  i led her away from the crowd that had collected she was evidently frightenedi felt her hand trembling on my armbut she had one great merit she made no fuss about it  if i can sit down for a few minutes she said in her pretty foreign accent i shall soon be myself again and i shall not trespass any further on your kindness i thank you very much sir for taking care of me  we sat down on a bench in a retired par t of the gardens near a little fountain a row of lighted lamps ran round the outer rim of the basin i could see her plainly  i have said that she was a little lady i could not have described her more correctly in three words  her figure was slight and small she was a wellmade miniature of a woman from head to foot her hair and her eyes were both dark the hair curled naturally the expression of the eyes was quiet and rather sad the complexion as i then saw it very pale the little mouth perfectly charming i was especially attracted i remembered by the carriage of her head it was strikingly graceful and spirited it distinguished her little as she was and quiet as she was among the thousands of other women in the gardens as a creature apart even the one marked defect in hera slight cast in the left eyeseemed to add in some strange way to the quaint attractiveness of her face i have already spoken of the tasteful simplicity of her dress i ought now to add that it was not made of any costly material and that she wore no jewels or ornaments of any sort my little lady was not rich even a mans eye could see that  she was perfectly unembarrassed and unaffected we fell as easily into talk as if we had been friends instead of strangers  i asked how it was that she had no companion to take care of her you are too young and too pretty i said in my blunt english way to trust yourself alone in such a place as this  she took no notice of the compliment she calmly put it away from her as if it had not reached her ears  i have no friend to take care of me she said simply i was sad and sorry this evening all by myself and i thought i would go to the gardens and hear the music just to amuse me it is not much to pay at the gate only a shilling  no friend to take care of you i repeated surely there must be one happy man who might have been here with you tonight  what man do you mean she asked  the man i answered thoughtlessly whom we call in england a sweetheart  i would have given worlds to have recalled those foolish words the moment they passed my lips i felt that i had taken a vulgar liberty with her her face saddened her eyes dropped to the ground i begged her pardon  there is no need to beg my pardon she said if you wish to know siryes i had once a sweetheart as you call it in england he has gone away and left me no more of him if you please i am rested now i will thank you again and go home  she rose to leave me  i was determined not to part with her in that way i begged to be allowed to see her safely back to her own door she hesitated i took a mans unfair advantage of her by appealing to her fears i said suppose the blackguard who annoyed you should be waiting outside the gates that decided her she took my arm we went away together by the bank of the thames in the balmy summer night  a walk of half an hour brought us to the house in which she lodgeda shabby little house in a bystreet inhabited evidently by very poor people  she held out her hand at the door and wished me goodnight i was too much interested in her to consent to leave my little foreign lady without the hope of seeing her again i asked permission to call on her the next day we were standing under the light of the streetlamp she studied my face with a grave and steady attention before she made any reply  yes she said at last i think i do know a gentleman when i see him you may come sir if you please and call upon me tomorrow  so we parted so i entereddoubting nothing foreboding nothingon a scene in my life which i now look back on with unfeigned repentance and regret  iii  i am speaking at this later time in the position of a clergyman and in the character of a man of mature age remember that and you will understand why i pass as rapidly as possible over the events of the next year of my lifewhy i say as little as i can of the errors and the delusions of my youth  i called on her the next day i repeated my visits during the days and weeks that followed until the shabby little house in the bystreet had become a second and i say it with shame and selfreproach a dearer home to me  all of herself and her story which she thought fit to confide to me under these circumstances may be repeated to you in few words  the name by which letters were addressed to her was mademoiselle jeromette among the ignorant people of the house and the small tradesmen of the neighborhoodwho found her name not easy of pronunciation by the average english tongueshe was known by the friendly nickname of the french miss when i knew her she was resigned to her lonely life among strangers some years had elapsed since she had lost her parents and had left france possessing a small very small income of her own she added to it by coloring miniatures for the photographers she had relatives still living in france but she had long since ceased to correspond with them ask me nothing more about my family she used to say i am as good as dead in my own country and among my own people  this was allliterally allthat she told me of herself i have never discovered more of her sad story from that day to this  she never mentioned her family namenever even told me what part of france she came from or how long she had lived in england that she was by birth and breeding a lady i could entertain no doubt her manners her accomplishments her ways of thinking and speaking all proved it looking below the surface her character showed itself in aspects not common among young women in these days in her quiet way she was an incurable fatalist and a firm believer in the ghostly reality of apparitions from the dead then again in the matter of money she had strange views of her own whenever my purse was in my hand she held me resolutely at a distance from first to last she refused to move into better apartments the shabby little house was clean inside and the poor people who lived in it were kind to herand that was enough the most expensive present that she ever permitted me to offer her was a little enameled ring the plainest and cheapest thing of the kind in the jewelers shop in all relations with me she was sincerity itself on all occasions and under all circumstances she spoke her mind as the phrase is with the same uncompromising plainness  i like you she said to me i respect you i shall always be faithful to you while you are faithful to me but my love has gone from me there is another man who has taken it away with him i know not where  who was the other man  she refused to tell me she kept his rank and his name strict secrets from me i never discovered how he had met with her or why he had left her or whether the guilt was his of making of her an exile from her country and her friends she despised herself for still loving him but the passion was too strong for hershe owned it and lamented it with the frankness which was so preeminently a part of her character more than this she plainly told me in the early days of our acquaintance that she believed he would return to her it might be tomorrow or it might be years hence even if he failed to repent of his own cruel conduct the man would still miss her as something lost out of his life and sooner or later he would come back  and will you receive him if he does come back i asked  i shall receive him she replied against my own better judgmentin spite of my own firm persuasion that the day of his return to me will bring with it the darkest days of my life  i tried to remonstrate with her  you have a will of your own i said exert it if he attempts to return to you  i have no will of my own she answered quietly where he is concerned it is my misfortune to love him her eyes rested for a moment on mine with the utter selfabandonment of despair we have said enough about this she added abruptly let us say no more  from that time we never spoke again of the unknown man during the year that followed o ur first meeting she heard nothing of him directly or indirectly he might be living or he might be dead there came no word of him or from him i was fond enough of her to be satisfied with thishe never disturbed us  iv  the year passedand the end came not the end as you may have anticipated it or as i might have foreboded it  you remember the time when your letters from home informed you of the fatal termination of our mothers illness it is the time of which i am now speaking a few hours only before she breathed her last she called me to her bedside and desired that we might be left together alone reminding me that her death was near she spoke of my prospects in life she noticed my want of interest in the studies which were then supposed to be engaging my attention and she ended by entreating me to reconsider my refusal to enter the church  your fathers heart is set upon it she said do what i ask of you my dear and you will help to comfort him when i am gone  her strength failed her she could say no more could i refuse the last request she would ever make to me i knelt at the bedside and took her wasted hand in mine and solemnly promised her the respect which a son owes to his mothers last wishes  having bound myself by this sacred engagement i had no choice but to accept the sacrifice which it imperatively exacted from me the time had come when i must tear myself free from all unworthy associations no matter what the effort cost me i must separate myself at once and forever from the unhappy woman who was not who never could be my wife  at the close of a dull foggy day i set forth with a heavy heart to say the words which were to part us forever  her lodging was not far from the banks of the thames as i drew near the place the darkness was gathering and the broad surface of the river was hidden from me in a chill white mist i stood for a while with my eyes fixed on the vaporous shroud that brooded over the flowing wateri stood and asked myself in despair the one dreary question what am i to say to her  the mist chilled me to the bones i turned from the riverbank and made my way to her lodgings hard by it must be done i said to myself as i took out my key and opened the house door  she was not at her work as usual when i entered her little sittingroom she was standing by the fire with her head down and with an open letter in her hand  the instant she turned to meet me i saw in her face that something was wrong her ordinary manner was the manner of an unusually placid and selfrestrained person her temperament had little of the liveliness which we associate in england with the french nature she was not ready with her laugh and in all my previous experience i had never yet known her to cry now for the first time i saw the quiet face disturbed i saw tears in the pretty brown eyes she ran to meet me and laid her head on my breast and burst into a passionate fit of weeping that shook her from head to foot  could she by any human possibility have heard of the coming change in my life was she aware before i had opened my lips of the hard necessity which had brought me to the house  it was simply impossible the thing could not be  i waited until her first burst of emotion had worn itself out then i askedwith an uneasy conscience with a sinking heartwhat had happened to distress her  she drew herself away from me sighing heavily and gave me the open letter which i had seen in her hand  read that she said and remember i told you what might happen when we first met  i read the letter  it was signed in initials only but the writer plainly revealed himself as the man who had deserted her he had repented he had returned to her in proof of his penitence he was willing to do her the justice which he had hitherto refusedhe was willing to marry her on the condition that she would engage to keep the marriage a secret so long as his parents lived submitting this proposal he waited to know whether she would consent on her side to forgive and forget  i gave her back the letter in silence this unknown rival had done me the service of paving the way for our separation in offering her the atonement of marriage he had made it on my part a matter of duty to her as well as to myself to say the parting words i felt this instantly and yet i hated him for helping me  she took my hand and led me to the sofa we sat down side by side her face was composed to a sad tranquillity she was quiet she was herself again  i have refused to see him she said until i had first spoken to you you have read his letter what do you say  i could make but one answer it was my duty to tell her what my own position was in the plainest terms i did my dutyleaving her free to decide on the future for herself those sad words said it was useless to prolong the wretchedness of our separation i rose and took her hand for the last time  i see her again now at that final moment as plainly as if it had happened yesterday she had been suffering from an affection of the throat and she had a white silk handkerchief tied loosely round her neck she wore a simple dress of purple merino with a blacksilk apron over it her face was deadly pale her fingers felt icily cold as they closed round my hand  promise me one thing i said before i go while i live i am your friendif i am nothing more if you are ever in trouble promise that you will let me know it  she started and drew back from me as if i had struck her with a sudden terror  strange she said speaking to herself he feels as i feel he is afraid of what may happen to me in my life to come  i attempted to reassure her i tried to tell her what was indeed the truththat i had only been thinking of the ordinary chances and changes of life when i spoke  she paid no heed to me she came back and put her hands on my shoulders and thoughtfully and sadly looked up in my face  my mind is not your mind in this matter she said i once owned to you that i had my forebodings when we first spoke of this mans return i may tell you now more than i told you then i believe i shall die young and die miserably if i am right have you interest enough still left in me to wish to hear of it  she paused shudderingand added these startling words  you shall hear of it  the tone of steady conviction in which she spoke alarmed and distressed me my face showed her how deeply and how painfully i was affected  there there she said returning to her natural manner dont take what i say too seriously a poor girl who has led a lonely life like mine thinks strangely and talks strangelysometimes yes i give you my promise if i am ever in trouble i will let you know it god bless youyou have been very kind to megoodby  a tear dropped on my face as she kissed me the door closed between us the dark street received me  it was raining heavily i looked up at her window through the drifting shower the curtains were parted she was standing in the gap dimly lit by the lamp on the table behind her waiting for our last look at each other slowly lifting her hand she waved her farewell at the window with the unsought native grace which had charmed me on the night when we first met the curtain fell againshe disappearednothing was before me nothing was round me but the darkness and the night  v  in two years from that time i had redeemed the promise given to my mother on her deathbed i had entered the church  my fathers interest made my first step in my new profession an easy one after serving my preliminary apprenticeship as a curate i was appointed before i was thirty years of age to a living in the west of england  my new benefice offered me every advantage that i could possibly desirewith the one exception of a sufficient income although my wants were few and although i was still an unmarried man i found it desirable on many accounts to add to my resources following the example of other young clergymen in my position i det ermined to receive pupils who might stand in need of preparation for a career at the universities my relatives exerted themselves and my good fortune still befriended me i obtained two pupils to start with a third would complete the number which i was at present prepared to receive in course of time this third pupil made his appearance under circumstances sufficiently remarkable to merit being mentioned in detail  it was the summer vacation and my two pupils had gone home thanks to a neighboring clergyman who kindly undertook to perform my duties for me i too obtained a fortnights holiday which i spent at my fathers house in london  during my sojourn in the metropolis i was offered an opportunity of preaching in a church made famous by the eloquence of one of the popular pulpitorators of our time in accepting the proposal i felt naturally anxious to do my best before the unusually large and unusually intelligent congregation which would be assembled to hear me  at the period of which i am now speaking all england had been startled by the discovery of a terrible crime perpetrated under circumstances of extreme provocation i chose this crime as the main subject of my sermon admitting that the best among us were frail mortal creatures subject to evil promptings and provocations like the worst among us my object was to show how a christian man may find his certain refuge from temptation in the safeguards of his religion i dwelt minutely on the hardship of the christians first struggle to resist the evil influenceon the help which his christianity inexhaustibly held out to him in the worst relapses of the weaker and viler part of his natureon the steady and certain gain which was the ultimate reward of his faith and his firmnessand on the blessed sense of peace and happiness which accompanied the final triumph preaching to this effect with the fervent conviction which i really felt i may say for myself at least that i did no discredit to the choice which had placed me in the pulpit i held the attention of my congregation from the first word to the last  while i was resting in the vestry on the conclusion of the service a note was brought to me written in pencil a member of my congregationa gentlemanwished to see me on a matter of considerable importance to himself he would call on me at any place and at any hour which i might choose to appoint if i wished to be satisfied of his respectability he would beg leave to refer me to his father with whose name i might possibly be acquainted  the name given in the reference was undoubtedly familiar to me as the name of a man of some celebrity and influence in the world of london i sent back my card appointing an hour for the visit of my correspondent on the afternoon of the next day  vi  the stranger made his appearance punctually i guessed him to be some two or three years younger than myself he was undeniably handsome his manners were the manners of a gentlemanand yet without knowing why i felt a strong dislike to him the moment he entered the room  after the first preliminary words of politeness had been exchanged between us my visitor informed me as follows of the object which he had in view  i believe you live in the country sir he began  i live in the west of england i answered  do you make a long stay in london  no i go back to my rectory tomorrow  may i ask if you take pupils  yes  have you any vacancy  i have one vacancy  would you object to let me go back with you tomorrow as your pupil  the abruptness of the proposal took me by surprise i hesitated  in the first place as i have already said i disliked him in the second place he was too old to be a fit companion for my other two pupilsboth lads in their teens in the third place he had asked me to receive him at least three weeks before the vacation came to an end i had my own pursuits and amusements in prospect during that interval and saw no reason why i should inconvenience myself by setting them aside  he noticed my hesitation and did not conceal from me that i had disappointed him  i have it very much at heart he said to repair without delay the time that i have lost my age is against me i know the truth isi have wasted my opportunities since i left school and i am anxious honestly anxious to mend my ways before it is too late i wish to prepare myself for one of the universitiesi wish to show if i can that i am not quite unworthy to inherit my fathers famous name you are the man to help me if i can only persuade you to do it i was struck by your sermon yesterday and if i may venture to make the confession in your presence i took a strong liking to you will you see my father before you decide to say no he will be able to explain whatever may seem strange in my present application and he will be happy to see you this afternoon if you can spare the time as to the question of terms i am quite sure it can be settled to your entire satisfaction  he was evidently in earnestgravely vehemently in earnest i unwillingly consented to see his father  our interview was a long one all my questions were answered fully and frankly  the young man had led an idle and desultory life he was weary of it and ashamed of it his disposition was a peculiar one he stood sorely in need of a guide a teacher and a friend in whom he was disposed to confide if i disappointed the hopes which he had centered in me he would be discouraged and he would relapse into the aimless and indolent existence of which he was now ashamed any terms for which i might stipulate were at my disposal if i would consent to receive him for three months to begin with on trial  still hesitating i consulted my father and my friends  they were all of opinion and justly of opinion so far that the new connection would be an excellent one for me they all reproached me for taking a purely capricious dislike to a wellborn and wellbred young man and for permitting it to influence me at the outset of my career against my own interests pressed by these considerations i allowed myself to be persuaded to give the new pupil a fair trial he accompanied me the next day on my way back to the rectory  vii  let me be careful to do justice to a man whom i personally disliked my senior pupil began well he produced a decidedly favorable impression on the persons attached to my little household  the women especially admired his beautiful light hair his crisplycurling beard his delicate complexion his clear blue eyes and his finely shaped hands and feet even the inveterate reserve in his manner and the downcast almost sullen look which had prejudiced me against him aroused a common feeling of romantic enthusiasm in my servants hall it was decided on the high authority of the housekeeper herself that the new gentleman was in loveand more interesting still that he was the victim of an unhappy attachment which had driven him away from his friends and his home  for myself i tried hard and tried vainly to get over my first dislike to the senior pupil  i could find no fault with him all his habits were quiet and regular and he devoted himself conscientiously to his reading but little by little i became satisfied that his heart was not in his studies more than this i had my reasons for suspecting that he was concealing something from me and that he felt painfully the reserve on his own part which he could not or dared not break through there were moments when i almost doubted whether he had not chosen my remote country rectory as a safe place of refuge from some person or persons of whom he stood in dread  for example his ordinary course of proceeding in the matter of his correspondence was to say the least of it strange  he received no letters at my house they waited for him at the village post office he invariably called for them himself and invariably forbore to trust any of my servants with his own letters for the post again when we were out walking together i more than once caught him looking furtively over his shoulder as if he suspected some person of following him for some evil purpose being constitutionally a hater of mysteries i determined at an early stage of our intercourse on making an effort to clear matters up there might be just a chance of my winning the senior pupils confidence if i spoke to him while the last days of the summer vacation still left us alone together in the house  excuse me for noticing it i said to him one morning while we were engaged over our booksi cannot help observing that you appear to have some trouble on your mind is it indiscreet on my part to ask if i can be of any use to you  he changed colorlooked up at me quicklylooked down again at his bookstruggled hard with some secret fear or secret reluctance that was in himand suddenly burst out with this extraordinary question i suppose you were in earnest when you preached that sermon in london  i am astonished that you should doubt it i replied  he paused again struggled with himself again and startled me by a second outbreak even stranger than the first  i am one of the people you preached at in your sermon he said thats the true reason why i asked you to take me for your pupil dont turn me out when you talked to your congregation of tortured and tempted people you talked of me  i was so astonished by the confession that i lost my presence of mind for the moment i was unable to answer him  dont turn me out he repeated help me against myself i am telling you the truth as god is my witness i am telling you the truth  tell me the whole truth i said and rely on my consoling and helping yourely on my being your friend  in the fervor of the moment i took his hand it lay cold and still in mine it mutely warned me that i had a sullen and a secret nature to deal with  there must be no concealment between us i resumed you have entered my house by your own confession under false pretenses it is your duty to me and your duty to yourself to speak out  the mans inveterate reservecast off for the moment onlyrenewed its hold on him he considered carefully considered his next words before he permitted them to pass his lips  a person is in the way of my prospects in life he began slowly with his eyes cast down on his book a person provokes me horribly i feel dreadful temptations like the man you spoke of in your sermon when i am in the persons company teach me to resist temptation i am afraid of myself if i see the person again you are the only man who can help me do it while you can  he stopped and passed his handkerchief over his forehead  will that do he askedstill with his eyes on his book  it will not do i answered you are so far from really opening your heart to me that you wont even let me know whether it is a man or a woman who stands in the way of your prospects in life you used the word person over and over againrather than say he or she when you speak of the provocation which is trying you how can i help a man who has so little confidence in me as that  my reply evidently found him at the end of his resources he tried tried desperately to say more than he had said yet no the words seemed to stick in his throat not one of them would pass his lips  give me time he pleaded piteously i cant bring myself to it all at once i mean well upon my soul i mean well but i am slow at this sort of thing wait till tomorrow  tomorrow cameand again he put it off  one more day he said you dont know how hard it is to speak plainly i am half afraid i am half ashamed give me one more day  i had hitherto only disliked him try as i might and did to make merciful allowance for his reserve i began to despise him now  viii  the day of the deferred confession came and brought an event with it for which both he and i were alike unprepared would he really have confided in me but for that event he must either have done it or have abandoned the purpose which had led him into my house  we met as usual at the breakfasttable my housekeeper brought in my letters of the morning to my surprise instead of leaving the room again as usual she walked round to the other side of the table and laid a letter before my senior pupilthe first letter since his residence with me which had been delivered to him under my roof  he started and took up the letter he looked at the address a spasm of suppressed fury passed across his face his breath came quickly his hand trembled as it held the letter so far i said nothing i waited to see whether he would open the envelope in my presence or not  he was afraid to open it in my presence he got on his feet he said in tones so low that i could barely hear him please excuse me for a minuteand left the room  i waited for half an hourfor a quarter of an hour after thatand then i sent to ask if he had forgotten his breakfast  in a minute more i heard his footstep in the hall he opened the breakfastroom door and stood on the threshold with a small travelingbag in his hand  i beg your pardon he said still standing at the door i must ask for leave of absence for a day or two business in london  can i be of any use i asked i am afraid your letter has brought you bad news  yes he said shortly bad news i have no time for breakfast  wait a few minutes i urged wait long enough to treat me like your friendto tell me what your trouble is before you go  he made no reply he stepped into the hall and closed the doorthen opened it again a little way without showing himself  business in london he repeatedas if he thought it highly important to inform me of the nature of his errand the door closed for the second time he was gone  i went into my study and carefully considered what had happened  the result of my reflections is easily described i determined on discontinuing my relations with my senior pupil in writing to his father which i did with all due courtesy and respect by that days post i mentioned as my reason for arriving at this decisionfirst that i had found it impossible to win the confidence of his son secondly that his son had that morning suddenly and mysteriously left my house for london and that i must decline accepting any further responsibility toward him as the necessary consequence  i had put my letter in the postbag and was beginning to feel a little easier after having written it when my housekeeper appeared in the study with a very grave face and with something hidden apparently in her closed hand  would you please look sir at what we have found in the gentlemans bedroom since he went away this morning  i knew the housekeeper to possess a womans full share of that amicable weakness of the sex which goes by the name of curiosity i had also in various indirect ways become aware that my senior pupils strange departure had largely increased the disposition among the women of my household to regard him as the victim of an unhappy attachment the time was ripe as it seemed to me for checking any further gossip about him and any renewed attempts at prying into his affairs in his absence  your only business in my pupils bedroom i said to the housekeeper is to see that it is kept clean and that it is properly aired there must be no interference if you please with his letters or his papers or with anything else that he has left behind him put back directly whatever you may have found in his room  the housekeeper had her full share of a womans temper as well as of a womans curiosity she listened to me with a rising color and a just perceptible toss of the head  must i put it back sir on the floor between the bed and the wall she inquired with an ironical assumption of the humblest deference to my wishes thats where the girl found it when she was sweeping the room anybody can see for themselves pursued the housekeeper indignantly that the poor gentleman has gone away brokenhearted and there in my opinion is the hussy who is the cause of it  with those words she made me a low curtsey and laid a small photographic portrait on the desk at which i was sitting  i looked at the photograph  in an instant my heart was beating wildlymy head turned giddythe housekeeper the furniture the walls of the room all swayed and whirled round me  the portrait that had been found in my senior pupils bedroom was the portrait of jeromette  ix  i had sent the housekeeper out of my study i was alone with the photograph of the frenchwoman on my desk  there could surely be little doubt about the discovery that had burst upon me the man who had stolen his way into my house driven by the terror of a temptation that he dared not reveal and the man who had been my unknown rival in the bygone time were one and the same  recovering selfpossession enough to realize this plain truth the inferences that followed forced their way into my mind as a matter of course the unnamed person who was the obstacle to my pupils prospects in life the unnamed person in whose company he was assailed by temptations which made him tremble for himself stood revealed to me now as being in all human probability no other than jeromette had she bound him in the fetters of the marriage which he had himself proposed had she discovered his place of refuge in my house and was the letter that had been delivered to him of her writing assuming these questions to be answered in the affirmative what in that case was his business in london i remembered how he had spoken to me of his temptations i recalled the expression that had crossed his face when he recognized the handwriting on the letterand the conclusion that followed literally shook me to the soul ordering my horse to be saddled i rode instantly to the railwaystation  the train by which he had traveled to london had reached the terminus nearly an hour since the one useful course that i could take by way of quieting the dreadful misgivings crowding one after another on my mind was to telegraph to jeromette at the address at which i had last seen her i sent the subjoined messageprepaying the reply  if you are in any trouble telegraph to me i will be with you by the first train answer in any case  there was nothing in the way of the immediate dispatch of my message and yet the hours passed and no answer was received by the advice of the clerk i sent a second telegram to the london office requesting an explanation the reply came back in these terms  improvements in street houses pulled down no trace of person named in telegram  i mounted my horse and rode back slowly to the rectory  the day of his return to me will bring with it the darkest days of my life i shall die young and die miserably have you interest enough still left in me to wish to hear of it  you  shall hear of it those words were in my memory while i rode home in the cloudless moonlight night they were so vividly present to me that i could hear again her pretty foreign accent her quiet clear tones as she spoke them for the rest the emotions of that memorable day had worn me out the answer from the telegraph office had struck me with a strange and stony despair my mind was a blank i had no thoughts i had no tears  i was about halfway on my road home and i had just heard the clock of a village church strike ten when i became conscious little by little of a chilly sensation slowly creeping through and through me to the bones the warm balmy air of a summer night was abroad it was the month of july in the month of july was it possible that any living creature in good health could feel cold it was not possibleand yet the chilly sensation still crept through and through me to the bones  i looked up i looked all round me  my horse was walking along an open highroad neither trees nor waters were near me on either side the flat fields stretched away bright and broad in the moonlight  i stopped my horse and looked round me again  yes i saw it with my own eyes i saw it a pillar of white mistbetween five and six feet high as well as i could judgewas moving beside me at the edge of the road on my left hand when i stopped the white mist stopped when i went on the white mist went on i pushed my horse to a trotthe pillar of mist was with me i urged him to a gallopthe pillar of mist was with me i stopped him againthe pillar of mist stood still  the white color of it was the white color of the fog which i had seen over the riveron the night when i had gone to bid her farewell and the chill which had then crept through me to the bones was the chill that was creeping through me now  i went on again slowly the white mist went on again slowlywith the clear bright night all round it  i was awed rather than frightened there was one moment and one only when the fear came to me that my reason might be shaken i caught myself keeping time to the slow tramp of the horses feet with the slow utterances of these words repeated over and over again jeromette is dead jeromette is dead but my will was still my own i was able to control myself to impose silence on my own muttering lips and i rode on quietly and the pillar of mist went quietly with me  my groom was waiting for my return at the rectory gate i pointed to the mist passing through the gate with me  do you see anything there i said  the man looked at me in astonishment  i entered the rectory the housekeeper met me in the hall i pointed to the mist entering with me  do you see anything at my side i asked  the housekeeper looked at me as the groom had looked at me  i am afraid you are not well sir she said your color is all goneyou are shivering let me get you a glass of wine  i went into my study on the groundfloor and took the chair at my desk the photograph still lay where i had left it the pillar of mist floated round the table and stopped opposite to me behind the photograph  the housekeeper brought in the wine i put the glass to my lips and set it down again the chill of the mist was in the wine there was no taste no reviving spirit in it the presence of the housekeeper oppressed me my dog had followed her into the room the presence of the animal oppressed me i said to the woman leave me by myself and take the dog with you  they went out and left me alone in the room  i sat looking at the pillar of mist hovering opposite to me  it lengthened slowly until it reached to the ceiling as it lengthened it grew bright and luminous a time passed and a shadowy appearance showed itself in the center of the light little by little the shadowy appearance took the outline of a human form soft brown eyes tender and melancholy looked at me through the unearthly light in the mist the head and the rest of the face broke next slowly on my view then the figure gradually revealed itself moment by moment downward and downward to the feet she stood before me as i had last seen her in her purplemerino dress with the blacksilk apron with the white handkerchief tied loosely round her neck she stood before me in the gentle beauty that i remembered so well and looked at me as she had looked when she gave me her last kisswhen her tears had dropped on my cheek  i fell on my knees at the table i stretched out my hands to her imploringly i said speak to meo once again speak to me jeromette  her eyes rested on me with a divine compassion in them she lifted her hand and pointed to the photograph on my desk with a gesture which bade me turn the card i turned it the name of the man who had left my house that morning was inscribed on it in her own handwriting  i looked up at her again when i had read it she lifted her hand once more and pointed to the handkerchief round her neck as i looked at it the fair white silk changed horribly in colorthe fair white silk became darkened and drenched in blood  a moment moreand the vision of her began to grow dim by slow degrees the figure then the face faded back into the shadowy appearance that i had first seen the luminous inner light died out in the white mist the mist itself dropped slowly downwardfloated a moment in airy circles on the floorvanished nothing was before me but the familiar wall of the room and the photograph lying face downward on my desk  x  the next day the newspapers reported the discovery of a murder in london a frenchwoman was the victim she had been killed by a wound in the throat the crime had been discovered between ten and eleven oclock on the previous night  i leave you to draw your conclusion from what i have related my own faith in the reality of the apparition is immovable i say and believe that jeromette kept her word with me she died young and died miserably and i heard of it from herself  take up the trial again and look at the circumstances that were revealed during the investigation in court his motive for murdering her is there  you will see that she did indeed marry him privately that they lived together contentedly until the fatal day when she discovered that his fancy had been caught by another woman that violent quarrels took place between them from that time to the time when my sermon showed him his own deadly hatred toward her reflected in the case of another man that she discovered his place of retreat in my house and threatened him by letter with the public assertion of her conjugal rights lastly that a man variously described by different witnesses was seen leaving the door of her lodgings on the night of the murder the lawadvancing no further than thismay have discovered circumstances of suspicion but no certainty the law in default of direct evidence to convict the prisoner may have rightly decided in letting him go free  but i persisted in believing that the man was guilty i declare that he and he alone was the murderer of jeromette and now you know why     miss mina and the groom  i  i hear that the shocking story of my conduct was widely circulated at the ball and that public opinion among the ladies in every part of the room declared i had disgraced myself but there was one dissentient voice in this chorus of general condemnation you spoke madam with all the authority of your wide celebrity and your high rank you said i am personally a stranger to the young lady who is the subject of remark if i venture to interfere it is only to remind you that there are two sides to every question may i ask if you have waited to pass sentence until you have heard what the person accused has to say in her own defense  these just and generous words produced if i am correctly informed a dead silence not one of the women who had condemned me had heard me in my own defense not one of them ventured to answer you  how i may stand in the opinions of such persons as these is a matter of perfect indifference to me my one anxiety is to show that i am not quite unworthy of your considerate interference in my favor will you honor me by reading what i have to say for myself in these pages  i will pass as rapidly as i can over the subject of my family and i will abstain in deference to motives of gratitude and honor from mentioning surnames in my narrative  my father was the second son of an english nobleman a german lady was his first wife and my mother left a widower he married for the second time the new wife being of american birth she took a stepmothers dislike to mewhich in some degree at least i must own that i deserved  when the newly married pair went to the united states they left me in england by my own desire to live under the protection of my unclea general in the army this good mans marriage had been childless and his wife lady claudia was perhaps on that account as kindly ready as her husband to receive me in the character of an adopted daughter i may add here that i bear my german mothers christian name wilhelmina all my friends in the days when i had friends used to shorten this to mina be my friend so far and call me mina too  after these few words of introduction will your patience bear with me if i try to make you better acquainted with my uncle and aunt and if i allude to circumstances connected with my new life which had as i fear some influence in altering my character for the worse  ii  when i think of the good generals fatherly kindness to me i really despair of writing about him in terms that do justice to his nature to own the truth the tears get into my eyes and the lines mingle in such confusion that i cannot read them myself as for my relations with my aunt i only tell the truth when i say that she performed her duties toward me without the slightest pretension and in the most charming manner  at nearly fifty years old lady claudia was still admired though she had lost the one attraction which distinguished her before my timethe attraction of a perfectly beautiful figure with fine hair and expressive eyes she was otherwise a plain woman her unassuming cleverness and her fascinating manners were the qualities no doubt which made her popular everywhere we never quarreled not because i was always amiable but because my aunt would not allow it she managed me as she managed her husband with perfect tact with certain occasional checks she absolutely governed the general there were eccentricities in his character which made him a man easily ruled by a clever woman deferring to his opinion so far as appearances went lady claudia generally contrived to get her own way in the end except when he was at his club happy in his gossip his good dinners and his whist my excellent uncle lived under a despotism in the happy delusion that he was master in his own house  prosperous and pleasant as it appeared on the surface my life had its sad side for a young woman  in the commonplace routine of our existence as wealthy people in the upper rank there was nothing to ripen the growth of any better capacities which may have been in my nature heartily as i loved and admired my uncle he was neither of an age nor of a character to be the chosen depositary of my most secret thoughts the friend of my inmost heart who could show me how to make the best and the most of my life with friends and admirers in plenty i had found no one who could hold this position toward me in the midst of society i was unconsciously a lonely woman  as i remember them my hours of happiness were the hours when i took refuge in my music and my books out of the house my one diversion always welcome and always fresh was riding without any false modesty i may mention that i had lovers as well as admirers but not one of them produced an impression on my heart in all that related to the tender passion as it is called i was an undeveloped being the influence that men have on women because they are men was really and truly a mystery to me i was ashamed of my own coldnessi tried honestly tried to copy other girls to feel my heart beating in the presence of the one chosen man it was not to be done when a man pressed my hand i felt it in my rings instead of my heart  these confessions made i have done with the past and may now relate the events which my enemies among the ladies have described as presenting a shocking story  iii  we were in london for the season one morning i went out riding with my uncle as usual in hyde park  the generals service in the army had been in a cavalry regimentservice distinguished by merits which justified his rapid rise to the high places in his profession in the huntingfield he was noted as one of the most daring and most accomplished riders in our county he had always delighted in riding young and highspirited horses and the habit remained with him after he had quitted the active duties of his profession in later life from first to last he had met with no accident worth remembering until the unlucky morning when he went out with me  his horse a fiery chestnut ran away with him in that part of the parkride call ed rotten row with the purpose of keeping clear of other riders he spurred his runaway horse at the rail which divides the row from the grassy inclosure at its side the terrified animal swerved in taking the leap and dashed him against a tree he was dreadfully shaken and injured but his strong constitution carried him through to recoverywith the serious drawback of an incurable lameness in one leg  the doctors on taking leave of their patient united in warning him at his age and bearing in mind his weakened leg to ride no more restive horses a quiet cob general they all suggested my uncle was sorely mortified and offended if i am fit for nothing but a quiet cob he said bitterly i will ride no more he kept his word no one ever saw the general on horseback again  under these sad circumstances and my aunt being no horsewoman i had apparently no other choice than to give up riding also but my kindhearted uncle was not the man to let me be sacrificed to his own disappointment his ridinggroom had been one of his soldierservants in the cavalry regimenta quaint sour tempered old man not at all the sort of person to attend on a young lady taking her ridingexercise alone we must find a smart fellow who can be trusted said the general i shall inquire at the club  for a week afterward a succession of grooms recommended by friends applied for the vacant place  the general found insurmountable objections to all of them ill tell you what i have done he announced one day with the air of a man who had hit on a grand discovery i have advertised in the papers  lady claudia looked up from her embroidery with the placid smile that was peculiar to her i dont quite like advertising for a servant she said you are at the mercy of a stranger you dont know that you are not engaging a drunkard or a thief  or you may be deceived by a false character i added on my side i seldom ventured at domestic consultations on giving my opinion unaskedbut the new groom represented a subject in which i felt a strong personal interest in a certain sense he was to be my groom  im much obliged to you both for warning me that i am so easy to deceive the general remarked satirically unfortunately the mischief is done three men have answered my advertisement already i expect them here tomorrow to be examined for the place  lady claudia looked up from her embroidery again are you going to see them yourself she asked softly i thought the steward  i have hitherto considered myself a better judge of a groom than my steward the general interposed however dont be alarmed i wont act on my own sole responsibility after the hint you have given me you and mina shall lend me your valuable assistance and discover whether they are thieves drunkards and what not before i feel the smallest suspicion of it myself  iv  we naturally supposed that the general was joking no this was one of those rare occasions on which lady claudias tactinfallible in matters of importanceproved to be at fault in a trifle my uncles selfesteem had been touched in a tender place and he had resolved to make us feel it the next morning a polite message came requesting our presence in the library to see the grooms my aunt always ready with her smile but rarely tempted into laughing outright did for once laugh heartily it is really too ridiculous she said however she pursued her policy of always yielding in the first instance we went together to the library  the three grooms were received in the order in which they presented themselves for approval two of them bore the ineffaceable mark of the publichouse so plainly written on their villainous faces that even i could see it my uncle ironically asked us to favor him with our opinions lady claudia answered with her sweetest smile pardon me generalwe are here to learn the words were nothing but the manner in which they were spoken was perfect few men could have resisted that gentle influenceand the general was not one of the few he stroked his mustache and returned to his petticoat government the two grooms were dismissed  the entry of the third and last man took me completely by surprise  if the strangers short coat and light trousers had not proclaimed his vocation in life i should have taken it for granted that there had been some mistake and that we were favored with a visit from a gentleman unknown he was between dark and light in complexion with frank clear blue eyes quiet and intelligent if appearances were to be trusted easy in his movements respectful in his manner but perfectly free from servility i say the general blurted out addressing my aunt confidentially he looks as if he would do doesnt he  the appearance of the new man seemed to have had the same effect on lady claudia which it had produced on me but she got over her first feeling of surprise sooner than i did you know best she answered with the air of a woman who declined to trouble herself by giving an opinion  step forward my man said the general the groom advanced from the door bowed and stopped at the foot of the tablemy uncle sitting at the head with my aunt and myself on either side of him the inevitable questions began  what is your name  michael bloomfield  your age  twentysix  my aunts want of interest in the proceedings expressed itself by a little weary sigh she leaned back resignedly in her chair  the general went on with his questions what experience have you had as a groom  i began learning my work sir before i was twelve years old  yes yes i mean what private families have you served in  two sir  how long have you been in your two situations  four years in the first and three in the second  the general looked agreeably surprised seven years in only two situations is a good character in itself he remarked who are your references  the groom laid two papers on the table  i dont take written references said the general  be pleased to read my papers sir answered the groom  my uncle looked sharply across the table the groom sustained the look with respectful but unshaken composure the general took up the papers and seemed to be once more favorably impressed as he read them personal references in each case if required in support of strong written recommendations from both his employers he informed my aunt copy the addresses mina very satisfactory i must say dont you think so yourself he resumed turning again to my aunt  lady claudia replied by a courteous bend of her head the general went on with his questions they related to the management of horses and they were answered to his complete satisfaction  michael bloomfield you know your business he said and you have a good character leave your address when i have consulted your references you shall hear from me  the groom took out a blank card and wrote his name and address on it i looked over my uncles shoulder when he received the card another surprise the handwriting was simply irreproachablethe lines running perfectly straight and every letter completely formed as this perplexing person made his modest bow and withdrew the general struck by an afterthought called him back from the door  one thing more said my uncle about friends and followers i consider it my duty to my servants to allow them to see their relations but i expect them to submit to certain conditions in return  i beg your pardon sir the groom interposed i shall not give you any trouble on that score i have no relations  no brothers or sisters asked the general  none sir  father and mother both dead  i dont know sir  you dont know what does that mean  i am telling you the plain truth sir i never heard who my father and mother wereand i dont expect to hear now  he said those words with a bitter composure which impressed me painfully lady claudia was far from feeling it as i did her languid interest in the engagement of the groom seemed to be completely exhaustedand that was all she rose in her easy graceful way and looked out of the window at the courtyard and fountain the housedog in his kennel and the box of flowers in the coachmans window  in the meanwhile the groom remained near the table respectfully waiting for his dismissal the general spoke to him sharply for the first time i could see that my good uncle had noticed the cruel tone of that passing reference to the parents and thought of it as i did  one word more before you go he said if i dont find you more mercifully inclined toward my horses than you seem to be toward your father and mother you wont remain long in my service you might have told me you had never heard who your parents were without speaking as if you didnt care to hear  may i say a bold word sir in my own defense  he put the question very quietly but at the same time so firmly that he even surprised my aunt she looked round from the windowthen turned back again and stretched out her hand toward the curtain intending as i supposed to alter the arrangement of it the groom went on  may i ask sir why i should care about a father and mother who deserted me mind what you are about my lady he criedsuddenly addressing my aunt theres a cat in the folds of that curtain she might frighten you  he had barely said the words before the housekeepers large tabby cat taking its noonday siesta in the loopedup fold of the curtain leaped out and made for the door  lady claudia was naturally enough a little perplexed by the mans discovery of an animal completely hidden in the curtain she appeared to think that a person who was only a groom had taken a liberty in presuming to puzzle her like her husband she spoke to michael sharply  did you see the cat she asked  no my lady  then how did you know the creature was in the curtain  for the first time since he had entered the room the groom looked a little confused  its a sort of presumption for a man in my position to be subject to a nervous infirmity he answered i am one of those persons the weakness is not uncommon as your ladyship is aware who know by their own unpleasant sensations when a cat is in the room it goes a little further than that with me the antipathy as the gentlefolks call it tells me in what part of the room the cat is  my aunt turned to her husband without attempting to conceal that she took no sort of interest in the grooms antipathies  havent you done with the man yet she asked  the general gave the groom his dismissal  you shall hear from me in three days time goodmorning  michael bloomfield seemed to have noticed my aunts ungracious manner he looked at her for a moment with steady attention before he left the room  v  you dont mean to engage that man said lady claudia as the door closed  why not asked my uncle  i have taken a dislike to him  this short answer was so entirely out of the character of my aunt that the general took her kindly by the hand and said  i am afraid you are not well  she irritably withdrew her hand  i dont feel well it doesnt matter  it does matter claudia what can i do for you  write to the man she paused and smiled contemptuously imagine a groom with an antipathy to cats she said turning to me i dont know what you think mina i have a strong objection myself to servants who hold themselves above their position in life write she resumed addressing her husband and tell him to look for another place  what objection can i make to him the general asked helplessly  good heavens cant you make an excuse say he is too young  my uncle looked at me in expressive silencewalked slowly to the writingtableand glanced at his wife in the faint hope that she might change her mind their eyes metand she seemed to recover the command of her temper she put her hand caressingly on the generals shoulder  i remember the time she said softly when any caprice of mine was a command to you ah i was younger then  the generals reception of this little advance was thoroughly characteristic of him he first kissed lady claudias hand and then he wrote the letter my aunt rewarded him by a look and left the library  what the deuce is the matter with her my uncle said to me when we were alone do you dislike the man too  certainly not as far as i can judge he appears to be just the sort of person we want  and knows thoroughly well how to manage horses my dear what can be your aunts objection to him  as the words passed his lips lady claudia opened the library door  i am so ashamed of myself she said sweetly at my age i have been behaving like a spoiled child how good you are to me general let me try to make amends for my misconduct will you permit me  she took up the generals letter without waiting for permission tore it to pieces smiling pleasantly all the while and threw the fragments into the wastepaper basket as if you didnt know better than i do she said kissing him on the forehead engage the man by all means  she left the room for the second time for the second time my uncle looked at me in blank perplexityand i looked back at him in the same condition of mind the sound of the luncheon bell was equally a relief to both of us not a word more was spoken on the subject of the new groom his references were verified and he entered the generals service in three days time  vi  always careful in anything that concerned my welfare no matter how trifling it might be my uncle did not trust me alone with the new groom when he first entered our service two old friends of the general accompanied me at his special request and reported the man to be perfectly competent and trustworthy after that michael rode out with me alone my friends among young ladies seldom caring to accompany me when i abandoned the park for the quiet country roads on the north and west of london was it wrong in me to talk to him on these expeditions it would surely have been treating a man like a brute never to take the smallest notice of himespecially as his conduct was uniformly respectful toward me not once by word or look did he presume on the position which my favor permitted him to occupy  ought i to blush when i confess though he was only a groom that he interested me  in the first place there was something romantic in the very blankness of the story of his life  he had been left in his infancy in the stables of a gentleman living in kent near the highroad between gravesend and rochester the same day the stableboy had met a woman running out of the yard pursued by the dog she was a stranger and was not welldressed while the boy was protecting her by chaining the dog to his kennel she was quick enough to place herself beyond the reach of pursuit  the infants clothing proved on examination to be of the finest linen he was warmly wrapped in a beautiful shawl of some foreign manufacture entirely unknown to all the persons present including the master and mistress of the house among the folds of the shawl there was discovered an open letter without date signature or address which it was presumed the woman must have forgotten  like the shawl the paper was of foreign manufacture the handwriting presented a strongly marked character and the composition plainly revealed the mistakes of a person imperfectly acquainted with the english language the contents of the letter after alluding to the means supplied for the support of the child announced that the writer had committed the folly of inclosing a sum of a hundred pounds in a banknote to pay expenses in a postscript an appointment was made for a meeting in six months time on the eastward side of london bridge the stableboys description of the woman who had passed him showed that she belonged to the lower class to such a person a hundred pounds would be a fortune she had no doubt abandoned the child and made off with the money  no trace of her was ever discovered on the day of the appointment the police watched the eastward side of london bridge without obtaining any result through the kindness of the gentleman in whose stable he had been found the first ten years of the boys life were passed under the protection of a charitable asylum they gave him the name of one of the little inmates who had died and they sent him out to service before he was eleven years old he was harshly treated and ran away wandered to some trainingstables near newmarket attracted the favorable notice of the headgroom was employed among the other boys and liked the occupation growing up to manhood he had taken service in private families as a groom this was the story of twentysix years of michaels life  but there was something in the man himself which attracted attention and made one think of him in his absence  i mean by this that there was a spirit of resistance to his destiny in him which is very rarely found in servingmen of his order i remember accompanying the general on one of his periodical visits of inspection to the stable he was so well satisfied that he proposed extending his investigations to the grooms own room  if you don object michael he added with his customary consideration for the selfrespect of all persons in his employment michaels color rose a little he looked at me i am afraid the young lady will not find my room quite so tidy as it ought to be he said as he opened the door for us  the only disorder in the grooms room was produced to our surprise by the grooms books and papers  cheap editions of the english poets translations of latin and greek classics handbooks for teaching french and german without a master carefully written exercises in both languages manuals of shorthand with more exercises in that art were scattered over the table round the central object of a readinglamp which spoke plainly of studies by night why what is all this cried the general are you going to leave me michael and set up a school michael answered in sad submissive tones i try to improve myself sirthough i sometimes lose heart and hope hope of what asked my uncle are you not content to be a servant must you rise in the world as the saying is the groom shrank a little at that abrupt question if i had relations to care for me and help me along the hard ways of life he said i might be satisfied sir to remain as i am as it is i have no one to think about but myselfand i am foolish enough sometimes to look beyond myself  so far i had kept silence but i could no longer resist giving him a word of encouragementhis confession was so sadly and so patiently made you speak too harshly of yourself i said the best and greatest men have begun like you by looking beyond themselves for a moment our eyes met i admired the poor lonely fellow trying so modestly and so bravely to teach himselfand i did not care to conceal it he was the first to look away some suppressed emotion turned him deadly pale was i the cause of it i felt myself tremble as that bold question came into my mind the general with one sharp glance at me diverted the talk not very delicately as i thought to the misfortune of michaels birth  i have heard of your being deserted in your infancy by some woman unknown he said what has become of the things you were wrapped in and the letter that was found on you they might lead to a discovery one of these days the groom smiled the last master i served thought of it as you do sir he was so good as to write to the gentleman who was first burdened with the care of meand the things were sent to me in return  he took up an unlocked leather bag which opened by touching a brass knob and showed us the shawl the linen sadly faded by time and the letter we were puzzled by the shawl my uncle who had served in the east thought it looked like a very rare kind of persian work we examined with interest the letter and the fine linen when michael quietly remarked as we handed them back to him they keep the secret you see we could only look at each other and own there was nothing more to be said  vii  that night lying awake thinking i made my first discovery of a great change that had come over me i felt like a new woman  never yet had my life been so enjoyable to me as it was now i was conscious of a delicious lightness of heart the simplest things pleased me i was ready to be kind to everybody and to admire everything even the familiar scenery of my rides in the park developed beauties which i had never noticed before the enchantments of music affected me to tears i was absolutely in love with my dogs and my birdsand as for my maid i bewildered the girl with presents and gave her holidays almost before she could ask for them in a bodily sense i felt an extraordinary accession of strength and activity i romped with the dear old general and actually kissed lady claudia one morning instead of letting her kiss me as usual my friends noticed my new outburst of gayety and spiritand wondered what had produced it i can honestly say that i wondered too only on that wakeful night which followed our visit to michaels room did i arrive at something like a clear understanding of myself the next morning completed the process of enlightenment i went out riding as usual the instant when michael put his hand under my foot as i sprang into the saddle his touch flew all over me like a flame i knew who had made a new woman of me from that moment  as to describing the first sense of confusion that overwhelmed me even if i were a practiced writer i should be incapable of doing it i pulled down my veil and rode on in a sort of trance fortunately for me our house looked on the park and i had only to cross the road otherwise i should have met with some accident if i had ridden through the streets to this day i dont know where i rode the horse went his own way quietlyand the groom followed me  the groom is there any human creature so free from the hateful and antichristian pride of rank as a woman who loves with all her heart and soul for the first time in her life i only tell the truth in however unfavorable a light it may place me when i declare that my confusion was entirely due to the discovery that i was in love i was not ashamed of myself for being in love with the groom i had given my heart to the man what did the accident of his position matter put money into his pocket and a title before his nameby another accident in speech manners and attainments he would be a gentleman worthy of his wealth and worthy of his rank  even the natural dread of what my relations and friends might say if they discovered my secret seemed to be a sensation so unworthy of me and of him that i looked round and called to him to speak to me and asked him questions about himself which kept him riding nearly side by side with me ah how i enjoyed the gentle deference and respect of his manner as he answered me he was hardly bold enough to raise his eyes to mine when i looked at him absorbed in the paradise of my own making i rode on slowly and was only aware that friends had passed and had recognized me by seeing him touch his hat i looked round and discovered the women smiling ironically as they rode by that one circumstance roused me rudely from my dream i let michael fall back again to his proper place and quickened my horses pace angry with myself angry with the world in general then suddenly changing and being fool enough and child enough to feel ready to cry how long these varying moods lasted i dont know on returning i slipped off my horse without waiting for michael to help me and ran into the house without even wishing him goodday  viii  after taking off my ridinghabit and cooling my hot face with eaudecologne and water i went down to the room which we called the morningroom the piano there was my favorite instrument and i had the idea of trying what music would do toward helping me to compose myself  as i sat down before the piano i heard the opening of the door of the breakfastroom separated from me by a curtained archway and the voice of lady claudia asking if michael had returned to the stable on the servants reply in the affirmative she desired that he might be sent to her immediately  no doubt i ought either to have left the morningroom or to have let my aunt know of my presence there i did neither the one nor the other her first dislike of michael had to all appearance subsided she had once or twice actually taken opportunities of speaking to him kindly i believed this was due to the caprice of the moment the tone of her voice too suggested on this occasion that she had some spiteful object in view in sending for him i knew it was unworthy of meand yet i deliberately waited to hear what passed between them  lady claudia began  you were out riding today with miss mina  yes my lady  turn to the light i wish to see people when i speak to them you were observed by some friends of mine your conduct excited remark do you know your business as a ladys groom  i have had seven years experience my lady  your business is to ride at a certain distance behind your mistress has your experience taught you that  yes my lady  you were not riding behind miss minayour horse was almost side by side with hers do you deny it  no my lady  you behaved with the greatest improprietyyou were seen talking to miss mina do you deny that  no my lady  leave the room no come back have you any excuse to make  none my lady  your insolence is intolerable i shall speak to the general  the sound of the closing door followed  i knew now what the smiles meant on the false faces of those womenfriends of mine who had met me in the park an ordinary man in michaels place would have mentioned my own encouragement of him as a sufficient excuse he with the inbred delicacy and reticence of a gentleman had taken all the blame on himself indignant and ashamed i advanced to the breakfastroom bent on instantly justifying him drawing aside the curtain i was startled by a sound as of a person sobbing i cautiously looked in lady claudia was prostrate on the sofa hiding her face in her hands in a passion of tears  i withdrew completely bewildered the extraordinary contradictions in my aunts conduct were not at an end yet later in the day i went to my uncle resolved to set michael right in his estimation and to leave him to speak to lady claudia the general was in the lowest spirits he shook his head ominously the moment i mentioned the grooms name i dare say the man meant no harmbut the thing has been observed i cant have you made the subject of scandal mina my wife makes a point of itmichael must go  you dont mean to say that she has insisted on your sending michael away  before he could answer me a footman appeared with a message my lady wishes to see you sir  the general rose directly my curiosity had got by this time beyond all restraint i was actually indelicate enough to ask if i might go with him he stared at me as well he might i persisted i said i particularly wished to see lady claudia my uncles punctilious good breeding still resisted me your aunt may wish to speak to me in private he said wait a moment and i will send for you  i was incapable of waiting my obstinacy was something superhuman the bare idea that michael might lose his place through my fault made me desperate i suppose i wont trouble you to send for me i persisted i will go with you at once as far as the door and wait to hear if i may come in the footman was still present holding the door open the general gave way i kept so close behind him that my aunt saw me as her husband entered the room come in mina she said speaking and looking like the charming lady claudia of everyday life was this the woman whom i had seen crying her heart out on the sofa hardly an hour ago  on second thoughts she continued turning to the general i fear i may have been a little hasty pardon me for troubling you about it againhave you spoken to michael yet no then let us err on the side of kindness let us look over his misconduct this time  my uncle was evidently relieved i seized the opportunity of making my confession and taking the whole blame on myself lady claudia stopped me with the perfect grace of which she was mistress  my good child dont distress yourself dont make mountains out of molehills she patted me on the cheek with two plump white fingers which felt deadly cold i was not always prudent mina when i was your age besides your curiosity is naturally excited about a servant who iswhat shall i call hima foundling  she paused and fixed her eyes on me attentively what did he tell you she asked is it a very romantic story  the general began to fidget in his chair if i had kept my attention on him i should have seen in his face a warning to me to be silent but my interest at the moment was absorbed in my aunt encouraged by her amiable reception i was not merely unsuspicious of the trap that she had set for mei was actually foolish enough to think that i could improve michaels position in her estimation remember that i was in love with him by telling his story exactly as i have already told it in these pages i spoke with fervor will you believe ither humor positively changed again she flew into a passion with me for the first time in her life  lies she cried impudent lies on the face of theminvented to appeal to your interest how dare you repeat them general if mina had not brought it on herself this mans audacity would justify you in instantly dismissing him dont you agree with me  the generals sense of fair play roused him for once into openly opposing his wife  you are completely mistaken he said mina and i have both had the shawl and the letter in our handsand what was there besidesah yes the very linen the child was wrapped in  what there was in those words to check lady claudias anger in its full flow i was quite unable to understand if her husband had put a pistol to her head he could hardly have silenced her more effectually she did not appear to be frightened or ashamed of her outbreak of rageshe sat vacant and speechless with her eyes on the general and her hands crossed on her lap after waiting a moment wondering as i did what it meant my uncle rose with his customary resignation and left her i followed him he was unusually silent and thoughtful not a word passed between us i afterward discovered that he was beginning to fear poor man that his wifes mind must be affected in some way and was meditating a consultation with the physician who helped us in cases of need  as for myself i was either too stupid or too innocent to feel any positive forewarning of the truth so far after luncheon while i was alone in the conservatory my maid came to me from michael asking if i had any commands for him in the afternoon i thought this rather odd but it occurred to me that he might want some hours to himself i made the inquiry  to my astonishment the maid announced that lady claudia had employed michael to go on an errand for her the nature of the errand was to take a letter to her bookseller and to bring back the books which she had ordered with three idle footmen in the house whose business it was to perform such service as this why had she taken the groom away from his work the question obtained such complete possession of my mind that i actually summoned courage enough to go to my aunt i said i had thought of driving out in my ponycarriage that afternoon and i asked if she objected to sending one of the three indoor servants for her books in michaels place  she received me with a strange hard stare and answered with obstinate selfpossession i wish michael to go no explanation followed with reason or without it agreeable to me or not agreeable to me she wished michael to go  i begged her pardon for interfering and replied that i would give up the idea of driving on that day she made no further remark i left the room determining to watch her there is no defense for my conduct it was mean and unbecoming no doubt i was drawn on by some force in me which i could not even attempt to resist indeed indeed i am not a mean person by nature  at first i thought of speaking to michael not with any special motive but simply because i felt drawn toward him as the guide and helper in whom my heart trusted at this crisis in my life a little consideration however suggested to me that i might be seen speaking to him and might so do him an injury while i was still hesitating the thought came to me that my aunts motive for sending him to her bookseller might be to get him out of her way  out of her way in the house no his place was not in the house out of her way in the stable the next instant the idea flashed across my mind of watching the stable door  the best bedrooms my room included were all in front of the house i went up to my maids room which looked on the courtyard ready with my excuse if she happened to be there she was not there i placed myself at the window in full view of the stable opposite  an interval elapsedlong or short i cannot say which i was too much excited to look at my watch all i know is that i discovered her she crossed the yard after waiting to make sure that no one was there to see her and she entered the stable by the door which led to that part of the building occupied by michael this time i looked at my watch  forty minutes passed before i saw her again and then instead of appearing at the door she showed herself at the window of michaels room throwing it wide open i concealed myself behind the window curtain just in time to escape discovery as she looked up at the house she next appeared in the yard hurrying back i waited a while trying to compose myself in case i met any one on the stairs there was little danger of a meeting at that hour the general was at his club the servants were at their tea i reached my own room without being seen by any one and locked myself in  what had my aunt been doing for forty minutes in michaels room and why had she opened the window  i spare you my reflections on these perplexing questions a convenient headache saved me from the ordeal of meeting lady claudia at the dinnertable i passed a restless and miserable night conscious that i had found my way blindly as it were to some terrible secret which might have its influence on my whole future life and not knowing what to think or what to do next even then i shrank instinctively from speaking to my uncle this was not wonderful but i felt afraid to speak to michaeland that perplexed and alarmed me consideration for lady claudia was certainly not the motive that kept me silent after what i had seen  the next morning my pale face abundantly justified the assertion that i was still ill  my aunt always doing her maternal duty toward me came herself to inquire after my health before i was out of my room so certain was she of not having been observed on the previous dayor so prodigious was her power of controlling herselfthat she actually advised me to go out riding before lunch and try what the fresh air and the exercise would do to relieve me feeling that i must end in speaking to michael it struck me that this would be the one safe way of consulting him in private i accepted her advice and had another approving pat on the cheek from her plump white fingers they no longer struck cold on my skin the customary vital warmth had returned to them her ladyships mind had recovered its tranquillity  ix  i left the house for my morning ride  michael was not in his customary spirits with some difficulty i induced him to tell me the reason he had decided on giving notice to leave his situation in the generals employment as soon as i could command myself i asked what had happened to justify this incomprehensible proceeding on his part he silently offered me a letter it was written by the master whom he had served before he came to us and it announced that an employment as secretary was offered to him in the house of a gentleman who was interested in his creditable efforts to improve his position in the world  what it cost me to preserve the outward appearance of composure as i handed back the letter i am ashamed to tell i spoke to him with some bitterness your wishes are gratified i said i dont wonder that you are eager to leave your place he reined back his horse and repeated my words eager to leave my place i am heartbroken at leaving it i was reckless enough to ask why his head sank i darent tell you he said i went on from one imprudence to another what are you afraid of i asked he suddenly looked up at me his eyes answered you  is it possible to fathom the folly of a woman in love can any sensible person imagine the enormous importance which the veriest trifles assume in her poor little mind i was perfectly satisfiedeven perfectly happy after that one look i rode on briskly for a minute or twothen the forgotten scene at the stable recurred to my memory i resumed a footpace and beckoned to him to speak to me  lady claudias bookseller lives in the city doesnt he i began  yes miss  did you walk both ways  yes  you must have felt tired when you got back  i hardly remember what i felt when i got backi was met by a surprise  may i ask what it was  certainly miss do you remember a black bag of mine  perfectly  when i returned from the city i found the bag open and the things i kept in itthe shawl the linen and the letter  gone  gone  my heart gave one great leap in me and broke into vehement throbbings which made it impossible for me to say a word more i reined up my horse and fixed my eyes on michael he was startled he asked if i felt faint i could only sign to him that i was waiting to hear more  my own belief he proceeded is that some person burned the things in my absence and opened the window to prevent any suspicion being excited by the smell i am certain i shut the window before i left my room when i closed it on my return the fresh air had not entirely removed the smell of burning and what is more i found a heap of ashes in the grate as to the person who has done me this injury and why it has been done those are mysteries beyond my fathomingi beg your pardon missi am sure you are not well might i advise you to return to the house  i accepted his advice and turned back  in the tumult of horror and amazement that filled my mind i could still feel a faint triumph stirring in me through it all when i saw how alarmed and how anxious he was about me nothing more passed between us on the way back confronted by the dreadful discovery that i had now made i was silent and helpless of the guilty persons concerned in the concealment of the birth and in the desertion of the infant my noblyborn highlybred irreproachable aunt now stood revealed before me as one an older woman than i might have been hard put to it to preserve her presence of mind in such a position as mine instinct not reason served me in my sore need instinct not reason kept me passively and stupidly silent when i got back to the house we will talk about it tomorrow was all i could say to michael when he gently lifted me from my horse  i excused myself from appearing at the luncheontable and i drew down the blinds in my sittingroom so that my face might not betray me when lady claudias maternal duty brought her upstairs to make inquiries the same excuse served in both casesmy ride had failed to relieve me of my headache my aunts brief visit led to one result which is worth mentioning the indescribable horror of her that i felt forced the conviction on my mind that we two could live no longer under the same roof while i was still trying to face this alternative with the needful composure my uncle presented himself in some anxiety about my continued illness i should certainly have burst out crying when the kind and dear old man condoled with me if he had not brought news with him which turned back all my thoughts on myself and my aunt michael had shown the general his letter and had given notice to leave lady claudia was present at the time to her husbands amazement she abruptly interfered with a personal request to michael to think better of it and to remain in his place  i should not have troubled you my dear on this unpleasant subject said my uncle if michael had not told me that you were aware of the circumstances under which he feels it his duty to leave us after your aunts interference quite incomprehensible to me the man hardly knows what to do being your groom he begs me to ask if there is any impropriety in his leaving the difficulty to your decision i tell you of his request mina but i strongly advise you to decline taking any responsibility on yourself  i answered mechanically accepting my uncles suggestion while my thoughts were wholly absorbed in this last of the many extraordinary proceedings on lady claudias part since michael had entered the house there are limitsout of books and playsto the innocence of a young unmarried woman after what i had just heard the doubts which had thus far perplexed me were suddenly and completely cleared up i said to my secret self she has some human feeling left if her son goes away she knows that they may never meet again  from the moment when my mind emerged from the darkness i recovered the use of such intelligence and courage as i naturally possessed from this point you will find that right or wrong i saw my way before me and took it  to say that i felt for the general with my whole heart is merely to own that i could be commonly grateful i sat on his knee and laid my cheek against his cheek and thanked him for his long long years of kindness to me he stopped me in his simple generous way why mina you talk as if you were going to leave us i started up and went to the window opening it and complaining of the heat and so concealing from him that he had unconsciously anticipated the event that was indeed to come when i returned to my chair he helped me to recover myself by alluding once more to his wife he feared that her health was in some way impaired in the time when they had first met she was subject to nervous maladies having their origin in a calamity which was never mentioned by either of them in later days she might possibly be suffering again from some other form of nervous derangement and he seriously thought of persuading her to send for medical advice  under ordinary circumstances this vague reference to a calamity would not have excited any special interest in me but my mind was now in a state of morbid suspicion i had not heard how long my uncle and aunt had been married but i remembered that michael had described himself as being twentysix years old bearing these circumstances in mind it struck me that i might be acting wisely in michaels interest if i persuaded the general to speak further of what had happened at the time when he met the woman whom an evil destiny had bestowed on him for a wife nothing but the consideration of serving the man i loved would have reconciled me to making my own secret use of the recollections which my uncle might innocently confide to me as it was i thought the means would in this case he for once justified by the end before we part i have little doubt that you will think so too  i found it an easier task than i had anticipated to turn the talk back again to the days when the general had seen lady claudia for the first time he was proud of the circumstances under which he had won his wife ah how my heart ached for him as i saw his eyes sparkle and the color mount in his fine rugged face  this is the substance of what i heard from him i tell it briefly because it is still painful to me to tell it at all   my uncle had met lady claudia at her fathers country house she had then reappeared in society after a period of seclusion passed partly in england partly on the continent before the date of her retirement she had been engaged to marry a french nobleman equally illustrious by his birth and by his diplomatic services in the east within a few weeks of the weddingday he was drowned by the wreck of his yacht this was the calamity to which my uncle had referred  lady claudias mind was so seriously affected by the dreadful event that the doctors refused to answer for the consequences unless she was at once placed in the strictest retirement her mother and a french maid devotedly attached to her were the only persons whom it was considered safe for the young lady to see until time and care had in some degree composed her her return to her friends and admirers after the necessary interval of seclusion was naturally a subject of sincere rejoicing among the guests assembled in her fathers house my uncles interest in lady claudia soon developed into love they were equals in rank and well suited to each other in age the parents raised no obstacles but they did not conceal from their guest that the disaster which had befallen their daughter was but too likely to disincline her to receive his addresses or any mans addresses favorably to their surprise they proved to be wrong the young lady was touched by the simplicity and the delicacy with which her lover urged his suit she had lived among worldly people this was a man whose devotion she could believe to be sincere they were married  had no unusual circumstances occurred had nothing happened which the general had forgotten nothing  x  it is surely needless that i should stop here to draw the plain inferences from the events just related  any person who remembers that the shawl in which the infant was wrapped came from those eastern regions which were associated with the french noblemans diplomatic servicesalso that the faults of composition in the letter found on the child were exactly the faults likely to have been committed by the french maidany person who follows these traces can find his way to the truth as i found mine  returning for a moment to the hopes which i had formed of being of some service to michael i have only to say that they were at once destroyed when i heard of the death by drowning of the man to whom the evidence pointed as his father the prospect looked equally barren when i thought of the miserable mother that she should openly acknowledge her son in her position was perhaps not to be expected of any woman had she courage enough or in plainer words heart enough to acknowledge him privately  i called to mind again some of the apparent caprices and contradictions in lady claudias conduct on the memorable day when michael had presented himself to fill the vacant place look back with me to the record of what she said and did on that occasion by the light of your present knowledge and you will see that his likeness to his father must have struck her when he entered the room and that his statement of his age must have correctly described the age of her son recall the actions that followed after she had been exhausted by her first successful efforts at selfcontrolthe withdrawal to the window to conceal her face the clutch at the curtain when she felt herself sinking the harshness of manner under which she concealed her emotions when she ventured to speak to him the reiterated inconsistencies and vacillations of conduct that followed all alike due to the protest of nature desperately resisted to the lastand say if i did her injustice when i believed her to be incapable of running the smallest risk of discovery at the prompting of maternal love  there remained then only michael to think of i remember how he had spoken of the unknown parents whom he neither expected nor cared to discover still i could not reconcile it to my conscience to accept a chance outbreak of temper as my sufficient justification for keeping him in ignorance of a discovery which so nearly concerned him it seemed at least to be my duty to make myself acquainted with the true state of his feelings before i decided to bear the burden of silence with me to my grave  what i felt it my duty to do in this serious matter i determined to do at once besides let me honestly own that i felt lonely and desolate oppressed by the critical situation in which i was placed and eager for the relief that it would be to me only to hear the sound of michaels voice i sent my maid to say that i wished to speak to him immediately the crisis was already hanging over my head that one act brought it down  xi  he came in and stood modestly waiting at the door  after making him take a chair i began by saying that i had received his message and that acting on my uncles advice i must abstain from interfering in the question of his leaving or not leaving his place having in this way established a reason for sending for him i alluded next to the loss that he had sustained and asked if he had any prospect of finding out the person who had entered his room in his absence on his reply in the negative i spoke of the serious results to him of the act of destruction that had been committed your last chance of discovering your parents i said has been cruelly destroyed  he smiled sadly you know already miss that i never expected to discover them  i ventured a little nearer to the object i had in view  do you never think of your mother i asked at your age she might be still living can you give up all hope of finding her without feeling your heart ache  if i have done her wrong in believing that she deserted me he answered the heartache is but a poor way of expressing the remorse that i should feel  i ventured nearer still  even if you were right i beganeven it she did desert you  he interrupted me sternly i would not cross the street to see her he said a woman who deserts her child is a monster forgive me for speaking so miss when i see good mothers and their children it maddens me when i think of what my childhood was  hearing these words and watching him attentively while he spoke i could see that my silence would be a mercy not a crime i hastened to speak of other things  if you decide to leave us i said when shall you go  his eyes softened instantly little by little the color faded out of his face as he answered me  the general kindly said when i spoke of leaving my place his voice faltered and he paused to steady it my master he resumed said that i need not keep my new employer waiting by staying for the customary month providedprovided you were willing to dispense with my services  so far i had succeeded in controlling myself at that reply i felt my resolution failing me i saw how he suffered i saw how manfully he struggled to conceal it  i am not willing i said i am sorryvery very sorry to lose you but i will do anything that is for your good i can say no more  he rose suddenly as if to leave the room mastered himself stood for a moment silently looking at methen looked away again and said his parting words  if i succeed miss mina in my new employmentif i get on to higher thingsis itis it presuming too much to ask if i might some dayperhaps when you are out riding aloneif i might speak to youonly to ask if you are well and happy  he could say no more i saw the tears in his eyes saw him shaken by the convulsive breathings which break from men in the rare moments when they cry he forced it back even then he bowed to meoh god he bowed to me as if he were only my servant as if he were too far below me to take my hand even at that moment i could have endured anything else i believe i could still have restrained myself under any other circumstances it matters little now my confession must be made whatever you may think of me i flew to him like a frenzied creaturei threw my arms round his necki said to him oh michael dont you know that i love you and then i laid my head on his breast and held him to me and said no more  in that moment of silence the door of the room was opened i started and looked up lady claudia was standing on the threshold  i saw in her face that she had been listeningshe must have followed him when he was on his way to my room that conviction steadied me i took his hand in mine and stood side by side with him waiting for her to speak first she looked at michael not at me she advanced a step or two and addressed him in these words  it is just possible that you have some sense of decency left leave the room  that deliberate insult was all that i wanted to make me completely mistress of myself i told michael to wait a moment and opened my writing desk i wrote on an envelope the address in london of a faithful old servant who had attended my mother in her last moments i gave it to michael call there tomorrow morning i said you will find me waiting for you  he looked at lady claudia evidently unwilling to leave me alone with her fear nothing i said i am old enough to take care of myself i have only a word to say to this lady before i leave the house with that i took his arm and walked with him to the door and said goodby almost as composedly as if we had been husband and wife already  lady claudias eyes followed me as i shut the door again and crossed the room to a second door which led into my bedchamber she suddenly stepped up to me just as i was entering the room and laid her hand on my arm  what do i see in your face she asked as much of herself as of mewith her eyes fixed in keen inquiry on mine  you shall know directly i answered let me get my bonnet and cloak first  do you mean to leave the house  i do  she rang the bell i quietly dressed myself to go out  the servant answered the bell as i returned to the sittingroom  tell your master i wish to see him instantly said lady claudia  my master has gone out my lady  to his club  i believe so my lady  i will send you with a letter to him come back when i ring again she turned to me as the man withdrew do you refuse to stay here until the general returns  i shall be happy to see the general if you will inclose my address in your letter to him  replying in those terms i wrote the address for the second time lady claudia knew perfectly well when i gave it to her that i was going to a respectable house kept by a woman who had nursed me when i was a child  one last question she said am i to tell the general that it is your intention to marry your groom  her tone stung me into making an answer which i regretted the moment it had passed my lips  you can put it more plainly if you like i said you can tell the general that it is my intention to marry your son  she was near the door on the point of leaving me as i spoke she turned with a ghastly stare of horrorfelt about her with her hands as if she was groping in darknessand dropped on the floor  i instantly summoned help the womenservants carried her to my bed while they were restoring her to herself i wrote a few lines telling the miserable woman how i had discovered her secret  your husbands tranquillity i added is as precious to me as my own as for your son you know what he thinks of the mother who deserted him your secret is safe in my keepingsafe from your husband safe from your son to the end of my life  i sealed up those words and gave them to her when she had come to herself again i never heard from her in reply i have never seen her from that time to this she knows she can trust me  and what did my good uncle say when we next met i would rather report what he did when he had got the better of his first feelings of anger and surprise on hearing of my contemplated marriage he consented to receive us on our weddingday and he gave my husband the appointment which places us both in an independent position for life  but he had his misgivings he checked me when i tried to thank him  come back in a years time he said i will wait to be thanked till the experience of your married life tells me that i have deserved it  the year passed and the general received the honest expression of my gratitude he smiled and kissed me but there was something in his face which suggested that he was not quite satisfied yet  do you believe that i have spoken sincerely i asked  i firmly believe it he answeredand there he stopped  a wiser woman would have taken the hint and dropped the subject my folly persisted in putting another question  tell me uncle havent i proved that i was right when i married my groom  no my dear you have only proved that you are a lucky woman     mr lepel and the housekeeper  first epoch  the italians are born actors  at this conclusion i arrived sitting in a roman theaternow many years since my friend and traveling companion rothsay cordially agreed with me experience had given us some claim to form an opinion we had visited at that time nearly every city in italy whereever a theater was open we had attended the performances of the companies which travel from place to place and we had never seen bad acting from first to last men and women whose names are absolutely unknown in england played in modern comedy and drama for the most part with a general level of dramatic ability which i have never seen equaled in the theaters of other nations incapable italian actors there must be no doubt for my own part i have only discovered them by ones and twos in england appearing among the persons engaged to support salvini and ristori before the audiences of london  on the occasion of which i am now writing the nights performances consisted of two plays an accident to be presently related prevented us from seeing more than the introductory part of the second piece that one actin respect of the influence which the remembrance of it afterward exercised over rothsay and myselfclaims a place of its own in the opening pages of the present narrative  the scene of the story was laid in one of the principalities of italy in the bygone days of the carbonaro conspiracies the chief persons were two young noblemen friends affectionately attached to each other and a beautiful girl born in the lower ranks of life  on the rising of the curtain the scene before us was the courtyard of a prison we found the beautiful girl called celia as well as i can recollect in great distress confiding her sorrows to the jailers daughter her father was pining in the prison charged with an offense of which he was innocent and she herself was suffering the tortures of hopeless love she was on the point of confiding her secret to her friend when the appearance of the young nobleman closed her lips the girls at once withdrew and the two friendswhom i now only remember as the marquis and the countbegan the dialogue which prepared us for the story of the play  the marquis had been tried for conspiracy against the reigning prince and his government had been found guilty and is condemned to be shot that evening he accepts his sentence with the resignation of a man who is weary of his life young as he is he has tried the round of pleasures without enjoyment he has no interests no aspirations no hopes he looks on death as a welcome release his friend the count admitted to a farewell interview has invented a stratagem by which the prisoner may escape and take to flight the marquis expresses a grateful sense of obligation and prefers being shot i dont value my life he says i am not a happy man like you upon this the count mentions circumstances which he has hitherto kept secret he loves the charming celia and loves in vain her reputation is unsullied she possesses every good quality that a man can desire in a wifebut the counts social position forbids him to marry a woman of low birth he is heartbroken and he too finds life without hope a burden that is not to be borne the marquis at once sees a way of devoting himself to his friends interests he is rich his money is at his own disposal he will bequeath a marriage portion to celia which will make her one of the richest women in italy the count receives this proposal with a sigh no money he says will remove the obstacle that still remains my fathers fatal objection to celia is her rank in life the marquis walks apartconsiders a littleconsults his watchand returns with a new idea i have nearly two hours of life still left he says send for celia she was here just now and she is probably in her fathers cell the count is at a loss to understand what this proposal means the marquis explains himself i ask your permission he resumes to offer marriage to celiafor your sake the chaplain of the prison will perform the ceremony before dark the girl you love will be my widow my widow is a lady of titlea fit wife for the greatest nobleman in the land the count protests and refuses in vain the jailer is sent to find celia she appears unable to endure the scene the count rushes out in horror the marquis takes the girl into his confidence and makes his excuses if she becomes a widow of rank she may not only marry the count but will be in a position to procure the liberty of the innocent old man whose strength is failing him under the rigors of imprisonment celia hesitates after a struggle with herself filial love prevails and she consents the jailer announces that the chaplain is waiting the bride and bridegroom withdraw to the prison chapel left on the stage the jailer hears a distant sound in the city which he is at a loss to understand it sinks increases again travels nearer to the prison and now betrays itself as the sound of multitudinous voices in a state of furious uproar has the conspiracy broken out again yes the whole population has risen the soldiers have refused to fire on the people the terrified prince has dismissed his ministers and promises a constitution the marquis returning from the ceremony which has just made celia his wife is presented with a free pardon and with the offer of a high place in the reformed ministry a new life is opening before himand he has innocently ruined his friends prospects on this striking situation the dropcurtain falls  while we were still applauding the first act rothsay alarmed me he dropped from his seat at my side like a man struck dead the stifling heat in the theater had proved too much for him we carried him out at once into the fresh air when he came to his senses my friend entreated me to leave him and see the end of the play to my mind he looked as if he might faint again i insisted on going back with him to our hotel  on the next day i went to the theater to ascertain if the play would be repeated the boxoffice was closed the dramatic company had left rome  my interest in discovering how the story ended led me next to the booksellers shopsin the hope of buying the play nobody knew anything about it nobody could tell me whether it was the original work of an italian writer or whether it had been stolen and probably disfigured from the french as a fragment i had seen it as a fragment it has remained from that time to this  second epoch  one of my objects in writing these lines is to vindicate the character of an innocent woman formerly in my service as housekeeper who has been cruelly slandered absorbed in the pursuit of my purpose it has only now occurred to me that strangers may desire to know something more than they know now of myself and my friend give us some idea they may say of what sort of persons you are if you wish to interest us at the outset of your story  a most reasonable suggestion i admit unfortunately i am not the right man to comply with it  in the first place i cannot pretend to pronounce judgment on my own character in the second place i am incapable of writing impartially of my friend at the imminent risk of his own life rothsay rescued me from a dreadful death by accident when we were at college together who can expect me to speak of his faults i am not even capable of seeing them  under these embarrassing circumstancesand not forgetting at the same time that a servants opinion of his master and his masters friends may generally be trusted not to err on the favorable sidei am tempted to call my valet as a witness to character  i slept badly on our first night at rome and i happened to be awake while the man was talking of us confidentially in the courtyard of the hoteljust under my bedroom window here to the best of my recollection is a faithful report of what he said to some friend among the servants who understood english  my masters well connected you must knowthough hes only plain mr lepel his uncles the great lawyer lord lepel and his late father was a banker rich did you say i should think he was richand be hanged to him no not married and not likely to be owns he was forty last birthday a regular old bachelor not a bad sort taking him altogether the worst of him is he is one of the most indiscreet persons i ever met with does the queerest things when the whim takes him and doesnt care what other people think of it they say the lepels have all got a slate loose in the upper story oh no not a very old familyi mean nothing compared to the family of his friend young rothsay they count back as i have heard to the ancient kings of scotland between ourselves the ancient kings havent left the rothsays much money they would be glad ill be bound to get my rich master for one of their daughters poor as job i tell you this young fellow traveling with us has never had a spare fivepound note since he was born plenty of brains in his head i grant you and a little too apt sometimes to be suspicious of other people but liberaloh give him his dueliberal in a small way tips me with a sovereign now and then i take itlord bless you i take it what do you say has he got any employment not he dabbles in chemistry experiments and that sort of thing by way of amusing himself and tells the most infernal lies about it the other day he showed me a bottle about as big as a thimble with what looked like water in it and said it was enough to poison everybody in the hotel what rot isnt that the clock striking again near about bedtime i should say wish you good night  there are our charactersdrawn on the principle of justice without mercy by an impudent rascal who is the best valet in england now you know what sort of persons we are and now we may go on again   rothsay and i parted soon after our night at the theater he went to civita vecchia to join a friends yacht waiting for him in the harbor i turned homeward traveling at a leisurely rate through the tyrol and germany  after my arrival in england certain events in my life occurred which did not appear to have any connection at the time they led nevertheless to consequences which seriously altered the relations of happy past years between rothsay and myself  the first event took place on my return to my house in london i found among the letters waiting for me an invitation from lord lepel to spend a few weeks with him at his country seat in sussex  i had made so many excuses in past years when i received invitations from my uncle that i was really ashamed to plead engagements in london again there was no unfriendly feeling between us my only motive for keeping away from him took its rise in dislike of the ordinary modes of life in an english countryhouse a man who feels no interest in politics who cares nothing for field sports who is impatient of amateur music and incapable of small talk is a man out of his element in country society this was my unlucky case i went to lord lepels house sorely against my will longing already for the day when it would be time to say goodby  the routine of my uncles establishment had remained unaltered since my last experience of it  i found my lord expressing the same pride in his collection of old masters and telling the same story of the wonderful escape of his picturegallery from firei renewed my acquaintance with the same members of parliament among the guests all on the same side in politicsi joined in the same dreary amusementsi saluted the same resident priest the lepels are all born and bred roman catholicsi submitted to the same rigidly early breakfast hour and inwardly cursed the same peremptory bell ringing as a means of reminding us of our meals the one change that presented itself was a change out of the house death had removed the lodgekeeper at the parkgate his widow and daughter mrs rymer and little susan remained in their pretty cottage they had been allowed by my lords kindness to take charge of the gate  out walking on the morning after my arrival i was caught in a shower on my way back to the park and took shelter in the lodge  in the bygone days i had respected mrs rymers husband as a thoroughly worthy manbut mrs rymer herself was no great favorite of mine she had married beneath her as the phrase is and she was a little too conscious of it a woman with a sharp eye to her own interests selfishly discontented with her position in life and not very scrupulous in her choice of means when she had an end in view that is how i describe mrs rymer her daughter whom i only remembered as a weakly child astonished me when i saw her again after the interval that had elapsed the backward flower had bloomed into perfect health susan was now a lovely little modest girl of seventeenwith a natural delicacy and refinement of manner which marked her to my mind as one of natures gentlewomen when i entered the lodge she was writing at a table in a corner having some books on it and rose to withdraw i begged that she would proceed with her employment and asked if i might know what it was she answered me with a blush and a pretty brightening of her clear blue eyes i am trying sir to teach myself french she said the weather showed no signs of improvingi volunteered to help her and found her such an attentive and intelligent pupil that i looked in at the lodge from time to time afterward and continued my instructions the younger men among my uncles guests set their own stupid construction on my attentions to the girl at the gate as they called herrather too familiarly according to my notions of propriety i contrived to remind them that i was old enough to be susans father in a manner which put an end to their jokes and i was pleased to hear when i next went to the lodge that mrs rymer had been wise enough to keep these facetious gentlemen at their proper distance  the day of my departure arrived lord leper took leave of me kindly and asked for news of rothsay let me know when your friend returns my uncle said he belongs to a good old stock put me in mind of him when i next invite you to come to my house  on my way to the train i stopped of course at the lodge to say goodby mrs rymer came out alone i asked for susan  my daughter is not very well today  is she confined to her room  she is in the parlor  i might have been mistaken but i thought mrs rymer answered me in no very friendly way resolved to judge for myself i entered the lodge and found my poor little pupil sitting in a corner crying when i asked her what was the matter the excuse of a bad headache was the only reply that i received the natures of young girls are a hopeless puzzle to me susan seemed for some reason which it was impossible to understand to be afraid to look at me  have you and your mother been quarreling i asked  oh no  she denied it with such evident sincerity that i could not for a moment suspect her of deceiving me whatever the cause of her distress might be it was plain that she had her own reasons for keeping it a secret  her french books were on the table i tried a little allusion to her lessons  i hope you will go on regularly with your studies i said  i will do my best sirwithout you to help me  she said it so sadly that i proposedpurely from the wish to encourage hera continuation of our lessons through the post  send your exercises to me once a week i suggested and i will return them corrected  she thanked me in low tones with a shyness of manner which i had never noticed in her before i had done my best to cheer herand i was conscious as we shook hands at parting that i had failed a feeling of disappointment overcomes me when i see young people out of spirits i was sorry for susan  third epoch  one of my faults which has not been included in the list set forth by my valet is a disinclination to occupy myself with my own domestic affairs the proceedings of my footman while i had been away from home left me no alternative but to dismiss him on my return with this exertion of authority my interference as chief of the household came to an end i left it to my excellent housekeeper mrs mozeen to find a sober successor to the drunken vagabond who had been sent away she discovered a respectable young mantall plump and rosywhose name was joseph and whose character was beyond reproach i have but one excuse for noticing such a trifling event as this it took its place at a later period in the chain which was slowly winding itself round me  my uncle had asked me to prolong my visit and i should probably have consented but for anxiety on the subject of a near and dear relativemy sister her health had been failing since the death of her husband to whom she was tenderly attached i heard news of her while i was in sussex which hurried me back to town in a month more her death deprived me of my last living relation she left no children and my two brothers had both died unmarried while they were still young men  this affliction placed me in a position of serious embarrassment in regard to the disposal of my property after my death  i had hitherto made no will being well aware that my fortune which was entirely in money would go in due course of law to the person of all others who would employ it to the best purposethat is to say to my sister as my nearest of kin as i was now situated my property would revert to my uncle if i died intestate he was a richer man than i was of his two children both sons the eldest would inherit his estates the youngest had already succeeded to his mothers ample fortune having literally no family claims on me i felt bound to recognize the wider demands of poverty and misfortune and to devote my superfluous wealth to increasing the revenues of charitable institutions as to minor legacies i owed it to my good housekeeper mrs mozeen not to forget the faithful services of past years need i addif i had been free to act as i pleasedthat i should have gladly made rothsay the object of a handsome bequest but this was not to be my friend was a man morbidly sensitive on the subject of money in the early days of our intercourse we had been for the first and only time on the verge of a quarrel when i had asked as a favor to myself to be allowed to provide for him in my will  it is because i am poor he explained that i refuse to profit by your kindnessthough i feel it gratefully  i failed to understand himand said so plainly  you will understand this he resumed i should never recover my sense of degradation if a mercenary motive on my side was associated with our friendship dont say its impossible you know as well as i do that appearances would be against me in the eyes of the world besides i dont want money my own small income is enough for me make me your executor if you like and leave me the customary present of five hundred pounds if you exceed that sum i declare on my word of honor that i will not touch one farthing of it he took my hand and pressed it fervently do me a favor he said never let us speak of this again  i understood that i must yieldor lose my friend  in now making my will i accordingly appointed rothsay one of my executors on the terms that he had prescribed the minor legacies having been next duly reduced to writing i left the bulk of my fortune to public charities  my lawyer laid the fair copy of the will on my table  a dreary disposition of property for a man of your age he said i hope to receive a new set of instructions before you are a year older  what instructions i asked  to provide for your wife and children he answered  my wife and children the idea seemed to be so absurd that i burst out laughing it never occurred to me that there could be any absurdity from my own point of view  i was sitting alone after my legal adviser had taken his leave looking absently at the newlyengrossed will when i heard a sharp knock at the housedoor which i thought i recognized in another minute rothsays bright face enlivened my dull room he had returned from the mediterranean that morning  am i interrupting you he asked pointing to the leaves of manuscript before me are you writing a book  i am making my will  his manner changed he looked at me seriously  do you remember what i said when we once talked of your will he asked i set his doubts at rest immediatelybut he was not quite satisfied yet cant you put your will away he suggested i hate the sight of anything that reminds me of death  give me a minute to sign it i saidand rang to summon the witnesses  mrs mozeen answered the bell rothsay looked at her as if he wished to have my housekeeper put away as well as my will from the first moment when he had seen her he conceived a great dislike to that good creature there was nothing i am sure personally repellent about her she was a little slim quiet woman with a pale complexion and bright brown eyes her movements were gentle her voice was low her decent gray dress was adapted to her age why rothsay should dislike her was more than he could explain himself he turned his unreasonable prejudice into a jokeand said he hated a woman who wore slate colored capribbons  i explained to mrs mozeen that i wanted witnesses to the signature of my will naturally enoughbeing in the room at the timeshe asked if she could be one of them  i was obliged to say no and not to mortify her i gave the reason  my will recognizes what i owe to your good services i said if you are one of the witnesses you will lose your legacy send up the menservants  with her customary tact mrs mozeen expressed her gratitude silently by a lookand left the room  why couldnt you tell that woman to send the servants without mentioning her legacy rothsay asked my friend lepel you have done a very foolish thing  in what way  you have given mrs mozeen an interest in your death  it was impossible to make a serious reply to this ridiculous exhibition of rothsays prejudice against poor mrs mozeen  when am i to be murdered i asked and how is it to be done poison  im not joking rothsay answered you are infatuated about your housekeeper when you spoke of her legacy did you notice her eyes  yes  did nothing strike you  it struck me that they were unusually well preserved eyes for a woman of her age  the appearance of the valet and the footman put an end to this idle talk the will was executed and locked up our conversation turned on rothsays travels by sea the cruise had been in every way successful the matchless shores of the mediterranean defied description the sailing of the famous yacht had proved to be worthy of her reputation and to crown all rothsay had come back to england in a fair way for the first time in his life of making money  i have discovered a treasure he announced  it was a dirty little modern picture picked up in a bystreet at palermo it is a virgin and child by guido  on further explanation it appeared that the picture exposed for sale was painted on copper noticing the contrast between the rare material and the wretchedly bad painting that covered it rothsay had called t o mind some of the wellknown stories of valuable works of art that had been painted over for purposes of disguise the price asked for the picture amounted to little more than the value of the metal rothsay bought it his knowledge of chemistry enabled him to put his suspicion successfully to the test and one of the guests on board the yachta famous french artisthad declared his conviction that the picture now revealed to view was a genuine work by guido such an opinion as this convinced me that it would be worth while to submit my friends discovery to the judgment of other experts consulted independently these critics confirmed the view taken by the celebrated personage who had first seen the work this result having been obtained rothsay asked my advice next on the question of selling his picture i at once thought of my uncle an undoubted work by guido would surely be an acquisition to his gallery i had only in accordance with his own request to let him know that my friend had returned to england we might take the picture with us when we received our invitation to lord lepels house  fourth epoch  my uncles answer arrived by return of post other engagements obliged him to defer receiving us for a month at the end of that time we were cordially invited to visit him and to stay as long as we liked  in the interval that now passed other events occurredstill of the trifling kind  one afternoon just as i was thinking of taking my customary ride in the park the servant appeared charged with a basket of flowers and with a message from mrs rymer requesting me to honor her by accepting a little offering from her daughter hearing that she was then waiting in the hall i told the man to show her in susan as i ought to have already mentioned had sent her exercises to me regularly every week in returning them corrected i had once or twice added a word of welldeserved approval the offering of flowers was evidently intended to express my pupils grateful sense of the interest taken in her by her teacher  i had no reason this time to suppose that mrs rymer entertained an unfriendly feeling toward me at the first words of greeting that passed between us i perceived a change in her manner which ran in the opposite extreme she overwhelmed me with the most elaborate demonstrations of politeness and respect dwelling on her gratitude for my kindness in receiving her and on her pride at seeing her daughters flowers on my table until i made a resolute effort to stop her by asking as if it was actually a matter of importance to me whether she was in london on business or on pleasure  oh on business sir my poor husband invested his little savings in bank stock and i have just been drawing my dividend i do hope you dont think my girl overbold in venturing to send you a few flowers she wouldnt allow me to interfere i do assure you she would gather and arrange them with her own hands in themselves i know they are hardly worth accepting but if you will allow the motive to plead  i made another effort to stop mrs rymer i said her daughter could not have sent me a prettier present  the inexhaustible woman only went on more fluently than ever  she is so grateful sir and so proud of your goodness in looking at her exercises the difficulty of the french language seem as nothing to her now her motive is to please you she is so devoted to her studies that i find it difficult to induce her to take the exercise necessary to her health and as you may perhaps remember susan was always rather weakly as a child she inherits her fathers constitution mr lepelnot mine  here to my infinite relief the servant appeared announcing that my horse was at the door  mrs rymer opened her mouth i saw a coming flood of apologies on the point of pouring outand seized my hat on the spot i declared i had an appointment i sent kind remembrances to susan pitying her for having such a mother with my whole heart i said i hoped to return to my uncles house soon and to continue the french lessons the one thing more that i remember was finding myself safe in the saddle and out of the reach of mrs rymers tongue  reflecting on what had passed it was plain to me that this woman had some private end in view and that my abrupt departure had prevented her from finding the way to it what motive could she possibly have for that obstinate persistence in presenting poor susan under a favorable aspect to a man who had already shown that he was honestly interested in her pretty modest daughter i tried hard to penetrate the mysteryand gave it up in despair  three days before the date at which rothsay and i were to pay our visit to lord lepel i found myself compelled to undergo one of the minor miseries of human life in other words i became one of the guests at a large dinnerparty it was a rainy day in october my position at the table placed me between a window that was open and a door that was hardly ever shut i went to bed shivering and woke the next morning with a headache and a difficulty in breathing on consulting the doctor i found that i was suffering from an attack of bronchitis there was no reason to be alarmed if i remained indoors and submitted to the necessary treatment i might hope to keep my engagement with my uncle in ten days or a fortnight  there was no alternative but to submit i accordingly arranged with rothsay that he should present himself at lord lepels house taking the picture with him on the date appointed for our visit and that i should follow as soon as i was well enough to travel  on the day when he was to leave london my friend kindly came to keep me company for a while he was followed into my room by mrs mozeen with a bottle of medicine in her hand this worthy creature finding that the doctors directions occasionally escaped my memory devoted herself to the duty of administering the remedies at the prescribed intervals of time when she left the room having performed her duties as usual i saw rothsays eyes follow her to the door with an expression of sardonic curiosity he put a strange question to me as soon as we were alone  who engaged that new servant of yours he asked i mean the fat fellow with the curly flaxen hair  hiring servants i replied is not much in my way i left the engagement of the new man to mrs mozeen  rothsay walked gravely up to my bedside  lepel he said your respectable housekeeper is in love with the fat young footman  it is not easy to amuse a man suffering from bronchitis but this new outbreak of absurdity was more than i could resist even with a mustardplaster on my chest  i thought i should raise your spirits rothsay proceeded when i came to your house this morning the valet opened the door to me i expressed my surprise at his condescending to take that trouble he informed me that joseph was otherwise engaged with anybody in particular i asked humoring the joke yes sir with the housekeeper shes teaching him how to brush his hair so as to show off his good looks to the best advantage make up your mind my friend to lose mrs mozeenespecially if she happens to have any money  nonsense rothsay the poor woman is old enough to be josephs mother  my good fellow that wont make any difference to joseph in the days when we were rich enough to keep a manservant our footmanas handsome a fellow as ever you saw and no older than i ammarried a witch with a lame leg when i asked him why he had made such a fool of himself he looked quite indignant and said sir she has got six hundred pounds he and the witch keep a public house what will you bet me that we dont see your housekeeper drawing beer at the bar and joseph getting drunk in the parlor before we are a year older  i was not well enough to prolong my enjoyment of rothsays boyish humor besides exaggeration to be really amusing must have some relation no matter how slender it may be to the truth my housekeeper belonged to a respectable family and was essentially a person accustomed to respect herself her brother occupied a position of responsibility in the establishment of a firm of chemists whom i had employed for years past her late husband had farmed his own land and had owed his ruin to calamities for which he was in no way responsible kindhearted mrs mozeen was just the woman to take a motherly interest in a welldisposed lad like joseph and it was equally characteristic of my valetespecially when rothsay was thoughtless enough to encourage himto pervert an innocent action for the sake of indulging in a stupid jest i took advantage of my privilege as an invalid and changed the subject  a week passed i had expected to hear from rothsay to my surprise and disappointment no letter arrived  susan was more considerate she wrote very modestly and prettily to say that she and her mother had heard of my illness from mr rothsay and to express the hope that i should soon be restored to health a few days later mrs rymers politeness carried her to the length of taking the journey to london to make inquiries at my door i did not see her of course she left word that she would have the honor of calling again  the second week followed i had by that time perfectly recovered from my attack of bronchitisand yet i was too ill to leave the house  the doctor himself seemed to be at a loss to understand the symptoms that now presented themselves a vile sensation of nausea tried my endurance and an incomprehensible prostration of strength depressed my spirits i felt such a strange reluctance to exert myself that i actually left it to mrs mozeen to write to my uncle in my name and say that i was not yet well enough to visit him my medical adviser tried various methods of treatment my housekeeper administered the prescribed medicines with unremitting care but nothing came of it a physician of great authority was called into consultation being completely puzzled he retreated to the last refuge of bewildered doctors i asked him what was the matter with me and he answered suppressed gout  fifth epoch  midway in the third week my uncle wrote to me as follows   i have been obliged to request your friend rothsay to bring his visit to a conclusion although he refuses to confess it i have reason to believe that he has committed the folly of falling seriously in love with the young girl at my lodge gate i have tried remonstrance in vain and i write to his father at the same time that i write to you there is much more that i might say i reserve it for the time when i hope to have the pleasure of seeing you restored to health   two days after the receipt of this alarming letter rothsay returned to me  ill as i was i forgot my sufferings the moment i looked at him wild and haggard he stared at me with bloodshot eyes like a man demented  do you think i am mad i dare say i am i cant live without her those were the first words he said when we shook hands  but i had more influence over him than any other person and weak as i was i exerted it little by little he became more reasonable he began to speak like his old self again  to have expressed any surprise on my part at what had happened would have been not only imprudent but unworthy of him and of me my first inquiry was suggested by the fear that he might have been hurried into openly confessing his passion to susanalthough his position forbade him to offer marriage i had done him an injustice his honorable nature had shrunk from the cruelty of raising hopes which for all he knew to the contrary might never be realized at the same time he had his reasons for believing that he was at least personally acceptable to her  she was always glad to see me said poor rothsay we constantly talked of you she spoke of your kindness so prettily and so gratefully oh lepel it is not her beauty only that has won my heart her nature is the nature of an angel  his voice failed him for the first time in my remembrance of our long companionship he burst into tears  i was so shocked and distressed that i had the greatest difficulty in preserving my own selfcontrol in the effort to comfort him i asked if he had ventured to confide in his father  you are the favorite son i reminded him is there no gleam of hope in the future  he had written to his father in silence he gave me the letter in reply  it was expressed with a moderation which i had hardly dared to expect mr rothsay the elder admitted that he had himself married for love and that his wifes rank in the social scale although higher than susans had not been equal to his own  in such a family as ours he wroteperhaps with pardonable pridewe raise our wives to our own degree but this young person labors under a double disadvantage she is obscure and she is poor what have you to offer her nothing and what have i to give you nothing  this meant as i interpreted it that the main obstacle in the way was susans poverty and i was rich in the excitement that possessed me i followed the impulse of the moment headlong like a child  while you were away from me i said to rothsay did you never once think of your old friend must i remind you that i can make susan your wife with one stroke of my pen he looked at me in silent surprise i took my checkbook from the drawer of the table and placed the inkstand within reach susans marriage portion i said is a matter of a line of writing with my name at the end of it  he burst out with an exclamation that stopped me just as my pen touched the paper  good heavens he cried you are thinking of that play we saw at rome are we on the stage are you performing the part of the marquisand am i the count  i was so startled by this wild allusion to the pasti recognized with such astonishment the reproduction of one of the dramatic situations in the play at a crisis in his life and minethat the use of the pen remained suspended in my hand for the first time in my life i was conscious of a sensation which resembled superstitious dread  rothsay recovered himself first he misinterpreted what was passing in my mind  dont think me ungrateful he said you dear kind good fellow consider for a moment and you will see that it cant be what would be said of her and of me if you made susan rich with your money and if i married her the poor innocent would be called your castoff mistress people would say he has behaved liberally to her and his needy friend has taken advantage of it  the point of view which i had failed to see was put with terrible directness of expression the conviction that i was wrong was literally forced on me what reply could i make rothsay evidently felt for me  you are ill he said gently let me leave you to rest  he held out his hand to say goodby i insisted on his taking up his abode with me for the present at least ordinary persuasion failed to induce him to yield i put it on selfish grounds next  you have noticed that i am ill i said i want you to keep me company  he gave way directly  through the wakeful night i tried to consider what moral remedies might be within our reach the one useful conclusion at which i could arrive was to induce rothsay to try what absence and change might do to compose his mind to advise him to travel alone was out of the question i wrote to his one other old friend besides myselfthe friend who had taken him on a cruise in the mediterranean  the owner of the yacht had that very day given directions to have his vessel laid up for the winter season he at once countermanded the order by telegraph i am an idle man he said and i am as fond of rothsay as you are i will take him wherever he likes to go it was not easy to persuade the object of these kind intentions to profit by them nothing that i could say roused him i spoke to him of his picture he had left it at my uncles house and neither knew nor cared to know whether it had been sold or not the one consideration which ultimately influenced rothsay was presented by the doctor speaking as follows to quote his own explanation in the interests of my health  i warned your friend he said that his conduct was causing anxiety which you were not strong enough to bear on hearing this he at once promised to follow the advice which you had given to him and to join the yacht as you know he has kept his word may i ask if he has ever followed the medical profession  replying in the negative i begged the doctor to tell me why he had put his question  he answered mr rothsay requested me to tell him all that i knew about your illness i complied of course mentioning that i had lately adopted a new method of treatment and that i had every reason to feel confident of the results he was so interested in the symptoms of your illness and in the remedies being tried that he took notes in his pocketbook of what i had said when he paid me that compliment i thought it possible that i might be speaking to a colleague  i was pleased to hear of my friends anxiety for my recovery if i had been in better health i might have asked myself what reason he could have had for making those entries in his pocketbook  three days later another proof reached me of rothsays anxiety for my welfare  the owner of the yacht wrote to beg that i would send him a report of my health addressed to a port on the south coast of england to which they were then bound if we dont hear good news he added i have reason to fear that rothsay will overthrow our plans for the recovery of his peace of mind by leaving the vessel and making his own inquiries at your bedside  with no small difficulty i roused myself sufficiently to write a few words with my own hand they were words that liedfor my poor friends sake in a postscript i begged my correspondent to let me hear if the effect produced on rothsay had answered to our hopes and expectations  sixth epoch  the weary days followed each otherand time failed to justify the doctors confidence in his new remedies i grew weaker and weaker  my uncle came to see me he was so alarmed that he insisted on a consultation being held with his own physician another great authority was called in at the same time by the urgent request of my own medical man these distinguished persons held more than one privy council before they would consent to give a positive opinion it was an evasive opinion encumbered with hard words of greek and roman origin when it was at last pronounced i waited until they had taken their leave and then appealed to my own doctor what do these men really think i asked shall i live or die  the doctor answered for himself as well as for his illustrious colleagues we have great faith in the new prescriptions he said  i understood what that meant they were afraid to tell me the truth i insisted on the truth  how long shall i live i said till the end of the year  the reply followed in one terrible word  perhaps  it was then the first week in december i understood that i might reckonat the utmoston three weeks of life what i felt on arriving at this conclusion i shall not say it is the one secret i keep from the readers of these lines  the next day mrs rymer called once more to make inquiries not satisfied with the servants report she entreated that i would consent to see her my housekeeper with her customary kindness undertook to convey the message if she had been a wicked woman would she have acted in this way mrs rymer seems to be sadly distressed she pleaded as i understand sir she is suffering under some domestic anxiety which can only be mentioned to yourself  did this anxiety relate to susan the bare doubt of it decided me i consented to see mrs rymer feeling it necessary to control her in the use of her tongue i spoke the moment the door was opened  i am suffering from illness and i must ask you to spare me as much as possible what do you wish to say to me  the tone in which i addressed mrs rymer would have offended a more sensitive woman the truth is she had chosen an unfortunate time for her visit there were fluctuations in the progress of my malady there were days when i felt better and days when i felt worseand this was a bad day moreover my uncle had tried my temper that morning he had called to see me on his way to winter in the south of france by his physicians advice and he recommended a trial of change of air in my case also his country house only thirty miles from london was entirely at my disposal and the railway supplied beds for invalids it was useless to answer that i was not equal to the effort he reminded me that i had exerted myself to leave my bedchamber for my armchair in the next room and that a little additional resolution would enable me to follow his advice we parted in a state of irritation on either side which so far as i was concerned had not subsided yet  i wish to speak to you sir about my daughter mrs rymer answered  the mere allusion to susan had its composing effect on me i said kindly that i hoped she was well  well in body mrs rymer announced far from it sir in mind  before i could ask what this meant we were interrupted by the appearance of the servant bringing the letters which had arrived for me by the afternoon post i told the man impatiently to put them on the table at my side  what is distressing susan i inquired without stopping to look at the letters  she is fretting sir about your illness oh mr lepel if you would only try the sweet country air if you only had my good little susan to nurse you  she too taking my uncles view and talking of susan as my nurse  what are you thinking of i asked her a young girl like your daughter nursing me you ought to have more regard for susans good name  i know what you ought to do she made that strange reply with a furtive look at me half in anger half in alarm  go on i said  will you turn me out of your house for my impudence she asked  i will hear what you have to say to me what ought i to do  marry susan  i heard the woman plainlyand yet i declare i doubted the evidence of my senses  shes breaking her heart for you mrs rymer burst out shes been in love with you since you first darkened our doorsand it will end in the neighbors finding it out i did my duty to her i tried to stop it i tried to prevent you from seeing her when you went away too late the mischief was done when i see my girl fading day by daycrying about you in secret talking about you in her dreamsi cant stand it i must speak out oh yes i know how far beneath you she isthe daughter of your uncles servant but shes your equal sir in the sight of heaven my lords priest converted her only last yearand my susan is as good a papist as yourself  how could i let this go on i felt that i ought to have stopped it before  its possible i said that you may not be deliberately deceiving me if you are yourself deceived i am bound to tell you the truth mr rothsay loves your daughter and what is more mr rothsay has reason to know that susan  that susan loves him she interposed with a mocking laugh oh mr lepel is it possible that a clever man like you cant see clearer than that my girl in love with mr rothsay she wouldnt have looked at him a second time if he hadnt talked to her about you when i complained privately to my lord of mr rothsay hanging about the lodge do you think she turned as pale as ashes and cried when he passed through the gate and said goodby  she had complained of rothsay to lord lepeli understood her at last she knew that my friend and all his family were poor she had put her own construction on the innocent interest that i had taken in her daughter careless of the difference in rank blind to the malady that was killing me she was now bent on separating rothsay and susan by throwing the girl into the arms of a rich husband like myself  you are wasting your breath i told her i dont believe one word you say to me  believe susan then cried the reckless woman let me bring her here if shes too shamefaced to own the truth look at herthats all i asklook at her and judge for yourself  this was intolerable in justice to susan in justice to rothsay i insisted on silence no more of it i said take care how you provoke me dont you see that i am ill dont you see that you are irritating me to no purpose  she altered her tone ill wait she said quietly while you compose yourself  with those words she walked to the window and stood there with her back toward me was the wretch taking advantage of my helpless condition i stretched out my hand to ring the bell and have her sent awayand hesitated to degrade susans mother for susans sake in my state of prostration how could i arrive at a decision my mind was dreadfully disturbed i felt the imperative necessity of turning my thoughts to some other subject looking about me the letters on the table attracted my attention mechanically i took them up mechanically i put them down again two of them slipped from my trembling fingers my eyes fell on the uppermost of the two the address was in the handwriting of the good friend with whom rothsay was sailing  just as i had been speaking of rothsay here was the news of him for which i had been waiting  i opened the letter and read these words   there is i fear but little hope for our friendunless this girl on whom he has set his heart can by some lucky change of circumstances become his wife he has tried to master his weakness but his own infatuation is too much for him he is really and truly in a state of despair two evenings sinceto give you a melancholy example of what i meani was in my cabin when i heard the alarm of a man overboard the man was rothsay my sailingmaster seeing that he was unable to swim jumped into the sea and rescued him as i got on deck rothsay declares it to have been an accident and everybody believes him but myself i know the state of his mind dont be alarmed i will have him well looked after and i wont give him up just yet we are still bound southward with a fair wind if the new scenes which i hope to show him prove to be of no avail i must reluctantly take him back to england in that case which i dont like to contemplate you may see him againperhaps in a months time   he might return in a months timereturn to hear of the death of the one friend on whose power and will to help him he might have relied if i failed to employ in his interests the short interval of life still left to me could i doubt after what i had just read what the end would be how could i help him oh god how could i help him  mrs rymer left the window and returned to the chair which she had occupied when i first received her  are you quieter in your mind now she asked  i neither answered her nor looked at her  still determined to reach her end she tried again to force her unhappy daughter on me will you consent she persisted to see susan  if she had been a little nearer to me i am afraid i should have struck her you wretch i said do you know that i am a dying man  while theres life theres hope mrs rymer remarked  i ought to have controlled myself but it was not to be done  hope of your daughter being my rich widow i asked  her bitter answer followed instantly  even then she said susan wouldnt marry rothsay  a lie if circumstances favored her i knew on rothsays authority what susan would do  the thought burst on my mind like light bursting on the eyes of a man restored to sight if susan agreed to go through the form of marriage with a dying bridegroom my rich widow could and would become rothsays wife once more the remembrance of the play at rome returned and set the last embers of resolution which sickness and suffering had left to me in a flame the devoted friend of that imaginary story had counted on death to complete his generous purpose in vain he had been condemned by the tribunal of man and had been reprieved iin his place and with his selfsacrifice in my mindmight found a firmer trust in the future for i had been condemned by the tribunal of god  encouraged by my silence the obstinate woman persisted wont you even send a message to susan she asked  rashly madly without an instants hesitation i answered  go back to susan and say i leave it to her  mrs rymer started to her feet you leave it to susan to be your wife if she likes  i do  and if she consents  i consent  in two weeks and a day from that time the deed was done when rothsay returned to england he would ask for susanand he would find my virginwidow rich and free  seventh epoch  whatever may be thought of my conduct let me say this in justice to myselfi was resolved that susan should not be deceived  half an hour after mrs rymer had left my house i wrote to her daughter plainly revealing the motive which led me to offer marriage solely in the future interest of rothsay and herself if you refuse i said in conclusion you may depend on my understanding you and feeling for you but if you consentthen i have a favor to ask never let us speak to one another of the profanation that we have agreed to commit for your faithful lovers sake  i had formed a high opinion of susantoo high an opinion as it seemed her reply surprised and disappointed me in other words she gave her consent  i stipulated that the marriage should be kept strictly secret for a certain period in my own mind i decided that the interval should be held to expire either on the day of my death or on the day when rothsay returned  my next proceeding was to write in confidence to the priest whom i have already mentioned in an earlier part of these pages he has reasons of his own for not permitting me to disclose the motive which induced him to celebrate my marriage privately in the chapel at lord lepels house my uncles desire that i should try change of air as offering a last chance of recovery was known to my medical attendant and served as a sufficient reason although he protested against the risk for my removal to the country i was carried to the station and placed on a bedslung by ropes to the ceiling of a saloon carriage so as to prevent me from feeling the vibration when the train was in motion faithful mrs mozeen entreated to be allowed to accompany me i was reluctantly compelled to refuse compliance with this request in justice to the claims of my lords housekeeper who had been accustomed to exercise undivided authority in the household and who had made every preparation for my comfort with her own hands mrs mozeen packed everything that i required including the medicines prescribed for the occasion she was deeply affected poor soul when we parted  i bore the journeyhappily for me it was a short onebetter than had been anticipated for the first few days that followed the purer air of the country seemed in some degree to revive me but the deadly sense of weakness the slow sinking of the vital power in me returned as the time drew near for the marriage the ceremony was performed at night only susan and her mother were present no persons in the house but ourselves had the faintest suspicion of what had happened  i signed my new will the priest and mrs rymer being the witnesses in my bed that night it left everything that i possessed excepting a legacy to mrs mozeen to my wife  obliged it is needless to say to preserve appearances susan remained at the lodge as usual but it was impossible to resist her entreaty to be allowed to attend on me for a few hours daily as assistant to the regular nurse when she was alone with me and had no inquisitive eyes to dread the poor girl showed a depth of feeling which i was unable to reconcile with the motives that could alone have induced her as i then supposed to consent to the mockery of our marriage on occasions when i was so far able to resist the languor that oppressed me as to observe what was passing at my bedsidei saw susan look at me as if there were thoughts in her pressing for utterance which she hesitated to express once she herself acknowledged this i have so much to say to you she owned when you are stronger and fitter to hear me at other times her nerves seemed to be shaken by the spectacle of my sufferings her kind hands trembled and made mistakes when they had any nursing duties to perform near me the servants noticing her used to say that pretty girl seems to be the most awkward person in the house on the day that followed the ceremony in the chapel this want of selfcontrol brought about an accident which led to serious results  in removing the small chest which held my medicines from the shelf on which it was placed susan let it drop on the floor the two full bottles still left were so completely shattered that not even a teaspoonful of the contents was saved  shocked at what she had done the poor girl volunteered to go herself to my chemist in london by the first train i refused to allow it what did it matter to me now if my death from exhaustion was hastened by a day or two why need my life be prolonged artificially by drugs when i had nothing left to live for an excuse for me which would satisfy others was easily found i said that i had been long weary of physic and that the accident had decided me on refusing to take more  that night i did not wake quite so often as usual when she came to me the next day susan noticed that i looked better the day after the other nurse made the same observation at the end of the week i was able to leave my bed and sit by the fireside while susan read to me some mysterious change in my health had completely falsified the prediction of the medical men i sent to london for my doctorand told him that the improvement in me had begun on the day when i left off taking his remedies can you explain it i asked  he answered that no such resurrection from the dead as he called it had ever happened in his long experience on leaving me he asked for the latest prescriptions that had been written i inquired what he was going to do with them i mean to go to the chemist he replied and to satisfy myself that your medicines have been properly made up  i owed it to mrs mozeens true interest in me to tell her what had happened the same day i wrote to her i also mentioned what the doctor had said and asked her to call on him and ascertain if the prescriptions had been shown to the chemist and if any mistake had been made  a more innocently intended letter than this never was written and yet there are people who have declared that it was inspired by suspicion of mrs mozeen  eighth epoch  whether i was so weakened by illness as to be incapable of giving my mind to more than one subject for reflection at a time that subject being now the extraordinary recovery of my healthor whether i was preoccupied by the effort which i was in honor bound to make to resist the growing attraction to me of susans societyi cannot presume to say this only i know when the discovery of the terrible position toward rothsay in which i now stood suddenly overwhelmed me an interval of some days had passed i cannot account for it i can only sayso it was  susan was in the room i was wholly unable to hide from her the sudden change of color which betrayed the horror that had overpowered me she said anxiously what has frightened you  i dont think i heard her the play was in my memory againthe fatal play which had wound itself into the texture of rothsays life and mine in vivid remembrance i saw once more the dramatic situation of the first act and shrank from the reflection of it in the disaster which had fallen on my friend and myself  what has frightened you susan repeated  i answered in one wordi whispered his name rothsay  she looked at me in innocent surprise has he met with some misfortune she asked quietly  misfortunedid she call it had i not said enough to disturb her tranquillity in mentioning rothsays name i am living i said livingand likely to live  her answer expressed fervent gratitude thank god for it  i looked at her astonished as she had been astonished when she looked at me  susan susan i criedmust i own it i love you  she came nearer to me with timid pleasure in her eyeswith the first faint light of a smile playing round her lips  you say it very strangely she murmured surely my dear one you ought to love me since the first day when you gave me my french lessonhavent i loved you  you love me i repeated have you read my voice failed me i could say no more  she turned pale read what she asked  my letter  what letter  the letter i wrote to you before we were married   am i a coward the bare recollection of what followed that reply makes me tremble time has passed i am a new man now my health is restored my happiness is assured i ought to be able to write on no it is not to be done how can i think coolly how force myself to record the suffering that i innocently most innocently inflicted on the sweetest and truest of women nothing saved us from a parting as absolute as the parting that follows death but the confession that had been wrung from me at a time when my motive spoke for itself the artless avowal of her affection had been justified had been honored by the words which laid my heart at her feet when i said i love you    she had risen to leave me in a last look we had silently resigned ourselves to wait apart from each other for the day of reckoning that must follow rothsays return when we heard the sound of carriagewheels on the drive that led to the house in a minute more the man himself entered the room  he looked first at susanthen at me in both of us he saw the traces that told of agitation endured but not yet composed worn and weary he waited hesitating near the door  am i intruding he asked  we were thinking of you and speaking of you i replied just before you came in  we he repeated turning toward susan once more after a pause he offered me his handand drew it back  you dont shake hands with me he said  i am waiting rothsay until i know that we are the same firm friends as ever  for the third time he looked at susan  will you shake hands he asked  she gave him her hand cordially may i stay here she said addressing herself to me  in my situation at that moment i understood the generous purpose that animated her but she had suffered enough alreadyi led her gently to the door it will be better i whispered if you will wait downstairs in the library she hesitated what will they say in the house she objected thinking of the servants and of the humble position which she was still supposed to occupy it matters nothing what they say now i told her she left us  there seems to be some private understanding between you rothsay said when we were alone  you shall hear what it is i answered but i must beg you to excuse me if i speak first of myself  are you alluding to your health  yes  quite needless lepel i met your doctor this morning i know that a council of physicians decided you would die before the year was out  he paused there  and they proved to be wrong i added  they might have proved to be right rothsay rejoined but for the accident which spilled your medicine and the despair of yourself which decided you on taking no more  i could hardly believe that i understood him do you assert i said that my medicine would have killed me if i had taken the rest of it  i have no doubt that it would  will you explain what you mean  let me have your explanation first i was not prepared to find susan in your room i was surprised to see traces of tears in her face something has happened in my absence am i concerned in it  you are  i said it quietlyin full possession of myself the trial of fortitude through which i had already passed seemed to have blunted my customary sense of feeling i approached the disclosure which i was now bound to make with steady resolution resigned to the worst that could happen when the truth was known  do you remember the time i resumed when i was so eager to serve you that i proposed to make susan your wife by making her rich  yes  do you remember asking me if i was thinking of the play we saw together at rome is the story as present to your mind now as it was then  quite as present  you asked if i was performing the part of the marquisand if you were the count rothsay the devotion of that ideal character to his friend has been my devotion his conviction that his death would justify what he had done for his friends sake has been my conviction and as it ended with him so it has ended with mehis terrible position is my terrible position toward you at this moment  are you mad rothsay asked sternly  i passed over that first outbreak of his anger in silence  do you mean to tell me you have married susan he went on  bear this in mind i said when i married her i was doomed to death nay more in your interestsas god is my witnessi welcomed death  he stepped up to me in silence and raised his hand with a threatening gesture  that action at once deprived me of my selfpossession i spoke with the ungovernable rashness of a boy  carry out your intention i said insult me  his hand dropped  insult me i repeated it is one way out of the unendurable situation in which we are placed you may trust me to challenge you duels are still fought on the continent i will follow you abroad i will choose pistols i will take care that we fight on the fatal foreign system and i will purposely miss you make her what i intended her to bemy rich widow  he looked at me attentively  is that your refuge he asked scornfully no i wont help you to commit suicide  god forgive me i was possessed by a spirit of reckless despair i did my best to provoke him  reconsider your decision i said and rememberyou tried to commit suicide yourself  he turned quickly to the door as if he distrusted his own powers of selfcontrol  i wish to speak to susan he said keeping his back turned on me  you will find her in the library  he left me  i went to the window i opened it and let the cold wintry air blow over my burning head i dont know how long i sat at the window there came a time when i saw rothsay on the house steps he walked rapidly toward the park gate his head was down he never once looked back at the room in which he had left me  as he passed out of my sight i felt a hand laid gently on my shoulder susan had returned to me  he will not come back she said try still to remember him as your old friend he asks you to forgive and forget  she had made the peace between us i was deeply touched my eyes filled with tears as i looked at her she kissed me on the forehead and went out i afterward asked what had passed between them when rothsay spoke with her in the library she never has told me what they said to each other and she never will she is right   later in the day i was told that mrs rymer had called and wished to pay her respects  i refused to see her whatever claim she might have otherwise had on my consideration had been forfeited by the infamy of her conduct when she intercepted my letter to susan her sense of injury on receiving my message was expressed in writing and was sent to me the same evening the last sentence in her letter was characteristic of the woman  however your pride may despise me she wrote i am indebted to you for the rise in life that i have always desired you may refuse to see mebut you cant prevent my being the motherinlaw of a gentleman   soon afterward i received a visit which i had hardly ventured to expect busy as he was in london my doctor came to see me he was not in his usual good spirits  i hope you dont bring me any bad news i said  you shall judge for yourself he replied i come from mr rothsay to say for him what he is not able to say for himself  where is he  he has left england  for any purpose that you know of  yes he has sailed to join the expedition of rescuei ought rather to call it the forlorn hopewhich is to search for the lost explorers in central australia  in other words he had gone to seek death in the fatal footsteps of burke and wills i could not trust myself to speak  the doctor saw that there was a reason for my silence and that he would do well not to notice it he changed the subject  may i ask he said if you have heard from the servants left in charge at your house in london  has anything happened  something has happened which they are evidently afraid to tell you knowing the high opinion which you have of mrs mozeen she has suddenly quitted your service and has gone nobody knows where i have taken charge of a letter which she left for you  he handed me the letter as soon as i had recovered myself i looked at it  there was this inscription on the address for my good master to wait until he returns home the few lines in the letter itself ran thus   distressing circumstances oblige me to leave you sir and do not permit me to enter into particulars in asking your pardon i offer my sincere thanks for your kindness and my fervent prayers for your welfare   that was all the date had a special interest for me mrs mozeen had written on the day when she must have received my letterthe letter which has already appeared in these pages  is there really nothing known of the poor womans motives i asked  there are two explanations suggested the doctor informed me one of them which is offered by your female servants seems to me absurd they declare that mrs mozeen at her mature age was in love with the young man who is your footman it is even asserted that she tried to recommend herself to him by speaking of the money which she expected to bring to the man who would make her his wife the footmans reply informing her that he was already engaged to be married is alleged to be the cause which has driven her from your house  i begged that the doctor would not trouble himself to repeat more of what my women servants had said  if the other explanation i added is equally unworthy of notice  the other explanation the doctor interposed comes from mr rothsay and is of a very serious kind  rothsays opinion demanded my respect  what view does he take i inquired  a view that startles me the doctor said you remember my telling you of the interest he took in your symptoms and in the remedies i had employed well mr rothsay accounts for the incomprehensible recovery of your health by asserting that poisonprobably administered in small quantities and intermitted at intervals in fear of discoveryhas been mixed with your medicine and he asserts that the guilty person is mrs mozeen  it was impossible that i could openly express the indignation that i felt on hearing this my position toward rothsay forced me to restrain myself  may i ask the doctor continued if mrs mozeen was aware that she had a legacy to expect at your death  certainly  has she a brother who is one of the dispensers employed by your chemists  yes  did she know that i doubted if my prescriptions had been properly prepared and that i intended to make inquiries  i wrote to her myself on the subject  do you think her brother told her that i was referred to him when i went to the chemists  i have no means of knowing what her brother did  can you at least tell me when she received your letter  she must have received it on the day when she left my house  the doctor rose with a grave face  these are rather extraordinary coincidences he remarked  i merely replied mrs mozeen is as incapable of poisoning as i am  the doctor wished me goodmorning  i repeat here my conviction of my housekeepers innocence i protest against the cruelty which accuses her and whatever may have been her motive in suddenly leaving my service i declare that she still possesses my sympathy and esteem and i invite her to return to me if she ever sees these lines  i have only to add by way of postscript that we have heard of the safe return of the expedition of rescue time as my wife and i both hope may yet convince rothsay that he will not be wrong in counting on susans lovethe love of a sister  in the meanwhile we possess a memorial of our absent friend we have bought his picture     mr captain and the nymph  i  the captain is still in the prime of life the widow remarked he has given up his ship he possesses a sufficient income and he has nobody to live with him i should like to know why he doesnt marry  the captain was excessively rude to me the widows younger sister added on her side when we took leave of him in london i asked if there was any chance of his joining us at brighton this season he turned his back on me as if i had mortally offended him and he made me this extraordinary answer miss i hate the sight of the sea the man has been a sailor all his life what does he mean by saying that he hates the sight of the sea  these questions were addressed to a third person presentand the person was a man he was entirely at the mercy of the widow and the widows sister the other ladies of the familywho might have taken him under their protectionhad gone to an evening concert he was known to be the captains friend and to be well acquainted with events in the captains life as it happened he had reasons for hesitating to revive associations connected with those events but what polite alternative was left to him he must either inflict disappointment and worse still aggravate curiosityor he must resign himself to circumstances and tell the ladies why the captain would never marry and why sailor as he was he hated the sight of the sea they were both young women and handsome womenand the person to whom they had appealed being a man followed the example of submission to the sex first set in the garden of eden he enlightened the ladies in the terms that follow  the british merchantman fortuna sailed from the port of liverpool at a date which it is not necessary to specify with the morning tide she was bound for certain islands in the pacific ocean in search of a cargo of sandalwooda commodity which in those days found a ready and profitable market in the chinese empire  a large discretion was reposed in the captain by the owners who knew him to be not only trustworthy but a man of rare ability carefully cultivated during the leisure hours of a seafaring life devoted heart and soul to his professional duties he was a hard reader and an excellent linguist as well having had considerable experience among the inhabitants of the pacific islands he had attentively studied their characters and had mastered their language in more than one of its many dialects thanks to the valuable information thus obtained the captain was never at a loss to conciliate the islanders he had more than once succeeded in finding a cargo under circumstances in which other captains had failed  possessing these merits he had also his fair share of human defects for instance he was a little too conscious of his own good looksof his bright chestnut hair and whiskers of his beautiful blue eyes of his fair white skin which many a woman had looked at with the admiration that is akin to envy his shapely hands were protected by gloves a broadbrimmed hat sheltered his complexion in fine weather from the sun he was nice in the choice of his perfumes he never drank spirits and the smell of tobacco was abhorrent to him new men among his officers and his crew seeing him in his cabin perfectly dressed washed and brushed until he was an object speckless to look upona merchantcaptain soft of voice careful in his choice of words devoted to study in his leisure hourswere apt to conclude that they had trusted themselves at sea under a commander who was an anomalous mixture of a schoolmaster and a dandy but if the slightest infraction of discipline took place or if the storm rose and the vessel proved to be in peril it was soon discovered that the gloved hands held a rod of iron that the soft voice could make itself heard through wind and sea from one end of the deck to the other and that it issued orders which the greatest fool on board discovered to be orders that had saved the ship throughout his professional life the general impression that this variously gifted man produced on the little world about him was always the same some few liked him everybody respected him nobody understood him the captain accepted these results he persisted in reading his books and protecting his complexion with this result his owners shook hands with him and put up with his gloves  the fortuna touched at rio for water and for supplies of food which might prove useful in case of scurvy in due time the ship rounded cape horn favored by the finest weather ever known in those latitudes by the oldest hand on board the mateone mr duncalfa boozing wheezing selfconfident old seadog with a flaming face and a vast vocabulary of oaths swore that he didnt like it the foul weathers coming my lads said mr duncalf mark my words therell be wind enough to take the curl out of the captains whiskers before we are many days older  for one uneventful week the ship cruised in search of the islands to which the owners had directed her at the end of that time the wind took the predicted liberties with the captains whiskers and mr duncalf stood revealed to an admiring crew in the character of a true prophet  for three days and three nights the fortuna ran before the storm at the mercy of wind and sea on the fourth morning the gale blew itself out the sun appeared again toward noon and the captain was able to take an observation the result informed him that he was in a part of the pacific ocean with which he was entirely unacquainted thereupon the officers were called to a council in the cabin  mr duncalf as became his rank was consulted first his opinion possessed the merit of brevity my lads this ships bewitched take my word for it we shall wish ourselves back in our own latitudes before we are many days older which being interpreted meant that mr duncalf was lost like his superior officer in a part of the ocean of which he knew nothing  the remaining members of the council having no suggestions to offer left the captain to take his own way he decided the weather being fine again to stand on under an easy press of sail for fourandtwenty hours more and to see if anything came of it  soon after nightfall something did come of it the lookout forward hailed the quarterdeck with the dread cry breakers ahead in less than a minute more everybody heard the crash of the broken water the fortuna was put about and came round slowly in the light wind thanks to the timely alarm and the fine weather the safety of the vessel was easily provided for they kept her under a short sail and they waited for the morning  the dawn showed them in the distance a glorious green island not marked in the ships chartsan island girt about by a coralreef and having in its midst a highpeaked mountain which looked through the telescope like a mountain of volcanic origin mr duncalf taking his morning draught of rum and water shook his groggy old head and said and swore my lads i dont like the look of that island the captain was of a different opinion he had one of the ships boats put into the water he armed himself and four of his crew who accompanied him and away he went in the morning sunlight to visit the island  skirting round the coral reef they found a natural breach which proved to be broad enough and deep enough not only for the passage of the boat but of the ship herself if needful crossing the broad inner belt of smooth water they approached the golden sands of the island strew ed with magnificent shells and crowded by the dusky islandersmen women and children all waiting in breathless astonishment to see the strangers land  the captain kept the boat off and examined the islanders carefully the innocent simple people danced and sang and ran into the water imploring their wonderful white visitors by gestures to come on shore not a creature among them carried arms of any sort a hospitable curiosity animated the entire population the men cried out in their smooth musical language come and eat and the plump blackeyed women all laughing together added their own invitation come and be kissed was it in mortals to resist such temptations as these the captain led the way on shore and the women surrounded him in an instant and screamed for joy at the glorious spectacle of his whiskers his complexion and his gloves so the mariners from the far north were welcomed to the newlydiscovered island  iii  the morning wore on mr duncalf in charge of the ship cursing the island over his rum and water as a beastly green strip of a place not laid down in any christian chart was kept waiting four mortal hours before the captain returned to his command and reported himself to his officers as follows  he had found his knowledge of the polynesian dialects sufficient to make himself in some degree understood by the natives of the new island under the guidance of the chief he had made a first journey of exploration and had seen for himself that the place was a marvel of natural beauty and fertility the one barren spot in it was the peak of the volcanic mountain composed of crumbling rock originally no doubt lava and ashes which had cooled and consolidated with the lapse of time so far as he could see the crater at the top was now an extinct crater but if he had understood rightly the chief had spoken of earthquakes and eruptions at certain bygone periods some of which lay within his own earliest recollections of the place  adverting next to considerations of practical utility the captain announced that he had seen sandalwood enough on the island to load a dozen ships and that the natives were willing to part with it for a few toys and trinkets generally distributed among them to the mates disgust the fortuna was taken inside the reef that day and was anchored before sunset in a natural harbor twelve hours of recreation beginning with the next morning were granted to the men under the wise restrictions in such cases established by the captain that interval over the work of cutting the precious wood and loading the ship was to be unremittingly pursued  mr duncalf had the first watch after the fortuna had been made snug he took the boatswain aside an ancient seadog like himself and he said in a gruff whisper my lad this here aint the island laid down in our sailing orders see if mischief dont come of disobeying orders before we are many days older  nothing in the shape of mischief happened that night but at sunrise the next morning a suspicious circumstance occurred and mr duncalf whispered to the boatswain what did i tell you the captain and the chief of the islanders held a private conference in the cabin and the captain after first forbidding any communication with the shore until his return suddenly left the ship alone with the chief in the chiefs own canoe  what did this strange disappearance mean the captain himself when he took his seat in the canoe would have been puzzled to answer that question he asked in the nearest approach that his knowledge could make to the language used in the island whether he would be a long time or a short time absent from his ship  the chief answered mysteriously as the captain understood him in these words long time or short time your life depends on it and the lives of your men  paddling his light little boat in silence over the smooth water inside the reef the chief took his visitor ashore at a part of the island which was quite new to the captain the two crossed a ravine and ascended an eminence beyond there the chief stopped and silently pointed out to sea  the captain looked in the direction indicated to him and discovered a second and a smaller island lying away to the southwest taking out his telescope from the case by which it was slung at his back he narrowly examined the place two of the native canoes were lying off the shore of the new island and the men in them appeared to be all kneeling or crouching in curiously chosen attitudes shifting the range of his glass he next beheld a whiterobed figure tall and solitarythe one inhabitant of the island whom he could discover the man was standing on the highest point of a rocky cape a fire was burning at his feet now he lifted his arms solemnly to the sky now he dropped some invisible fuel into the fire which made a blue smoke and now he cast other invisible objects into the canoes floating beneath him which the islanders reverently received with bodies that crouched in abject submission lowering his telescope the captain looked round at the chief for an explanation the chief gave the explanation readily his language was interpreted by the english stranger in these terms  wonderful white man the island you see yonder is a holy island as such it is tabooan island sanctified and set apart the honorable person whom you notice on the rock is an allpowerful favorite of the gods he is by vocation a sorcerer and by rank a priest you now see him casting charms and blessings into the canoes of our fishermen who kneel to him for fine weather and great plenty of fish if any profane person native or stranger presumes to set foot on that island my otherwise peaceful subjects will in the performance of a religious duty put that person to death mention this to your men they will be fed by my male people and fondled by my female people so long as they keep clear of the holy isle as they value their lives let them respect this prohibition is it understood between us wonderful white man my canoe is waiting for you let us go back  understanding enough of the chiefs language illustrated by his gestures to receive in the right spirit the communication thus addressed to him the captain repeated the warning to the ships company in the plainest possible english the officers and men then took their holiday on shore with the exception of mr duncalf who positively refused to leave the ship for twelve delightful hours they were fed by the male people and fondled by the female people and then they were mercilessly torn from the fleshpots and the arms of their new friends and set to work on the sandalwood in good earnest mr duncalf superintended the loading and waited for the mischief that was to come of disobeying the owners orders with a confidence worthy of a better cause  iv  strangely enough chance once more declared itself in favor of the mates point of view the mischief did actually come and the chosen instrument of it was a handsome young islander who was one of the sons of the chief  the captain had taken a fancy to the sweettempered intelligent lad pursuing his studies in the dialect of the island at leisure hours he had made the chiefs son his tutor and had instructed the youth in english by way of return more than a month had passed in this intercourse and the ships lading was being rapidly completedwhen in an evil hour the talk between the two turned on the subject of the holy island  does nobody live on the island but the priest the captain asked  the chiefs son looked round him suspiciously promise me you wont tell anybody he began very earnestly  the captain gave his promise  there is one other person on the island the lad whispered a person to feast your eyes upon if you could only see her she is the priests daughter removed to the island in her infancy she has never left it since in that sacred solitude she has only looked on two human beingsher father and her mother i once saw her from my canoe taking care not to attract her notice or to approach too near the holy soil oh so young dear master and oh so beautiful the chiefs son completed the description by kissing his own hands as an expression of rapture  the captains fine blue eyes sparkled he asked no more questions but later on that day he took his telescope with him and paid a secret visit to the eminence which overlooked the holy island the next day and the next he privately returned to the same place on the fourth day fatal destiny favored him he discovered the nymph of the island  standing alone upon the cape on which he had already seen her father she was feeding some tame birds which looked like turtledoves the glass showed the captain her white robe fluttering in the seabreeze her long black hair falling to her feet her slim and supple young figure her simple grace of attitude as she turned this way and that attending to the wants of her birds before her was the blue ocean behind her rose the lustrous green of the island forest he looked and looked until his eyes and arms ached when she disappeared among the trees followed by her favorite birds the captain shut up his telescope with a sigh and said to himself i have seen an angel  from that hour he became an altered man he was languid silent interested in nothing general opinion on board his ship decided that he was going to be taken ill  a week more elapsed and the officers and crew began to talk of the voyage to their market in china the captain refused to fix a day for sailing he even took offense at being asked to decide instead of sleeping in his cabin he went ashore for the night  not many hours afterward just before daybreak mr duncalf snoring in his cabin on deck was aroused by a hand laid on his shoulder the swinging lamp still alight showed him the dusky face of the chiefs son convulsed with terror by wild signs by disconnected words in the little english which he had learned the lad tried to make the mate understand him dense mr duncalf understanding nothing hailed the second officer on the opposite side of the deck the second officer was young and intelligent he rightly interpreted the terrible news that had come to the ship  the captain had broken his own rules watching his opportunity under cover of the night he had taken a canoe and had secretly crossed the channel to the holy island no one had been near him at the time but the chiefs son the lad had vainly tried to induce him to abandon his desperate enterprise and had vainly waited on the shore in the hope of hearing the sound of the paddle announcing his return beyond all reasonable doubt the infatuated man had set foot on the shores of the tabooed island  the one chance for his life was to conceal what he had done until the ship could be got out of the harbor and then if no harm had come to him in the interval to rescue him after nightfall it was decided to spread the report that he had really been taken ill and that he was confined to his cabin the chiefs son whose heart the captains kindness had won could be trusted to do this and to keep the secret faithfully for his good friends sake  toward noon the next day they attempted to take the ship to sea and failed for want of wind hour by hour the heat grew more oppressive as the day declined there were ominous appearances in the western heaven the natives who had given some trouble during the day by their anxiety to see the captain and by their curiosity to know the cause of the sudden preparations for the ships departure all went ashore together looking suspiciously at the sky and reappeared no more just at midnight the ship still in her snug berth inside the reef suddenly trembled from her keel to her uppermost masts mr duncalf surrounded by the startled crew shook his knotty fist at the island as if he could see it in the dark my lads what did i tell you that was a shock of earthquake  with the morning the threatening aspect of the weather unexpectedly disappeared a faint hot breeze from the land just enough to give the ship steerageway offered mr duncalf a chance of getting to sea slowly the fortuna with the mate himself at the wheel half sailed half drifted into the open ocean at a distance of barely two miles from the island the breeze was felt no more and the vessel lay becalmed for the rest of the day  at night the men waited their orders expecting to be sent after their captain in one of the boats the intense darkness the airless heat and a second shock of earthquake faintly felt in the ship at her present distance from the land warned the mate to be cautious i smell mischief in the air said mr duncalf the captain must wait till i am surer of the weather  still no change came with the new day the dead calm continued and the airless heat as the day declined another ominous appearance became visible a thin line of smoke was discovered through the telescope ascending from the topmost peak of the mountain on the main island was the volcano threatening an eruption the mate for one entertained no doubt of it by the lord the place is going to burst up said mr duncalf come what may of it we must find the captain tonight  v  what was the captain doing and what chance had the crew of finding him that night  he had committed himself to his desperate adventure without forming any plan for the preservation of his own safety without giving even a momentary consideration to the consequences which might follow the risk that he had run the charming figure that he had seen haunted him night and day the image of the innocent creature secluded from humanity in her island solitude was the one image that filled his mind a man passing a woman in the street acts on the impulse to turn and follow her and in that one thoughtless moment shapes the destiny of his future life the captain had acted on a similar impulse when he took the first canoe he had found on the beach and shaped his reckless course for the tabooed island  reaching the shore while it was still dark he did one sensible thinghe hid the canoe so that it might not betray him when the daylight came that done he waited for the morning on the outskirts of the forest  the trembling light of dawn revealed the mysterious solitude around him following the outer limits of the trees first in one direction then in another and finding no trace of any living creature he decided on penetrating to the interior of the island he entered the forest  an hour of walking brought him to rising ground continuing the ascent he got clear of the trees and stood on the grassy top of a broad cliff which overlooked the sea an open hut was on the cliff he cautiously looked in and discovered that it was empty the few household utensils left about and the simple bed of leaves in a corner were covered with fine sandy dust nightbirds flew blundering out of the inner cavities of the roof and took refuge in the shadows of the forest below it was plain that the hut had not been inhabited for some time past  standing at the open doorway and considering what he should do next the captain saw a bird flying toward him out of the forest it was a turtledove so tame that it fluttered close up to him at the same moment the sound of sweet laughter became audible among the trees his heart beat fast he advanced a few steps and stopped in a moment more the nymph of the island appeared in her white robe ascending the cliff in pursuit of her truant bird she saw the strange man and suddenly stood still struck motionless by the amazing discovery that had burst upon her the captain approached smiling and holding out his hand she never moved she stood before him in helpless wondermenther lovely black eyes fixed spellbound on his face her dusky bosom palpitating above the fallen folds of her robe her rich red lips parted in mute astonishment feasting his eyes on her beauty in silence the captain after a while ventured to speak to her in the language of the main island the sound of his voice addressing her in the words that she understood roused the lovely creature to action she started stepped close up to him and dropped on her knees at his feet  my father worships invisible deities she said softly are you a visible deity has my mother sent you she pointed as she spoke to the deserted hut behind them you appear she went on in the place where my mother died is it for her sake that you show yourself to her child beautiful deity come to the templecome to my father  the captain gently raised her from the ground if her father saw him he was a doomed man  infatuated as he was he had sense enough left to announce himself plainly in his own character as a mortal creature arriving from a distant land the girl instantly drew back from him with a look of terror  he is not like my father she said to herself he is not like me is he the lying demon of the prophecy is he the predestined destroyer of our island  the captains experience of the sex showed him the only sure way out of the awkward position in which he was now placed he appealed to his personal appearance  do i look like a demon he asked  her eyes met his eyes a faint smile trembled on her lips he ventured on asking what she meant by the predestined destruction of the island she held up her hand solemnly and repeated the prophecy  the holy island was threatened with destruction by an evil being who would one day appear on its shores to avert the fatality the place had been sanctified and set apart under the protection of the gods and their priest here was the reason for the taboo and for the extraordinary rigor with which it was enforced listening to her with the deepest interest the captain took her hand and pressed it gently  do i feel like a demon he whispered  her slim brown fingers closed frankly on his hand you feel soft and friendly she said with the fearless candor of a child squeeze me again i like it  the next moment she snatched her hand away from him the sense of his danger had suddenly forced itself on her mind if my father sees you she said he will light the signal fire at the temple and the people from the other island will come here and put you to death where is your canoe no it is daylight my father may see you on the water she considered a little and approaching him laid her hands on his shoulders stay here till nightfall she resumed my father never comes this way the sight of the place where my mother died is horrible to him you are safe here promise to stay where you are till nighttime  the captain gave his promise  freed from anxiety so far the girls mobile temperament recovered its native cheerfulness its sweet gayety and spirit she admired the beautiful stranger as she might have admired a new bird that had flown to her to be fondled with the rest she patted his fair white skin and wished she had a skin like it she lifted the great glossy folds of her long black hair and compared it with the captains bright curly locks and longed to change colors with him from the bottom of her heart his dress was a wonder to her his watch was a new revelation she rested her head on his shoulder to listen delightedly to the ticking as he held the watch to her ear her fragrant breath played on his face her warm supple figure rested against him softly the captains arm stole round her waist and the captains lips gently touched her cheek she lifted her head with a look of pleased surprise thank you said the child of nature simply kiss me again i like it may i kiss you the tame turtledove perched on her shoulder as she gave the captain her first kiss and diverted her thoughts to the pets that she had left in pursuit of the truant dove come she said and see my birds i keep them on this side of the forest there is no danger so long as you dont show yourself on the other side my name is aimata aimata will take care of you oh what a beautiful white neck you have she put her arm admiringly round his neck the captains arm held her tenderly to him slowly the two descended the cliff and were lost in the leafy solitudes of the forest and the tame dove fluttered before them a winged messenger of love cooing to his mate  vi  the night had come and the captain had not left the island  aimatas resolution to send him away in the darkness was a forgotten resolution already she had let him persuade her that he was in no danger so long as he remained in the hut on the cliff and she had promised at parting to return to him while the priest was still sleeping at the dawn of day  he was alone in the hut the thought of the innocent creature whom he loved was sorrowfully as well as tenderly present to his mind he almost regretted his rash visit to the island i will take her with me to england he said to himself what does a sailor care for the opinion of the world aimata shall be my wife  the intense heat oppressed him he stepped out on the cliff toward midnight in search of a breath of air  at that moment the first shock of earthquake felt in the ship while she was inside the reef shook the ground he stood on he instantly thought of the volcano on the main island had he been mistaken in supposing the crater to be extinct was the shock that he had just felt a warning from the volcano communicated through a submarine connection between the two islands he waited and watched through the hours of darkness with a vague sense of apprehension which was not to be reasoned away with the first light of daybreak he descended into the forest and saw the lovely being whose safety was already precious to him as his own hurrying to meet him through the trees  she waved her hand distractedly as she approached him go she cried go away in your canoe before our island is destroyed  he did his best to quiet her alarm was it the shock of earthquake that had frightened her no it was more than the shock of earthquakeit was something terrible which had followed the shock there was a lake near the temple the waters of which were supposed to be heated by subterranean fires the lake had risen with the earthquake had bubbled furiously and had then melted away into the earth and been lost her father viewing the portent with horror had gone to the cape to watch the volcano on the main island and to implore by prayers and sacrifices the protection of the gods hearing this the captain entreated aimata to let him see the emptied lake in the absence of the priest she hesitated but his influence was allpowerful he prevailed on her to turn back with him through the forest  reaching the furthest limit of the trees they came out upon open rocky ground which sloped gently downward toward the center of the island having crossed this space they arrived at a natural amphitheater of rock on one side of it the temple appeared partly excavated partly formed by a natural cavern in one of the lateral branches of the cavern was the dwelling of the priest and his daughter the mouth of it looked out on the rocky basin of the lake stooping over the edge the captain discovered far down in the empty depths a light cloud of steam not a drop of water was visible look where he might  aimata pointed to the abyss and hid her face on his bosom my father says she whispered that it is your doing  the captain started does your father know that i am on the island  she looked up at him with a quick glance of reproach do you think i would tell him and put your life in peril she asked my father felt the destroyer of the island in the earthquake my father saw the coming destruction in the disappearance of the lake her eyes rested on him with a loving languor are you indeed the demon of the prophecy she said winding his hair round her finger i am not afraid of you if you are i am a creature bewitched i love the demon she kissed him passionately i dont care if i die she whispered between the kisses if i only die with you  the captain made no attempt to reason with her he took the wiser wayhe appealed to her feelings  you will come and live with me happily in my own country he said my ship is waiting for us i will take you home with me and you shall be my wife  she clapped her hands for joy then she thought of her father and drew back from him in tears  the captain understood her let us leave this dreary place he suggested we will talk about it in the cool glades of the forest where you first said you loved me  she gave him her hand where i first said i loved you she repeated smiling tenderly as she looked at him they left the lake together  vii  the darkness had fallen again and the ship was still becalmed at sea  mr duncalf came on deck after his supper the thin line of smoke seen rising from the peak of the mountain that evening was now succeeded by ominous flashes of fire from the same quarter intermittently visible the faint hot breeze from the land was felt once more theres just an air of wind mr duncalf remarked ill try for the captain while i have the chance  one of the boats was lowered into the waterunder command of the second mate who had already taken the bearings of the tabooed island by daylight four of the men were to go with him and they were all to be well armed mr duncalf addressed his final instructions to the officer in the boat  you will keep a lookout sir with a lantern in the bows if the natives annoy you you know what to do always shoot natives when you get anigh the island you will fire a gun and sing out for the captain  quite needless interposed a voice from the sea the captain is here  without taking the slightest notice of the astonishment that he had caused the commander of the fortuna paddled his canoe to the side of the ship instead of ascending to the deck he stepped into the boat waiting alongside lend me your pistols he said quietly to the second officer and oblige me by taking your men back to their duties on board he looked up at mr duncalf and gave some further directions if there is any change in the weather keep the ship standing off and on at a safe distance from the land and throw up a rocket from time to time to show your position expect me on board again by sunrise  what cried the mate do you mean to say you are going back to the islandin that boatall by yourself  i am going back to the island answered the captain as quietly as ever in this boatall by myself he pushed off from the ship and hoisted the sail as he spoke  youre deserting your duty the old seadog shouted with one of his loudest oaths  attend to my directions the captain shouted back as he drifted away into the darkness  mr duncalfviolently agitated for the first time in his lifetook leave of his superior officer with a singular mixture of solemnity and politeness in these words  the lord have mercy on your soul i wish you goodevening  viii  alone in the boat the captain looked with a misgiving mind at the flashing of the volcano on the main island  if events had favored him he would have removed aimata to the shelter of the ship on the day when he saw the emptied basin on the lake but the smoke of the priests sacrifice had been discovered by the chief and he had dispatched two canoes with instructions to make inquiries one of the canoes had returned the other was kept in waiting off the cape to place a means of communicating with the main island at the disposal of the priest the second shock of earthquake had naturally increased the alarm of the chief he had sent messages to the priest entreating him to leave the island and other messages to aimata suggesting that she should exert her influence over her father if he hesitated the priest refused to leave the temple he trusted in his gods and his sacrificeshe believed they might avert the fatality that threatened his sanctuary  yielding to the holy man the chief sent reenforcements of canoes to take their turn at keeping watch off the headland assisted by torches the islanders were on the alert in superstitious terror of the demon of the prophecy by night as well as by day the captain had no alternative but to keep in hiding and to watch his opportunity of approaching the place in which he had concealed his canoe it was only after aimata had left him as usual to return to her father at the close of evening that the chances declared themselves in his favor the fireflashes from the mountain visible when the night came had struck terror into the hearts of the men on the watch they thought of their wives their children and their possessions on the main island and they one and all deserted their priest the captain seized the opportunity of communicating with the ship and of exchanging a frail canoe which he was ill able to manage for a swiftsailing boat capable of keeping the sea in the event of stormy weather  as he now neared the land certain small sparks of red moving on the distant water informed him that the canoes of the sentinels had been ordered back to their duty  carefully avoiding the lights he reached his own side of the island without accident and guided by the boats lantern anchored under the cliff he climbed the rocks advanced to the door of the hut and was met to his delight and astonishment by aimata on the threshold  i dreamed that some dreadful misfortune had parted us forever she said and i came here to see if my dream was true you have taught me what it is to be miserable i never felt my heart ache till i looked into the hut and found that you had gone now i have seen you i am satisfied no you must not go back with me my father may be out looking for me it is you that are in danger not i i know the forest as well by dark as by daylight  the captain detained her when she tried to leave him  now you are here he said why should i not place you at once in safety i have been to the ship i have brought back one of the boats the darkness will befriend uslet us embark while we can  she shrank away as he took her hand you forget my father she said  your father is in no danger my love the canoes are waiting for him at the cape i saw the lights as i passed  with that reply he drew her out of the hut and led her toward the sea not a breath of the breeze was now to be felt the dead calm had returnedand the boat was too large to be easily managed by one man alone at the oars  the breeze may come again he said wait here my angel for the chance  as he spoke the deep silence of the forest below them was broken by a sound a harsh wailing voice was heard calling  aimata aimata  my father she whispered he has missed me if he comes here you are lost  she kissed him with passionate fervor she held him to her for a moment with all her strength  expect me at daybreak she said and disappeared down the landward slope of the cliff  he listened anxious for her safety the voices of the father and daughter just reached him from among the trees the priest spoke in no angry tones she had apparently found an acceptable excuse for her absence little by little the failing sound of their voices told him that they were on their way back together to the temple the silence fell again not a ripple broke on the beach not a leaf rustled in the forest nothing moved but the reflected flashes of the volcano on the main island over the black sky it was an airless and an awful calm  he went into the hut and laid down on his bed of leavesnot to sleep but to rest all his energies might be required to meet the coming events of the morning after the voyage to and from the ship and the long watching that had preceded it strong as he was he stood in need of repose  for some little time he kept awake thinking insensibly the oppression of the intense heat aided in its influence by his own fatigue treacherously closed his eyes in spite of himself the weary man fell into a deep sleep  he was awakened by a roar like the explosion of a park of artillery the volcano on the main island had burst into a state of eruption smoky flamelight overspread the sky and flashed through the open doorway of the hut he sprang from his bedand found himself up to his knees in water  had the sea overflowed the land  he waded out of the hut and the water rose to his middle he looked round him by the lurid light of the eruption the one visible object within the range of view was the sea stained by reflections from the bloodred sky swirling and rippling strangely in the dead calm in a moment more he became conscious that the earth on which he stood was sinking under his feet the water rose to his neck the last vestige of the roof of the hut disappeared  he looked round again and the truth burst on him the island was sinkingslowly slowly sinking into volcanic depths below even the depth of the sea the highest object was the hut and that had dropped inch by inch under water before his own eyes thrown up to the surface by occult volcanic influences the island had sunk back under the same influences to the obscurity from which it had emerged  a black shadowy object turning in a wide circle came slowly near him as the alldestroying ocean washed its bitter waters into his mouth the buoyant boat rising as the sea rose had dragged its anchor and was floating round in the vortex made by the slowly sinking island with a last desperate hope that aimata might have been saved as he had been saved he swam to the boat seized the heavy oars with the strength of a giant and made for the place so far as he could guess at it now where the lake and the temple had once been  he looked round and round him he strained his eyes in the vain attempt to penetrate below the surface of the seething dimpling sea had the panicstricken watchers in the canoes saved themselves without an effort to preserve the father and daughter or had they both been suffocated before they could make an attempt to escape he called to her in his misery as if she could hear him out of the fathomless depths aimata aimata the roar of the distant eruption answered him the mounting fires lit the solitary sea far and near over the sinking island the boat turned slowly and more slowly in the lessening vortex never again would those gentle eyes look at him with unutterable love never again would those fresh lips touch his lips with their fervent kiss alone amid the savage forces of nature in conflict the miserable mortal lifted his hands in frantic supplicationand the burning sky glared down on him in its pitiless grandeur and struck him to his knees in the boat his reason sank with his sinking limbs in the merciful frenzy that succeeded the shock he saw afar off in her white robe an angel poised on the waters beckoning him to follow her to the brighter and the better world he loosened the sail he seized the oars and the faster he pursued it the faster the mocking vision fled from him over the empty and endless sea  ix  the boat was discovered on the next morning from the ship  all that the devotion of the officers of the fortuna could do for their unhappy commander was done on the homeward voyage restored to his own country and to skilled medical help the captains mind by slow degrees recovered its balance he has taken his place in society againhe lives and moves and manages his affairs like the rest of us but his heart is dead to all new emotions nothing remains in it but the sacred remembrance of his lost love he neither courts nor avoids the society of women their sympathy finds him grateful but their attractions seem to be lost on him they pass from his mind as they pass from his eyesthey stir nothing in him but the memory of aimata   now you know ladies why the captain will never marry and why sailor as he is he hates the sight of the sea     mr marmaduke and the minister  i  september 13thwinter seems to be upon us on the highland border already  i looked out of window as the evening closed in before i barred the shutters and drew the curtains for the night the clouds hid the hilltops on either side of our valley fantastic mists parted and met again on the lower slopes as the varying breeze blew them the blackening waters of the lake before our window seemed to anticipate the coming darkness on the more distant hills the torrents were just visible in the breaks of the mist stealing their way over the brown ground like threads of silver it was a dreary scene the stillness of all things was only interrupted by the splashing of our little waterfall at the back of the house i was not sorry to close the shutters and confine the view to the four walls of our sittingroom  the day happened to be my birthday i sat by the peatfire waiting for the lamp and the teatray and contemplating my past life from the vantageground so to speak of my fiftyfifth year  there was wonderfully little to look back on nearly thirty years since it pleased an allwise providence to cast my lot in this remote scottish hamlet and to make me minister of cauldkirk on a stipend of seventyfour pounds sterling per annum i and my surroundings have grown quietly older and older together i have outlived my wife i have buried one generation among my parishioners and married another i have borne the wear and tear of years better than the kirk in which i minister and the manse or parsonagehouse in which i liveboth sadly out of repair and both still trusting for the means of reparation to the pious benefactions of people richer than myself not that i complain be it understood of the humble position which i occupy i possess many blessings and i thank the lord for them i have my little bit of land and my cow i have also my good daughter felicia named after her deceased mother but inheriting her comely looks it is thought rather from myself  neither let me forget my elder sister judith a friendless single person sheltered under my roof whose temperament i could wish somewhat less prone to look at persons and things on the gloomy side but whose compensating virtues heaven forbid that i should deny no i am grateful for what has been given me from on high and resigned to what has been taken away with what fair prospects did i start in life springing from a good old scottish stock blessed with every advantage of education that the institutions of scotland and england in turn could offer with a career at the bar and in parliament before meand all cast to the winds as it were by the measureless prodigality of my unhappy father god forgive him i doubt if i had five pounds left in my purse when the compassion of my relatives on the mothers side opened a refuge to me at cauldkirk and hid me from the notice of the world for the rest of my life   september 14ththus far i had posted up my diary on the evening of the 13th when an event occurred so completely unexpected by my household and myself that the pen i may say dropped incontinently from my hand  it was the time when we had finished our tea or supperi hardly know which to call it in the silence we could hear the rain pouring against the window and the wind that had risen with the darkness howling round the house my sister judith taking the gloomy view according to customcopious draughts of good bohea and two helpings of such a mutton ham as only scotland can produce had no effect in raising her spiritsmy sister i say remarked that there would be ships lost at sea and men drowned this night my daughter felicia the brightesttempered creature of the female sex that i have ever met with tried to give a cheerful turn to her aunts depressing prognostication if the ships must be lost she said we may surely hope that the men will be saved god willing i put inthereby giving to my daughters humane expression of feeling the fit religious tone that was all it wantedand then went on with my written record of the events and reflections of the day no more was said felicia took up a book judith took up her knitting  on a sudden the silence was broken by a blow on the housedoor  my two companions as is the way of women set up a scream i was startled myself wondering who could be out in the rain and the darkness and striking at the door of the house a stranger it must be light or dark any person in or near cauldkirk wanting admission would know where to find the bellhandle at the side of the door i waited a while to hear what might happen next the stroke was repeated but more softly it became me as a man and a minister to set an example i went out into the passage and i called through the door whos there  a mans voice answeredso faintly that i could barely hear hima lost traveler  immediately upon this my cheerful sister expressed her view of the matter through the open parlor door brother noah its a robber dont let him in  what would the good samaritan have done in my place assuredly he would have run the risk and opened the door i imitated the good samaritan  a man dripping wet with a knapsack on his back and a thick stick in his hand staggered in and would i think have fallen in the passage if i had not caught him by the arm judith peeped out at the parlor door and said hes drunk felicia was behind her holding up a lighted candle the better to see what was going on look at his face aunt says she worn out with fatigue poor man bring him in fatherbring him in  good felicia i was proud of my girl hell spoil the carpet says sister judith i said silence for shame and brought him in and dropped him dripping into my own armchair would the good samaritan have thought of his carpet or his chair i did think of them but i overcame it ah we are a decadent generation in these latter days  be quick father says felicia hell faint if you dont give him something  i took out one of our little drinking cups called among us a quaigh while felicia instructed by me ran to the kitchen for the creamjug filling the cup with whisky and cream in equal proportions i offered it to him he drank it off as if it had been so much water stimulant and nourishment youll observe sir in equal portions i remarked to him how do you feel now  ready for another says he  felicia burst out laughing i gave him another as i turned to hand it to him sister judith came behind me and snatched away the creamjug never a generous person sister judith at the best of timesmore especially in the matter of cream  he handed me back the empty cup i believe sir you have saved my life he said under providence i put inadding but i would remark looking to the state of your clothes that i have yet another service to offer you before you tell us how you came into this pitiable state with that reply i led him upstairs and set before him the poor resources of my wardrobe and left him to do the best he could with them he was rather a small man and i am in stature nigh on six feet when he came down to us in my clothes we had the merriest evening that i can remember for years past i thought felicia would have had a hysteric fit and even sister judith laughedhe did look such a comical figure in the ministers garments  as for the misfortune that had befallen him it offered one more example of the preternatural rashness of the english traveler in countries unknown to him he was on a walking tour through scotland and he had set forth to go twenty miles afoot from a town on one side of the highland border to a town on the other without a guide the only wonder is that he found his way to cauldkirk instead of perishing of exposure among the lonesome hills  will you offer thanks for your preservation to the throne of grace in your prayers tonight i asked him and he answered indeed i will  we have a spare room at the manse but it had not been inhabited for more than a year past therefore we made his bed for that night on the sofa in the parlor and so left him with the fire on one side of his couch and the whisky and the mutton ham on the other in case of need he mentioned his name when we bade him goodnight marmaduke falmer of london son of a minister of the english church establishment now deceased it was plain i may add before he spoke that we had offered the hospitality of the manse to a man of gentle breeding    september 15thi have to record a singularly pleasant day due partly to a return of the fine weather partly to the good social gifts of our guest  attired again in his own clothing he was albeit wanting in height a finely proportioned man with remarkably small hands and feet having also a bright mobile face and large dark eyes of an extraordinary diversity of expression also he was of a sweet and cheerful humor easily pleased with little things and amiably ready to make his gifts agreeable to all of us at the same time a person of my experience and penetration could not fail to perceive that he was most content when in company with felicia i have already mentioned my daughters comely looks and good womanly qualities it was in the order of nature that a young man to use his own phrase getting near to his thirtyfirst birthday should feel drawn by sympathy toward a wellfavored young woman in her fourandtwentieth year in matters of this sort i have always cultivated a liberal turn of mind not forgetting my own youth  as the evening closed in i was sorry to notice a certain change in our guest for the worse he showed signs of fatiguefalling asleep at intervals in his chair and waking up and shivering the spare room was now well aired having had a roaring fire in it all day  i begged him not to stand on ceremony and to betake himself at once to his bed felicia having learned the accomplishment from her excellent mother made him a warm sleepingdraught of eggs sugar nutmeg and spirits delicious alike to the senses of smell and taste sister judith waited until he had closed the door behind him and then favored me with one of her dismal predictions youll rue the day brother when you let him into the house he is going to fall ill on our hands  ii  november 28thgod be praised for all his mercies this day our guest marmaduke falmer joined us downstairs in the sittingroom for the first time since his illness  he is sadly deteriorated in a bodily sense by the wasting rheumatic fever that brought him nigh to death but he is still young and the doctor humanly speaking has no doubt of his speedy and complete recovery my sister takes the opposite view she remarked in his hearing that nobody ever thoroughly got over a rheumatic fever oh judith judith its well for humanity that youre a single person if haply there had been any man desperate enough to tackle such a woman in the bonds of marriage what a pessimist progeny must have proceeded from you  looking back over my diary for the last two months and more i see one monotonous record of the poor fellows sufferings cheered and varied i am pleased to add by the devoted services of my daughter at the sick mans bedside with some help from her aunt most readily given when he was nearest to the point of death and with needful services performed in turn by two of our aged women in cauldkirk felicia could not have nursed him more assiduously if he had been her own brother half the credit of bringing him through it belonged as the doctor himself confessed to the discreet young nurse always ready through the worst of the illness and always cheerful through the long convalescence that followed i must also record to the credit of marmaduke that he was indeed duly grateful when i led him into the parlor and he saw felicia waiting by the armchair smiling and patting the pillows for him he took her by the hand and burst out crying weakness in part no doubtbut sincere gratitude at the bottom of it i am equally sure    november 29thhowever there are limits even to sincere gratitude of this truth mr marmaduke seems to be insufficiently aware entering the sittingroom soon after noon today i found our convalescent guest and his nurse alone his head was resting on her shoulder his arm was round her waistand the truth before everything felicia was kissing him  a man may be of a liberal turn of mind and may yet consistently object to freedom when it takes the form of unlicensed embracing and kissing the person being his own daughter and the place his own house i signed to my girl to leave us and i advanced to mr marmaduke with my opinion of his conduct just rising in words to my lipswhen he staggered me with amazement by asking for felicias hand in marriage  you need feel no doubt of my being able to offer to your daughter a position of comfort and respectability he said i have a settled income of eight hundred pounds a year  his raptures over felicia his protestations that she was the first woman he had ever really loved his profane declaration that he preferred to die if i refused to let him be her husbandall these flourishes as i may call them passed in at one of my ears and out at the other but eight hundred pounds sterling per annum descending as it were in a golden avalanche on the mind of a scottish minister accustomed to thirty years annual contemplation of seventyfour poundseight hundred a year in one young mans pocket i say completely overpowered me i just managed to answer wait till tomorrowand hurried out of doors to recover my selfrespect if the thing was to be anywise done i took my way through the valley the sun was shining for a wonder when i saw my shadow on the hillside i saw the golden calf as an integral part of me bearing this inscription in letters of flameheres another of them    november 30thi have made amends for yesterdays backsliding i have acted as becomes my parental dignity and my sacred calling  the temptation to do otherwise has not been wanting here is sister judiths advice make sure that he has got the money first and for heavens sake nail him here is mr marmadukes proposal make any conditions you please so long as you give me your daughter and lastly here is felicias confession father my heart is set on him oh dont be unkind to me for the first time in your life  but i have stood firm i have refused to hear any more words on the subject from any one of them for the next six months to come  so serious a venture as the venture of marriage i said is not to be undertaken on impulse as soon as mr marmaduke can travel i request him to leave us and not to return again for six months if after that interval he is still of the same mind and my daughter is still of the same mind let him return to cauldkirk and premising that i am in all other respects satisfied let him ask me for his wife  there were tears there were protestations i remained immovable a week later mr marmaduke left us on his way by easy stages to the south i am not a hard man i rewarded the lovers for their obedience by keeping sister judith out of the way and letting them say their farewell words accompaniments included in private  iii  may 28tha letter from mr marmaduke informing me that i may expect him at cauldkirk exactly at the expiration of the six months intervalviz on june the seventh  writing to this effect he added a timely word on the subject of his family both his parents were dead his only brother held a civil appointment in india the place being named his uncle his fathers brother was a merchant resident in london and to this near relative he referred me if i wished to make inquiries about him the names of his bankers authorized to give me every information in respect to his pecuniary affairs followed nothing could be more plain and straightforward i wrote to his uncle and i wrote to his bankers in both cases the replies were perfectly satisfactorynothing in the slightest degree doubtful no prevarications no mysteries in a word mr marmaduke himself was thoroughly well vouched for and mr marmadukes income was invested in securities beyond fear and beyond reproach even sister judith bent on picking a hole in the record somewhere tried hard and could make nothing of it  the last sentence in mr marmadukes letter was the only part of it which i failed to read with pleasure  he left it to me to fix the day for the marriage and he entreated that i would make it as early a day as possible i had a touch of the heartache when i thought of parting with felicia and being left at home with nobody but judith however i got over it for that time and after consulting my daughter we decided on naming a fortnight after mr marmadukes arrivalthat is to say the twentyfirst of june this gave felicia time for her preparations besides offering to me the opportunity of becoming better acquainted with my soninlaws disposition the happiest marriage does indubitably make its demands on human forbearance and i was anxious among other things to assure myself of mr marmadukes good temper  iv  june 22dthe happy change in my daughters life let me say nothing of the change in my life has come they were married yesterday the manse is a desert and sister judith was never so uncongenial a companion to me as i feel her to be now her last words to the married pair when they drove away were lord help you both you have all your troubles before you  i had no heart to write yesterdays record yesterday evening as usual the absence of felicia at the suppertable completely overcame me i who have so often comforted others in their afflictions could find no comfort for myself even now that the day has passed the tears come into my eyes only with writing about it sad sad weakness let me close my diary and open the bibleand be myself again    june 23dmore resigned since yesterday a more becoming and more pious frame of mindobedient to gods holy will and content in the belief that my dear daughters married life will be a happy one  they have gone abroad for their holidayto switzerland by way of france i was anything rather than pleased when i heard that my soninlaw proposed to take felicia to that sink of iniquity paris he knows already what i think of balls and playhouses and similar devils diversions and how i have brought up my daughter to think of themthe subject having occurred in conversation among us more than a week since that he could meditate taking a child of mine to the headquarters of indecent jiggings and abominable stageplays of spouting rogues and painted jezebels was indeed a heavy blow  however felicia reconciled me to it in the end she declared that her only desire in going to paris was to see the picturegalleries the public buildings and the fair outward aspect of the city generally your opinions father are my opinions she said and marmaduke i am sure will so shape our arrangements as to prevent our passing a sabbath in paris marmaduke not only consented to this with the perfect good temper of which i have observed more than one gratifying example in him but likewise assured me that speaking for himself personally it would be a relief to him when they got to the mountains and the lakes so that matter was happily settled go where they may god bless and prosper them  speaking of relief i must record that judith has gone away to aberdeen on a visit to some friends youll be wretched enough here she said at parting all by yourself pure vanity and selfcomplacence it may be resignation to her absence or it may be natural force of mind i began to be more easy and composed the moment i was alone and this blessed state of feeling has continued uninterruptedly ever since  v  september 5tha sudden change in my life which it absolutely startles me to record i am going to london  my purpose in taking this most serious step is of a twofold nature i have a greater and a lesser object in view  the greater object is to see my daughter and to judge for myself whether certain doubts on the vital question of her happiness which now torment me night and day are unhappily founded on truth she and her husband returned in august from their weddingtour and took up their abode in marmadukes new residence in london up to this time felicias letters to me were in very truth the delight of my lifeshe was so entirely happy so amazed and delighted with all the wonderful things she saw so full of love and admiration for the best husband that ever lived since her return to london i perceive a complete change  she makes no positive complaint but she writes in a tone of weariness and discontent she says next to nothing of marmaduke and she dwells perpetually on the one idea of my going to london to see her i hope with my whole heart that i am wrong but the rare allusions to her husband and the constantly repeated desire to see her father while she has not been yet three months married seem to me to be bad signs in brief my anxiety is too great to be endured i have so arranged matters with one of my brethren as to be free to travel to london cheaply by steamer and i begin the journey tomorrow  my lesser object may be dismissed in two words having already decided on going to london i propose to call on the wealthy nobleman who owns all the land hereabouts and represent to him the discreditable and indeed dangerous condition of the parish kirk for want of means to institute the necessary repairs if i find myself well received i shall put in a word for the manse which is almost in as deplorable a condition as the church my lord is a wealthy manmay his heart and his purse be opened unto me  sister judith is packing my portmanteau according to custom she forbodes the worst never forget she says that i warned you against marmaduke on the first night when he entered the house  vi  september 10thafter more delays than one on land and sea i was at last set ashore near the tower on the afternoon of yesterday god help us my worst anticipations have been realized my beloved felicia has urgent and serious need of me  it is not to be denied that i made my entry into my soninlaws house in a disturbed and irritated frame of mind first my temper was tried by the almost interminable journey in the noisy and comfortless vehicle which they call a cab from the riverwharf to the westend of london where marmaduke lives in the second place i was scandalized and alarmed by an incident which took placestill on the endless journey from east to westin a street hard by the market of covent garden  we had just approached a large building most profusely illuminated with gas and exhibiting prodigious colored placards having inscribed on them nothing but the name of barrymore the cab came suddenly to a standstill and looking out to see what the obstacle might be i discovered a huge concourse of men and women drawn across the pavement and road alike so that it seemed impossible to pass by them i inquired of my driver what this assembling of the people meant oh says he barrymore has made another hit this answer being perfectly unintelligible to me i requested some further explanation and discovered that barrymore was the name of a stageplayer favored by the populace that the building was a theater and that all these creatures with immortal souls were waiting before the doors opened to get places at the show  the emotions of sorrow and indignation caused by this discovery so absorbed me that i failed to notice an attempt the driver made to pass through where the crowd seemed to be thinner until the offended people resented the proceeding some of them seized the horses head others were on the point of pulling the driver off his box when providentially the police interfered under their protection we drew back and reached our destination in safety by another way i record this otherwise unimportant affair because it grieved and revolted me when i thought of the peoples souls and so indisposed my mind to take cheerful views of anything under these circumstances i would fain hope that i have exaggerated the true state of the case in respect to my daughters married life  my good girl almost smothered me with kisses when i at last got a fair opportunity of observing her i thought her looking pale and worn and anxious query should i have arrived at this conclusion if i had met with no example of the wicked dissipations of london and if i had ridden at my ease in a comfortable vehicle  they had a succulent meal ready for me and what i call fair enough whisky out of scotland here again i remarked that felicia ate very little and marmaduke nothing at all he drank wine tooand good heavens champagne winea needless waste of money surely when there was whisky on the table my appetite being satisfied my soninlaw went out of the room and returned with his hat in his hand you and felicia have many things to talk about on your first evening together ill leave you for a whilei shall only be in the way so he spoke it was in vain that his wife and i assured him he was not in the way at all he kissed his hand and smiled pleasantly and left us  there father says felicia for the last ten days he has gone out like that and left me alone for the whole evening when we first returned from switzerland he left me in the same mysterious way only it was after breakfast then now he stays at home in the daytime and goes out at night  i inquired if she had not summoned him to give her some explanation  i dont know what to make of his explanation says felicia when he went away in the daytime he told me he had business in the city since he took to going out at night he says he goes to his club  have you asked where his club is my dear  he says its in pall mall there are dozens of clubs in that streetand he has never told me the name of his club i am completely shut out of his confidence would you believe it father he has not introduced one of his friends to me since we came home i doubt if they know where he lives since he took this house  what could i say  i said nothing and looked round the room it was fitted up with perfectly palatial magnificence i am an ignorant man in matters of this sort and partly to satisfy my curiosity partly to change the subject i asked to see the house mercy preserve us the same grandeur everywhere i wondered if even such an income as eight hundred a year could suffice for it all in a moment when i was considering this a truly frightful suspicion crossed my mind did these mysterious absences taken in connection with the unbridled luxury that surrounded us mean that my soninlaw was a gamester a shameless shuffler of cards or a debauched bettor on horses while i was still completely overcome by my own previsions of evil my daughter put her arm in mine to take me to the top of the house  for the first time i observed a bracelet of dazzling gems on her wrist not diamonds i said she answered with as much composure as if she had been the wife of a nobleman yes diamondsa present from marmaduke this was too much for me my previsions so to speak forced their way into words oh my poor child i burst out im in mortal fear that your husbands a gamester  she showed none of the horror i had anticipated she only shook her head and began to cry  worse than that im afraid she said  i was petrified my tongue refused its office when i would fain have asked her what she meant her besetting sin poor soul is a proud spirit she dried her eyes on a sudden and spoke out freely in these words i am not going to cry about it the other day father we were out walking in the park a horrid bold yellowhaired woman passed us in an open carriage she kissed her hand to marmaduke and called out to him how are you marmy i was so indignant that i pushed him away from me and told him to go and take a drive with his lady he burst out laughing nonsense he said she has known me for yearsyou dont understand our easy london manners we have made it up since then but i have my own opinion of the creature in the open carriage  morally speaking this was worse than all but logically viewed it completely failed as a means of accounting for the diamond bracelet and the splendor of the furniture  we went on to the uppermost story it was cut off from the rest of the house by a stout partition of wood and a door covered with green baize  when i tried the door it was locked ha says felicia i wanted you to see it for yourself more suspicious proceedings on the part of my soninlaw he kept the door constantly locked and the key in his pocket when his wife asked him what it meant he answered my study is up thereand i like to keep it entirely to myself after such a reply as that the preservation of my daughters dignity permitted but one answer oh keep it to yourself by all means  my previsions upon this assumed another form  i now asked myselfstill in connection with my soninlaws extravagant expenditurewhether the clew to the mystery might not haply be the forging of banknotes on the other side of the baize door my mind was prepared for anything by this time we descended again into the diningroom felicia saw how my spirits were dashed and came and perched upon my knee enough of my troubles for tonight father she said i am going to be your little girl again and we will talk of nothing but cauldkirk until marmaduke comes back i am one of the firmest men living but i could not keep the hot tears out of my eyes when she put her arm round my neck and said those words by good fortune i was sitting with my back to the lamp she didnt notice me  a little after eleven oclock marmaduke returned he looked pale and weary but more champagne and this time something to eat with it seemed to set him to rights againno doubt by relieving him from the reproaches of a guilty conscience  i had been warned by felicia to keep what had passed between us a secret from her husband for the present so we had superficially speaking a merry end to the evening my soninlaw was nearly as good company as ever and wonderfully fertile in suggestions and expedients when he saw they were wanted hearing from his wife to whom i had mentioned it that i purposed representing the decayed condition of the kirk and manse to the owner of cauldkirk and the country round about he strongly urged me to draw up a list of repairs that were most needful before i waited on my lord this advice vicious and degraded as the man who offered it may be is sound advice nevertheless i shall assuredly take it  so far i had written in my diary in the forenoon returning to my daily record after a lapse of some hours i have a new mystery of iniquity to chronicle my abominable soninlaw now appears i blush to write it to be nothing less than an associate of thieves  after the meal they call luncheon i thought it well before recreating myself with the sights of london to attend first to the crying necessities of the kirk and the manse furnished with my written list i presented myself at his lordships residence i was immediately informed that he was otherwise engaged and could not possibly receive me if i wished to see my lords secretary mr helmsley i could do so consenting to this rather than fail entirely in my errand i was shown into the secretarys room  mr helmsley heard what i had to say civilly enough expressing however grave doubts whether his lordship would do anything for me the demands on his purse being insupportably numerous already however he undertook to place my list before his employer and to let me know the result where are you staying in london he asked i answered with my soninlaw mr marmaduke falmer before i could add the address the secretary started to his feet and tossed my list back to me across the table in the most uncivil manner  upon my word says he your assurance exceeds anything i ever heard of your soninlaw is concerned in the robbery of her ladyships diamond braceletthe discovery was made not an hour ago leave the house sir and consider yourself lucky that i have no instructions to give you in charge to the police i protested against this unprovoked outrage with a violence of language which i would rather not recall as a minister i ought under every provocation to have preserved my selfcontrol  the one thing to do next was to drive back to my unhappy daughter  her guilty husband was with her i was too angry to wait for a fit opportunity of speaking the christian humility which i have all my life cultivated as the first of virtues sank as it were from under me in terms of burning indignation i told them what had happened the result was too distressing to be described it ended in felicia giving her husband back the bracelet the hardened reprobate laughed at us wait till i have seen his lordship and mr helmsley he said and left the house  does he mean to escape to foreign parts felicia womanlike believes in him still she is quite convinced that there must be some mistake i am myself in hourly expectation of the arrival of the police    with gratitude to providence i note before going to bed the harmless termination of the affair of the braceletso far as marmaduke is concerned the agent who sold him the jewel has been forced to come forward and state the truth his lordships wife is the guilty person the bracelet was hersa present from her husband harassed by debts that she dare not acknowledge she sold it my lord discovered that it was gone and in terror of his anger the wretched woman took refuge in a lie  she declared that the bracelet had been stolen from her asked for the name of the thief the reckless woman having no other name in her mind at the moment mentioned the man who had innocently bought the jewel of her agent otherwise my unfortunate soninlaw oh the profligacy of the modern babylon it was well i went to the secretary when i did or we should really have had the police in the house marmaduke found them in consultation over the supposed robbery asking for his address there was a dreadful exhibition of violence and recrimination at his lordships residence in the end he repurchased the bracelet my soninlaws money has been returned to him and mr helmsley has sent me a written apology  in a worldly sense this would i suppose be called a satisfactory ending  it is not so to my mind i freely admit that i too hastily distrusted marmaduke but am i on that account to give him back immediately the place which he once occupied in my esteem again this evening he mysteriously quitted the house leaving me alone with felicia and giving no better excuse for his conduct than that he had an engagement and this when i have a double claim on his consideration as his fatherinlaw and his guest    september 11ththe day began well enough at breakfast marmaduke spoke feelingly of the unhappy result of my visit to his lordship and asked me to let him look at the list of repairs it is just useless to expect anything from my lord after what has happened i said besides mr helmsley gave me no hope when i stated my case to him marmaduke still held out his hand for the list let me try if i can get some subscribers he replied this was kindly meant at any rate i gave him the list and i began to recover some of my old friendly feeling for him alas the little gleam of tranquillity proved to be of short duration  we made out our plans for the day pleasantly enough the check came when felicia spoke next of our plans for the evening my father has only four days more to pass with us she said to her husband surely you wont go out again tonight and leave him marmadukes face clouded over directly he looked embarrassed and annoyed i sat perfectly silent leaving them to settle it by themselves  you will stay with us this evening wont you says felicia no he was not free for the evening what another engagement surely you can put it off no impossible to put it off is it a ball or a party of some kind no answer he changed the subjecthe offered felicia the money repaid to him for the bracelet buy one for yourself my dear this time felicia handed him back the money rather too haughtily perhaps i dont want a bracelet she said i want your company in the evening  he jumped up goodtempered as he was in something very like a ragethen looked at me and checked himself on the point as i believe of using profane language this is downright persecution he burst out with an angry turn of his head toward his wife felicia got up in her turn your language is an insult to my father and to me he looked thoroughly staggered at this it was evidently their first serious quarrel  felicia took no notice of him i will get ready directly father and we will go out together he stopped her as she was leaving the roomrecovering his good temper with a readiness which it pleased me to see come come felicia we have not quarreled yet and we wont quarrel now let me off this one time more and i will devote the next three evenings of your fathers visit to him and to you give me a kiss and make it up my daughter doesnt do things by halves she gave him a dozen kisses i should thinkand there was a happy end of it  but what shall we do tomorrow evening says marmaduke sitting down by his wife and patting her hand as it lay in his  take us somewhere says she marmaduke laughed your father objects to public amusements where does he want to go to felicia took up the newspaper there is an oratorio at exeter hall she said my father likes music he turned to me you dont object to oratorios sir i dont object to music i answered so long as i am not required to enter a theater felicia handed the newspaper to me speaking of theaters father have you read what they say about the new play what a pity it cant be given out of a theater i looked at her in speechless amazement she tried to explain herself the paper says that the new play is a service rendered to the cause of virtue and that the great actor barrymore has set an example in producing it which deserves the encouragement of all truly religious people do read it father i held up my hands in dismay my own daughter perverted pinning her faith on a newspaper speaking with a perverse expression of interest of a stageplay and an actor even marmaduke witnessed this lamentable exhibition of backsliding with some appearance of alarm its not her fault sir he said interceding with me its the fault of the newspaper dont blame her i held my peace determining inwardly to pray for her shortly afterward my daughter and i went out marmaduke accompanied us part of the way and left us at a telegraph office who are you going to telegraph to felicia asked another mystery he answered business of my own my dearand went into the office    september 12this my miserable soninlaws house under a curse the yellowhaired woman in the open carriage drove up to the door at halfpast ten this morning in a state of distraction felicia and i saw her from the drawingroom balconya tall woman in gorgeous garments she knocked with her own hand at the doorshe cried out distractedly where is he i must see him at the sound of her voice marmaduke playing with his little dog in the drawingroom rushed downstairs and out into the street hold your tongue we heard him say to her what are you here for  what she answered we failed to hear she was certainly crying marmaduke stamped on the pavement like a man beside himselftook her roughly by the arm and led her into the house  before i could utter a word felicia left me and flew headlong down the stairs  she was in time to hear the diningroom locked following her i prevented the poor jealous creature from making a disturbance at the door god forgive menot knowing how else to quiet heri degraded myself by advising her to listen to what they said she instantly opened the door of the back diningroom and beckoned to me to follow i naturally hesitated i shall go mad she whispered if you leave me by myself what could i do i degraded myself the second time for my own childin pity for my own child  we heard them through the flimsy modern foldingdoors at those times when he was most angry and she most distracted that is to say we heard them when they spoke in their loudest tones  how did you find out where i live says he oh youre ashamed of me says she mr helmsley was with us yesterday evening thats how i found out what do you mean i mean that mr helmsley had your card and address in his pocket ah you were obliged to give your address when you had to clear up that matter of the bracelet you cruel cruel man what have i done to deserve such a note as you sent me this morning do what the note tells you do what the note tells me did anybody ever hear a man talk so out of a lunatic asylum why you havent even the grace to carry out your own wicked deceptionyou havent even gone to bed there the voices grew less angry and we missed what followed soon the lady burst out again piteously entreating him this time oh marmy dont ruin me has anybody offended you is there anything you wish to have altered do you want more money it is too cruel to treat me in this wayit is indeed he made some answer which we were not able to hear we could only suppose that he had upset her temper again she went on louder than ever ive begged and prayed of youand youre as hard as iron ive told you about the princeand that has had no effect on you i have done now well see what the doctor says he got angry in his turn we heard him again i wont see the doctor oh you refuse to see the doctori shall make your refusal knownand if theres law in england you shall feel it their voices dropped again some new turn seemed to be taken by the conversation we heard the lady once more shrill and joyful this time theres a dear you see it dont you in the right light and you havent forgotten the old times have you youre the same dear honorable kindhearted fellow that you always were  i caught hold of felicia and put my hand over her mouth  there was a sound in the next room which might have beeni cannot be certainthe sound of a kiss the next moment we heard the door of the room unlocked then the door of the house was opened and the noise of retreating carriagewheels followed we met him in the hall as he entered the house again  my daughter walked up to him pale and determined  i insist on knowing who that woman is and what she wants here those were her first words he looked at her like a man in utter confusion wait till this evening i am in no state to speak to you now with that he snatched his hat off the hall table and rushed out of the house  it is little more than three weeks since they returned to london from their happy weddingtourand it has come to this  the clock has just struck seven a letter has been left by a messenger addressed to my daughter i had persuaded her poor soul to lie down in her own room god grant that the letter may bring her some tidings of her husband i please myself in the hope of hearing good news  my mind has not been kept long in suspense felicias waitingwoman has brought me a morsel of writing paper with these lines penciled on it in my daughters handwriting dearest father make your mind easy everything is explained i cannot trust myself to speak to you about it tonightand he doesnt wish me to do so only wait till tomorrow and you shall know all he will be back about eleven oclock please dont wait up for himhe will come straight to me    september 13ththe scales have fallen from my eyes the light is let in on me at last my bewilderment is not to be uttered in wordsi am like a man in a dream  before i was out of my room in the morning my mind was upset by the arrival of a telegram addressed to myself it was the first thing of the kind i ever received i trembled under the prevision of some new misfortune as i opened the envelope  of all the people in the world the person sending the telegram was sister judith never before did this distracting relative confound me as she confounded me now here is her message you cant come back an architect from edinburgh asserts his resolution to repair the kirk and the manse the man only waits for his lawful authority to begin the money is readybut who has found it mr architect is forbidden to tell we live in awful times how is felicia  naturally concluding that judiths mind must be deranged i went downstairs to meet my soninlaw for the first time since the events of yesterday at the late breakfast which is customary in this house he was waiting for mebut felicia was not present she breakfasts in her room this morning says marmaduke and i am to give you the explanation which has already satisfied your daughter will you take it at great length sir or will you have it in one word there was something in his manner that i did not at all likehe seemed to be setting me at defiance i said stiffly brevity is best i will have it in one word  here it is then he answered i am barrymore   postscript added by felicia  if the last line extracted from my dear fathers diary does not contain explanation enough in itself i add some sentences from marmadukes letter to me sent from the theater last night n bi leave out the expressions of endearment they are my own private property   just remember how your father talked about theaters and actors when i was at cauldkirk and how you listened in dutiful agreement with him would he have consented to your marriage if he had known that i was one of the spouting rogues associated with the painted jezebels of the playhouse he would never have consentedand you yourself my darling would have trembled at the bare idea of marrying an actor  have i been guilty of any serious deception and have my friends been guilty in helping to keep my secret my birth my name my surviving relatives my fortune inherited from my fatherall these important particulars have been truly stated the name of barrymore is nothing but the name that i assumed when i went on the stage  as to what has happened since our return from switzerland i own that i ought to have made my confession to you forgive me if i weakly hesitated i was so fond of you and i so distrusted the puritanical convictions which your education had rooted in your mind that i put it off from day to day oh my angel  yes i kept the address of my new house a secret from all my friends knowing they would betray me if they paid us visits as for my mysteriouslyclosed study it was the place in which i privately rehearsed my new part when i left you in the mornings it was to go to the theater rehearsals my evening absences began of course with the first performance  your fathers arrival seriously embarrassed me when you most properly insisted on my giving up some of my evenings to him you necessarily made it impossible for me to appear on the stage the one excuse i could make to the theater was that i was too ill to act it did certainly occur to me to cut the gordian knot by owning the truth but your fathers horror when you spoke of the newspaper review of the play and the shame and fear you showed at your own boldness daunted me once more  the arrival at the theater of my written excuse brought the manageress down upon me in a state of distraction nobody could supply my place all the seats were taken and the prince was expected there was what we call a scene between the poor lady and myself i felt i was in the wrong i saw that the position in which i had impulsively placed myself was unworthy of meand it ended in my doing my duty to the theater and the public but for the affair of the bracelet which obliged me as an honorable man to give my name and address the manageress would not have discovered me she like every one else only knew of my address at my bachelor chambers how could you be jealous of the old theatrical comrade of my first days on the stage dont you know yet that you are the one woman in the world  a last word relating to your father and i have done  do you remember my leaving you at the telegraph office it was to send a message to a friend of mine an architect in edinburgh instructing him to go immediately to cauldkirk and provide for the repairs at my expense the theater my dear more than trebles my paternal income and i can well afford it will your father refuse to accept a tribute of respect to a scottish minister because it is paid out of an actors pocket you shall ask him the question  and i say feliciawill you come and see me act i dont expect your father to enter a theater but by way of further reconciling him to his soninlaw suppose you ask him to hear me read the play     mr percy and the prophet  part 1the prediction   chapter i  the quack  the disasters that follow the hateful offense against christianity which men call war were severely felt in england during the peace that ensued on the overthrow of napoleon at waterloo with rare exceptions distress prevailed among all classes of the community the starving nation was ripe and ready for a revolutionary rising against its rulers who had shed the peoples blood and wasted the peoples substance in a war which had yielded to the popular interests absolutely nothing in return  among the unfortunate persons who were driven during the disastrous early years of this century to strange shifts and devices to obtain the means of living was a certain obscure medical man of french extraction named lagarde the doctor duly qualified to bear the title was an inhabitant of london living in one of the narrow streets which connect the great thoroughfare of the strand with the bank of the thames  the method of obtaining employment chosen by poor lagarde as the one alternative left in the face of starvation was and is still considered by the medical profession to be the method of a quack he advertised in the public journals  addressing himself especially to two classes of the community the doctor proceeded in these words  i have the honor of inviting to my house in the first place persons afflicted with maladies which ordinary medical practice has failed to cureand in the second place persons interested in investigations the object of which is to penetrate the secrets of the future of the means by which i endeavor to alleviate suffering and to enlighten doubt it is impossible to speak intelligibly within the limits of an advertisement i can only offer to submit my system to public inquiry without exacting any preliminary fee from ladies and gentlemen who may honor me with a visit those who see sufficient reason to trust me after personal experience will find a moneybox fixed on the waitingroom table into which they can drop their offerings according to their means those whom i am not fortunate enough to satisfy will be pleased to accept the expression of my regret and will not be expected to give anything i shall be found at home every evening between the hours of six and ten  toward the close of the year 1816 this strange advertisement became a general topic of conversation among educated people in london for some weeks the doctors invitations were generally acceptedand all things considered were not badly remunerated a faithful few believed in him and told wonderful stories of what he had pronounced and prophesied in the sanctuary of his consultingroom the majority of his visitors simply viewed him in the light of a public amusement and wondered why such a gentlemanlike man should have chosen to gain his living by exhibiting himself as a quack   chapter ii  the numbers  on a raw and snowy evening toward the latter part of january 1817 a gentleman walking along the strand turned into the street in which doctor lagarde lived and knocked at the physicians door  he was admitted by an elderly male servant to a waitingroom on the first floor the light of one little lamp placed on a bracket fixed to the wall was so obscured by a dark green shade as to make it difficult if not impossible for visitors meeting by accident to recognize each other the metal moneybox fixed to the table was just visible in the flickering light of a small fire the stranger perceived the figures of three men seated apart and silent who were the only occupants of the room beside himself  so far as objects were to be seen there was nothing to attract attention in the waitingroom the furniture was plain and neat and nothing more the elderly servant handed a card with a number inscribed on it to the new visitor said in a whisper your number will be called sir in your turn and disappeared for some minutes nothing disturbed the deep silence but the faint ticking of a clock after a while a bell rang from an inner room a door opened and a gentleman appeared whose interview with doctor lagarde had terminated his opinion of the sitting was openly expressed in one emphatic wordhumbug no contribution dropped from his hand as he passed the moneybox on his way out  the next number being number fifteen was called by the elderly servant and the first incident occurred in the strange series of events destined to happen in the doctors house that night  one after another the three men who had been waiting rose examined their cards under the light of the lamp and sat down again surprised and disappointed  the servant advanced to investigate the matter the numbers possessed by the three visitors instead of being fifteen sixteen and seventeen proved to be sixteen seventeen and eighteen turning to the stranger who had arrived the last the servant said  have i made a mistake sir have i given you number fifteen instead of number eighteen  the gentleman produced his numbered card  a mistake had certainly been made but not the mistake that the servant supposed the card held by the latest visitor turned out to be the card previously held by the dissatisfied stranger who had just left the roomnumber fourteen as to the card numbered fifteen it was only discovered the next morning lying in a corner dropped on the floor  acting on his first impulse the servant hurried out calling to the original holder of fourteen to come back and bear his testimony to that fact the streetdoor had been opened for him by the landlady of the house she was a pretty womanand the gentleman had fortunately lingered to talk to her he was induced at the intercession of the landlady to ascend the stairs again  on returning to the waitingroom he addressed a characteristic question to the assembled visitors more humbug asked the gentleman who liked to talk to a pretty woman  the servantcompletely puzzled by his own stupidityattempted to make his apologies  pray forgive me gentlemen he said i am afraid i have confused the cards i distribute with the cards returned to me i think i had better consult my master  left by themselves the visitors began to speak jestingly of the strange situation in which they were placed the original holder of number fourteen described his experience of the doctor in his own pithy way i applied to the fellow to tell my fortune he first went to sleep over it and then he said he could tell me nothing i asked why i dont know says he  i do says ihumbug ill bet you the long odds gentlemen that you find it humbug too  before the wager could be accepted or declined the door of the inner room was opened again the tall spare black figure of a new personage appeared on the threshold relieved darkly against the light in the room behind him he addressed the visitors in these words  gentlemen i must beg your indulgence the accidentas we now suppose it to bewhich has given to the last comer the number already held by a gentleman who has unsuccessfully consulted me may have a meaning which we can none of us at present see if the three visitors who have been so good as to wait will allow the present holder of number fourteen to consult me out of his turnand if the earlier visitor who left me dissatisfied with his consultation will consent to stay here a little longersomething may happen which will justify a trifling sacrifice of your own convenience is ten minutes patience too much to ask of you  the three visitors who had waited longest consulted among themselves and having nothing better to do with their time decided on accepting the doctors proposal the visitor who believed it all to be humbug coolly took a gold coin out of his pocket tossed it into the air caught it in his closed hand and walked up to the shaded lamp on the bracket  heads stay he said tails go he opened his hand and looked at the coin heads very good go on with your hocuspocus doctorill wait  you believe in chance said the doctor quietly observing him that is not my experience of life  he paused to let the stranger who now held number fourteen pass him into the inner roomthen followed closing the door behind him   chapter iii  the consultation  the consultingroom was better lighted than the waitingroom and that was the only difference between the two in the one as in the other no attempt was made to impress the imagination everywhere the commonplace furniture of a london lodginghouse was left without the slightest effort to alter or improve it by changes of any kind  seen under the clearer light doctor lagarde appeared to be the last person living who would consent to degrade himself by an attempt at imposture of any kind his eyes were the dreamy eyes of a visionary his look was the prematurelyaged look of a student accustomed to give the hours to his book which ought to have been given to his bed to state it briefly he was a man who might easily be deceived by others but who was incapable of consciously practicing deception himself  signing to his visitor to be seated he took a chair on the opposite side of the small table that stood between themwaited a moment with his face hidden in his hands as if to collect himselfand then spoke  do you come to consult me on a case of illness he inquired or do you ask me to look to the darkness which hides your future life  the answer to these questions was frankly and briefly expressed i have no need to consult you about my health i come to hear what you can tell me of my future life  i can try pursued the doctor but i cannot promise to succeed  i accept your conditions the stranger rejoined i never believe nor disbelieve if you will excuse my speaking frankly i mean to observe you closely and to decide for myself  doctor lagarde smiled sadly  you have heard of me as a charlatan who contrives to amuse a few idle people he said i dont complain of that my present position leads necessarily to misinterpretation of myself and my motives still i may at least say that i am the victim of a sincere avowal of my belief in a great science yes i repeat it a great science new i dare say to the generation we live in though it was known and practiced in the days when pyramids were built the age is advancing and the truths which it is my misfortune to advocate before the time is ripe for them are steadily forcing their way to recognition i am resigned to wait my sincerity in this matter has cost me the income that i derived from my medical practice patients distrust me doctors refuse to consult with me i could starve if i had no one to think of but myself but i have another person to consider who is very dear to me and i am driven literally driven either to turn beggar in the streets or do what i am doing now  he paused and looked round toward the corner of the room behind him mother he said gently are you ready  an elderly lady dressed in deep mourning rose from her seat in the corner she had been thus far hidden from notice by the high back of the easychair in which her son sat excepting some f olds of fine black lace laid over her white hair so as to form a headdress at once simple and picturesque there was nothing remarkable in her attire the visitor rose and bowed she gravely returned his salute and moved so as to place herself opposite to her son  may i ask what this lady is going to do said the stranger  to be of any use to you answered doctor lagarde i must be thrown into the magnetic trance the person who has the strongest influence over me is the person who will do it tonight  he turned to his mother when you like he said  bending over him she took both the doctors hands and looked steadily into his eyes no words passed between them nothing more took place in a minute or two his head was resting against the back of the chair and his eyelids had closed  are you sleeping asked madame lagarde  i am sleeping he answered  she laid his hands gently on the arms of the chair and turned to address the visitor  let the sleep gain on him for a minute or two more she said then take one of his hands and put to him what questions you please  does he hear us now madam  you might fire off a pistol sir close to his ear and he would not hear it the vibration might disturb him that is all until you or i touch him and so establish the nervous sympathy he is as lost to all sense of our presence here as if he were dead  are you speaking of the thing called animal magnetism madam  yes sir  and you believe in it of course  my sons belief sir is my belief in this thing as in other things i have heard what he has been saying to you it is for me that he sacrifices himself by holding these exhibitions it is in my poor interests that his hardlyearned money is made i am in infirm health and remonstrate as i may my son persists in providing for me not the bare comforts only but even the luxuries of life whatever i may suffer i have my compensation i can still thank god for giving me the greatest happiness that a woman can enjoy the possession of a good son  she smiled fondly as she looked at the sleeping man draw your chair nearer to him she resumed and take his hand you may speak freely in making your inquiries nothing that happens in this room goes out of it  with those words she returned to her place in the corner behind her sons chair  the visitor took doctor lagardes hand as they touched each other he was conscious of a faintlytitillating sensation in his own handa sensation which oddly reminded him of bygone experiments with an electrical machine in the days when he was a boy at school  i wish to question you about my future life he began how ought i to begin  the doctor spoke his first words in the monotonous tones of a man talking in his sleep  own your true motive before you begin he said your interest in your future life is centered in a woman you wish to know if her heart will be yours in the time that is to comeand there your interest in your future life ends  this startling proof of the sleepers capacity to look by sympathy into his mind and to see there his most secret thoughts instead of convincing the stranger excited his suspicions you have means of getting information he said that i dont understand  the doctor smiled as if the idea amused him  madame lagarde rose from her seat and interposed  hundreds of strangers come here to consult my son she said quietly if you believe that we know who those strangers are and that we have the means of inquiring into their private lives before they enter this room you believe in something much more incredible than the magnetic sleep  this was too manifestly true to be disputed the visitor made his apologies  i should like to have some explanation he added the thing is so very extraordinary how can i prevail upon doctor lagarde to enlighten me  he can only tell you what he sees madame lagarde answered ask him that and you will get a direct reply say to him do you see the lady  the stranger repeated the question the reply followed at once in these words  i see two figures standing side by side one of them is your figure the other is the figure of a lady she only appears dimly i can discover nothing but that she is taller than women generally are and that she is dressed in pale blue  the man to whom he was speaking started at those last words her favorite color he thought to himselfforgetting that while he held the doctors hand the doctor could think with his mind  yes added the sleeper quietly her favorite color as you know she fades and fades as i look at her he went on she is gone i only see you under a new aspect you have a pistol in your hand opposite to you there stands the figure of another man he too has a pistol in his hand are you enemies are you meeting to fight a duel is the lady the cause i try but i fail to see her  can you describe the man  not yet so far he is only a shadow in the form of a man  there was another interval an appearance of disturbance showed itself on the sleepers face suddenly he waved his free hand in the direction of the waitingroom  send for the visitors who are there he said they are all to come in each one of them is to take one of my hands in turnwhile you remain where you are holding the other hand dont let go of me even for a moment my mother will ring  madame lagarde touched a bell on the table the servant received his orders from her and retired after a short absence he appeared again in the consultingroom with one visitor only waiting on the threshold behind him   chapter iv  the man  the other three gentlemen have gone away madam the servant explained addressing madame lagarde they were tired of waiting i found this gentleman fast asleep and i am afraid he is angry with me for taking the liberty of waking him  sleep of the common sort is evidently not allowed in this house with that remark the gentleman entered the room and stood revealed as the original owner of the card numbered fourteen  viewed by the clear lamplight he was a tall finelymade man in the prime of life with a florid complexion goldenbrown hair and sparkling blue eyes noticing madame lagarde he instantly checked the flow of his satire with the instinctive goodbreeding of a gentleman i beg your pardon he said i have a great many faults and a habit of making bad jokes is one of them is the servant right madam in telling me that i have the honor of presenting myself here at your request  madame lagarde briefly explained what had passed  the florid gentleman still privately believing it to be all humbug was delighted to make himself of any use i congratulate you sir he said with his easy humor as he passed the visitor who had become possessed of his card number fourteen seems to be a luckier number in your keeping than it was in mine  as he spoke he took doctor lagardes disengaged hand the instant they touched each other the sleeper started his voice rose his face flushed you are the man he exclaimed i see you plainly now  what am i doing  you are standing opposite to the gentleman here who is holding my other hand and as i have said already you have met to fight a duel  the unbeliever cast a shrewd look at his companion in the consultation  considering that you and i are total strangers sir he said dont you think the doctor had better introduce us before he goes any further we have got to fighting a duel already and we may as well know who we are before the pistols go off he turned to doctor lagarde dramatic situations dont amuse me out of the theater he resumed let me put you to a very commonplace test i want to be introduced to this gentleman has he told you his name  no  of course you know it without being told  certainly i have only to look into your own knowledge of yourselves while i am in this trance and while you have got my hands to know both your names as well as you do  introduce us then retorted the jesting gentleman and take my name first  mr percy linwood replied the doctor i have the honor of presenting you to captain bervie of the artillery  with one accord the gentlemen both dropped doctor lagardes hands and looked at each other in blank amazement  of course he has discovered our names somehow said mr percy linwood explaining the mystery to his own perfect satisfaction in that way  captain bervie had not forgotten what madame lagarde had said to him when he too had suspected a trick he now repeated it quite ineffectually for mr linwoods benefit if you dont feel the force of that argument as i feel it he added perhaps as a favor to me sir you will not object to our each taking the doctors hand again and hearing what more he can tell us while he remains in the state of trance  with the greatest pleasure answered goodhumored mr linwood our friend is beginning to amuse me i am as anxious as you are to know what he is going to see next  captain bervie put the next question  you have seen us ready to fight a duelcan you tell us the result  i can tell you nothing more than i have told you already the figures of the duelists have faded away like the other figures i saw before them what i see now looks like the winding gravelpath of a garden a man and a woman are walking toward me the man stops and places a ring on the womans finger and kisses her  captain bervie opened his lips to continue his inquiriesturned paleand checked himself mr linwood put the next question  who is the happy man he asked  you are the happy man was the instantaneous reply  who is the woman cried captain bervie before mr linwood could speak again  the same woman whom i saw before dressed in the same color in pale blue  captain bervie positively insisted on receiving clearer information than this surely you can see something of her personal appearance he said  i can see that she has long darkbrown hair falling below her waist i can see that she has lovely darkbrown eyes she has the look of a sensitive nervous person she is quite young i can see no more  look again at the man who is putting the ring on her finger said the captain are you sure that the face you see is the face of mr percy linwood  i am absolutely sure  captain bervie rose from his chair  thank you madam he said to the doctors mother i have heard enough  he walked to the door mr percy linwood dropped doctor lagardes hand and appealed to the retiring captain with a broad stare of astonishment  you dont really believe this he said  i only say i have heard enough captain bervie answered  mr linwood could hardly fail to see that any further attempt to treat the matter lightly might lead to undesirable results  it is difficult to speak seriously of this kind of exhibition he resumed quietly but i suppose i may mention a mere matter of fact without meaning or giving offense the description of the lady i can positively declare does not apply in any single particular to any one whom i know  captain bervie turned round at the door his patience was in some danger of failing him mr linwoods unruffled composure assisted in its influence by the presence of madame lagarde reminded him of the claims of politeness he restrained the rash words as they rose to his lips you may make new acquaintances sir was all that he said you have the future before you  upon that he went out percy linwood waited a little reflecting on the captains conduct  had doctor lagardes description of the lady accidentally answered the description of a living lady whom captain bervie knew was he by any chance in love with her and had the doctor innocently reminded him that his love was not returned assuming this to be likely was it really possible that he believed in prophetic revelations offered to him under the fantastic influence of a trance could any man in the possession of his senses go to those lengths the captains conduct was simply incomprehensible  pondering these questions percy decided on returning to his place by the doctors chair of one thing i am certain at any rate he thought to himself ill see the whole imposture out before i leave the house  he took doctor lagardes hand now then what is the next discovery he asked  the sleeper seemed to find some difficulty in answering the question  i indistinctly see the man and the woman again he said  am i the man still percy inquired  no the man this time is the captain the woman is agitated by something that he is saying to her he seems to be trying to persuade her to go away with him she hesitates he whispers something in her ear she yields he leads her away the darkness gathers behind them i look and look and i can see no more  shall we wait awhile percy suggested and then try again  doctor lagarde sighed and reclined in his chair my head is heavy he said my spirits are dull the darkness baffles me i have toiled long enough for you drop my hand and leave me to rest  hearing those words madame lagarde approached her sons chair  it will be useless sir to ask him any more questions tonight she said he has been weak and nervous all day and he is worn out by the effort he has made pardon me if i ask you to step aside for a moment while i give him the repose that he needs  she laid her right hand gently on the doctors head and kept it there for a minute or so are you at rest now she asked  i am at rest he answered in faint drowsy tones  madame lagarde returned to percy if you are not yet satisfied she said my son will be at your service tomorrow evening sir  thank you madam i have only one more question to ask and you can no doubt answer it when your son wakes will he remember what he has said to captain bervie and to myself  my son will be as absolutely ignorant of everything that he has seen and of everything that he has said in the trance as if he had been at the other end of the world  percy linwood swallowed this last outrageous assertion with an effort which he was quite unable to conceal many thanks madam he said i wish you goodnight  returning to the waitingroom he noticed the moneybox fixed to the table these people look poor he thought to himself and i feel really indebted to them for an amusing evening besides i can afford to be liberal for i shall certainly never go back he dropped a fivepound note into the moneybox and left the house  walking toward his club percys natural serenity of mind was a little troubled by the remembrance of captain bervies language and conduct the captain had interested the young man in spite of himself his first idea was to write to bervie and mention what had happened at the renewed consultation with doctor lagarde on second thoughts he saw reason to doubt how the captain might receive such an advance as this on the part of a stranger after all percy decided the whole thing is too absurd to be worth thinking about seriously neither he nor i are likely to meet again or to see the doctor againand theres an end of it  he never was more mistaken in his life the end of it was not to come for many a long day yet   part iithe fulfillment   chapter v  the ballroom  while the consultation at doctor lagardes was still fresh in the memory of the persons present at it chance or destiny occupied in sowing the seeds for the harvest of the future discovered as one of its fit instruments a retired military officer named major mulvany  the major was a smart little man who persisted in setting up the appearance of youth as a means of hiding the reality of fifty being still a bachelor and being always ready to make himself agreeable he was generally popular in the society of women in the ballroom he was a really welcome addition to the company the german waltz had then been imported into england little more than three years since the outcry raised against the dance by persons ski lled in the discovery of latent impropriety had not yet lost its influence in certain quarters men who could waltz were scarce the major had successfully grappled with the difficulties of learning the dance in mature life and the young ladies rewarded him nobly for the effort that is to say they took the assumption of youth for granted in the palpable presence of fifty  knowing everybody and being welcome everywhere playing a good hand at whist and having an inexhaustible fancy in the invention of a dinner major mulvany naturally belonged to all the best clubs of his time percy linwood and he constantly met in the billiardroom or at the dinnertable the major approved of the easy handsome pleasanttempered young man i have lost the first freshness of youth he used to say with pathetic resignation and i see myself revived as it were in percy naturally i like percy  about three weeks after the memorable evening at doctor lagardes the two friends encountered each other on the steps of a club  have you got anything to do tonight asked the major  nothing that i know of said percy unless i go to the theater  let the theater wait my boy my old regiment gives a ball at woolwich tonight i have got a ticket to spare and i know several sweet girls who are going some of them waltz percy gather your rosebuds while you may come with me  the invitation was accepted as readily as it was given the major found the carriage and percy paid for the posthorses they entered the ballroom among the earlier guests and the first person whom they met waiting near the door wascaptain bervie  percy bowed a little uneasily i feel some doubt he said laughing whether we have been properly introduced to one another or not  not properly introduced cried major mulvany ill soon set that right my dear friend percy linwood my dear friend arthur berviebe known to each other esteem each other  captain bervie acknowledged the introduction by a cold salute percy yielding to the goodnatured impulse of the moment alluded to what had happened in doctor lagardes consultingroom  you missed something worth hearing when you left the doctor the other night he said we continued the sitting and you turned up again among the persons of the drama in a new character  excuse me for interrupting you said captain bervie i am a member of the committee charged with the arrangements of the ball and i must really attend to my duties  he withdrew without waiting for a reply percy looked round wonderingly at major mulvany strange he said i feel rather attracted toward captain bervie and he seems to have taken such a dislike to me that he can hardly behave with common civility what does it mean  ill tell you answered the major confidentially arthur bervie is madly in lovemadly is really the wordwith a miss bowmore and this is between ourselves the young lady doesnt feel it quite in the same way a sweet girl ive often had her on my knee when she was a child her father and mother are old friends of mine she is coming to the ball tonight thats the true reason why arthur left you just now look at himwaiting to be the first to speak to her if he could have his way he wouldnt let another man come near the poor girl all through the evening he really persecutes her ill introduce you to miss bowmore and you will see how he looks at us for presuming to approach her its a great pity she will never marry him arthur bervie is a man in a thousand but hes fast becoming a perfect bear under the strain on his temper whats the matter you dont seem to be listening to me  this last remark was perfectly justified in telling the captains lovestory major mulvany had revived his young friends memory of the lady in the blue dress who had haunted the visions of doctor lagarde  tell me said percy what is miss bowmore like is there anything remarkable in her personal appearance i have a reason for asking  as he spoke there arose among the guests in the rapidlyfilling ballroom a low murmur of surprise and admiration the major laid one hand on percys shoulder and lifting the other pointed to the door  what is miss bowmore like he repeated there she is let her answer for herself  percy turned toward the lower end of the room  a young lady was entering dressed in plain silk and the color of it was a pale blue excepting a white rose at her breast she wore no ornament of any sort doubly distinguished by the perfect simplicity of her apparel and by her tall supple commanding figure she took rank at once as the most remarkable woman in the room moving nearer to her through the crowd under the guidance of the complaisant major young linwood gained a clearer view of her hair her complexion and the color of her eyes in every one of these particulars she was the living image of the woman described by doctor lagarde  while percy was absorbed over this strange discovery major mulvany had got within speaking distance of the young lady and of her mother as they stood together in conversation with captain bervie my dear mrs bowmore how well you are looking my dear miss charlotte what a sensation you have made already the glorious simplicity if i may so express myself of your dress isiswhat was i going to saythe ideas come thronging on me i merely want words  miss bowmores magnificent brown eyes wandering from the major to percy rested on the young man with a modest and momentary interest which captain bervies jealous attention instantly detected  they are forming a dance he said pressing forward impatiently to claim his partner if we dont take our places we shall be too late  stop stop cried the major there is a time for everything and this is the time for presenting my dear friend here mr percy linwood he is like me miss charlottehe has been struck by your glorious simplicity and he wants words at this part of the presentation he happened to look toward the irate captain and instantly gave him a hint on the subject of his temper i say arthur bervie we are all goodhumored people here what have you got on your eyebrows it looks like a frown and it doesnt become you send for a skilled waiter and have it brushed off and taken away directly  may i ask miss bowmore if you are disengaged for the next dance said percy the moment the major gave him an opportunity of speaking  miss bowmore is engaged to me for the next dance said the angry captain before the young lady could answer  the third dance then percy persisted with his brightest smile  with pleasure mr linwood said miss bowmore she would have been no true woman if she had not resented the open exhibition of arthurs jealousy it was like asserting a right over her to which he had not the shadow of a claim she threw a look at percy as her partner led her away which was the severest punishment she could inflict on the man who ardently loved her  the third dance stood in the programme as a waltz  in jealous distrust of percy the captain took the conductor of the band aside and used his authority as committeeman to substitute another dance he had no sooner turned his back on the orchestra than the wife of the colonel of the regiment who had heard him spoke to the conductor in her turn and insisted on the original programme being retained quote the colonels authority said the lady if captain bervie ventures to object in the meantime the captain on his way to rejoin charlotte was met by one of his brother officers who summoned him officially to an impending debate of the committee charged with the administrative arrangements of the suppertable bervie had no choice but to follow his brother officer to the committeeroom  barely a minute later the conductor appeared at his desk and the first notes of the music rose low and plaintive introducing the third dance  percy my boy cried the major recognizing the melody youre in lucks wayits going to be a waltz  almost as he spoke the notes of the symphony glided by subtle modulations into the inspiriting air of the waltz percy claimed his partners hand miss charlotte hesitated and looked at her mother  surely you waltz said percy  i have learned to waltz she answered modestly but this is such a large room and there are so many people  once round percy pleaded only once round  miss bowmore looked again at her mother her foot was keeping time with the music under her dress her heart was beating with a delicious excitement kindhearted mrs bowmore smiled and said once round my dear as mr linwood suggests  in another moment percys arm took possession of her waist and they were away on the wings of the waltz  could words describe could thought realize the exquisite enjoyment of the dance enjoyment it was moreit was an epoch in charlottes lifeit was the first time she had waltzed with a man what a difference between the fervent clasp of percys arm and the cold formal contact of the mistress who had taught her how brightly his eyes looked down into hers admiring her with such a tender restraint that there could surely be no harm in looking up at him now and then in return round and round they glided absorbed in the music and in themselves occasionally her bosom just touched him at those critical moments when she was most in need of support at other intervals she almost let her head sink on his shoulder in trying to hide from him the smile which acknowledged his admiration too boldly once round percy had suggested once round her mother had said they had been ten twenty thirty times round they had never stopped to rest like other dancers they had centered the eyes of the whole room on themincluding the eyes of captain berviewithout knowing it her delicately pale complexion had changed to rosyred the neat arrangement of her hair had become disturbed her bosom was rising and falling faster and faster in the effort to breathebefore fatigue and heat overpowered her at last and forced her to say to him faintly im very sorryi cant dance any more  percy led her into the cooler atmosphere of the refreshmentroom and revived her with a glass of lemonade her arm still rested on hisshe was just about to thank him for the care he had taken of herwhen captain bervie entered the room  mrs bowmore wishes me to take you back to her he said to charlotte then turning to percy he added will you kindly wait here while i take miss bowmore to the ballroom i have a word to say to youi will return directly  the captain spoke with perfect politenessbut his face betrayed him it was pale with the sinister whiteness of suppressed rage  percy sat down to cool and rest himself with his experience of the ways of men he felt no surprise at the marked contrast between captain bervies face and captain bervies manner he has seen us waltzing and he is coming back to pick a quarrel with me such was the interpretation which mr linwoods knowledge of the world placed on captain bervies politeness in a minute or two more the captain returned to the refreshmentroom and satisfied percy that his anticipations had not deceived him   chapter vi  love  four days had passed since the night of the ball  although it was no later in the year than the month of february the sun was shining brightly and the air was as soft as the air of a day in spring percy and charlotte were walking together in the little garden at the back of mr bowmores cottage near the town of dartford in kent  mr linwood said the young lady you were to have paid us your first visit the day after the ball why have you kept us waiting have you been too busy to remember your new friends  i have counted the hours since we parted miss charlotte if i had not been detained by business  i understand for three days business has controlled you on the fourth day you have controlled businessand here you are i dont believe one word of it mr linwood  there was no answering such a declaration as this guiltily conscious that charlotte was right in refusing to accept his wellworn excuse percy made an awkward attempt to change the topic of conversation  they happened at the moment to be standing near a small conservatory at the end of the garden the glass door was closed and the few plants and shrubs inside had a lonely neglected look does nobody ever visit this secluded place percy asked jocosely or does it hide discoveries in the rearing of plants which are forbidden mysteries to a stranger  satisfy your curiosity mr linwood by all means charlotte answered in the same tone open the door and i will follow you  percy obeyed in passing through the doorway he encountered the bare hanging branches of some creeping plant long since dead and detached from its fastenings on the woodwork of the roof he pushed aside the branches so that charlotte could easily follow him in without being aware that his own forced passage through them had a little deranged the folds of spotless white cambric which a welldressed gentleman wore round his neck in those days charlotte seated herself and directed percys attention to the desolate conservatory with a saucy smile  the mystery which your lively imagination has associated with this place she said means being interpreted that we are too poor to keep a gardener make the best of your disappointment mr linwood and sit here by me we are out of hearing and out of sight of mammas other visitors you have no excuse now for not telling me what has really kept you away from us  she fixed her eyes on him as she said those words before percy could think of another excuse her quick observation detected the disordered condition of his cravat and discovered the upper edge of a black plaster attached to one side of his neck  you have been hurt in the neck she said that is why you have kept away from us for the last three days  a mere trifle he answered in great confusion please dont notice it  her eyes still resting on his face assumed an expression of suspicious inquiry which percy was entirely at a loss to understand suddenly she started to her feet as if a new idea had occurred to her wait here she said flushing with excitement till i come back i insist on it  before percy could ask for an explanation she had left the conservatory  in a minute or two miss bowmore returned with a newspaper in her hand read that she said pointing to a paragraph distinguished by a line drawn round it in ink  the passage that she indicated contained an account of a duel which had recently taken place in the neighborhood of london the names of the duelists were not mentioned one was described as an officer and the other as a civilian they had quarreled at cards and had fought with pistols the civilian had had a narrow escape of his life his antagonists bullet had passed near enough to the side of his neck to tear the flesh and had missed the vital parts literally by a hairsbreadth  charlottes eyes riveted on percy detected a sudden change of color in his face the moment he looked at the newspaper that was enough for her you are the man she cried oh for shame for shame to risk your life for a paltry dispute about cards  i would risk it again said percy to hear you speak as if you set some value on it  she looked away from him without a word of reply her mind seemed to be busy again with its own thoughts did she meditate returning to the subject of the duel was she not satisfied with the discovery which she had just made  no such doubts as these troubled the mind of percy linwood intoxicated by the charm of her presence emboldened by her innocent betrayal of the interest that she felt in him he opened his whole heart to her as unreservedly as if they had known each other from the days of their childhood there was but one excuse for him charlotte was his first love  you dont know how completely you have become a part of my life since we met at the ball he went on that one delightful dance seemed by some magic which i cant explain to draw us together in a few minutes as if we had known each other for years oh dear i could make such a confession of what i feltonly i am afraid of offending you by speaking too soon women are so dreadfully difficult to understand how is a man to know at what time it is considerate toward them to conceal his true feelings and at what time it is equally considerate to express his true feelings one doesnt know whether it is a matter of days or weeks or monthsthere ought to be a law to settle it dear miss charlotte when a poor fellow loves you at first sight as he has never loved any other woman and when he is tormented by the fear that some other man may be preferred to him cant you forgive him if he lets out the truth a little too soon he ventured as he put that very downright question to take her hand it really isnt my fault he said simply my heart is so full of you i can talk of nothing else  to percys delight the first experimental pressure of his hand far from being resented was softly returned charlotte looked at him again with a new resolution in her face  ill forgive you for talking nonsense mr linwood she said and i will even permit you to come and see me again on one conditionthat you tell the whole truth about the duel if you conceal the smallest circumstance our acquaintance is at an end  havent i owned everything already percy inquired in great perplexity did i say no when you told me i was the man  could you say no with that plaster on your neck was the ready rejoinder i am determined to know more than the newspaper tells me will you declare on your word of honor that captain bervie had nothing to do with the duel can you look me in the face and say that the real cause of the quarrel was a disagreement at cards when you were talking with me just before i left the ball how did you answer a gentleman who asked you to make one at the whisttable you said i dont play at cards ah you thought i had forgotten that dont kiss my hand trust me with the whole truth or say goodby forever  only tell me what you wish to know miss charlotte said percy humbly if you will put the questions i will give the answersas well as i can  on this understanding percys evidence was extracted from him as follows  was it captain bervie who quarreled with you  yes  was it about me  yes  what did he say  he said i had committed an impropriety in waltzing with you  why  because your parents disapproved of your waltzing in a public ballroom  thats not true what did he say next  he said i had added tenfold to my offense by waltzing with you in such a manner as to make you the subject of remark to the whole room  oh did you let him say that  no i contradicted him instantly and i said besides its an insult to miss bowmore to suppose that she would permit any impropriety  quite right and what did he say  well he lost his temper i would rather not repeat what he said when he was mad with jealousy there was nothing to be done with him but to give him his way  give him his way does that mean fight a duel with him  dont be angryit does  and you kept my name out of it by pretending to quarrel at the cardtable  yes we managed it when the cardroom was emptying at suppertime and nobody was present but major mulvany and another friend as witnesses  and when did you fight the duel  the next morning  you never thought of me i suppose  indeed i did i was very glad that you had no suspicion of what we were at  was that all  no i had your flower with me the flower you gave me out of your nosegay at the ball  well  oh never mind it doesnt matter  it does matter what did you do with my flower  i gave it a sly kiss while they were measuring the ground and dont tell anybody i put it next to my heart to bring me luck  was that just before he shot at you  yes  how did he shoot  he walked as the seconds had arranged it ten paces forward and then he stopped and lifted his pistol  dont tell me any more oh to think of my being the miserable cause of such horrors ill never dance again as long as i live did you think he had killed you when the bullet wounded your poor neck  no i hardly felt it at first  hardly felt it how he talks and when the wretch had done his best to kill you and when it came to your turn what did you do  nothing  what you didnt walk your ten paces forward  no  and you never shot at him in return  no i had no quarrel with him poor fellow i just stood where i was and fired in the air  before he could stop her charlotte seized his hand and kissed it with an hysterical fervor of admiration which completely deprived him of his presence of mind  why shouldnt i kiss the hand of a hero she cried with tears of enthusiasm sparkling in her eyes nobody but a hero would have given that man his life nobody but a hero would have pardoned him while the blood was streaming from the wound that he had inflicted i respect you i admire you oh dont think me bold i cant control myself when i hear of anything noble and good you will understand me better when we get to be old friendswont you  she spoke in low sweet tones of entreaty percys arm stole softly round her  are we never to be nearer and dearer to each other than old friends he asked in a whisper i am not a heroyour goodness overrates me dear miss charlotte my one ambition is to be the happy man who is worthy enough to win you at your own time i wouldnt distress you i wouldnt confuse you i wouldnt for the whole world take advantage of the compliment which your sympathy has paid to me if it offends you i wont even ask if i may hope  she sighed as he said the last words trembled a little and silently looked at him  percy read his answer in her eyes without meaning it on either side their heads drew nearer together their cheeks then their lips touched she started back from him and rose to leave the conservatory at the same moment the sound of slowlyapproaching footsteps became audible on the gravel walk of the garden charlotte hurried to the door  my father she exclaimed turning to percy come and be introduced to him  percy followed her into the garden   chapter vii  politics  judging by appearances mr bowmore looked like a man prematurely wasted and worn by the cares of a troubled life his eyes presented the one feature in which his daughter resembled him in shape and color they were exactly reproduced in charlotte the difference was in the expression the fathers look was habitually restless eager and suspicious not a trace was to be seen in it of the truthfulness and gentleness which made the charm of the daughters expression a man whose bitter experience of the world had soured his temper and shaken his faith in his fellowcreaturessuch was mr bowmore as he presented himself on the surface he received percy politelybut with a preoccupied air every now and then his restless eyes wandered from the visitor to an open letter in his hand charlotte observing him pointed to the letter  have you any bad news there papa she asked  dreadful news mr bowmore answered dreadful news my child to every englishman who respects the liberties which his ancestors won my correspondent is a man who is in the confidence of the ministers he continued addressing percy what do you think is the remedy that the government proposes for the universal distress among the population caused by an infamous and needless war despotism mr linwood despotism in this free country is the remedy in one week more sir ministers will bring in a bill for suspending the habeas corpus act  before percy could do justice in words to the impression produced on him charlotte innocently asked a question which shocked her father  what is the habeas corpus act papa  good god cried mr bowmore is it possible that a child of mine has grown up to womanhood in ignorance of the palladium of english liberty oh charlotte charlotte  i am very sorry papa if you will only tell me i will never forget it  mr bowmore reverently uncovered his head saluting an invisible habeas corpus act he took his daughter by the hand with a certain parental sternness his voice trembled with emotion as he spoke his next words  the habeas corpus act my child forbids the imprisonment of an english subject unless that imprisonment can be first justified by law not even the will of the reigning monarch can prevent us from appearing before the judges of the land and summoning them to declare whether our committal to prison is legally just  he put on his hat again never forget what i have told you charlotte he said solemnly i would not remove my hat sir he continuing turning to percy in the presence of the proudest autocrat that ever sat on a throne i uncover in homage to the grand law which asserts the sacredness of human liberty when parliament has sanctioned the infamous bill now before it english patriots may be imprisoned may even be hanged on warrants privately obtained by the paid spies and informers of the men who rule us perhaps i weary you sir you are a young man the conduct of the ministry may not interest you  on the contrary said percy i have the strongest personal interest in the conduct of the ministry  how in what way cried mr bowmore eagerly  my late father had a claim on government percy answered for money expended in foreign service as his heir i inherit the claim which has been formally recognized by the present ministers my petition for a settlement will be presented by friends of mine who can advocate my interests in the house of commons  mr bowmore took percys hand and shook it warmly  in such a matter as this you cannot have too many friends to help you he said i myself have some influence as representing opinion outside the house and i am entirely at your service come tomorrow and let us talk over the details of your claim at my humble dinnertable today i must attend a meeting of the branchhampdenclub of which i am vicepresident and to which i am now about to communicate the alarming news which my letter contains excuse me for leaving youand count on a hearty welcome when we see you tomorrow  the amiable patriot saluted his daughter with a smile and disappeared  i hope you like my father said charlotte all our friends say he ought to be in parliament he has tried twice the expenses were dreadful and each time the other man defeated him the agent says he would be certainly elected if he tried again but there is no money and we mustnt think of it  a man of a suspicious turn of mind might have discovered in those artless words the secret of mr bowmores interest in the success of his young friends claim on the government one british subject with a sum of ready money at his command may be an inestimably useful person to another british subject without ready money who cannot sit comfortably unless he sits in parliament but honest percy linwood was not a man of a suspicious turn of mind he had just opened his lips to echo charlottes filial glorification of her father when a shabbilydressed manservant met them with a message for which they were both alike unprepared  captain bervie has called miss to say goodby and my mistress requests your company in the parlor   chapter viii  the warning  having delivered his little formula of words the shabby servant cast a look of furtive curiosity at percy and withdrew charlotte turned to her lover with indignation sparkling in her eyes and flushing on her cheeks at the bare idea of seeing captain bervie again does he think i will breathe the same air she exclaimed with the man who attempted to take your life  percy gently remonstrated with her  you are sadly mistaken he said captain bervie stood to receive my fire as fairly as i stood to receive his when i discharged my pistol in the air he was the first man who ran up to me and asked if i was seriously hurt they told him my wound was a trifle and he fell on his knees and thanked god for preserving my life from his guilty hand i am no longer the rival who hates you he said give me time to try if change of scene will quiet my mind and i will be your brother and her brother whatever his faults may be charlotte arthur bervie has a great heart go in i entreat you and be friends with him as i am  charlotte listened with downcast eyes and changing color you believe him she asked in low and trembling tones  i believe him as i believe you percy answered  she secretly resented the comparison and detested the captain more heartily than ever i will go in and see him if you wish it she said but not by myself i want you to come with me  why percy asked  i want to see what his face says when you and he meet  do you still doubt him charlotte  she made no reply percy had done his best to convince her and had evidently failed  they went together into the cottage fixing her eyes steadily on the captains face charlotte saw it turn pale when percy followed her into the parlor the two men greeted one another cordially charlotte sat down by her mother preserving her composure so far as appearances went i hear you have called to bid us goodby she said to bervie is it to be a long absence  i have got two months leave the captain answered without looking at her while he spoke  are you going abroad  yes i think so  she turned away to her mother bervie seized the opportunity of speaking to percy i have a word of advice for your private ear at the same moment charlotte whispered to her mother dont encourage him to prolong his visit  the captain showed no intention to prolong his visit to charlottes surprise when he took leave of the ladies percy also rose to go his carriage he said was waiting at the door and he had offered to take captain bervie back to london  charlotte instantly suspected an arrangement between the two men for a confidential interview her obstinate distrust of bervie strengthened tenfold she reluctantly gave him her hand as he parted from her at the parlordoor the effort of concealing her true feeling toward him gave a color and a vivacity to her face which made her irresistibly beautiful bervie looked at the woman whom he had lost with an immeasurable sadness in his eyes when we meet again he said you will see me in a new character he hurried out of the gate as if he feared to trust himself for a moment longer in her presence  charlotte followed percy into the passage i shall be here tomorrow dearest he said and tried to raise her hand to his lips she abruptly drew it away not that hand she answered captain bervie has just touched it kiss the other  do you still doubt the captain said percy amused by her petulance  she put her arm over his shoulder and touched the plaster on his neck gently with her finger theres one thing i dont doubt she said the captain did that  percy left her laughing at the front gate of the cottage he found arthur bervie in conversation with the same shabbilydressed manservant who had announced the captains visit to charlotte  what has become of the other servant bervie asked i mean the old man who has been with mr bowmore for so many years  he has left his situation sir  why  as i understand sir he spoke disrespectfully to the master  oh and how came the master to hear of you  i advertised and mr bowmore answered my advertisement  bervie looked hard at the man for a moment and then joined percy at the carriage door the two gentlemen started for london  what do you think of mr bowmores new servant asked the captain as they drove away from the cottage i dont like the look of the fellow  i didnt particularly notice him percy answered  there was a pause when the conversation was resumed it turned on commonplace subjects the captain looked uneasily out of the carriage window percy looked uneasily at the captain  they had left dartford about two miles behind them when percy noticed an old gabled house sheltered by magnificent trees and standing on an eminence well removed from the highroad carriages and saddlehorses were visible on the drive in front and a flag was hoisted on a staff placed in the middle of the lawn  something seems to be going on there percy remarked a fine old house who does it belong to  bervie smiled it belongs to my father he said he is chairman of the bench of local magistrates and he receives his brother justices today to celebrate the opening of the sessions  he stopped and looked at percy with some embarrassment i am afraid i have surprised and disappointed you he resumed abruptly changing the subject i told you when we met just now at mr bowmores cottage that i had something to say to you and i have not yet said it the truth is i dont feel sure whether i have been long enough your friend to take the liberty of advising you  whatever your advice is percy answered trust me to take it kindly on my side  thus encouraged the captain spoke out  you will probably pass much of your time at the cottage he began and you will be thrown a great deal into mr bowmores society i have known him for many years speaking from that knowledge i most seriously warn you against him as a thoroughly unprincipled and thoroughly dangerous man  this was strong languageand naturally enough percy said so the captain justified his language  without alluding to mr bowmores politics he went on i can tell you that the motive of everything he says and does is vanity to the gratification of that one passion he would sacrifice you or me his wife or his daughter without hesitation and without remorse his one desire is to get into parliament you are wealthy and you can help him he will leave no effort untried to reach that end and if he gets you into political difficulties he will desert you without scruple  percy made a last effort to take mr bowmores partfor the one irresistible reason that he was charlottes father  pray dont think i am unworthy of your kind interest in my welfare he pleaded can you tell me of any facts which justify what you have just said  i can tell you of three facts bervie said mr bowmore belongs to one of the most revolutionary clubs in england he has spoken in the ranks of sedition at public meetings and his name is already in the black book at the home office so much for the past as to the future if the rumor be true that ministers mean to stop the insurrectionary risings among the population by suspending the habeas corpus act mr bowmore will certainly be in danger and it may be my fathers duty to grant the warrant that apprehends him write to my father to verify what i have said and i will forward your letter by way of satisfying him that he can trust you in the meantime refuse to accept mr bowmores assistance in the matter of your claim on parliament and above all things stop him at the outset when he tries to steal his way into your intimacy i need not caution you to say nothing against him to his wife and daughter his wily tongue has long since deluded them dont let him delude you have you thought any more of our evening at doctor lagardes he asked abruptly changing the subject  i hardly know said percy still under the impression of the formidable warning which he had just received  let me jog your memory the other continued you went on with the consultation by yourself after i had left the doctors house it will be really doing me a favor if you can call to mind what lagarde saw in the trancein my absence  thus entreated percy roused himself his memory of events were still fresh enough to answer the call that his friend had made on it in describing what had happened he accurately repeated all that the doctor had said  bervie dwelt on the words with alarm in his face as well as surprise  a man like me trying to persuade a woman like he checked himself as if he was afraid to let charlottes name pass his lips trying to induce a woman to go away with me he resumed and persuading her at last pray go on what did the doctor see next  he was too much exhausted he said to see any more  surely you returned to consult him again  no i had had enough of it  when we get to london said the captain we shall pass along the strand on the way to your chambers will you kindly drop me at the turning that leads to the doctors lodgings  percy looked at him in amazement you still take it seriously he said  is it not serious bervie asked have you and i so far not done exactly what this man saw us doing did we not meet in the days when we were rivals as he saw us meet with the pistols in our hands did you not recognize his description of the lady when you met her at the ball as i recognized it before you  mere coincidences percy answered quoting charlottes opinion when they had spoken together of doctor lagarde but taking care not to cite his authority how many thousand men have been crossed in love how many thousand men have fought duels for love how many thousand women choose blue for their favorite color and answer to the vague description of the lady whom the doctor pretended to see  say that it is so bervie rejoined the thing is remarkable even from your point of view and if more coincidences follow the result will be more remarkable still  arrived at the strand percy set the captain down at the turning which led to the doctors lodgings you will call on me or write me word if anything remarkable happens he said  you shall hear from me without fail bervie replied  that night the captains pen performed the captains promise in few and startling words  melancholy news madame lagarde is dead nothing is known of her son but that he has left england i have found out that he is a political exile if he has ventured back to france it is barely possible that i may hear something of him i have friends at the english embassy in paris who will help me to make inquiries and i start for the continent in a day or two write to me while i am away to the care of my father at the manor house near dartford he will always know my address abroad and will forward your letters for your own sake remember the warning i gave you this afternoon your faithful friend a b   chapter ix  official secrets  there was a more serious reason than bervie was aware of at the time for the warning which he had thought it his duty to address to percy linwood the new footman who had entered mr bowmores service was a spy  well practiced in the infamous vocation that he followed the wretch had been chosen by the department of secret service at the home office to watch the proceedings of mr bowmore and his friends and to report the result to his superiors it may not be amiss to add that the employment of paid spies and informers by the english government of that time was openly acknowledged in the house of lords and was defended as a necessary measure in the speeches of lord redesdale and lord liverpool  the reports furnished by the home office spy under these circumstances begin with the month of march and take the form of a series of notes introduced as follows  mr secretarysince i entered mr bowmores service i have the honor to inform you that my eyes and ears have been kept in a state of active observation and i can further certify that my means of making myself useful in the future to my honorable employers are in no respect diminished not the slightest suspicion of my true character is felt by any person in the house  first note  the young gentleman now on a visit to mr bowmore is as you have been correctly informed mr percy linwood although he is engaged to be married to miss bowmore he is not discreet enough to conceal a certain want of friendly feeling on his part toward her father the young lady has noticed this and has resented it she accuses her lover of having allowed himself to be prejudiced against mr bowmore by some slanderous person unknown  mr percys clumsy defense of himself led in my hearing to a quarrel nothing but his prompt submission prevented the marriage engagement from being broken off  if you showed a want of confidence in me i heard miss charlotte say i might forgive it but when you show a want of confidence in a man so noble as my father i have no mercy on you after such an expression of filial sentiment as this mr percy wisely took the readiest way of appealing to the ladys indulgence the young man has a demand on parliament for moneys due to his fathers estate and he pleased and flattered miss charlotte by asking mr bowmore to advise him as to the best means of asserting his claim by way of advancing his political interests mr bowmore introduced him to the local hampden club and miss charlotte rewarded him with a generosity which must not be passed over in silence her lover was permitted to put an engagement ring on her finger and to kiss her afterward to his hearts content  second note  mr percy has paid more visits to the republican club and justice bervie father of the captain has heard of it and has written to his son the result that might have been expected has followed captain bervie announces his return to england to exert his influence for political good against the influence of mr bowmore for political evil  in the meanwhile mr percys claim has been brought before the house of commons and has been adjourned for further consideration in six months time both the gentlemen are indignantespecially mr bowmore he has called a meeting of the club to consider his young friends wrongs and has proposed the election of mr percy as a member of that revolutionary society  third note  mr percy has been elected captain bervie has tried to awaken his mind to a sense of the danger that threatens him if he persists in associating with his republican friendsand has utterly failed mr bowmore and mr percy have made speeches at the club intended to force the latter gentlemans claim on the immediate attention of government mr bowmores flow of frothy eloquence has its influence as you know from our shorthand writers previous reports on thousands of ignorant people as it seems to me the reasons for at once putting this man in prison are beyond dispute whether it is desirable to include mr percy in the order of arrest i must not venture to decide let me only hint that his seditious speech rivals the more elaborate efforts of mr bowmore himself  so much for the present i may now respectfully direct your attention to the future  on the second of april next the club assembles a public meeting in aid of british liberty in a field near dartford mr bowmore is to preside and is to be escorted afterward to westminster hall on his way to plead mr percys cause in his own person before the house of commons he is quite serious in declaring that the minions of government dare not touch a hair of his head miss charlotte agrees with her father and mr percy agrees with miss charlotte such is the state of affairs at the house in which i am acting the part of domestic servant  i inclose shorthand reports of the speeches recently delivered at the hampden club and have the honor of waiting for further orders  fourth note  your commands have reached me by this mornings post  i immediately waited on justice bervie in plain clothes of course and gave him your official letter instructing me to arrest mr bowmore and mr percy linwood  the venerable magistrate hesitated  he quite understood the necessity for keeping the arrest a strict secret in the interests of government the only reluctance he felt in granting the warrant related to his sons intimate friend but for the peremptory tone of your letter i really believe he would have asked you to give mr percy time for consideration not being rash enough to proceed to such an extreme as this he slyly consulted the young mans interests by declining on formal grounds to date the warrant earlier than the second of april please note that my visit to him was paid at noon on the thirtyfirst of march  if the object of this delay to which i was obliged to submit is to offer a chance of escape to mr percy the same chance necessarily includes mr bowmore whose name is also in the warrant trust me to keep a watchful eye on both these gentlemen especially on mr bowmore he is the most dangerous man of the two and the most likely if he feels any suspicions to slip through the fingers of the law  i have also to report that i discovered three persons in the hall of justice bervies house as i went out  one of them was his son the captain one was his daughter miss bervie and the third was that smoothtongued old soldier major mulvany if the escape of mr bowmore and mr linwood is in contemplation mark my words the persons whom i have just mentioned will be concerned in itand perhaps miss charlotte herself as well at present she is entirely unsuspicious of any misfortune hanging over her head her attention being absorbed in the preparation of her bridal finery as an admirer myself of the fair sex i must own that it seems hard on the girl to have her lover clapped into prison before the weddingday  i will bring you word of the arrest myself there will be plenty of time to catch the afternoon coach to london  hereunless something happens which it is impossible to foreseemy report may come to an end        readers who may desire to test the authors authority for      this statement are referred to the annual register for      1817 chapters i and iii and further on to page 66 in      the same volume   chapter x  the elopement  on the evening of the first of april mrs bowmore was left alone with the servants mr bowmore and percy had gone out together to attend a special meeting of the club shortly afterward miss charlotte had left the cottage under very extraordinary circumstances  a few minutes only after the departure of her father and percy she received a letter which appeared to cause her the most violent agitation she said to mrs bowmore  mamma i must see captain bervie for a few minutes in private on a matter of serious importance to all of us he is waiting at the front gate and he will come in if i show myself at the hall door  upon this mrs bowmore had asked for an explanation  there is no time for explanation was the only answer she received i ask you to leave me for five minutes alone with the captain  mrs bowmore still hesitated charlotte snatched up her garden hat and declared wildly that she would go out to captain bervie if she was not permitted to receive him at home in the face of this declaration mrs bowmore yielded and left the room  in a minute more the captain made his appearance  although she had given way mrs bowmore was not disposed to trust her daughter without supervision in the society of a man whom charlotte herself had reviled as a slanderer and a false friend she took up her position in the veranda outside the parlor at a safe distance from one of the two windows of the room which had been left partially open to admit the fresh air here she waited and listened  the conversation was for some time carried on in whispers  as they became more and more excited both charlotte and bervie ended in unconsciously raising their voices  i swear it to you on my faith as a christian mrs bowmore heard the captain say i declare before god who hears me that i am speaking the truth  and charlotte had answered with a burst of tears  i cant believe you i darent believe you oh how can you ask me to do such a thing let me go let me go  alarmed at those words mrs bowmore advanced to the window and looked in  bervie had put her daughters arm on his arm and was trying to induce her to leave the parlor with him she resisted and implored him to release her he dropped her arm and whispered in her ear she looked at himand instantly made up her mind  let me tell my mother where i am going she said and i will consent  be it so he answered and remember one thing every minute is precious the fewest words are the best  mrs bowmore reentered the cottage by the adjoining room and met them in the passage in few words charlotte spoke  i must go at once to justice bervies house dont be afraid mamma i know what i am about and i know i am right  going to justice bervies cried mrs bowmore in the utmost extremity of astonishment what will your father say what will percy think when they come back from the club  my sisters carriage is waiting for me close by bervie answered it is entirely at miss bowmores disposal she can easily get back if she wishes to keep her visit a secret before mr bowmore and mr linwood return  he led her to the door as he spoke she ran back and kissed her mother tenderly mrs bowmore called to them to wait  i darent let you go she said to her daughter without your fathers leave  charlotte seemed not to hear the captain seemed not to hear they ran across the front garden and through the gateand were out of sight in less than a minute  more than two hours passed the sun sank below the horizon and still there were no signs of charlottes return  feeling seriously uneasy mrs bowmore crossed the room to ring the bell and send the manservant to justice bervies house to hasten her daughters return  as she approached the fireplace she was startled by a sound of stealthy footsteps in the hall followed by a loud noise as of some heavy object that had dropped on the floor she rang the bell violently and opened the door of the parlor at the same moment the spyfootman passed her running out apparently in pursuit of somebody at the top of his speed she followed him as rapidly as she could across the little front garden to the gate arrived in the road she was in time to see him vault upon the luggageboard at the back of a postchaise before the cottage just as the postilion started the horses on their way to london the spy saw mrs bowmore looking at him and pointed with an insolent nod of his head first to the inside of the vehicle and then over it to the highroad signing to her that he designed to accompany the person in the postchaise to the end of the journey  turning to go back mrs bowmore saw her own bewilderment reflected in the faces of the two female servants who had followed her out  who can the footman be after maam asked the cook do you think its a thief  the housemaid pointed to the postchaise barely visible in the distance  simpleton she said do thieves travel in that way i wish my master had come back she proceeded speaking to herself im afraid theres something wrong  mrs bowmore returning through the gardengate instantly stopped and looked at the woman  what makes you mention your masters name amelia when you fear that something is wrong she asked  amelia changed color and looked confused  i am loth to alarm you maam she said and i cant rightly see what it is my duty to do  mrs bowmores heart sank within her under the cruelest of all terrors the terror of something unknown dont keep me in suspense she said faintly whatever it is let me know it  she led the way back to the parlor the housemaid followed her the cook declining to be left alone followed the housemaid  it was something i heard early this afternoon maam amelia began cook happened to be busy  the cook interposed she had not forgiven the housemaid for calling her a simpleton no amelia if you must bring me into itnot busy uneasy in my mind on the subject of the soup  i dont know that your mind makes much difference amelia resumed what it comes to is thisit was i and not you who went into the kitchengarden for the vegetables  not by my wish heaven knows persisted the cook  leave the room said mrs bowmore even her patience had given way at last  the cook looked as if she declined to believe her own ears mrs bowmore pointed to the door the cook said ohaccenting it as a question mrs bowmores finger still pointed the cook in solemn silence yielded to circumstances and banged the door  i was getting the vegetables maam amelia proceeded when i heard voices on the other side of the paling the wood is so old that one can see through the cracks easy enough i saw my master and mr linwood and captain bervie the captain seemed to have stopped the other two on the pathway that leads to the field he stood as it might be between them and the back way to the houseand he spoke severely that he did  what did captain bervie say  he said these words maam for the last time mr bowmore says he will you understand that you are in danger and that mr linwood is in danger unless you both leave this neighborhood tonight my master made light of it for the last time says he will you refer us to a proof of what you say and allow us to judge for ourselves i have told you already says the captain i am bound by my duty toward another person to keep what i know a secret very well says my master i am bound by my duty to my country and i tell you this says he in his high and mighty way neither government nor the spies of government dare touch a hair of my head they know it sir for the head of the peoples friend  thats quite true said mrs bowmore still believing in her husband as firmly as ever  amelia went on  captain bervie didnt seem to think so she said he lost his temper what stuff says he theres a government spy in your house at this moment disguised as your footman my master looked at mr linwood and burst out laughing you wont beat that captain says he if you talk till doomsday he turned about without a word more and went home the captain caught mr linwood by the arm as soon as they were alone for gods sake says he dont follow that madmans example  mrs bowmore was shocked did he really call my husband a madman she asked  he did indeed maamand he was in earnest about it too if you value your liberty he says to mr linwood if you hope to become charlottes husband consult your own safety i can give you a passport escape to france and wait till this trouble is over mr linwood was not in the best of tempersmr linwood shook him off charlottes father will soon be my father says he do you think i will desert him my friends at the club have taken up my claim do you think i will forsake them at the meeting tomorrow you ask me to be unworthy of charlotte and unworthy of my friendsyou insult me if you say more he whipped round on his heel and followed my master  and what did the captain do  lifted up his hands maam to the heavens and lookedi declare it turned my blood to see him if theres truth in mortal man its my firm belief  what the housemaids belief was remained unexpressed before she could get to her next word a shriek of horror from the hall announced that the cooks powers of interruption were not exhausted yet  mistress and servant both hurried out in terror of they knew not what there stood the cook alone in the hall confronting the stand on which the overcoats and hats of the men of the family were placed  wheres the masters traveling coat cried the cook staring wildly at an unoccupied peg and wheres his cap to match oh lord hes off in the postchaise and the footmans after him  simpleton as she was the woman had blundered on a very serious discovery  coat and capboth made after a foreign pattern and both strikingly remarkable in form and color to english eyeshad unquestionably disappeared it was equally certain that they were well known to the foot man whom the captain had declared to be a spy as the coat and cap which his master used in traveling had mr bowmore discovered since the afternoon that he was really in danger had the necessities of instant flight only allowed him time enough to snatch his coat and cap out of the hall and had the treacherous manservant seen him as he was making his escape to the postchaise the cooks conclusions answered all these questions in the affirmativeand if captain bervies words of warning had been correctly reported the cooks conclusion for once was not to be despised  under this last trial of her fortitude mrs bowmores feeble reserves of endurance completely gave way the poor lady turned faint and giddy amelia placed her on a chair in the hall and told the cook to open the front door and let in the fresh air  the cook obeyed and instantly broke out with a second terrific scream announcing nothing less this time than the appearance of mr bowmore himself alive and hearty returning with percy from the meeting at the club  the inevitable inquiries and explanations followed  fully assured as he had declared himself to be of the sanctity of his person politically speaking mr bowmore turned pale nevertheless when he looked at the unoccupied peg on his clothes stand had some man unknown personated him and had a postchaise been hired to lead an impending pursuit of him in the wrong direction what did it mean who was the friend to whose services he was indebted as for the proceedings of the manservant but one interpretation could now be placed on them they distinctly justified what captain bervie had said of him mr bowmore thought of the captains other assertion relating to the urgent necessity for making his escape and looked at percy in silent dismay and turned paler than ever  percys thoughts diverted for the moment only from the lady of his love returned to her with renewed fidelity let us hear what charlotte thinks of it he said where is she  it was impossible to answer this question plainly and in few words  terrified at the effect which her attempt at explanation produced on percy helplessly ignorant when she was called upon to account for her daughters absence mrs bowmore could only shed tears and express a devout trust in providence her husband looked at the new misfortune from a political point of view he sat down and slapped his forehead theatrically with the palm of his hand thus far said the patriot my political assailants have only struck at me through the newspapers now they strike at me through my child  percy made no speeches there was a look in his eyes which boded ill for captain bervie if the two met i am going to fetch her was all he said as fast as a horse can carry me  he hired his horse at an inn in the town and set forth for justice bervies house at a gallop  during percys absence mr bowmore secured the front and back entrances to the cottage with his own hands  these first precautions taken he ascended to his room and packed his travelingbag necessaries for my use in prison he remarked the bloodhounds of government are after me are they after percy too his wife ventured to ask mr bowmore looked up impatiently and cried poohas if percy was of no consequence mrs bowmore thought otherwise the good woman privately packed a bag for percy in the sanctuary of her own room  for an hour and more than an hour no event of any sort occurred  mr bowmore stalked up and down the parlor meditating at intervals ideas of flight presented themselves attractively to his mind at intervals ideas of the speech that he had prepared for the public meeting on the next day took their place if i fly tonight he wisely observed what will become of my speech i will not fly tonight the people shall hear me  he sat down and crossed his arms fiercely as he looked at his wife to see what effect he had produced on her the sound of heavy carriagewheels and the trampling of horses penetrated to the parlor from the gardengate  mr bowmore started to his feet with every appearance of having suddenly altered his mind on the question of flight just as he reached the hall percys voice was heard at the front door let me in instantly instantly  mrs bowmore drew back the bolts before the servants could help her where is charlotte she cried seeing percy alone on the doorstep  gone percy answered furiously eloped to paris with captain bervie read her own confession they were just sending the messenger with it when i reached the house  he handed a note to mrs bowmore and turned aside to speak to her husband while she read it charlotte wrote to her mother very briefly promising to explain everything on her return in the meantime she had left home under careful protectionshe had a lady for her companion on the journeyand she would write again from paris so the letter evidently written in great haste began and ended  percy took mr bowmore to the window and pointed to a carriage and four horses waiting at the gardengate  do you come with me and back me with your authority as her father he asked sternly or do you leave me to go alone  mr bowmore was famous among his admirers for his happy replies he made one now  i am not brutus he said i am only bowmore my daughter before everything fetch my travelingbag  while the travelers bags were being placed in the chaise mr bowmore was struck by an idea  he produced from his coatpocket a roll of many papers thickly covered with writing on the blank leaf in which they were tied up he wrote in the largest letters frightful domestic calamity vicepresident bowmore obliged to leave england welfare of a beloved daughter his speech will be read at the meeting by secretary joskin of the club private to joskin have these lines printed and posted everywhere and when you read my speech for gods sake dont drop your voice at the ends of the sentences  he threw down the pen and embraced mrs bowmore in the most summary manner the poor woman was ordered to send the roll of paper to the club without a word to comfort and sustain her from her husbands lips percy spoke to her hopefully and kindly as he kissed her cheek at parting  on the next morning a letter addressed to mrs bowmore was delivered at the cottage by private messenger  opening the letter she recognized the handwriting of her husbands old friend and her old friendmajor mulvany in breathless amazement she read these lines  dear mrs bowmorein matters of importance the golden rule is never to waste words i have performed one of the great actions of my lifei have saved your husband  how i discovered that my friend was in danger i must not tell you at present let it be enough if i say that i have been a guest under justice bervies hospitable roof and that i know of a home office spy who has taken you unawares under pretense of being your footman if i had not circumvented him the scoundrel would have imprisoned your husband and another dear friend of mine this is how i did it  i must begin by appealing to your memory  do you happen to remember that your husband and i are as near as may be of about the same height very good so far did you in the next place miss bowmores traveling coat and cap from their customary peg i am the thief dearest lady i put them on my own humble self did you hear a sudden noise in the hall oh forgive mei made the noise and it did just what i wanted of it it brought the spy up from the kitchen suspecting that something might be wrong  what did the wretch see when he got into the hall his master in traveling costume running out what did he find when he reached the garden his master escaping in a postchaise on the road to london what did he do the born blackguard that he was jumped up behind the chaise to make sure of his prisoner it was dark when we got to london in a hop skip and jump i was out of the carriage and in at my own door before he could look me in the face  the date of the warrant you must know obliged him to wait till the morning all that night he and the bow street runners kept watch they came in with the sunriseand who did they find major mulvany snug in his bed and as innocent as the babe unborn oh they did their duty searched the place from the kitchen to the garretsand gave it up theres but one thing i regreti let the spy off without a good thrashing no matter ill do it yet one of these days  let me know the first good news of our darling fugitives and i shall be more than rewarded for what little i have done  your always devoted  terence mulvany   chapter xi  pursuit and discovery  feeling himself hurried away on the road to dover as fast as four horses could carry him mr bowmore had leisure to criticise percys conduct from his own purely selfish point of view  if you had listened to my advice he said you would have treated that man bervie like the hypocrite and villain that he is but no you trusted to your own crude impressions having given him your hand after the duel i would have given him the contents of my pistol you hesitated to withdraw it again when that slanderer appealed to your friendship not to cast him off now you see the consequence  wait till we get to paris all the ingenuity of percys traveling companion failed to extract from him any other answer than that  foiled so far mr bowmore began to start difficulties next had they money enough for the journey percy touched his pocket and answered shortly plenty had they passports percy sullenly showed a letter there is the necessary voucher from a magistrate he said the consul at dover will give us our passports mind this he added in warning tones i have pledged my word of honor to justice bervie that we have no political object in view in traveling to france keep your politics to yourself on the other side of the channel  mr bowmore listened in blank amazement charlottes lover was appearing in a new characterthe character of a man who had lost his respect for charlottes father  it was useless to talk to him he deliberately checked any further attempts at conversation by leaning back in the carriage and closing his eyes the truth is mr bowmores own language and conduct were insensibly producing the salutary impression on percys mind which bervie had vainly tried to convey under the disadvantage of having charlottes influence against him throughout the journey percy did exactly what bervie had once entreated him to dohe kept mr bowmore at a distance  at every stage they inquired after the fugitives at every stage they were answered by a more or less intelligible description of bervie and charlotte and of the lady who accompanied them no disguise had been attempted no person had in any case been bribed to conceal the truth  when the first tumult of his emotions had in some degree subsided this strange circumstance associated itself in percys mind with the equally unaccountable conduct of justice bervie on his arrival at the manor house  the old gentleman met his visitor in the hall without expressing and apparently without feeling any indignation at his sons conduct it was even useless to appeal to him for information he only said i am not in arthurs confidence he is of age and my daughter who has volunteered to accompany him is of age i have no claim to control them i believe they have taken miss bowmore to paris and that is all i know about it  he had shown the same dense insensibility in giving his official voucher for the passports percy had only to satisfy him on the question of politics and the document was drawn out as a matter of course such had been the fathers behavior and the conduct of the son now exhibited the same shameless composure to what conclusion did this discovery point percy abandoned the attempt to answer that question in despair  they reached dover toward two oclock in the morning  at the pierhead they found a coastguardsman on duty and received more information  in 1817 the communication with france was still by sailingvessels arriving long after the departure of the regular packet bervie had hired a lugger and had sailed with the two ladies for calais having a fresh breeze in his favor percys first angry impulse was to follow him instantly the next moment he remembered the insurmountable obstacle of the passports the consul would certainly not grant those essentially necessary documents at two in the morning  the only alternative was to wait for the regular packet which sailed some hours laterbetween eight and nine oclock in the forenoon in this case they might apply for their passports before the regular office hours if they explained the circumstances backed by the authority of the magistrates letter  mr bowmore followed percy to the nearest inn that was open sublimely indifferent to the delays and difficulties of the journey he ordered refreshments with the air of a man who was performing a melancholy duty to himself in the name of humanity  when i think of my speech he said at supper my heart bleeds for the people in a few hours more they will assemble in their thousands eager to hear me and what will they see joskin in my place joskin with a manuscript in his hand joskin who drops his voice at the ends of his sentences i will never forgive charlotte waiter another glass of brandy and water  after an unusually quick passage across the channel the travelers landed on the french coast before the defeated spy had returned from london to dartford by stagecoach continuing their journey by post as far as amiens they reached that city in time to take their places by the diligence to paris  arrived in paris they encountered another incomprehensible proceeding on the part of captain bervie  among the persons assembled in the yard to see the arrival of the diligence was a man with a morsel of paper in his hand evidently on the lookout for some person whom he expected to discover among the travelers after consulting his bit of paper he looked with steady attention at percy and mr bowmore and suddenly approached them if you wish to see the captain he said in broken english you will find him at that hotel he handed a printed card to percy and disappeared among the crowd before it was possible to question him  even mr bowmore gave way to human weakness and condescended to feel astonished in the face of such an event as this what next he exclaimed  wait till we get to the hotel said percy  in half an hour more the landlord had received them and the waiter had led them to the right door percy pushed the man aside and burst into the room  captain bervie was alone reading a newspaper before the first furious words had escaped percys lips bervie silenced him by pointing to a closed door on the right of the fireplace  she is in that room he said speak quietly or you may frighten her i know what you are going to say he added as percy stepped nearer to him will you hear me in my own defense and then decide whether i am the greatest scoundrel living or the best friend you ever had  he put the question kindly with something that was at once grave and tender in his look and manner the extraordinary composure with which he acted and spoke had its tranquilizing influence over percy he felt himself surprised into giving bervie a hearing  i will tell you first what i have done the captain proceeded and next why i did it i have taken it on myself mr linwood to make an alteration in your wedding arrangements instead of being married at dartford church you will be married if you see no objection at the chapel of the embassy in paris by my old college friend the chaplain  this was too much for percys selfcontrol your audacity is beyond belief he broke out  and beyond endurance mr bowmore added understand this sir whatever your defense may be i object under any circumstances to be made the victim of a trick  you are the victim of your own obstinate refusal to profit by a plain warning bervie rejoined at the eleventh hour i entreated you and i entreated mr linwood to provide for your own safety and i spoke in vain  percys patience gave way once more  to use your own language he said i have still to decide whether you have behaved toward me like a scoundrel or a friend you have said nothing to justify yourself yet  very well put mr bowmore chimed in come to the point sir my daughters reputation is in question  miss bowmores reputation is not in question for a single instant bervie answered my sister has been the companion of her journey from first to last  journey mr bowmore repeated indignantly i want to know sir what the journey means as an outraged father i ask one plain question why did you run away with my daughter  bervie took a slip of paper from his pocket and handed it to percy with a smile  it was a copy of the warrant which justice bervies duty had compelled him to issue for the arrest of orlando bowmore and percy linwood there was no danger in divulging the secret now british warrants were wastepaper in france in those days  i ran away with the bride bervie said coolly in the certain knowledge that you and mr bowmore would run after me if i had not forced you both to follow me out of england on the first of april you would have been made state prisoners on the second what do you say to my conduct now  wait percy before you answer him mr bowmore interposed he is ready enough at excusing himself but observehe hasnt a word to say in justification of my daughters readiness to run away with him  have you quite done bervie asked as quietly as ever  mr bowmore reserved the right of all others which he most prized the right of using his tongue for the present he answered in his loftiest manner i have done  bervie proceeded your daughter consented to run away with me because i took her to my fathers house and prevailed upon him to trust her with the secret of the coming arrests she had no choice left but to let her obstinate father and her misguided lover go to prisonor to take her place with my sister and me in the travelingcarriage he appealed once more to percy my friend you remember the day when you spared my life have i remembered it too  for once there was an englishman who was not contented to express the noblest emotions that humanity can feel by the commonplace ceremony of shaking hands percys heart overflowed in an outburst of unutterable gratitude he threw himself on bervies breast as brothers the two men embraced as brothers they loved and trusted one another from that day forth  the door on the right was softly opened from within a charming facethe dark eyes bright with happy tears the rosy lips just opening into a smilepeeped into the room a low sweet voice with an undernote of trembling in it made this modest protest in the form of an inquiry  when you have quite done percy with our good friend perhaps you will have something to say to me  last words  the persons immediately interested in the marriage of percy and charlotte were the only persons present at the ceremony  at the little breakfast afterward in the french hotel mr bowmore insisted on making a speech to a select audience of six namely the bride and bridegroom the bridesmaid the chaplain the captain and mrs bowmore but what does a small audience matter the english frenzy for making speeches is not to be cooled by such a trifle as that at the end of the world the expiring forces of nature will hear a dreadful voicethe voice of the last englishman delivering the last speech  percy wisely made his honeymoon a long one he determined to be quite sure of his superior influence over his wife before he trusted her within reach of her father again  mr and mrs bowmore accompanied captain bervie and miss bervie on their way back to england as far as boulogne in that pleasant town the banished patriot set up his tent it was a cheaper place to live in than paris and it was conveniently close to england when he had quite made up his mind whether to be an exile on the continent or to go back to his own country and be a martyr in prison in the end the course of events settled that question for him mr bowmore returned to england with the return of the habeas corpus act   the years passed percy and charlotte judged from the romantic point of view became two uninteresting married people bervie always remaining a bachelor rose steadily in his profession through the higher grades of military rank mr bowmore wisely overlooked by a new government sank back again into the obscurity from which shrewd ministers would never have assisted him to emerge the one subject of interest left among the persons of this little drama was now represented by doctor lagarde thus far not a trace had been discovered of the french physician who had so strangely associated the visions of his magnetic sleep with the destinies of the two men who had consulted him  steadfastly maintaining his own opinion of the prediction and the fulfillment bervie persisted in believing that he and lagarde or percy and lagarde were yet destined to meet and resume the unfinished consultation at the point where it had been broken off persons happy in the possession of sound common sense who declared the prediction to be skilled guesswork and the fulfillment manifest coincidence ridiculed the idea of finding doctor lagarde as closely akin to that other celebrated idea of finding the needle in the bottle of hay but bervies obstinacy was proverbial nothing shook his confidence in his own convictions  more than thirteen years had elapsed since the consultation at the doctors lodgings when bervie went to paris to spend a summer holiday with his friend the chaplain at the english embassy his last words to percy and charlotte when he took his leave were suppose i meet with doctor lagarde  it was then the year 1830 bervie arrived at his friends rooms on the 24th of july on the 27th of the month the famous revolution broke out which dethroned charles the tenth in three days  on the second day bervie and his host ventured into the streets watching the revolution like other reckless englishmen at the risk of their lives in the confusion around them they were separated bervie searching for his companion found his progress stopped by a barricade which had been desperately attacked and desperately defended men in blouses and men in uniform lay dead and dying together the tricolored flag waved over them in token of the victory of the people  bervie had just revived a poor wretch with a drink from an overthrown bowl of water which still had a few drops left in it when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder from behind he turned and discovered a national guard who had been watching his charitable action give a helping hand to that poor fellow said the citizensoldier pointing to a workman standing near grimed with blood and gunpowder the tears were rolling down the mans cheeks i cant see my way sir for crying he said help me to carry that sad burden into the next street he pointed to a rude wooden litter on which lay a dead or wounded man his face and breast covered with an old cloak there is the best friend the people ever had the workman said he cured us comforted us respected us loved us and there he lies shot dead while he was binding up the wounds of friends and enemies alike  whoever he is he has died nobly bervie answered may i look at him  the workman signed that he might look  bervie lifted the cloakand met with doctor lagarde once more     miss bertha and the yankee  preliminary statements of witnesses for the defense collected at the office of the solicitor  no 1miss bertha laroche of nettlegrove hall testifies and says  i  toward the middle of june in the year 1817 i went to take the waters at maplesworth in derbyshire accompanied by my nearest relativemy aunt  i am an only child and i was twentyone years old at my last birthday on coming of age i inherited a house and lands in derbyshire together with a fortune in money of one hundred thousand pounds the only education which i have received has been obtained within the last two or three years of my life and i have thus far seen nothing of society in england or in any other civilized part of the world i can be a competent witness it seems in spite of these disadvantages anyhow i mean to tell the truth  my father was a french colonist in the island of saint domingo he died while i was very young leaving to my mother and to me just enough to live on in the remote part of the island in which our little property was situated my mother was an englishwoman her delicate health made it necessary for her to leave me for many hours of the day under the care of our household slaves i can never forget their kindness to me but unfortunately their ignorance equaled their kindness if we had been rich enough to send to france or england for a competent governess we might have done very well but we were not rich enough i am ashamed to say that i was nearly thirteen years old before i had learned to read and write correctly  four more years passedand then there came a wonderful event in our lives which was nothing less than the change from saint domingo to england  my mother was distantly related to an ancient and wealthy english family she seriously offended those proud people by marrying an obscure foreigner who had nothing to live on but his morsel of land in the west indies having no expectations from her relatives my mother preferred happiness with the man she loved to every other consideration and i for one think she was right from that moment she was cast off by the head of the family for eighteen years of her life as wife mother and widow no letters came to her from her english home we had just celebrated my seventeenth birthday when the first letter came it informed my mother that no less than three lives which stood between her and the inheritance of certain portions of the family property had been swept away by death the estate and the fortune which i have already mentioned had fallen to her in due course of law and her surviving relatives were magnanimously ready to forgive her at last  we wound up our affairs at saint domingo and we went to england to take possession of our new wealth  at first the return to her native air seemed to have a beneficial effect on my mothers health but it was a temporary improvement only her constitution had been fatally injured by the west indian climate and just as we had engaged a competent person to look after my neglected education my constant attendance was needed at my mothers bedside we loved each other dearly and we wanted no strange nurses to come between us my aunt my mothers sister relieved me of my cares in the intervals when i wanted rest  for seven sad months our dear sufferer lingered i have only one remembrance to comfort me my mothers last kiss was mineshe died peacefully with her head on my bosom  i was nearly nineteen years old before i had sufficiently rallied my courage to be able to think seriously of myself and my prospects  at that age one does not willingly submit ones self for the first time to the authority of a governess having my aunt for a companion and protectress i proposed to engage my own masters and to superintend my own education  my plans failed to meet with the approval of the head of the family he declared most unjustly as the event proved that my aunt was not a fit person to take care of me she had passed all the later years of her life in retirement a good creature he admitted in her own way but she had no knowledge of the world and no firmness of character the right person to act as my chaperon and to superintend my education was the highminded and accomplished woman who had taught his own daughters  i declined with all needful gratitude and respect to take his advice the bare idea of living with a stranger so soon after my mothers death revolted me besides i liked my aunt and my aunt liked me being made acquainted with my decision the head of the family cast me off exactly as he had cast off my mother before me  so i lived in retirement with my good aunt and studied industriously to improve my mind until my twentyfirst birthday came i was now an heiress privileged to think and act for myself my aunt kissed me tenderly we talked of my poor mother and we cried in each others arms on the memorable day that made a wealthy woman of me in a little time more other troubles than vain regrets for the dead were to try me and other tears were to fill my eyes than the tears which i had given to the memory of my mother  ii  i may now return to my visit in june 1817 to the healing springs at maplesworth  this famous inland wateringplace was only between nine and ten miles from my new home called nettlegrove hall i had been feeling weak and out of spirits for some months and our medical adviser recommended change of scene and a trial of the waters at maplesworth my aunt and i established ourselves in comfortable apartments with a letter of introduction to the chief doctor in the place this otherwise harmless and worthy man proved strangely enough to be the innocent cause of the trials and troubles which beset me at the outset of my new life  the day after we had presented our letter of introduction we met the doctor on the public walk he was accompanied by two strangers both young men and both so far as my ignorant opinion went persons of some distinction judging by their dress and manners the doctor said a few kind words to us and rejoined his two companions both the gentlemen looked at me and both took off their hats as my aunt and i proceeded on our walk  i own i thought occasionally of the wellbred strangers during the rest of the day especially of the shortest of the two who was also the handsomest of the two to my thinking if this confession seems rather a bold one remember if you please that i had never been taught to conceal my feelings at saint domingo and that the events which followed our arrival in england had kept me completely secluded from the society of other young ladies of my age  the next day while i was drinking my glass of healing water extremely nasty water by the way the doctor joined us  while he was asking me about my health the two strangers made their appearance again and took off their hats again they both looked expectantly at the doctor and the doctor in performance of a promise which he had already made as i privately suspected formally introduced them to my aunt and to me first i put the handsomest man first captain arthur stanwick of the army home from india on leave and staying at maplesworth to take the waters secondly mr lionel varleigh of boston in america visiting england after traveling all over europe and stopping at maplesworth to keep company with his friend the captain  on their introduction the two gentlemen observing no doubt that i was a little shy forbore delicately from pressing their society on us  captain stanwick with a beautiful smile and with teeth worthy of the smile stroked his whiskers and asked me if i had found any benefit from taking the waters he afterward spoke in great praise of the charming scenery in the neighborhood of maplesworth and then turning away addressed his next words to my aunt mr varleigh took his place speaking with perfect gravity and with no whiskers to stroke he said  i have once tried the waters here out of curiosity i can sympathize miss with the expression which i observed on your face when you emptied your glass just now permit me to offer you something nice to take the taste of the waters out of your mouth he produced from his pocket a beautiful little box filled with sugarplums i bought it in paris h e explained having lived a good deal in france i have got into a habit of making little presents of this sort to ladies and children i wouldnt let the doctor see it miss if i were you he has the usual medical prejudice against sugarplums with that quaint warning he too made his bow and discreetly withdrew  thinking it over afterward i acknowledged to myself that the english captainalthough he was the handsomest man of the two and possessed the smoothest mannershad failed nevertheless to overcome my shyness the american travelers unaffected sincerity and goodhumor on the other hand set me quite at my ease i could look at him and thank him and feel amused at his sympathy with the grimace i had made after swallowing the illflavored waters and yet while i lay awake at night wondering whether we should meet our new acquaintances on the next day it was the english captain that i most wanted to see again and not the american traveler at the time i set this down to nothing more important than my own perversity ah dear dear i know better than that now  the next morning brought the doctor to our hotel on a special visit to my aunt he invented a pretext for sending me into the next room which was so plainly a clumsy excuse that my curiosity was aroused i gratified my curiosity must i make my confession plainer still must i acknowledge that i was mean enough to listen on the other side of the door  i heard my dear innocent old aunt say doctor i hope you dont see anything alarming in the state of berthas health  the doctor burst out laughing my dear madam there is nothing in the state of the young ladys health which need cause the smallest anxiety to you or to me the object of my visit is to justify myself for presenting those two gentlemen to you yesterday they are both greatly struck by miss berthas beauty and they both urgently entreated me to introduce them such introductions i need hardly say are marked exceptions to my general rule in ninetynine cases out of a hundred i should have said no in the cases of captain stanwick and mr varleigh however i saw no reason to hesitate permit me to assure you that i am not intruding on your notice two fortunehunting adventurers they are both men of position and men of property the family of the stanwicks has been well known to me for years and mr varleigh brought me a letter from my oldest living friend answering for him as a gentleman in the highest sense of the word he is the wealthiest man of the two and it speaks volumes for him in my opinion that he has preserved his simplicity of character after a long residence in such places as paris and vienna captain stanwick has more polish and ease of manner but looking under the surface i rather fancy there may be something a little impetuous and domineering in his temper however we all have our faults i can only say for both these young friends of mine that you need feel no scruple about admitting them to your intimacy if they happen to please youand your niece having now i hope removed any doubts which may have troubled you pray recall miss bertha i am afraid i have interrupted you in discussing your plans for the day  the smoothly eloquent doctor paused for the moment and i darted away from the door  our plans for the day included a drive through the famous scenery near the town my two admirers met us on horseback here again the captain had the advantage over his friend his seat in the saddle and his ridingdress were both perfect things in their way the englishman rode on one side of the carriage and the american on the other they both talked well but mr varleigh had seen more of the world in general than captain stanwick and he made himself certainly the more interesting and more amusing companion of the two  on our way back my admiration was excited by a thick wood beautifully situated on rising ground at a little distance from the highroad oh dear i said how i should like to take a walk in that wood idle thoughtless words but oh what remembrances crowd on me as i think of them now  captain stanwick and mr varleigh at once dismounted and offered themselves as my escort the coachman warned them to be careful people had often lost themselves he said in that wood i asked the name of it the name was herne wood my aunt was not very willing to leave her comfortable seat in the carriage but it ended in her going with us  before we entered the wood mr varleigh noted the position of the highroad by his pocketcompass captain stanwick laughed at him and offered me his arm ignorant as i was of the ways of the world and the rules of coquetry my instinct i suppose warned me not to distinguish one of the gentlemen too readily at the expense of the other i took my aunts arm and settled it in that way  a winding path led us into the wood  on a nearer view the place disappointed me the further we advanced the more horribly gloomy it grew the thicklygrowing trees shut out the light the damp stole over me little by little until i shivered the undergrowth of bushes and thickets rustled at intervals mysteriously as some invisible creeping creature passed through it at a turn in the path we reached a sort of clearing and saw the sky and the sunshine once more but even here a disagreeable incident occurred a snake wound his undulating way across the open space passing close by me and i was fool enough to scream the captain killed the creature with his ridingcane taking a pleasure in doing it which i did not like to see  we left the clearing and tried another path and then another and still the horrid wood preyed on my spirits i agreed with my aunt that we should do well to return to the carriage on our way back we missed the right path and lost ourselves for the moment mr varleigh consulted his compass and pointed in one direction captain stanwick consulting nothing but his own jealous humor pointed in the other we followed mr varleighs guidance and got back to the clearing he turned to the captain and said goodhumoredly you see the compass was right captain stanwick answered sharply there are more ways than one out of an english wood you talk as if we were in one of your american forests  mr varleigh seemed to be at a loss to understand his rudeness there was a pause the two men looked at each other standing face to face on the brown earth of the clearingthe englishmans ruddy countenance light auburn hair and whiskers and wellopened bold blue eyes contrasting with the pale complexion the keenlyobservant look the dark closelycut hair and the delicatelylined face of the american it was only for a moment i had barely time to feel uneasy before they controlled themselves and led us back to the carriage talking as pleasantly as if nothing had happened for days afterward nevertheless that scene in the clearingthe faces and figures of the two men the dark line of trees hemming them in on all sides the brown circular patch of ground on which they stoodhaunted my memory and got in the way of my brighter and happier thoughts when my aunt inquired if i had enjoyed the day i surprised her by saying no and when she asked why i could only answer it was all spoiled by herne wood  iii  three weeks passed  the terror of those dreadful days creeps over me again when i think of them i mean to tell the truth without shrinking but i may at least consult my own feelings by dwelling on certain particulars as briefly as i can i shall describe my conduct toward the two men who courted me in the plainest terms if i say that i distinguished neither of them innocently and stupidly i encouraged them both  in books women are generally represented as knowing their own minds in matters which relate to love and marriage this is not my experience of myself day followed day and ridiculous as it may appear i could not decide which of my two admirers i liked best  captain stanwick was at first the man of my choice while he kept his temper under control h e charmed me but when he let it escape him he sometimes disappointed sometimes irritated me in that frame of mind i turned for relief to lionel varleigh feeling that he was the more gentle and the more worthy man of the two and honestly believing at such times that i preferred him to his rival for the first few days after our visit to herne wood i had excellent opportunities of comparing them they paid their visits to us together and they divided their attentions carefully between me and my aunt at the end of the week however they began to present themselves separately if i had possessed any experience of the natures of men i might have known what this meant and might have seen the future possibility of some more serious estrangement between the two friends of which i might be the unfortunate cause as it was i never once troubled my head about what might be passing out of my presence whether they came together or whether they came separately their visits were always agreeable to me and i thought of nothing and cared for nothing more  but the time that was to enlighten me was not far off  one day captain stanwick called much earlier than usual my aunt had not yet returned from her morning walk the captain made some excuse for presenting himself under these circumstances which i have now forgotten  without actually committing himself to a proposal of marriage he spoke with such tender feeling he managed his hold on my inexperience so delicately that he entrapped me into saying some words on my side which i remembered with a certain dismay as soon as i was left alone again in half an hour more mr lionel varleigh was announced as my next visitor i at once noticed a certain disturbance in his look and manner which was quite new in my experience of him i offered him a chair to my surprise he declined to take it  i must trust to your indulgence to permit me to put an embarrassing question to you he began it rests with you miss laroche to decide whether i shall remain here or whether i shall relieve you of my presence by leaving the room  what can you possibly mean i asked  is it your wish he went on that i should pay you no more visits except in captain stanwicks company or by captain stanwicks express permission  my astonishment deprived me for the moment of the power of answering him do you really mean that captain stanwick has forbidden you to call on me i asked as soon as i could speak  i have exactly repeated what captain stanwick said to me half an hour since lionel varleigh answered  in my indignation at hearing this i entirely forgot the rash words of encouragement which the captain had entrapped me into speaking to him when i think of it now i am ashamed to repeat the language in which i resented this mans presumptuous assertion of authority over me having committed one act of indiscretion already my anxiety to assert my freedom of action hurried me into committing another i bade mr varleigh welcome whenever he chose to visit me in terms which made his face flush under the emotions of pleasure and surprise which i had aroused in him my wounded vanity acknowledged no restraints i signed to him to take a seat on the sofa at my side i engaged to go to his lodgings the next day with my aunt and see the collection of curiosities which he had amassed in the course of his travels i almost believe if he had tried to kiss me that i was angry enough with the captain to have let him do it  remember what my life had beenremember how ignorantly i had passed the precious days of my youth how insidiously a sudden accession of wealth and importance had encouraged my folly and my prideand try like good christians to make some allowance for me  my aunt came in from her walk before mr varleighs visit had ended she received him rather coldly and he perceived it after reminding me of our appointment for the next day he took his leave  what appointment does mr varleigh mean my aunt asked as soon as we were alone is it wise under the circumstances to make appointments with mr varleigh she said when i had answered her question i naturally inquired what she meant my aunt replied i have met captain stanwick while i was out walking he has told me something which i am quite at a loss to understand is it possible bertha that you have received a proposal of marriage from him favorably without saying one word about your intentions to me  i instantly denied it however rashly i might have spoken i had certainly said nothing to justify captain stanwick in claiming me as his promised wife in his mean fear of a fair rivalry with mr varleigh he had deliberately misinterpreted me if i marry either of the two i said it will be mr varleigh  my aunt shook her head these two gentlemen seem to be both in love with you bertha it is a trying position for you between them and i am afraid you have acted with some indiscretion captain stanwick tells me that he and his friend have come to a separation already i fear you are the cause of it mr varleigh has left the hotel at which he was staying with the captain in consequence of a disagreement between them this morning you were not aware of that when you accepted his invitation shall i write an excuse for you we must at least put off the visit my dear until you have set yourself right with captain stanwick  i began to feel a little alarmed but i was too obstinate to yield without a struggle give me time to think over it i said to write an excuse seems like acknowledging the captains authority let us wait till tomorrow morning  iv  the morning brought with it another visit from captain stanwick this time my aunt was present he looked at her without speaking and turned to me with his fiery temper showing itself already in his eyes  i have a word to say to you in private he began  i have no secrets from my aunt i answered whatever you have to say captain stanwick may be said here  he opened his lips to reply and suddenly checked himself he was controlling his anger by so violent an effort that it turned his ruddy face pale for the moment he conquered his temperhe addressed himself to me with the outward appearance of respect at least  has that man varleigh lied he asked or have you given him hopes tooafter what you said to me yesterday  i said nothing to you yesterday which gives you any right to put that question to me i rejoined you have entirely misunderstood me if you think so  my aunt attempted to say a few temperate words in the hope of soothing him he waved his hand refusing to listen to her and advanced closer to me  you have misunderstood me he said if you think i am a man to be made a plaything of in the hands of a coquette  my aunt interposed once more with a resolution which i had not expected from her  captain stanwick she said you are forgetting yourself  he paid no heed to her he persisted in speaking to me it is my misfortune to love you he burst out my whole heart is set on you i mean to be your husband and no other man living shall stand in my way after what you said to me yesterday i have a right to consider that you have favored my addresses this is not a mere flirtation dont think it i say its the passion of a life do you hear its the passion of a mans whole life i am not to be trifled with i have had a night of sleepless misery about youi have suffered enough for youand youre not worth it dont laugh this is no laughing matter take care bertha take care  my aunt rose from her chair she astonished me on all ordinary occasions the most retiring the most feminine of women she now walked up to captain stanwick and looked him full in the face without flinching for an instant  you appear to have forgotten that you are speaking in the presence of two ladies she said alter your tone sir or i shall be obliged to take my niece out of the room  half angry half frightened i tried to speak in my turn my aunt signed to me to be silent the captain drew back a step as if he felt her reproof but his eyes still fixed on me were as fiercely bright as ever there the gentlemans superficial goodbreeding failed to hide the natural man beneath  i will leave you in undisturbed possession of the room he said to my aunt with bitter politeness before i go permit me to give your niece an opportunity of reconsidering her conduct before it is too late my aunt drew back leaving him free to speak to me after considering for a moment he laid his hand firmly but not roughly on my arm you have accepted lionel varleighs invitation to visit him he said under pretense of seeing his curiosities think again before you decide on keeping that engagement if you go to varleigh tomorrow you will repent it to the last day of your life saying those words in a tone which made me tremble in spite of myself he walked to the door as he laid his hand on the lock he turned toward me for the last time i forbid you to go to varleighs lodgings he said very distinctly and quietly understand what i tell you i forbid it  with those words he left us  my aunt sat down by me and took my hand kindly there is only one thing to be done she said we must return at once to nettlegrove if captain stanwick attempts to annoy you in your own house we have neighbors who will protect us and we have mr loring our rector to appeal to for advice as for mr varleigh i will write our excuses myself before we go away  she put out her hand to ring the bell and order the carriage i stopped her my childish pride urged me to assert myself in some way after the passive position that i had been forced to occupy during the interview with captain stanwick  no i said it is not acting fairly toward mr varleigh to break our engagement with him let us return to nettlegrove by all means but let us first call on mr varleigh and take our leave are we to behave rudely to a gentleman who has always treated us with the utmost consideration because captain stanwick has tried to frighten us by cowardly threats the commonest feeling of selfrespect forbids it  my aunt protested against this outbreak of folly with perfect temper and good sense but my obstinacy my firmness as i thought it was immovable i left her to choose between going with me to mr varleigh or letting me go to him by myself finding it useless to resist she decided it is needless to say on going with me  we found mr varleigh very courteous but more than usually grave and quiet our visit only lasted for a few minutes my aunt using the influence of her age and her position to shorten it she mentioned family affairs as the motive which recalled us to nettlegrove i took it on myself to invite mr varleigh to visit me at my own house he bowed and thanked me without engaging himself to accept the invitation when i offered him my hand at parting he raised it to his lips and kissed it with a fervor that agitated me his eyes looked into mine with a sorrowful admiration with a lingering regret as if they were taking their leave of me for a long while dont forget me he whispered as he stood at the door while i followed my aunt out come to nettlegrove i whispered back his eyes dropped to the ground he let me go without a word more  this i declare solemnly was all that passed at our visit by some unexpressed consent among us no allusion whatever was made to captain stanwick not even his name was mentioned i never knew that the two men had met just before we called on mr varleigh nothing was said which could suggest to me the slightest suspicion of any arrangement for another meeting between them later in the day beyond the vague threats which had escaped captain stanwicks lipsthreats which i own i was rash enough to despisei had no warning whatever of the dreadful events which happened at maplesworth on the day after our return to nettlegrove hall  i can only add that i am ready to submit to any questions that may be put to me pray dont think me a heartless woman my worst fault was ignorance in those days i knew nothing of the false pretenses under which men hide what is selfish and savage in their natures from the women whom it is their interest to deceive  no 2julius bender fencingmaster testifies and says  i am of german nationality established in england as teacher of the use of the sword and the pistol since the beginning of the present year  finding business slack in london it unfortunately occurred to me to try what i could do in the country i had heard of maplesworth as a place largely frequented by visitors on account of the scenery as well as by invalids in need of taking the waters and i opened a gallery there at the beginning of the season of 1817 for fencing and pistol practice about the visitors i had not been deceived there were plenty of idle young gentlemen among them who might have been expected to patronize my establishment they showed the most barbarous indifference to the noble art of attack and defensecame by twos and threes looked at my gallery and never returned my small means began to fail me after paying my expenses i was really at my wits end to find a few pounds to go on with in the hope of better days  one gentleman i remember who came to see me and who behaved most liberally  he described himself as an american and said he had traveled a great deal as my ill luck would have it he stood in no need of my instructions on the two or three occasions when he amused himself with my foils and my pistols he proved to be one of the most expert swordsmen and one of the finest shots that i ever met with it was not wonderful he had by nature cool nerves and a quick eye and he had been taught by the masters of the art in vienna and paris  early in julythe 9th or 10th of the month i thinki was sitting alone in my gallery looking ruefully enough at the last two sovereigns in my purse when a gentleman was announced who wanted a lesson a private lesson he said with emphasis looking at the man who cleaned and took care of my weapons  i sent the man out of the room the stranger an englishman and as i fancied judging by outward appearances a military man as well took from his pocketbook a fiftypound banknote and held it up before me i have a heavy wager depending on a fencing match he said and i have no time to improve myself teach me a trick which will make me a match for a man skilled in the use of the foil and keep the secretand there are fifty pounds for you  i hesitated i did indeed hesitate poor as i was but this devil of a man held his banknote before me whichever way i looked and i had only two pounds left in the world  are you going to fight a duel i asked  i have already told you what i am going to do he answered  i waited a little the infernal banknote still tempted me in spite of myself i tried him again  if i teach you the trick i persisted will you undertake to make no bad use of your lesson  yes he said impatiently enough  i was not quite satisfied yet  will you promise it on your word of honor i asked  of course i will he answered take the money and dont keep me waiting any longer  i took the money and i taught him the trickand i regretted it almost as soon as it was done not that i knew mind of any serious consequences that followed for i returned to london the next morning my sentiments were those of a man of honor who felt that he had degraded his art and who could not be quite sure that he might not have armed the hand of an assassin as well i have no more to say  no 3thomas outwater servant to captain stanwick testifies and says  if i did not firmly believe my master to be out of his senses no punishment that i could receive would prevail upon me to tell of him what i am going to tell now  but i say he is mad and therefore not accountable for what he has donemad for love of a young woman if i could have my way i should like to twist her neck though she is a lady and a great heiress into the bargain before she came between them my master and mr varleigh were more like brothers than anything else she set them at variance and whether she meant to do it or not is all the same to me i own i took a dislike to her when i first saw her she was one of the lighthaired blueeyed sort with an innocent look and a snaky waistnot at all to be depended on as i have found them  i hear i am not expected to give an account of the disagreement between the two gentlemen of which this lady was the cause i am to state what i did in maplesworth and what i saw afterward in herne wood poor as i am i would give a fivepound note to anybody who could do it for me unfortunately i must do it for myself  on the 10th of july in the evening my master went for the second time that day to mr varleighs lodgings  i am certain of the date because it was the day of publication of the town newspaper and there was a law report in it which set everybody talking there had been a duel with pistols a day or two before between a resident in the town and a visitor caused by some dispute about horses nothing very serious came of the meeting one of the men only was hurt and the wound proved to be of no great importance the awkward part of the matter was that the constables appeared on the ground before the wounded man had been removed he and his two seconds were caught and the prisoners were committed for trial dueling the magistrates said was an inhuman and unchristian practice and they were determined to put the law in force and stop it this sentence made a great stir in the town and fixed the date as i have just said in my mind  having been accidentally within hearing of some of the disputes concerning miss laroche between my master and mr varleigh i had my misgivings about the captains second visit to the friend with whom he had quarreled already a gentleman called on him soon after he had gone out on important business this gave me an excuse for following him to mr varleighs rooms with the visitors card and i took the opportunity  i heard them at high words on my way upstairs and waited a little on the landing the captain was in one of his furious rages mr varleigh was firm and cool as usual after listening for a minute or so i heard enough in my opinion to justify me in entering the room i caught my master in the act of lifting his canethreatening to strike mr varleigh he instantly dropped his hand and turned on me in a fury at my intrusion taking no notice of this outbreak of temper i gave him his friends card and went out a talk followed in voices too low for me to hear outside the room and then the captain approached the door i got out of his way feeling very uneasy about what was to come next i could not presume to question mr varleigh the only thing i could think of was to tell the young ladys aunt what i had seen and heard and to plead with miss laroche herself to make peace between them when i inquired for the ladies at their lodgings i was told that they had left maplesworth  i saw no more of the captain that night  the next morning he seemed to be quite himself again he said to me thomas i am going sketching in herne wood take the paintbox and the rest of it and put this into the carriage  he handed me a packet as thick as my arm and about three feet long done up in many folds of canvas i made bold to ask what it was he answered that it was an artists sketching umbrella packed for traveling  in an hours time the carriage stopped on the road below herne wood my master said he would carry his sketching things himself and i was to wait with the carriage in giving him the socalled umbrella i took the occasion of his eye being off me for the moment to pass my hand over it carefully and i felt through the canvas the hilt of a sword as an old soldier i could not be mistakenthe hilt of a sword  what i thought on making this discovery does not much matter what i did was to watch the captain into the wood and then to follow him  i tracked him along the path to where there was a clearing in the midst of the trees there he stopped and i got behind a tree he undid the canvas and produced two swords concealed in the packet if i had felt any doubts before i was certain of what was coming now a duel without seconds or witnesses by way of keeping the town magistrates in the darka duel between my master and mr varleigh as his name came into my mind the man himself appeared making his way into the clearing from the other side of the wood  what could i do to stop it no human creature was in sight the nearest village was a mile away reckoning from the further side of the wood the coachman was a stupid old man quite useless in a difficulty even if i had had time enough to go back to the road and summon him to help me while i was thinking about it the captain and mr varleigh had stripped to their shirts and trousers when they crossed their swords i could stand it no longeri burst in on them for god almightys sake gentlemen i cried out dont fight without seconds my master turned on me like the madman he was and threatened me with the point of his sword mr varleigh pulled me back out of harms way dont be afraid he whispered as he led me back to the verge of the clearing i have chosen the sword instead of the pistol expressly to spare his life  those noble words spoken by as brave and true a man as ever breathed quieted me i knew mr varleigh had earned the repute of being one of the finest swordsmen in europe  the duel began i was placed behind my master and was consequently opposite to his antagonist the captain stood on his defense waiting for the other to attack mr varleigh made a pass i was opposite the point of his sword i saw it touch the captains left shoulder in the same instant of time my master struck up his opponents sword with his own weapon seized mr varleighs right wrist in his left hand and passed his sword clean through mr varleighs breast he fell the victim of a murderous trickfell without a word or a cry  the captain turned slowly and faced me with his bloody sword in his hand i cant tell you how he looked i can only say that the sight of him turned me faint with terror i was at waterlooi am no coward but i tell you the cold sweat poured down my face like water i should have dropped if i had not held by the branch of a tree  my master waited until i had in a measure recovered myself feel if his heart beats he said pointing to the man on the ground  i obeyed he was deadthe heart was still the beat of the pulse was gone i said you have killed him  the captain made no answer he packed up the two swords again in the canvas and put them under his arm then he told me to follow him with the sketching materials i drew back from him without speaking there was a horrid hollow sound in his voice that i did not like do as i tell you he said you have yourself to thank for it if i refuse to lose sight of you now i managed to say that he might trust me to say nothing he refused to trust me he put out his hand to take hold of me i could not stand that ill go with you i said dont touch me we reached the carriage and returned to maplesworth the same day we traveled by post to london  in london i contrived to give the captain the slip by the first coach the next morning i want back to maplesworth eager to hear what had happened and if the body had been found not a word of news reached me nothing seemed to be known of the duel in herne wood  i went to the woodon foot fearing that i might be traced if i hired a carriage the country round was as solitary as usual not a creature was near when i entered the wood not a creature was near when i looked into the clearing  there was nothing on the ground the body was gone  no 4the reverend alfred loring rector of nettlegrove testifies and says  i  early in the month of october 1817 i was informed that miss bertha laroche had called at my house and wished to see me in private  i had first been presented to miss laroche on her arrival with her aunt to take possession of her property at nettlegrove hall my opportunities of improving my acquaintance with her had not been so numerous as i could have desired and i sincerely regretted it she had produced a very favorable impression on me singularly inexperienced and impulsivewith an odd mixture of shyness and vivacity in her manner and subject now and then to outbursts of vanity and petulance which she was divertingly incapable of concealingi could detect nevertheless under the surface the signs which told of a true and generous nature of a simple and pure heart her personal appearance i should add was attractive in a remarkable degree there was something in it so peculiar and at the same time so fascinating that i am conscious it may have prejudiced me in her favor for fear of this acknowledgment being misunderstood i think it right to add that i am old enough to be her grandfather and that i am also a married man  i told the servant to show miss laroche into my study  the moment she entered the room her appearance alarmed me she looked literally panicstricken i offered to send for my wife she refused the proposal i entreated her to take time at least to compose herself it was not in her impulsive nature to do this she said give me your hand to encourage me and let me speak while i can i gave her my hand poor soul i said speak to me my dear as if i were your father  so far as i could understand the incoherent statement which she addressed to me she had been the object of admiration while visiting maplesworth of two gentlemen who both desired to marry her hesitating between them and perfectly inexperienced in such matters she had been the unfortunate cause of enmity between the rivals and had returned to nettlegrove at her aunts suggestion as the best means of extricating herself from a very embarrassing position the removal failing to alleviate her distressing recollections of what had happened she and her aunt had tried a further change by making a tour of two months on the continent she had returned in a more quiet frame of mind to her great surprise she had heard nothing of either of her two suitors from the day when she left maplesworth to the day when she presented herself at my rectory  early that morning she was walking after breakfast in the park at nettlegrove when she heard footsteps behind her she turned and found herself face to face with one of her suitors at maplesworth i am informed that there is no necessity now for my suppressing the name the gentleman was captain stanwick  he was so fearfully changed for the worse that she hardly knew him again  after his first glance at her he held his hand over his bloodshot eyes as if the sunlight hurt them without a word to prepare her for the disclosure he confessed that he had killed mr varleigh in a duel his remorse he declared had unsettled his reason only a few days had passed since he had been released from confinement in an asylum  you are the cause of it he said wildly it is for love of you i have but one hope left to live formy hope in you if you cast me off my mind is made up i will give my life for the life that i have taken i will die by my own hand look at me and you will see that i am in earnest my future as a living man depends on your decision think of it today and meet me here tomorrow not at this time the horrid daylight feels like fire in my eyes and goes like fire to my brain wait till sunsetyou will find me here  he left her as suddenly as he had appeared when she had sufficiently recovered herself to be able to think she decided on saying nothing of what had happened to her aunt she took her way to the rectory to seek my advice  it is needless to encumber my narrative by any statement of the questions which i felt it my duty to put to her under these circumstances my inquiries informed me that captain stanwick had in the first instance produced a favorable impression on her the less showy qualities of mr varleigh had afterward grown on her liking aided greatly by the repelling effect on her mind of the captains violent language and conduct when he had reason to suspect that his rival was being preferred to him when she knew the horrible news of mr varleighs death she knew her own heart to repeat her exact words to me by the shock that she felt toward captain stanwick the only feeling of which she was now conscious was naturally a feeling of the strongest aversion  my own course in this difficult and painful matter appeared to me to be clear it is your duty as a christian to see this miserable man again i said and it is my duty as your friend and pastor to sustain you under the trial i will go with you tomorrow to the place of meeting  ii  the next evening we found captain stanwick waiting for us in the park  he drew back on seeing me i explained to him temperately and firmly what my position was with sullen looks he resigned himself to endure my presence by degrees i won his confidence my first impression of him remains unshakenthe mans reason was unsettled i suspected that the assertion of his release was a falsehood and that he had really escaped from the asylum it was impossible to lure him into telling me where the place was he was too cunning to do thistoo cunning to say anything about his relations when i tried to turn the talk that way next on the other hand he spoke with a revolting readiness of the crime that he had committed and of his settled resolution to destroy himself if miss laroche refused to be his wife i have nothing else to live for i am alone in the world he said even my servant has deserted me he knows how i killed lionel varleigh he paused and spoke his next words in a whisper to me i killed him by a trickhe was the best swordsman of the two  this confession was so horrible that i could only attribute it to an insane delusion on pressing my inquiries i found that the same idea must have occurred to the poor wretchs relations and to the doctors who signed the certificates for placing him under medical care this conclusion as i afterward heard was greatly strengthened by the fact that mr varleighs body had not been found on the reported scene of the duel as to the servant he had deserted his master in london and had never reappeared so far as my poor judgment went the question before me was not of delivering a selfaccused murderer to justice with no corpse to testify against him but of restoring an insane man to the care of the persons who had been appointed to restrain him  i tried to test the strength of his delusion in an interval when he was not urging his shocking entreaties on miss laroche how do you know that you killed mr varleigh i said  he looked at me with a wild terror in his eyes suddenly he lifted his right hand and shook it in the air with a moaning cry which was unmistakably a cry of pain should i see his ghost he asked if i had not killed him i know it by the pain that wrings me in the hand that stabbed him always in my right hand always the same pain at the moment when i see him he stopped and ground his teeth in the agony and reality of his delusion look he cried look between the two trees behind you there he iswith his dark hair and his shaven face and his steady look there he is standing before me as he stood in the wood with his eyes on my eyes and his sword feeling mine he turned to miss laroche do you see him too he asked eagerly tell me the truth my whole life depends on your telling me the truth  she controlled herself with a wonderful courage i dont see him she answered  he took out his handkerchief and passed it over his face with a gasp of relief there is my last chance he said if she will be true to meif she will be always near me morning noon and night i shall be released from the sight of him see he is fading away already gone h e cried with a scream of exultation he fell on his knees and looked at miss laroche like a savage adoring his idol will you cast me off now he asked humbly lionel was fond of you in his lifetime his spirit is a merciful spirit he shrinks from frightening you he has left me for your sake he will release me for your sake pity me take me to live with youand i shall never see him again  it was dreadful to hear him i saw that the poor girl could endure no more leave us i whispered to her i will join you at the house  he heard me and instantly placed himself between us let her promise or she shant go  she felt as i felt the imperative necessity of saying anything that might soothe him at a sign from me she gave him her promise to return  he was satisfiedhe insisted on kissing her hand and then he let her go i had by this time succeeded in inducing him to trust me he proposed of his own accord that i should accompany him to the inn in the village at which he had been staying the landlord naturally enough distrusting his wretched guest had warned him that morning to find some other place of shelter i engaged to use my influence with the man to make him change his purpose and i succeeded in effecting the necessary arrangements for having the poor wretch properly looked after on my return to my own house i wrote to a brother magistrate living near me and to the superintendent of our county asylum requesting them to consult with me on the best means of lawfully restraining captain stanwick until we could communicate with his relations could i have done more than this the event of the next morning answered that questionanswered it at once and forever  iii  presenting myself at nettlegrove hall toward sunset to take charge of miss laroche i was met by an obstacle in the shape of a protest from her aunt  this good lady had been informed of the appearance of captain stanwick in the park and she strongly disapproved of encouraging any further communication with him on the part of her niece she also considered that i had failed in my duty in still leaving the captain at liberty i told her that i was only waiting to act on the advice of competent persons who would arrive the next day to consult with me and i did my best to persuade her of the wisdom of the course that i had taken in the meantime miss laroche on her side was resolved to be true to the promise that she had given between us we induced her aunt to yield on certain conditions  i know the part of the park in which the meeting is to take place the old lady said it is my nieces favorite walk if she is not brought back to me in half an hours time i shall send the menservants to protect her  the twilight was falling when we reached the appointed place we found captain stanwick angry and suspicious it was not easy to pacify him on the subject of our delay his insanity seemed to me to be now more marked than ever he had seen or dreamed of seeing the ghost during the past night for the first time he said the apparition of the dead man had spoken to him in solemn words it had condemned him to expiate his crime by giving his life for the life that he had taken it had warned him not to insist on marriage with bertha laroche she shall share your punishment if she shares your life and you shall know it by this signshe shall see me as you see me  i tried to compose him he shook his head in immovable despair no he answered if she sees him when i see him there ends the one hope of release that holds me to life it will be goodby between us and goodby forever  we had walked on while we were speaking to a part of the park through which there flowed a rivulet of clear water on the further bank the open ground led down into a wooded valley on our side of the stream rose a thick plantation of firtrees intersected by a winding path captain stanwick stopped as we reached the place his eyes rested in the darkening twilight on the narrow space pierced by the path among the trees on a sudden he lifted his right hand with the same cry of pain which we had heard before with his left hand he took miss laroche by the arm there he said look where i look do you see him there  as the words passed his lips a dimlyvisible figure appeared advancing toward us along the path  was it the figure of a living man or was it the creation of my own excited fancy before i could ask myself the question the man advanced a step nearer to us a last gleam of the dying light fell on his face through an opening in the trees at the same instant miss laroche started back from captain stanwick with a scream of terror she would have fallen if i had not been near enough to support her the captain was instantly at her side again speak he cried do you see it too  she was just able to say yes before she fainted in my arms  he stooped over her and touched her cold cheek with his lips goodby he said in tones suddenly and strangely changed to the most exquisite tenderness goodby forever  he leaped the rivulet he crossed the open ground he was lost to sight in the valley beyond  as he disappeared the visionary man among the firtrees advanced passed in silence crossed the rivulet at a bound and vanished as the figure of the captain had vanished before him  i was left alone with the swooning woman not a sound far or near broke the stillness of the coming night  no 5mr frederic darnel member of the college of surgeons testifies and says  in the intervals of my professional duty i am accustomed to occupy myself in studying botany assisted by a friend and neighbor whose tastes in this respect resemble my own when i can spare an hour or two from my patients we go out together searching for specimens our favorite place is herne wood it is rich in material for the botanist and it is only a mile distant from the village in which i live  early in july my friend and i made a discovery in the wood of a very alarming and unexpected kind we found a man in the clearing prostrated by a dangerous wound and to all appearance dead  we carried him to the gamekeepers cottage on the outskirts of the woods and on the side of it nearest to our village he and his boy were out but the light cart in which he makes his rounds in the remoter part of his masters property was in the outhouse while my friend was putting the horse to i examined the strangers wound it had been quite recently inflicted and i doubted whether it had as yet at any rate really killed him i did what i could with the linen and cold water which the gamekeepers wife offered to me and then my friend and i removed him carefully to my house in the cart i applied the necessary restoratives and i had the pleasure of satisfying myself that the vital powers had revived he was perfectly unconscious of course but the action of the heart became distinctly perceptible and i had hopes  in a few days more i felt fairly sure of him then the usual fever set in i was obliged in justice to his friends to search his clothes in presence of a witness we found his handkerchief his purse and his cigarcase and nothing more no letters or visiting cards nothing marked on his clothes but initials there was no help for it but to wait to identify him until he could speak  when that time came he acknowledged to me that he had divested himself purposely of any clew to his identity in the fear if some mischance happened to him of the news of it reaching his father and mother abruptly by means of the newspapers he had sent a letter to his bankers in london to be forwarded to his parents if the bankers neither saw him nor heard from him in a months time his first act was to withdraw this letter the other particulars which he communicated to me are i am told already known i need only add that i willingly kept his secret simply speaking of him in the neighborhood as a traveler from foreign parts who had met with an accident  his convalescence was a long one it was the beginning of october before he was completely restored to health when he left us he went to london he behaved most liberally to me and we parted with sincere good wishes on either side  no 6mr lionel varleigh of boston u s a testifies and says  my first proceeding on my recovery was to go to the relations of captain stanwick in london for the purpose of making inquiries about him  i do not wish to justify myself at the expense of that miserable man it is true that i loved miss laroche too dearly to yield her to any rival except at her own wish it is also true that captain stanwick more than once insulted me and that i endured it he had suffered from sunstroke in india and in his angry moments he was hardly a responsible being it was only when he threatened me with personal chastisement that my patience gave way we met sword in hand in my mind was the resolution to spare his life in his mind was the resolution to kill me i have forgiven him i will say no more  his relations informed me of the symptoms of insane delusion which he had shown after the duel of his escape from the asylum in which he had been confined and of the failure to find him again  the moment i heard this news the dread crossed my mind that stanwick had found his way to miss laroche in an hour more i was traveling to nettlegrove hall  i arrived late in the evening and found miss laroches aunt in great alarm about her nieces safety the young lady was at that very moment speaking to stanwick in the park with only an old man the rector to protect her i volunteered to go at once and assist in taking care of her a servant accompanied me to show me the place of meeting we heard voices indistinctly but saw no one the servant pointed to a path through the firtrees i went on quickly by myself leaving the man within call in a few minutes i came upon them suddenly at a little distance from me on the bank of a stream  the fear of seriously alarming miss laroche if i showed myself too suddenly deprived me for a moment of my presence of mind pausing to consider what it might be best to do i was less completely protected from discovery by the trees than i had supposed she had seen me i heard her cry of alarm the instant afterward i saw stanwick leap over the rivulet and take to flight that action roused me without stopping for a word of explanation i pursued him  unhappily i missed my footing in the obscure light and fell on the open ground beyond the stream when i had gained my feet once more stanwick had disappeared among the trees which marked the boundary of the park beyond me i could see nothing of him and i could hear nothing of him when i came out on the highroad there i met with a laboring man who showed me the way to the village from the inn i sent a letter to miss laroches aunt explaining what had happened and asking leave to call at the hall on the next day  early in the morning the rector came to me at the inn he brought sad news miss laroche was suffering from a nervous attack and my visit to the hall must be deferred speaking next of the missing man i heard all that mr loring could tell me my intimate knowledge of stanwick enabled me to draw my own conclusion from the facts the thought instantly crossed my mind that the poor wretch might have committed his expiatory suicide at the very spot on which he had attempted to kill me leaving the rector to institute the necessary inquiries i took posthorses to maplesworth on my way to herne wood  advancing from the highroad to the wood i saw two persons at a little distance from mea man in the dress of a gamekeeper and a lad i was too much agitated to take any special notice of them i hurried along the path which led to the clearing my presentiment had not misled me there he lay dead on the scene of the duel with a bloodstained razor by his side i fell on my knees by the corpse i took his cold hand in mine and i thanked god that i had forgiven him in the first days of my recovery  i was still kneeling when i felt myself seized from behind i struggled to my feet and confronted the gamekeeper he had noticed my hurry in entering the wood his suspicions had been aroused and he and the lad had followed me there was blood on my clothes there was horror in my face appearances were plainly against me i had no choice but to accompany the gamekeeper to the nearest magistrate  my instructions to my solicitor forbade him to vindicate my innocence by taking any technical legal objections to the action of the magistrate or of the coroner i insisted on my witnesses being summoned to the lawyers office and allowed to state in their own way what they could truly declare on my behalf and i left my defense to be founded upon the materials thus obtained in the meanwhile i was detained in custody as a matter of course  with this event the tragedy of the duel reached its culminating point i was accused of murdering the man who had attempted to take my life   this last incident having been related all that is worth noticing in my contribution to the present narrative comes to an end i was tried in due course of law the evidence taken at my solicitors office was necessarily altered in form though not in substance by the examination to which the witnesses were subjected in a court of justice so thoroughly did our defense satisfy the jury that they became restless toward the close of the proceedings and returned their verdict of not guilty without quitting the box  when i was a free man again it is surely needless to dwell on the first use that i made of my honorable acquittal whether i deserved the enviable place that i occupied in berthas estimation it is not for me to say let me leave the decision to the lady who has ceased to be miss larochei mean the lady who has been good enough to become my wife     miss dulane and my lord  part i  two remonstrations  i  one afternoon old miss dulane entered her drawingroom ready to receive visitors dressed in splendor and exhibiting every outward appearance of a defiant frame of mind  just as a saucy bronze nymph on the mantelpiece struck the quarter to three on an elegant clock under her arm a visitor was announcedmrs newsham  miss dulane wore her own undisguised gray hair dressed in perfect harmony with her time of life without an attempt at concealment she submitted to be too short and too stout her appearance if it had only been made to speak would have said in effect i am an old woman and i scorn to disguise it  mrs newsham tall and elegant painted and dyed acted on the opposite principle in dressing which confesses nothing on exhibition before the world this ladys disguise asserted that she had reached her thirtieth year on her last birthday her husband was discreetly silent and father time was discreetly silent they both knew that her last birthday had happened thirty years since  shall we talk of the weather and the news my dear or shall we come to the object of your visit at once so miss dulane opened the interview  your tone and manner my good friend are no doubt provoked by the report in the newspaper of this morning in justice to you i refuse to believe the report so mrs newsham adopted her friends suggestion  you kindness is thrown away elizabeth the report is true  matilda you shock me  why  at your age  if he doesnt object to my age what does it matter to you  dont speak of that man  why not  he is young enough to be your son and he is marrying youimpudently undisguisedly marrying youfor your money  and i am marrying himimpudently undisguisedly marrying himfor his rank  you neednt remind me matilda that you are the daughter of a tailor  in a week or two more elizabeth i shall remind you that i am the wife of a noblemans son  a younger son dont forget that  a younger son as you say he finds the social position and i find the moneyhalf a million at my own sole disposal my future husband is a good fellow in his way and his future wife is another good fellow in her way to look at your grim face one would suppose there were no such things in the world as marriages of convenience  not at your time of life i tell you plainly your marriage will be a public scandal  that doesnt frighten us miss dulane remarked we are resigned to every illnatured thing that our friends can say of us in course of time the next nine days wonder will claim public attention and we shall be forgotten i shall be none the less on that account lady howel beaucourt and my husband will be happy in the enjoyment of every expensive taste which a poor man call gratify for the first time in his life have you any more objections to make dont hesitate to speak plainly  i have a question to ask my dear  charmed i am sure to answer itif i can  am i right in supposing that lord howel beaucourt is about half your age  yes dear my future husband is as nearly as possible half as old as i am  mrs newshams uneasy virtue shuddered what a profanation of marriage she exclaimed  nothing of the sort her friend pronounced positively marriage by the law of england as my lawyer tells me is nothing but a contract who ever heard of profaning a contract  call it what you please matilda do you expect to live a happy life at your age with a young man for your husband  a happy life miss dulane repeated because it will be an innocent life she laid a certain emphasis on the last word but one  mrs newsham resented the emphasis and rose to go her last words were the bitterest words that she had spoken yet  you have secured such a truly remarkable husband my dear that i am emboldened to ask a great favor will you give me his lordships photograph  no said miss dulane i wont give you his lordships photograph  what is your objection matilda  a very serious objection elizabeth you are not pure enough in mind to be worthy of my husbands photograph  with that reply the first of the remonstrances assumed hostile proportions and came to an untimely end  ii  the second remonstrance was reserved for a happier fate it took its rise in a conversation between two men who were old and true friends in other words it led to no quarreling  the elder man was one of those admirable human beings who are cordial gentle and goodtempered without any conscious exercise of their own virtues he was generally known in the world about him by a fond and familiar use of his christian name to call him sir richard in these pages except in the character of one of his servants would be simply ridiculous when he lent his money his horses his house and sometimes after unlucky friends had dropped to the lowest social depths even his clothes this general benefactor was known in the best society and the worst society alike as dick he filled the hundred mouths of rumor with his nickname in the days when there was an opera in london as the proprietor of the beautybox the ladies who occupied the box were all invited under the same circumstances they enjoyed operatic music but their husbands and fathers were not rich enough to be able to gratify that expensive taste dicks carriage called for them and took them home again and the beauties all agreed if he ever married that mrs dick would be the most enviable woman on the face of the civilized earth even the false reports which declared that he was privately married already and on bad terms with his wife slandered him cordially under the popular name and his intimate companions when they alluded among each other to a romance in his life which would remain a hidden romance to the end of his days forgot that the occasion justified a serious and severe use of his surname and blamed him affectionately as poor dear dick  the hour was midnight and the friends whom the most hospitable of men delighted to assemble round his dinnertable had taken their leave with the exception of one guest specially detained by the host who led him back to the diningroom  you were angry with our friends dick began when they asked you about that report of your marriage you wont be angry with me are you really going to be the old maids husband  this plain question received a plain reply yes i am  dick took the young lords hand simply and seriously he said accept my congratulations  howel beaucourt started as if he had received a blow instead of a compliment  there isnt another man or woman in the whole circle of my acquaintance he declared who would have congratulated me on marrying miss dulane i believe you would make allowances for me if i had committed murder  i hope i should dick answered gravely when a man is my friendmurder or marriagei take it for granted that he has a reason for what he does wait a minute you mustnt give me more credit than i deserve i dont agree with you if i were a marrying man myself i shouldnt pick an old maidi should prefer a young one thats a matter of taste you are not like me you always have a definite object in view i may not know what the object is never mind i wish you joy all the same  beaucourt was not unworthy of the friendship he had inspired i should be ungrateful indeed he said if i didnt tell you what my object is you know that i am poor  the only poor friend of mine dick remarked who has never borrowed money of me  beaucourt went on without noticing this i have three expensive tastes he said i want to get into parliament i want to have a yacht i want to collect pictures add if you like the selfish luxury of helping poverty and wretchedness and hearing my conscience tell me what an excellent man i am i cant do all this on five hundred a yearbut i can do it on forty times five hundred a year moral marry miss dulane  listening attentively until the other had done dick showed a sardonic side to his character never yet discovered in beaucourts experience of him  i suppose you have made the necessary arrangements he said when the old lady releases you she will leave consolation behind her in her will  thats the first illnatured thing i ever heard you say dick when the old lady dies my sense of honor takes fright and turns its back on her will its a condition on my side that every farthing of her money shall be left to her relations  dont you call yourself one of them  what a question am i her relation because the laws of society force a mock marriage on us how can i make use of her money unless i am her husband and how can she make use of my title unless she is my wife as long as she lives i stand honestly by my side of the bargain but when she dies the transaction is at an end and the surviving partner returns to his five hundred a year  dick exhibited another surprising side to his character the most compliant of men now became as obstinate as the proverbial mule  all very well he said but it doesnt explain whyif you must sell yourselfyou have sold yourself to an old lady there are plenty of young ones and pretty ones with fortunes to tempt you it seems odd that you havent tried your luck with one of them  no dick it would have been odd and worse than odd if i had tried my luck with a young woman  i dont see that  you shall see it directly if i marry an old woman for her money i have no occasion to be a hypocrite we both know that our marriage is a mere matter of form but if i make a young woman my wife because i want her money and if that young woman happens to be worth a straw i must deceive her and disgrace myself by shamming love that my boy you may depend upon it i will never do  dicks face suddenly brightened with a mingled expression of relief and triumph  ha my mercenary friend he burst out theres something mixed up in this business which is worthier of you than anything i have heard yet stop im going to be clever for the first time in my life a man who talks of love as you do must have felt love himself where is the young one and the pretty one and what has she done poor dear to be deserted for an old woman good god how you look at me i have hurt your feelingsi have been a greater fool than everi am more ashamed of myself than words can say  beaucourt stopped him there gently and firmly  you have made a very natural mistake he said there was a young lady she has refused meabsolutely refused me there is no more love in my life its a dark life and an empty life for the rest of my days i must see what money can do for me next when i have thoroughly hardened my heart i may not feel my misfortune as i feel it now pity me or despise me in either case let us say goodnight  he went out into the hall and took his hat dick went out into the hall and took his hat  have your own way he answered i mean to have mineill go home with you  the man was simply irresistible beaucourt sat down resignedly on the nearest of the hall chairs dick asked him to return to the diningroom no he said its not worth while what i can tell you may be told in two minutes dick submitted and took the next of the hall chairs in that inappropriate place the young lords unpremeditated confession was forced out of him by no more formidable exercise of power than the kindness of his friend  when you hear where i met with her he began you will most likely not want to hear any more i saw her for the first time on the stage of a music hall  he looked at dick perfectly quiet and perfectly impenetrable dick only said go on beaucourt continued in these words  she was singing arnes delicious setting of ariels song in the tempest with a taste and feeling completely thrown away on the greater part of the audience that she was beautifulin my eyes at leasti neednt say that she had descended to a sphere unworthy of her and new to her nobody could doubt her modest dress her refinement of manner seemed rather to puzzle than to please most of the people present they applauded her but not very warmly when she retired i obtained an introduction through her musicmaster who happened to be acquainted professionally with some relatives of mine he told me that she was a young widow and he assured me that the calamity through which her family had lost their place in the world had brought no sort of disgrace on them if i wanted to know more he referred me to the lady herself i found her very reserved a long time passed before i could win her confidenceand a longer time still before i ventured to confess the feeling with which she had inspired me you know the rest  you mean of course that you offered her marriage  certainly  and she refused you on account of your position in life  no i had foreseen that obstacle and had followed the example of the adventurous nobleman in the old story like him i assumed a name and presented myself as belonging to her own respectable middle class of life you are too old a friend to suspect me of vanity if i tell you that she had no objection to me and no suspicion that i had approached her personally speaking under a disguise  what motive could she possibly have had for refusing you dick asked  a motive associated with her dead husband beaucourt answered he had married hermind innocently married herwhile his first wife was living the woman was an inveterate drunkard they had been separated for years her death had been publicly reported in the newspapers among the persons killed in a railway accident abroad when she claimed her unhappy husband he was in delicate health the shock killed him his widowi cant and wont speak of her misfortune as if it was her faultknew of no living friends who were in a position to help her not a great artist with a wonderful voice she could still trust to her musical accomplishments to provide for the necessities of life plead as i might with her to forget the past i always got the same reply if i was base enough to let myself be tempted by the happy future that you offer i should deserve the unmerited disgrace which has fallen on me marry a woman whose reputation will bear inquiry and forget me i was mad enough to press my suit once too often when i visited her on the next day she was gone every effort to trace her has failed lost my friendirretrievably lost to me  he offered his hand and said goodnight dick held him back on the doorstep  break off your mad engagement to miss dulane he said be a man howel wait and hope you are throwing away your life when happiness is within your reach if you will only be patient that poor young creature is worthy of you lost nonsense in this narrow little world people are never hopelessly lost till they are dead and underground help me to recognize her by a description and tell me her name ill find her ill persuade her to come back to youand mark my words you will live to bless the day when you followed my advice  this wellmeant remonstrance was completely thrown away beaucourts despair was deaf to every entreaty that dick had addressed to him thank you with all my heart he said you dont know her as i do she is one of the very few women who mean no when they say no useless dickuseless  those were the last words he said to his friend in the character of a single man  part ii  platonic marriage  iii  seven months have passed my dear dick since my inhuman obstinacy those were the words you used made you one of the witnesses at my marriage to miss dulane sorely against your will do you remember your parting prophecy when you were out of the brides hearing a miserable life is before that womans husbandand by jupiter he has deserved it  never my dear boy attempt to forecast the future again viewed as a prophet you are a complete failure i have nothing to complain of in my married life  but you must not mistake me i am far from saying that i am a happy man i only declare myself to be a contented man my old wife is a marvel of good temper and good sense she trusts me implicitly and i have given her no reason to regret it we have our time for being together and our time for keeping apart within our inevitable limits we understand each other and respect each other and have a truer feeling of regard on both sides than many people far better matched than we are in point of age but you shall judge for yourself come and dine with us when i return on wednesday next from the trial trip of my new yacht in the meantime i have a service to ask of you  my wifes niece has been her companion for years she has left us to be married to an officer who has taken her to india and we are utterly at a loss how to fill her place the good old lady doesnt want much a nicetempered refined girl who can sing and play to her with some little taste and feeling and read to her now and then when her eyes are wearythere is what we require and there it seems is more than we can get after advertising for a week past of all the companions who have presented themselves not one has turned out to be the sort of person whom lady howel wants  can you help us in any case my wife sends you her kind remembrances and true to the old times i add my love  on the day which followed the receipt of this letter dick paid a visit to lady howel beaucourt  you seem to be excited she said has anything remarkable happened  pardon me if i ask a question first dick replied do you object to a young widow  that depends on the widow  then i have found the very person you want and oddly enough your husband has had something to do with it  do you mean that my husband has recommended her  there was an undertone of jealousy in lady howels voicejealousy excited not altogether without a motive she had left it to beaucourts sense of honor to own the truth if there had been any love affair in his past life which ought to make him hesitates before he married he had justified miss dulanes confidence in him acknowledging an attachment to a young widow and adding that she had positively refused him we have not met since he said and we shall never meet again under those circumstances miss dulane had considerately abstained from asking for any further details she had not thought of the young widow again until dicks language had innocently inspired her first doubt fortunately for both of them he was an outspoken man and he reassured her unreservedly in these words your husband knows nothing about it  now she said you may tell me how you came to hear of the lady  through my uncles library dick replied his will has left me his collection of booksin such a wretchedly neglected condition that i asked beaucourt not being a reading man myself if he knew of any competent person who could advise me how to set things right he introduced me to farleigh  halford the wellknown publishers the second partner is a book collector himself as well as a bookseller he kindly looks in now and then to see how his instructions for mending and binding are being carried out when he called yesterday i thought of you and i found he could help us to a young lady employed in his office at correcting proof sheets  what is the ladys name  mrs evelin  why does she leave her employment  to save her eyes poor soul when the senior partner mr farleigh met with her she was reduced by family misfortunes to earn her own living the publishers would have been only too glad to keep her in their office but for the oculists report he declared that she would run the risk of blindness if she fatigued her weak eyes much longer there is the only objection to this otherwise invaluable personshe will not be able to read to you  can she sing and play  exquisitely mr farleigh answers for her music  and her character  mr halford answers for her character  and her manners  a perfect lady i have seen her and spoken to her i answer for her manners and i guarantee her personal appearance charmingcharming  for a moment lady howel hesitated after a little reflection she decided that it was her duty to trust her excellent husband i will receive the charming widow she said tomorrow at twelve oclock and if she produces the right impression i promise to overlook the weakness of her eyes  iv  beaucourt had prolonged the period appointed for the trial trip of his yacht by a whole week his apology when he returned delighted the kindhearted old lady who had made him a present of the vessel  there isnt such another yacht in the whole world he declared i really hadnt the heart to leave that beautiful vessel after only three days experience of her he burst out with a torrent of technical praises of the yacht to which his wife listened as attentively as if she really understood what he was talking about when his breath and his eloquence were exhausted alike she said now my dear its my turn i can match your perfect vessel with my perfect lady  what you have found a companion  yes  did dick find her for you  he did indeed you shall see for yourself how grateful i ought to be to your friend  she opened a door which led into the next room mary my dear come and be introduced to my husband  beaucourt started when he heard the name and instantly recovered himself he had forgotten how many marys there are in the world  lady howel returned leading her favorite by the hand and gayly introduced her the moment they entered the room  mrs evelin lord  she looked at her husband the utterance of his name was instantly suspended on her lips mrs evelins hand turning cold at the same moment in her hand warned her to look round the face of the woman more than reflected the inconcealable agitation in the face of the man  the wifes first words when she recovered herself were addressed to them both  which of you can i trust she asked to tell me the truth  you can trust both of us her husband answered  the firmness of his tone irritated her i will judge of that for myself she said go back to the next room she added turning to mrs evelin i will hear you separately  the companion whose duty it was to obeywhose modesty and gentleness had won her mistresss heartrefused to retire  no she said i have been deceived too i have my right to hear what lord howel has to say for himself  beaucourt attempted to support the claim that she had advanced his wife sternly signed to him to be silent what do you mean she said addressing the question to mrs evelin  i mean this the person whom you speak of as a nobleman was presented to me as mr vincent an artist but for that deception i should never have set foot in your ladyships house  is this true my lord lady howel asked with a contemptuous emphasis on the title of nobility  quite true her husband answered i thought it possible that my rank might prove an obstacle in the way of my hopes the blame rests on me and on me alone i ask mrs evelin to pardon me for an act of deception which i deeply regret  lady howel was a just woman under other circumstances she might have shown herself to be a generous woman that brighter side of her character was incapable of revealing itself in the presence of mrs evelin young and beautiful and in possession of her husbands heart she could say i beg your pardon madam i have not treated you justly but no selfcontrol was strong enough to restrain the next bitter words from passing her lips at my age she said lord howel will soon be free you will not have long to wait for him  the young widow looked at her sadlyanswered her sadly  oh my lady your better nature will surely regret having said that  for a moment her eyes rested on beaucourt dim with rising tears she left the roomand left the house  there was silence between the husband and wife beaucourt was the first to speak again  after what you have just heard do you persist in your jealousy of that lady and your jealousy of me he asked  i have behaved cruelly to her and to you i am ashamed of myself was all she said in reply that expression of sorrow so simple and so true did not appeal in vain to the gentler side of beaucourts nature he kissed his wifes hand he tried to console her  you may forgive me she answered i cannot forgive myself that poor ladys last words have made my heart ache what i said to her in anger i ought to have said generously why should she not wait for you after your life with mea life of kindness a life of selfsacrificeyou deserve your reward promise me that you will marry the woman you loveafter my death has released you  you distress me and needlessly distress me he said what you are thinking of my dear can never happen no not even if he left the rest unsaid  not even if you were free she asked  not even then  she looked toward the next room go in howel and bring mrs evelin back i have something to say to her  the discovery that she had left the house caused no fear that she had taken to flight with the purpose of concealing herself there was a prospect before the poor lonely woman which might be trusted to preserve her from despair to say the least of it  during her brief residence in beaucourts house she had shown to lady howel a letter received from a relation who had emigrated to new zealand with her husband and her infant children some years since they had steadily prospered they were living in comfort and they wanted for nothing but a trustworthy governess to teach their children the mother had accordingly written asking if her relative in england could recommend a competent person and offering a liberal salary in showing the letter to lady howel mrs evelin had said if i had not been so happy as to attract your notice i might have offered to be the governess myself  assuming that it had now occurred to her to act on this idea lady howel felt assured that she would apply for advice either to the publishers who had recommended her or to lord howels old friend  beaucourt at once offered to make th e inquiries which might satisfy his wife that she had not been mistaken readily accepting his proposal she asked at the same time for a few minutes of delay  i want to say to you she explained what i had in my mind to say to mrs evelin do you object to tell me why she refused to marry you i couldnt have done it in her place  you would have done it my dear as i think if her misfortune had been your misfortune with those prefatory words he told the miserable story of mrs evelins marriage  lady howels sympathies strongly excited appeared to have led her to a conclusion which she was not willing to communicate to her husband she asked him rather abruptly if he would leave it to her to find mrs evelin i promise she added to tell you what i am thinking of when i come back  in two minutes more she was ready to go out and had hurriedly left the house  v  after a long absence lady howel returned accompanied by dick his face and manner betrayed unusual agitation beaucourt noticed it  i may well be excited dick declared after what i have heard and after what we have done lady howel yours is the brain that thinks to some purpose make our reporti wait for you  but my lady preferred waiting for dick he consented to speak first for the thoroughly characteristic reason that he could get over it in no time  i shall try the old division he said into first second and third dont be afraid i am not going to preachquite the contrary i am going to be quick about it first then mrs evelin has decided under sound advice to go to new zealand second i have telegraphed to her relations at the other end of the world to tell them that she is coming third and last farleigh  halford have sent to the office and secured a berth for her in the next ship that sailsdate the day after tomorrow done in half a minute now lady howel  i will begin and end in half a minute too she said if i can first she continued turning to her husband i found mrs evelin at your friends house she kindly let me say all that i could say for the relief of my poor heart secondly  she hesitated smiled uneasily and came to a full stop  i cant do it howel she confessed i speak to you as usual or i can never get on saying many things in few wordsif the ladies who assert our rights will forgive me for confessing itis an accomplishment in which we are completely beaten by the men you must have thought me rude my dear for leaving you very abruptly without a word of explanation the truth is i had an idea in my head and i kept it to myself old people are proverbially cautious you know till i had first found out whether it was worth mentioning when you were speaking of the wretched creature who had claimed mrs evelins husband as her own you said she was an inveterate drunkard a woman in that state of degradation is capable as i persist in thinking of any wickedness i suppose this put it into my head to doubt herno i mean to wonder whether mr evelindo you know that she keeps her husbands name by his own entreaty addressed to her on his deathbedoh i am losing myself in a crowd of words of my own collecting say the rest of it for me sir richard  no lady howel not unless you call me dick  then say it for medick  no not yet on reflection dick is too short say dear dick  dear dickthere  thank you my lady now we had better remember that your husband is present he turned to beaucourt lady howel had the idea he proceeded which ought to have presented itself to you and to me it was a serious misfortune as she thought that mr evelins sufferings in his last illness and his wifes anxiety while she was nursing him had left them unfit to act in their own defense they might otherwise not have submitted to the drunken wretchs claim without first making sure that she had a right to advance it taking her character into due consideration are we quite certain that she was herself free to marry when mr evelin unfortunately made her his wife to that serious question we now mean to find an answer with mrs evelins knowledge of the affair to help us we have discovered the womans address to begin with she keeps a small tobacconists shop at the town of grailey in the north of england the rest is in the hands of my lawyer if we make the discovery that we all hope for we have your wife to thank for it he paused and looked at his watch ive got an appointment at the club the committee will blackball the best fellow that ever lived if i dont go and stop them goodby  the last day of mrs evelins sojourn in england was memorable in more ways than one  on the first occasion in beaucourts experience of his married life his wife wrote to him instead of speaking to him although they were both in the house at the time it was a little note only containing these words i thought you would like to say goodby to mrs evelin i have told her to expect you in the library and i will take care that you are not disturbed  waiting at the window of her sittingroom on the upper floor lady howel perceived that the delicate generosity of her conduct had been gratefully felt the interview in the library barely lasted for five minutes she saw mrs evelin leave the house with her veil down immediately afterward beaucourt ascended to his wifes room to thank her carefully as he had endeavored to hide them the traces of tears in his eyes told her how cruelly the parting scene had tried him it was a bitter moment for his admirable wife do you wish me dead she asked with sad selfpossession live he said and live happily if you wish to make me happy too he drew her to him and kissed her forehead lady howel had her reward  part iii  news from the colony  vi  furnished with elaborate instructions to guide him which included golden materials for bribery a young jew holding the place of third clerk in the office of dicks lawyer was sent to the town of grailey to make discoveries in the matter of successfully instituting private inquiries he was justly considered to be a match for any two christians who might try to put obstacles in his way his name was moses jackling  entering the cigarshop the jew discovered that he had presented himself at a critical moment  a girl and a man were standing behind the counter the girl looked like a maidofallwork she was rubbing the tears out of her eyes with a big red fist the man smart in manner and shabby in dress received the stranger with a peremptory eagerness to do business now then what for you jackling bought the worst cigar he had ever smoked in the course of an enormous experience of bad tobacco and tried a few questions with this result the girl had lost her place the man was in possession and the stock and furniture had been seized for debt jackling thereupon assumed the character of a creditor and ask to speak with the mistress  shes too ill to see you sir the girl said  tell the truth you fool cried the man in possession he led the way to a door with a glass in the upper part of it which opened into a parlor behind the shop as soon as his back was turned jackling whispered to the maid when i go slip out after me ive got something for you the man lifted the curtain over the glass look through he said and see whats the matter with her for yourself  jackling discovered the mistress flat on her back on the floor helplessly drunk that was enough for the clerkso far he took leave of the man in possession with the one joke which never wears out in the estimation of englishmen the joke that foresees the drinkers headache in the morning in a minute or two more the girl showed herself carrying an empty jug she had been sent for the mans beer and she was expected back directly jackling having first overwhelmed her by a present of five shillings proposed another appointment in the evening the maid promised to be at the place of meeting and in memory of the five shillings she kept her word  what wages do you get was the first question that astonished her  three pounds a year sir the unfortunate creature replied  all paid  only one pound paidand i say its a crying shame  say what you like my dear so long as you listen to me i want to know everything that your mistress says and doesfirst when shes drunk and then when shes sober wait a bit i havent done yet if you tell me everything you can remembermind  everythingill pay the rest of your wages  madly excited by this golden prospect the victim of domestic service answered inarticulately with a scream jacklings right hand and left hand entered his pockets and appeared again holding two sovereigns separately between two fingers and thumbs from that moment he was at liberty to empty the maidofallworks memory of every saying and doing that it contained  the sober moments of the mistress yielded little or nothing to investigation the report of her drunken moments produced something worth hearing there were two men whom it was her habit to revile bitterly in her cups one of them was mr evelin whom she abusedsometimes for the small allowance that he made to her sometimes for dying before she could prosecute him for bigamy her drunken remembrances of the other man were associated with two names she called him septimus she called him darts and she despised him occasionally for being a common sailor it was clearly demonstrated that he was one man and not two whether he was septimus or whether he was darts he had always committed the same atrocities he had taken her money away from her he had called her by an atrocious name and he had knocked her down on more than one occasion provided with this information jackling rewarded the girl and paid a visit to her mistress the next day  the miserable woman was exactly in the state of nervous prostration after the excess of the previous evening which offered to the clerk his best chance of gaining his end he presented himself as the representative of friends bent on helping her whose modest benevolence had positively forbidden him to mention their names  what sum of money must you pay he asked to get rid of the man in possession  too completely bewildered to speak her trembling hand offered to him a slip of paper on which the amount of the debt and the expenses was set forth l51 12s 10d  with some difficulty the jew preserved his gravity very well he resumed i will make it up to sixty pounds to set you going again on two conditions  she suddenly recovered her power of speech give me the money she cried with greedy impatience of delay  first condition he continued without noticing the interruption you are not to suffer either in purse or person if you give us the information that we want  she interrupted him again tell me what it is and be quick about it  second condition he went on as impenetrably as ever you take me to the place where i can find the certificate of your marriage to septimus darts  her eyes glared at him like the eyes of a wild animal furies hysterics faintings denials threatsjackling endured them all by turns it was enough for him that his desperate guess of the evening before had hit the mark on the morning after when she had completely exhausted herself he returned to the experiment which he had already tried with the maid well aware of the advantage of exhibiting gold instead of notes when the object is to tempt poverty he produced the promised bribe in sovereigns pouring them playfully backward and forward from one big hand to the other  the temptation was more than the woman could resist in another halfhour the two were traveling together to a town in one of the midland counties  the certificate was found in the church register and duly copied  it also appeared that one of the witnesses to the marriage was still living his name and address were duly noted in the clerks pocketbook subsequent inquiry at the office of the customs comptroller discovered the name of septimus darts on the captains official list of the crew of an outward bound merchant vessel with this information and with a photographic portrait to complete it the man was discovered alive and hearty on the return of the ship to her port  his wifes explanation of her conduct included the customary excuse that she had every reason to believe her husband to be dead and was followed by a bold assertion that she had married mr evelin for love in moses jacklings opinion she lied when she said this and lied again when she threatened to prosecute mr evelin for bigamy take my word for it said this new representative of the unbelieving jew she would have extorted money from him if he had lived delirium tremens left this question unsettled and closed the cigar shop soon afterward under the authority of death  the good news telegraphed to new zealand was followed by a letter containing details  at a later date a telegram arrived from mrs evelin she had reached her destination and had received the dispatch which told her that she had been lawfully married a letter to lady howel was promised by the next mail  while the necessary term of delay was still unexpired the newspapers received the intelligence of a volcanic eruption in the northern island of the new zealand group later particulars announcing a terrible destruction of life and property included the homestead in which mrs evelin was living the farm had been overwhelmed and every member of the household had perished  part iv  the night nurse  vii  indorsed as follows reply from sir richard addressed to farleigh  halford  your courteous letter has been forwarded to my house in the country  i really regret that you should have thought it necessary to apologize for troubling me your past kindness to the unhappy mrs evelin gives you a friendly claim on me which i gladly recognizeas you shall soon see  the extraordinary story as you very naturally call it is nevertheless true i am the only person now at your disposal who can speak as an eyewitness of the events  in the first place i must tell you that the dreadful intelligence received from new zealand had an effect on lord howel beaucourt which shocked his friends and inexpressibly distressed his admirable wife i can only describe him at that time as a man struck down in mind and body alike  lady howel was unremitting in her efforts to console him he was thankful and gentle it was true that no complaint could be made of him it was equally true that no change for the better rewarded the devotion of his wife  the state of feeling which this implied imbittered the disappointment that lady howel naturally felt as some relief to her overburdened mind she associated herself with the work of mercy carried on under the superintendence of the rector of the parish i thought he was wrong in permitting a woman at her advanced time of life to run the risk encountered in visiting the sick and suffering poor at their own dwellingplaces circumstances however failed to justify my dread of the perilous influences of infection and foul air the one untoward event that happened seemed to be too trifling to afford any cause for anxiety lady howel caught cold  unhappily she treated that apparently trivial accident with indifference her husband tried in vain to persuade her to remain at home on one of her charitable visits she was overtaken by a heavy fall of rain and a shivering fit seized her on returning to the house at her age the results were serious a bronchial attack followed in a week more the dearest and best of women had left us nothing to love but the memory of the dead  her last words were faintly whispered to me in her husbands presence take care of him the dying woman said when i am gone  no effort of mine to be worthy of that sacred trust was left untried how could i hope to succeed where she had failed my house in london and my house in the country were both open to beaucourt i entreated him to live with me or if he preferred it to be my guest for a short time only or if he wished to be alone to choose the place of abode which he liked best for his solitary retreat with sincere expressions of gratitude his inflexible despair refused my proposals  in one of the ancient inns built centuries since for the legal societies of london he secluded himself from friends and acquaintances alike one by one they were driven from his dreary chambers by a reception which admitted them with patient resignation and held out little encouragement to return after an interval of no great length i was the last of his friends who intruded on his solitude  poor lady howels will excepting some special legacies had left her fortune to me in trust on certain conditions with which it is needless to trouble you beaucourts resolution not to touch a farthing of his dead wifes money laid a heavy responsibility on my shoulders the burden being ere long increased by forebodings which alarmed me on the subject of his health  he devoted himself to the reading of old books treating as i was told of that branch of useless knowledge generally described as occult science these unwholesome studies so absorbed him that he remained shut up in his badly ventilated chambers for weeks together without once breathing the outer air even for a few minutes such defiance of the ordinary laws of nature as this could end but in one way his health steadily declined and feverish symptoms showed themselves the doctor said plainly there is no chance for him if he stays in this place  once more he refused to be removed to my london house the development of the fever he reminded me might lead to consequences dangerous to me and to my household he had heard of one of the great london hospitals which reserved certain rooms for the occupation of persons capable of paying for the medical care bestowed on them if he were to be removed at all to that hospital he would go many advantages and no objections of importance were presented by this course of proceeding we conveyed him to the hospital without a moments loss of time  when i think of the dreadful illness that followed and when i recall the days of unrelieved suspense passed at the bedside i have not courage enough to dwell on this part of my story besides you know already that beaucourt recoveredor as i might more correctly describe it that he was snatched back to life when the grasp of death was on him of this happier period of his illness i have something to say which may surprise and interest you  on one of the earlier days of his convalescence my visit to him was paid later than usual a matter of importance neglected while he was in danger had obliged me to leave town for a few days after there was nothing to be feared returning i had missed the train which would have brought me to london in better time  my appearance evidently produced in beaucourt a keen feeling of relief he requested the day nurse waiting in the room to leave us by ourselves  i was afraid you might not have come to me today he said my last moments would have been imbittered my friend by your absence  are you anticipating your death i asked at the very time when the doctors answer for your life  the doctors have not seen her he said i saw her last night  of whom are you speaking  of my lost angel who perished miserably in new zealand twice her spirit has appeared to me i shall see her for the third time tonight i shall follow her to the better world  had the delirium of the worst time of the fever taken possession of him again in unutterable dread of a relapse i took his hand the skin was cool i laid my fingers on his pulse it was beating calmly  you think i am wandering in my mind he broke out stay here tonighti command you stayand see her as i have seen her  i quieted him by promising to do what he had asked of me he had still one more condition to insist on  i wont be laughed at he said promise that you will not repeat to any living creature what i have just told you  my promise satisfied him he wearily closed his eyes in a few minutes more his poor weak body was in peaceful repose  the daynurse returned and remained with us later than usual twilight melted into darkness the room was obscurely lit by a shaded lamp placed behind a screen that kept the sun out of the sick mans eyes in the daytime  are we alone beaucourt asked  yes  watch the door  why  you will see her on the threshold  as he said those words the door slowly opened in the dim light i could only discern at first the figure of a woman she slowly advanced toward me i saw the familiar face in shadow the eyes were large and faintly luminousthe eyes of mrs evelin  the wild words spoken to me by beaucourt the stillness and the obscurity in the room had their effect i suppose on my imagination you will think me a poor creature when i confess it for the moment i did assuredly feel a thrill of superstitious terror  my delusion was dispelled by a change in her face its natural expression of surprise when she saw me set my mind free to feel the delight inspired by the discovery that she was a living woman i should have spoken to her if she had not stopped me by a gesture  beaucourts voice broke the silence ministering spirit he said free me from the life of earth take me with you to the life eternal  she made no attempt to enlighten him wait she answered calmly wait and rest  silently obeying her he turned his head on the pillow we saw his face no more  i have related the circumstances exactly as they happened the ghost story which report has carried to your ears has no other foundation than this  mrs evelin led the way to that further end of the room in which the screen stood placing ourselves behind it we could converse in whispers without being heard her first words told me that she had been warned by one of the hospital doctors to respect my friends delusion for the present his mind partook in some degree of the weakness of his body and he was not strong enough yet to bear the shock of discovering the truth  she had been saved almost by a miracle  released in a state of insensibility from the ruins of the house she had been laid with her dead relatives awaiting burial happily for her an english traveler visiting the island was among the first men who volunteered to render help he had been in practice as a medical man and he saved her from being buried alive nearly a month passed before she was strong enough to bear removal to wellington the capital city and to be received into the hospital  i asked why she had not telegraphed or written to me  when i was strong enough to write she said i was strong enough to bear the seavoyage to england the expenses so nearly exhausted my small savings that i had no money to spare for the telegraph  on her arrival in london only a few days since she had called on me at the time when i had left home on the business which i have already mentioned she had not heard of lady howels death and had written ignorantly to prepare that good friend for seeing her the messenger sent with the letter had found the house in the occupation of strangers and had been referred to the agent employed in letting it she went herself to this person and so heard that lord howel beaucourt had lost his wife and was reported to be dying in one of the london hospitals  if he had been in his usual state of health she said it would have been indelicate on my parti mean it would have seemed like taking a selfish advantage of the poor ladys deathto have let him know that my life had been saved in any other way than by writing to him but when i heard he was dying i forgot all customary considerations his name was so wellknown in london that i easily discovered at what hospital he had been received there i heard that the report was false and that he was out of danger i ought to hav e been satisfied with thatbut oh how could i be so near him and not long to see him the old doctor with whom i had been speaking discovered i suppose that i was in trouble about something he was so kind and fatherly and he seemed to take such interest in me that i confessed everything to him after he had made me promise to be careful he told the nightnurse to let me take her place for a little while when the dim light in the room would not permit his patient to see me too plainly he waited at the door when we tried the experiment neither he nor i foresaw that lord howel would put such a strange interpretation on my presence the nurse doesnt approve of my coming backeven for a little while onlyand taking her place again tonight she is right i have had my little glimpse of happiness and with that little i must be content  what i said in answer to this and what i did as time advanced it is surely needless to tell you you have read the newspapers which announce their marriage and their departure for italy what else is there left for me to say  there is perhaps a word more still wanting  obstinate lord howel persisted in refusing to take the fortune that was waiting for him in this difficulty the conditions under which i was acting permitted me to appeal to the bride when she too said no i was not to be trifled with i showed her poor ladys howels will after reading the terms in which my dear old friend alluded to her she burst out crying i interpreted those grateful tears as an expression of repentance for the illconsidered reply which i had just received as yet i have not been told that i was wrong     mr policeman and the cook  a first word for myself  before the doctor left me one evening i asked him how much longer i was likely to live he answered its not easy to say you may die before i can get back to you in the morning or you may live to the end of the month  i was alive enough on the next morning to think of the needs of my soul and being a member of the roman catholic church to send for the priest  the history of my sins related in confession included blameworthy neglect of a duty which i owed to the laws of my country in the priests opinionand i agreed with himi was bound to make public acknowledgment of my fault as an act of penance becoming to a catholic englishman we concluded thereupon to try a division of labor i related the circumstances while his reverence took the pen and put the matter into shape  here follows what came of it  i  when i was a young man of fiveandtwenty i became a member of the london police force after nearly two years ordinary experience of the responsible and illpaid duties of that vocation i found myself employed on my first serious and terrible case of official inquiryrelating to nothing less than the crime of murder  the circumstances were these  i was then attached to a station in the northern district of londonwhich i beg permission not to mention more particularly on a certain monday in the week i took my turn of night duty up to four in the morning nothing occurred at the stationhouse out of the ordinary way it was then springtime and between the gas and the fire the room became rather hot i went to the door to get a breath of fresh airmuch to the surprise of our inspector on duty who was constitutionally a chilly man there was a fine rain falling and a nasty damp in the air sent me back to the fireside i dont suppose i had sat down for more than a minute when the swingingdoor was violently pushed open a frantic woman ran in with a scream and said is this the stationhouse  our inspector otherwise an excellent officer had by some perversity of nature a hot temper in his chilly constitution why bless the woman cant you see it is he says whats the matter now  murders the matter she burst out for gods sake come back with me its at mrs crosscapels lodginghouse number 14 lehigh street a young woman has murdered her husband in the night with a knife sir she says she thinks she did it in her sleep  i confess i was startled by this and the third man on duty a sergeant seemed to feel it too she was a nicelooking young woman even in her terrified condition just out of bed with her clothes huddled on anyhow i was partial in those days to a tall figureand she was as they say my style i put a chair for her and the sergeant poked the fire as for the inspector nothing ever upset him he questioned her as coolly as if it had been a case of petty larceny  have you seen the murdered man he asked  no sir  or the wife  no sir i didnt dare go into the room i only heard about it  oh and who are you one of the lodgers  no sir im the cook  isnt there a master in the house  yes sir hes frightened out of his wits and the housemaids gone for the doctor it all falls on the poor servants of course oh why did i ever set foot in that horrible house  the poor soul burst out crying and shivered from head to foot the inspector made a note of her statement and then asked her to read it and sign it with her name the object of this proceeding was to get her to come near enough to give him the opportunity of smelling her breath when people make extraordinary statements he afterward said to me it sometimes saves trouble to satisfy yourself that they are not drunk ive known them to be madbut not often you will generally find that in their eyes  she roused herself and signed her namepriscilla thurlby the inspectors own test proved her to be sober and her eyesa nice light blue color mild and pleasant no doubt when they were not staring with fear and red with cryingsatisfied him as i supposed that she was not mad he turned the case over to me in the first instance i saw that he didnt believe in it even yet  go back with her to the house he says this may be a stupid hoax or a quarrel exaggerated see to it yourself and hear what the doctor says if it is serious send word back here directly and let nobody enter the place or leave it till we come stop you know the form if any statement is volunteered  yes sir i am to caution the persons that whatever they say will be taken down and may be used against them  quite right youll be an inspector yourself one of these days now miss with that he dismissed her under my care  lehigh street was not very far offabout twenty minutes walk from the station i confess i thought the inspector had been rather hard on priscilla she was herself naturally angry with him what does he mean she says by talking of a hoax i wish he was as frightened as i am this is the first time i have been out at service sirand i did think i had found a respectable place  i said very little to herfeeling if the truth must be told rather anxious about the duty committed to me on reaching the house the door was opened from within before i could knock a gentleman stepped out who proved to be the doctor he stopped the moment he saw me  you must be careful policeman he says i found the man lying on his back in bed deadwith the knife that had killed him left sticking in the wound  hearing this i felt the necessity of sending at once to the station where could i find a trustworthy messenger i took the liberty of asking the doctor if he would repeat to the police what he had already said to me the station was not much out of his way home he kindly granted my request  the landlady mrs crosscapel joined us while we were talking she was still a young woman not easily frightened as far as i could see even by a murder in the house her husband was in the passage behind her he looked old enough to be her father and he so trembled with terror that some people might have taken him for the guilty person i removed the key from the street door after locking it and i said to the landlady nobody must leave the house or enter the house till the inspector comes i must examine the premises to see if any on e has broken in  there is the key of the area gate she said in answer to me its always kept locked come downstairs and see for yourself priscilla went with us her mistress set her to work to light the kitchen fire some of us says mrs crosscapel may be the better for a cup of tea i remarked that she took things easy under the circumstances she answered that the landlady of a london lodginghouse could not afford to lose her wits no matter what might happen  i found the gate locked and the shutters of the kitchen window fastened the back kitchen and back door were secured in the same way no person was concealed anywhere returning upstairs i examined the front parlor window there again the barred shutters answered for the security of that room a cracked voice spoke through the door of the back parlor the policeman can come in it said if he will promise not to look at me i turned to the landlady for information its my parlor lodger miss mybus she said a most respectable lady going into the room i saw something rolled up perpendicularly in the bed curtains miss mybus had made herself modestly invisible in that way having now satisfied my mind about the security of the lower part of the house and having the keys safe in my pocket i was ready to go upstairs  on our way to the upper regions i asked if there had been any visitors on the previous day there had been only two visitors friends of the lodgersand mrs crosscapel herself had let them both out my next inquiry related to the lodgers themselves on the ground floor there was miss mybus on the first floor occupying both rooms mr barfield an old bachelor employed in a merchants office on the second floor in the front room mr john zebedee the murdered man and his wife in the back room mr deluc described as a cigar agent and supposed to be a creole gentleman from martinique in the front garret mr and mrs crosscapel in the back garret the cook and the housemaid these were the inhabitants regularly accounted for i asked about the servants both excellent characters says the landlady or they would not be in my service  we reached the second floor and found the housemaid on the watch outside the door of the front room not as nice a woman personally as the cook and sadly frightened of course her mistress had posted her to give the alarm in the case of an outbreak on the part of mrs zebedee kept locked up in the room my arrival relieved the housemaid of further responsibility she ran downstairs to her fellowservant in the kitchen  i asked mrs crosscapel how and when the alarm of the murder had been given  soon after three this morning says she i was woke by the screams of mrs zebedee i found her out here on the landing and mr deluc in great alarm trying to quiet her sleeping in the next room he had only to open his door when her screams woke him my dear johns murdered i am the miserable wretchi did it in my sleep she repeated these frantic words over and over again until she dropped in a swoon mr deluc and i carried her back into the bedroom we both thought the poor creature had been driven distracted by some dreadful dream but when we got to the bedsidedont ask me what we saw the doctor has told you about it already i was once a nurse in a hospital and accustomed as such to horrid sights it turned me cold and giddy notwithstanding as for mr deluc i thought he would have had a fainting fit next  hearing this i inquired if mrs zebedee had said or done any strange things since she had been mrs crosscapels lodger  you think shes mad says the landlady and anybody would be of your mind when a woman accuses herself of murdering her husband in her sleep all i can say is that up to this morning a more quiet sensible wellbehaved little person than mrs zebedee i never met with only just married mind and as fond of her unfortunate husband as a woman could be i should have called them a pattern couple in their own line of life  there was no more to be said on the landing we unlocked the door and went into the room  ii  he lay in bed on his back as the doctor had described him on the left side of his nightgown just over his heart the blood on the linen told its terrible tale as well as one could judge looking unwillingly at a dead face he must have been a handsome young man in his lifetime it was a sight to sadden anybodybut i think the most painful sensation was when my eyes fell next on his miserable wife  she was down on the floor crouched up in a cornera dark little woman smartly dressed in gay colors her black hair and her big brown eyes made the horrid paleness of her face look even more deadly white than perhaps it really was she stared straight at us without appearing to see us we spoke to her and she never answered a word she might have been deadlike her husbandexcept that she perpetually picked at her fingers and shuddered every now and then as if she was cold i went to her and tried to lift her up she shrank back with a cry that wellnigh frightened menot because it was loud but because it was more like the cry of some animal than of a human being however quietly she might have behaved in the landladys previous experience of her she was beside herself now i might have been moved by a natural pity for her or i might have been completely upset in my mindi only know this i could not persuade myself that she was guilty i even said to mrs crosscapel i dont believe she did it  while i spoke there was a knock at the door i went downstairs at once and admitted to my great relief the inspector accompanied by one of our men  he waited downstairs to hear my report and he approved of what i had done it looks as if the murder had been committed by somebody in the house saying this he left the man below and went up with me to the second floor  before he had been a minute in the room he discovered an object which had escaped my observation  it was the knife that had done the deed  the doctor had found it left in the bodyhad withdrawn it to probe the woundand had laid it on the bedside table it was one of those useful knives which contain a saw a corkscrew and other like implements the big blade fastened back when open with a spring except where the blood was on it it was as bright as when it had been purchased a small metal plate was fastened to the horn handle containing an inscription only partly engraved which ran thus to john zebedee from there it stopped strangely enough  who or what had interrupted the engravers work it was impossible even to guess nevertheless the inspector was encouraged  this ought to help us he saidand then he gave an attentive ear looking all the while at the poor creature in the corner to what mrs crosscapel had to tell him  the landlady having done he said he must now see the lodger who slept in the next bedchamber  mr deluc made his appearance standing at the door of the room and turning away his head with horror from the sight inside  he was wrapped in a splendid blue dressinggown with a golden girdle and trimmings his scanty brownish hair curled whether artificially or not i am unable to say in little ringlets his complexion was yellow his greenishbrown eyes were of the sort called gogglethey looked as if they might drop out of his face if you held a spoon under them his mustache and goats beard were beautifully oiled and to complete his equipment he had a long black cigar in his mouth  it isnt insensibility to this terrible tragedy he explained my nerves have been shattered mr policeman and i can only repair the mischief in this way be pleased to excuse and feel for me  the inspector questioned this witness sharply and closely he was not a man to be misled by appearances but i could see that he was far from liking or even trusting mr deluc nothing came of the examination except what mrs crosscapel had in substance already mentioned to me mr deluc returned to his room  how long has he been lodging with you the inspector asked as soon as his back was turned  nearly a year the landlady answered  did he give you a reference  as good a reference as i could wish for thereupon she mentioned the names of a wellknown firm of cigar merchants in the city the inspector noted the information in his pocketbook  i would rather not relate in detail what happened next it is too distressing to be dwelt on let me only say that the poor demented woman was taken away in a cab to the stationhouse the inspector possessed himself of the knife and of a book found on the floor called the world of sleep the portmanteau containing the luggage was lockedand then the door of the room was secured the keys in both cases being left in my charge my instructions were to remain in the house and allow nobody to leave it until i heard again shortly from the inspector  iii  the coroners inquest was adjourned and the examination before the magistrate ended in a remandmrs zebedee being in no condition to understand the proceedings in either case the surgeon reported her to be completely prostrated by a terrible nervous shock when he was asked if he considered her to have been a sane woman before the murder took place he refused to answer positively at that time  a week passed the murdered man was buried his old father attending the funeral i occasionally saw mrs crosscapel and the two servants for the purpose of getting such further information as was thought desirable both the cook and the housemaid had given their months notice to quit declining in the interest of their characters to remain in a house which had been the scene of a murder mr delucs nerves led also to his removal his rest was now disturbed by frightful dreams he paid the necessary forfeitmoney and left without notice the firstfloor lodger mr barfield kept his rooms but obtained leave of absence from his employers and took refuge with some friends in the country miss mybus alone remained in the parlors when i am comfortable the old lady said nothing moves me at my age a murder up two pairs of stairs is nearly the same thing as a murder in the next house distance you see makes all the difference  it mattered little to the police what the lodgers did we had men in plain clothes watching the house night and day everybody who went away was privately followed and the police in the district to which they retired were warned to keep an eye on them after that as long as we failed to put mrs zebedees extraordinary statement to any sort of testto say nothing of having proved unsuccessful thus far in tracing the knife to its purchaserwe were bound to let no person living under mr crosscapels roof on the night of the murder slip through our fingers  iv  in a fortnight more mrs zebedee had sufficiently recovered to make the necessary statementafter the preliminary caution addressed to persons in such cases the surgeon had no hesitation now in reporting her to be a sane woman  her station in life had been domestic service she had lived for four years in her last place as ladysmaid with a family residing in dorsetshire the one objection to her had been the occasional infirmity of sleepwalking which made it necessary that one of the other female servants should sleep in the same room with the door locked and the key under her pillow in all other respects the ladysmaid was described by her mistress as a perfect treasure  in the last six months of her service a young man named john zebedee entered the house with a written character as a footman he soon fell in love with the nice little ladysmaid and she heartily returned the feeling they might have waited for years before they were in a pecuniary position to marry but for the death of zebedees uncle who left him a little fortune of two thousand pounds they were now for persons in their station rich enough to please themselves and they were married from the house in which they had served together the little daughters of the family showing their affection for mrs zebedee by acting as her bridesmaids  the young husband was a careful man he decided to employ his small capital to the best advantage by sheepfarming in australia his wife made no objection she was ready to go wherever john went  accordingly they spent their short honeymoon in london so as to see for themselves the vessel in which their passage was to be taken they went to mrs crosscapels lodginghouse because zebedees uncle had always stayed there when in london ten days were to pass before the day of embarkation arrived this gave the young couple a welcome holiday and a prospect of amusing themselves to their hearts content among the sights and shows of the great city  on their first evening in london they went to the theater they were both accustomed to the fresh air of the country and they felt half stifled by the heat and the gas however they were so pleased with an amusement which was new to them that they went to another theater on the next evening on this second occasion john zebedee found the heat unendurable they left the theater and got back to their lodgings toward ten oclock  let the rest be told in the words used by mrs zebedee herself she said  we sat talking for a little while in our room and johns headache got worse and worse i persuaded him to go to bed and i put out the candle the fire giving sufficient light to undress by so that he might the sooner fall asleep but he was too restless to sleep he asked me to read him something books always made him drowsy at the best of times  i had not myself begun to undress so i lit the candle again and i opened the only book i had john had noticed it at the railway bookstall by the name of the world of sleep he used to joke with me about my being a sleepwalker and he said heres something thats sure to interest youand he made me a present of the book  before i had read to him for more than half an hour he was fast asleep not feeling that way inclined i went on reading to myself  the book did indeed interest me there was one terrible story which took a hold on my mindthe story of a man who stabbed his own wife in a sleepwalking dream i thought of putting down my book after that and then changed my mind again and went on the next chapters were not so interesting they were full of learned accounts of why we fall asleep and what our brains do in that state and such like it ended in my falling asleep too in my armchair by the fireside  i dont know what oclock it was when i went to sleep i dont know how long i slept or whether i dreamed or not the candle and the fire had both burned out and it was pitch dark when i woke i cant even say why i wokeunless it was the coldness of the room  there was a spare candle on the chimneypiece i found the matchbox and got a light then for the first time i turned round toward the bed and i saw  she had seen the dead body of her husband murdered while she was unconsciously at his sideand she fainted poor creature at the bare remembrance of it  the proceedings were adjourned she received every possible care and attention the chaplain looking after her welfare as well as the surgeon  i have said nothing of the evidence of the landlady and servants it was taken as a mere formality what little they knew proved nothing against mrs zebedee the police made no discoveries that supported her first frantic accusation of herself her master and mistress where she had been last in service spoke of her in the highest terms we were at a complete deadlock  it had been thought best not to surprise mr deluc as yet by citing him as a witness the action of the law was however hurried in this case by a private communication received from the chaplain  after twice seeing and speaking with mrs zebedee the reverend gentleman was persuaded that she had no more to do than himself with the murder of her husband he did not consider that he was justified in repeating a confidential communicationhe would only recommend that mr deluc should be summoned to appear at the next examination this advice was followed  the police had no evidence against mrs zebedee when the inquiry was resumed to assist the ends of justice she was now put into the witnessbox the discovery of her murdered husband when she woke in the small hours of the morning was passed over as rapidly as possible only three questions of importance were put to her  first the knife was produced had she ever seen it in her husbands possession never did she know anything about it nothing whatever  secondly did she or did her husband lock the bedroom door when they returned from the theater no did she afterward lock the door herself no  thirdly had she any sort of reason to give for supposing that she had murdered her husband in a sleepwalking dream no reason except that she was beside herself at the time and the book put the thought into her head  after this the other witnesses were sent out of court the motive for the chaplains communication now appeared mrs zebedee was asked if anything unpleasant had occurred between mr deluc and herself  yes he had caught her alone on the stairs at the lodginghouse had presumed to make love to her and had carried the insult still farther by attempting to kiss her she had slapped his face and had declared that her husband should know of it if his misconduct was repeated he was in a furious rage at having his face slapped and he said to her madam you may live to regret this  after consultation and at the request of our inspector it was decided to keep mr deluc in ignorance of mrs zebedees statement for the present when the witnesses were recalled he gave the same evidence which he had already given to the inspectorand he was then asked if he knew anything of the knife he looked at it without any guilty signs in his face and swore that he had never seen it until that moment the resumed inquiry ended and still nothing had been discovered  but we kept an eye on mr deluc our next effort was to try if we could associate him with the purchase of the knife  here again there really did seem to be a sort of fatality in this case we reached no useful result it was easy enough to find out the wholesale cutlers who had manufactured the knife at sheffield by the mark on the blade but they made tens of thousands of such knives and disposed of them to retail dealers all over great britainto say nothing of foreign parts as to finding out the person who had engraved the imperfect inscription without knowing where or by whom the knife had been purchased we might as well have looked for the proverbial needle in the bundle of hay our last resource was to have the knife photographed with the inscribed side uppermost and to send copies to every policestation in the kingdom  at the same time we reckoned up mr deluci mean that we made investigations into his past lifeon the chance that he and the murdered man might have known each other and might have had a quarrel or a rivalry about a woman on some former occasion no such discovery rewarded us  we found deluc to have led a dissipated life and to have mixed with very bad company but he had kept out of reach of the law a man may be a profligate vagabond may insult a lady may say threatening things to her in the first stinging sensation of having his face slappedbut it doesnt follow from these blots on his character that he has murdered her husband in the dead of the night  once more then when we were called upon to report ourselves we had no evidence to produce the photographs failed to discover the owner of the knife and to explain its interrupted inscription poor mrs zebedee was allowed to go back to her friends on entering into her own recognizance to appear again if called upon articles in the newspapers began to inquire how many more murderers would succeed in baffling the police the authorities at the treasury offered a reward of a hundred pounds for the necessary information and the weeks passed and nobody claimed the reward  our inspector was not a man to be easily beaten more inquiries and examinations followed it is needless to say anything about them we were defeatedand there so far as the police and the public were concerned was an end of it  the assassination of the poor young husband soon passed out of notice like other undiscovered murders one obscure person only was foolish enough in his leisure hours to persist in trying to solve the problem of who killed zebedee he felt that he might rise to the highest position in the police force if he succeeded where his elders and betters had failedand he held to his own little ambition though everybody laughed at him in plain english i was the man  v  without meaning it i have told my story ungratefully  there were two persons who saw nothing ridiculous in my resolution to continue the investigation singlehanded one of them was miss mybus and the other was the cook priscilla thurlby  mentioning the lady first miss mybus was indignant at the resigned manner in which the police accepted their defeat she was a little brighteyed wiry woman and she spoke her mind freely  this comes home to me she said just look back for a year or two i can call to mind two cases of persons found murdered in londonand the assassins have never been traced i am a person too and i ask myself if my turn is not coming next youre a nicelooking fellow and i like your pluck and perseverance come here as often as you think right and say you are my visitor if they make any difficulty about letting you in one thing more i have nothing particular to do and i am no fool here in the parlors i see everybody who comes into the house or goes out of the house leave me your addressi may get some information for you yet  with the best intentions miss mybus found no opportunity of helping me of the two priscilla thurlby seemed more likely to be of use  in the first place she was sharp and active and not having succeeded in getting another situation as yet was mistress of her own movements  in the second place she was a woman i could trust before she left home to try domestic service in london the parson of her native parish gave her a written testimonial of which i append a copy thus it ran   i gladly recommend priscilla thurlby for any respectable employment which she may be competent to undertake her father and mother are infirm old people who have lately suffered a diminution of their income and they have a younger daughter to maintain rather than be a burden on her parents priscilla goes to london to find domestic employment and to devote her earnings to the assistance of her father and mother this circumstance speaks for itself i have known the family many years and i only regret that i have no vacant place in my own household which i can offer to this good girl  signed henry deerington rector of roth   after reading those words i could safely ask priscilla to help me in reopening the mysterious murder case to some good purpose  my notion was that the proceedings of the persons in mrs crosscapels house had not been closely enough inquired into yet by way of continuing the investigation i asked priscilla if she could tell me anything which associated the housemaid with mr deluc she was unwilling to answer i may be casting suspicion on an innocent person she said besides i was for so short a time the housemaids fellow servant  you slept in the same room with her i remarked and you had opportunities of observing her conduct toward the lodgers if they had asked you at the examination what i now ask you would have answered as an honest woman  to this argument she yielded i heard from her certain particulars which threw a new light on mr deluc and on the case generally on that information i acted it was slow work owing to the claims on me of my regular duties but with priscillas help i steadily advanced toward the end i had in view  besides this i owed another obligation to mrs crosscapels nicelooking cook the confession must be made sooner or laterand i may as well make it now i first knew what love was thanks to priscilla i had delicious kisses thanks to priscilla and when i asked if she would marry me she didnt say no she looked i must own a little sadly and she said how can two such poor people as we are ever hope to marry to this i answered it wont be long before i lay my hand on the clew which my inspector has failed to find i shall be in a position to marry you my dear when that time comes  at our next meeting we spoke of her parents i was now her promised husband judging by what i had heard of the proceedings of other people in my position it seemed to be only right that i should be made known to her father and mother she entirely agreed with me and she wrote home that day to tell them to expect us at the end of the week  i took my turn of nightduty and so gained my liberty for the greater part of the next day i dressed myself in plain clothes and we took our tickets on the railway for yateland being the nearest station to the village in which priscillas parents lived  vi  the train stopped as usual at the big town of waterbank supporting herself by her needle while she was still unprovided with a situation priscilla had been at work late in the nightshe was tired and thirsty i left the carriage to get her some sodawater the stupid girl in the refreshment room failed to pull the cork out of the bottle and refused to let me help her she took a corkscrew and used it crookedly i lost all patience and snatched the bottle out of her hand just as i drew the cork the bell rang on the platform i only waited to pour the sodawater into a glassbut the train was moving as i left the refreshment room the porters stopped me when i tried to jump on to the step of the carriage i was left behind  as soon as i had recovered my temper i looked at the timetable we had reached waterbank at five minutes past one by good luck the next train was due at fortyfour minutes past one and arrived at yateland the next station ten minutes afterward i could only hope that priscilla would look at the timetable too and wait for me if i had attempted to walk the distance between the two places i should have lost time instead of saving it the interval before me was not very long i occupied it in looking over the town  speaking with all due respect to the inhabitants waterbank to other people is a dull place i went up one street and down anotherand stopped to look at a shop which struck me not from anything in itself but because it was the only shop in the street with the shutters closed  a bill was posted on the shutters announcing that the place was to let the outgoing tradesmans name and business announced in the customary painted letters ran thus james wycomb cutler etc  for the first time it occurred to me that we had forgotten an obstacle in our way when we distributed our photographs of the knife we had none of us remembered that a certain proportion of cutlers might be placed by circumstances out of our reacheither by retiring from business or by becoming bankrupt i always carried a copy of the photograph about me and i thought to myself here is the ghost of a chance of tracing the knife to mr deluc  the shop door was opened after i had twice rung the bell by an old man very dirty and very deaf he said you had better go upstairs and speak to mr scorriertop of the house  i put my lips to the old fellows eartrumpet and asked who mr scorrier was  brotherinlaw to mr wycomb mr wycombs dead if you want to buy the business apply to mr scorrier  receiving that reply i went upstairs and found mr scorrier engaged in engraving a brass doorplate he was a middleaged man with a cadaverous face and dim eyes after the necessary apologies i produced my photograph  may i ask sir if you know anything of the inscription on that knife i said  he took his magnifying glass to look at it  this is curious he remarked quietly i remember the queer namezebedee yes sir i did the engraving as far as it goes i wonder what prevented me from finishing it  the name of zebedee and the unfinished inscription on the knife had appeared in every english newspaper he took the matter so coolly that i was doubtful how to interpret his answer was it possible that he had not seen the account of the murder or was he an accomplice with prodigious powers of selfcontrol  excuse me i said do you read the newspapers  never my eyesight is failing me i abstain from reading in the interests of my occupation  have you not heard the name of zebedee mentionedparticularly by people who do read the newspapers  very likely but i didnt attend to it when the days work is done i take my walk then i have my supper my drop of grog and my pipe then i go to bed a dull existence you think i daresay i had a miserable life sir when i was young a bare subsistence and a little rest before the last perfect rest in the gravethat is all i want the world has gone by me long ago so much the better  the poor man spoke honestly i was ashamed of having doubted him i returned to the subject of the knife  do you know where it was purchased and by whom i asked  my memory is not so good as it was he said but i have got something by me that helps it  he took from a cupboard a dirty old scrapbook strips of paper with writing on them were pasted on the pages as well as i could see he turned to an index or table of contents and opened a page something like a flash of life showed itself on his dismal face  ha now i remember he said the knife was bought of my late brotherinlaw in the shop downstairs it all comes back to me sir a person in a state of frenzy burst into this very room and snatched the knife away from me when i was only half way through the inscription  i felt that i was now close on discovery may i see what it is that has assisted your memory i asked  oh yes you must know sir i live by engraving inscriptions and addresses and i paste in this book the manuscript instructions which i receive with marks of my own on the margin for one thing they serve as a reference to new customers and for another thing they do certainly help my memory  he turned the book toward me and pointed to a slip of paper which occupied the lower half of a page  i read the complete inscription intended for the knife that killed zebedee and written as follows  to john zebedee from priscilla thurlby  vii  i declare that it is impossible for me to describe what i felt when priscillas name confronted me like a written confession of guilt how long it was before i recovered myself in some degree i cannot say the only thing i can clearly call to mind is that i frightened the poor engraver  my first desire was to get possession of the manuscript inscription i told him i was a policeman and summoned him to assist me in the discovery of a crime i even offered him money he drew back from my hand you shall have it for nothing he said if you will only go away and never come here again he tried to cut it out of the pagebut his trembling hands were helpless i cut it out myself and attempted to thank him he wouldnt hear me go away he said i dont like the look of you  it may be here objected that i ought not to have felt so sure as i did of the womans guilt until i had got more evidence against her the knife might have been stolen from her supposing she was the person who had snatched it out of the engravers hands and might have been afterward used by the thief to commit the murder all very true but i never had a moments doubt in my own mind from the time when i read the damnable line in the engravers book  i went back to the railway without any plan in my head the train by which i had proposed to follow her had left waterbank the next train that arrived was for london i took my place in itstill without any plan in my head  at charing cross a friend met me he said youre looking miserably ill come and have a drink  i went with him the liquor was what i really wanted it strung me up and cleared my head he went his way and i went mine in a little while more i determined what i would do  in the first place i decided to resign my situation in the police from a motive which will presently appear in the second place i took a bed at a publichouse she would no doubt return to london and she would go to my lodgings to find out why i had broken my appointment to bring to justice the one woman whom i had dearly loved was too cruel a duty for a poor creature like me i preferred leaving the police force on the other hand if she and i met before time had helped me to control myself i had a horrid fear that i might turn murderer next and kill her then and there the wretch had not only all but misled me into marrying her but also into charging the innocent housemaid with being concerned in the murder  the same night i hit on a way of clearing up such doubts as still harassed my mind i wrote to the rector of roth informing him that i was engaged to marry her and asking if he would tell me in consideration of my position what her former relations might have been with the person named john zebedee  by return of post i got this reply   sirunder the circumstances i think i am bound to tell you confidentially what the friends and wellwishers of priscilla have kept secret for her sake  zebedee was in service in this neighborhood i am sorry to say it of a man who has come to such a miserable endbut his behavior to priscilla proves him to have been a vicious and heartless wretch they were engagedand i add with indignation he tried to seduce her under a promise of marriage her virtue resisted him and he pretended to be ashamed of himself the banns were published in my church on the next day zebedee disappeared and cruelly deserted her he was a capable servant and i believe he got another place i leave you to imagine what the poor girl suffered under the outrage inflicted on her going to london with my recommendation she answered the first advertisement that she saw and was unfortunate enough to begin her career in domestic service in the very lodginghouse to which as i gather from the newspaper report of the murder the man zebedee took the person whom he married after deserting priscilla be assured that you are about to unite yourself to an excellent girl and accept my best wishes for your happiness   it was plain from this that neither the rector nor the parents and friends knew anything of the purchase of the knife the one miserable man who knew the truth was the man who had asked her to be his wife  i owed it to myselfat least so it seemed to menot to let it be supposed that i too had meanly deserted her dreadful as the prospect was i felt that i must see her once more and for the last time  she was at work when i went into her room as i opened the door she started to her feet her cheeks reddened and her eyes flashed with anger i stepped forwardand she saw my face my face silenced her  i spoke in the fewest words i could find  i have been to the cutlers shop at waterbank i said there is the unfinished inscription on the knife complete in your handwriting i could hang you by a word god forgive mei cant say the word  her bright complexion turned to a dreadful claycolor her eyes were fixed and staring like the eyes of a person in a fit she stood before me still and silent without saying more i dropped the inscription into the fire without saying more i left her  i never saw her again  viii  but i heard from her a few days later the letter has long since been burned i wish i could have forgotten it as well it sticks to my memory if i die with my senses about me priscillas letter will be my last recollection on earth  in substance it repeated what the rector had already told me further it informed me that she had bought the knife as a keepsake for zebedee in place of a similar knife which he had lost on the saturday she made the purchase and left it to be engraved on the sunday the banns were put up on the monday she was deserted and she snatched the knife from the table while the engraver was at work  she only knew that zebedee had added a new sting to the insult inflicted on her when he arrived at the lodgings with his wife her duties as cook kept her in the kitchenand zebedee never discovered that she was in the house i still remember the last lines of her confession  the devil entered into me when i tried their door on my way up to bed and found it unlocked and listened a while and peeped in i saw them by the dying light of the candleone asleep on the bed the other asleep by the fireside i had the knife in my hand and the thought came to me to do it so that they might hang her for the murder i couldnt take the knife out again when i had done it mind this i did really like youi didnt say yes because you could hardly hang your own wife if you found out who killed zebedee   since the past time i have never heard again of priscilla thurlby i dont know whether she is living or dead many people may think i deserve to be hanged myself for not having given her up to the gallows they may perhaps be disappointed when they see this confession and hear that i have died decently in my bed i dont blame them i am a penitent sinner i wish all merciful christians goodby forever
