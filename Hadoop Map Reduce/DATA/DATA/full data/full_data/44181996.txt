44181996	the book of snobs   by one of themselves  william makepeace thackeray     prefatory remarks  the necessity of a work on snobs demonstrated from history and proved by felicitous illustrationsi am the individual destined to write that workmy vocation is announced in terms of great eloquencei show that the world has been gradually preparing itself for the work and the mansnobs are to be studied like other objects of natural science and are a part of the beautiful with a large b they pervade all classesaffecting instance of colonel snobley  we have all read a statement the authenticity of which i take leave to doubt entirely for upon what calculations i should like to know is it foundedwe have all i say been favoured by perusing a remark that when the times and necessities of the world call for a man that individual is found thus at the french revolution which the reader will be pleased to have introduced so early when it was requisite to administer a corrective dose to the nation robespierre was found a most foul and nauseous dose indeed and swallowed eagerly by the patient greatly to the latters ultimate advantage thus when it became necessary to kick john bull out of america mr washington stepped forward and performed that job to satisfaction thus when the earl of aldborough was unwell professor holloway appeared with his pills and cured his lordship as per advertisement c c numberless instances might be adduced to show that when a nation is in great want the relief is at hand just as in the pantomime that microcosm where when clown wants anythinga warmingpan a pumphandle a goose or a ladys tippeta fellow comes sauntering out from behind the sidescenes with the very article in question  again when men commence an undertaking they always are prepared to show that the absolute necessities of the world demanded its completionsay it is a railroad the directors begin by stating that a more intimate communication between bathershins and derrynane beg is necessary for the advancement of civilization and demanded by the multitudinous acclamations of the great irish people or suppose it is a newspaper the prospectus states that at a time when the church is in danger threatened from without by savage fanaticism and miscreant unbelief and undermined from within by dangerous jesuitism and suicidal schism a want has been universally felta suffering people has looked abroadfor an ecclesiastical champion and guardian a body of prelates and gentlemen have therefore stepped forward in this our hour of danger and determined on establishing the beadle newspaper c c one or other of these points at least is incontrovertible the public wants a thing therefore it is supplied with it or the public is supplied with a thing therefore it wants it  i have long gone about with a conviction on my mind that i had a work to doa work if you like with a great w a purpose to fulfil a chasm to leap into like curtius horse and foot a great social evil to discover and to remedy that conviction has pursued me for years it has dogged me in the busy street seated itself by me in the lonely study jogged my elbow as it lifted the winecup at the festive board pursued me through the maze of rotten row followed me in far lands on brightons shingly beach or margates sand the voice outpiped the roaring of the sea it nestles in my nightcap and it whispers wake slumberer thy work is not yet done last year by moonlight in the colosseum the little sedulous voice came to me and said smith or jones the writers name is neither here nor there smith or jones my fine fellow this is all very well but you ought to be at home writing your great work on snobs  when a man has this sort of vocation it is all nonsense attempting to elude it he must speak out to the nations he must unbusm himself as jeames would say or choke and die mark to yourself i have often mentally exclaimed to your humble servant the gradual way in which you have been prepared for and are now led by an irresistible necessity to enter upon your great labour first the world was made then as a matter of course snobs they existed for years and years and were no more known than america but presentlyingens patebat tellusthe people became darkly aware that there was such a race not above fiveandtwenty years since a name an expressive monosyllable arose to designate that race that name has spread over england like railroads subsequently snobs are known and recognized throughout an empire on which i am given to understand the sun never sets punch appears at the ripe season to chronicle their history and the individual comes forth to write that history in punch  i have and for this gift i congratulate myself with deep and abiding thankfulness an eye for a snob if the truthful is the beautiful it is beautiful to study even the snobbish to track snobs through history as certain little dogs in hampshire hunt out truffles to sink shafts in society and come upon rich veins of snobore snobbishness is like death in a quotation from horace which i hope you never have heard beating with equal foot at poor mens doors and kicking at the gates of emperors it is a great mistake to judge of snobs lightly and think they exist among the lower classes merely an immense percentage of snobs i believe is to be found in every rank of this mortal life you must not judge hastily or vulgarly of snobs to do so shows that you are yourself a snob i myself have been taken for one  when i was taking the waters at bagnigge wells and living at the imperial hotel there there used to sit opposite me at breakfast for a short time a snob so insufferable that i felt i should never get any benefit of the waters so long as he remained his name was lieutenantcolonel snobley of a certain dragoon regiment he wore japanned boots and moustaches he lisped drawled and left the rs out of his words he was always flourishing about and smoothing his lacquered whiskers with a huge flaming bandanna that filled the room with an odour of musk so stifling that i determined to do battle with that snob and that either he or i should quit the inn i first began harmless conversations with him frightening him exceedingly for he did not know what to do when so attacked and had never the slightest notion that anybody would take such a liberty with him as to speak first then i handed him the paper then as he would take no notice of these advances i used to look him in the face steadily andand use my fork in the light of a toothpick after two mornings of this practice he could bear it no longer and fairly quitted the place  should the colonel see this will he remember the gent who asked him if he thought publicoaler was a fine writer and drove him from the hotel with a fourpronged fork    chapter ithe snob playfully dealt with   there are relative and positive snobs i mean by positive such persons as are snobs everywhere in all companies from morning till night from youth to the grave being by nature endowed with snobbishnessand others who are snobs only in certain circumstances and relations of life  for instance i once knew a man who committed before me an act as atrocious as that which i have indicated in the last chapter as performed by me for the purpose of disgusting colonel snobley viz the using the fork in the guise of a toothpick i once i say knew a man who dining in my company at the europa coffeehouse opposite the grand opera and as everybody knows the only decent place for dining at naples ate peas with the assistance of his knife he was a person with whose society i was greatly pleased at firstindeed we had met in the crater of mount vesuvius and were subsequently robbed and held to ransom by brigands in calabria which is nothing to the purposea man of great powers excellent heart and varied information but i had never before seen him with a dish of pease and his conduct in regard to them caused me the deepest pain  after having seen him thus publicly comport himself but one course was open to meto cut his acquaintance i commissioned a mutual friend the honourable poly anthus to break the matter to this gentleman as delicately as possible and to say that painful circumstancesin nowise affecting mr marrowfats honour or my esteem for himhad occurred which obliged me to forego my intimacy with him and accordingly we met and gave each other the cut direct that night at the duchess of monte fiascos ball  everybody at naples remarked the separation of the damon and pythiasindeed marrowfat had saved my life more than oncebut as an english gentleman what was i to do  my dear friend was in this instance the snob relative it is not snobbish of persons of rank of any other nation to employ their knife in the manner alluded to i have seen monte fiasco clean his trencher with his knife and every principe in company doing likewise i have seen at the hospitable board of hih the grand duchess stephanie of badenwho if these humble lines should come under her imperial eyes is besought to remember graciously the most devoted of her servantsi have seen i say the hereditary princess of potztausenddonnerwetter that serenelybeautiful woman use her knife in lieu of a fork or spoon i have seen her almost swallow it by jove like ramo samee the indian juggler and did i blench did my estimation for the princess diminish no lovely amalia one of the truest passions that ever was inspired by woman was raised in this bosom by that lady beautiful one long long may the knife carry food to those lips the reddest and loveliest in the world  the cause of my quarrel with marrowfat i never breathed to mortal soul for four years we met in the halls of the aristocracyour friends and relatives we jostled each other in the dance or at the board but the estrangement continued and seemed irrevocable until the fourth of june last year  we met at sir george gollopers we were placed he on the right your humble servant on the left of the admirable lady g peas formed part of the banquetducks and green peas i trembled as i saw marrowfat helped and turned away sickening lest i should behold the weapon darting down his horrid jaws  what was my astonishment what my delight when i saw him use his fork like any other christian he did not administer the cold steel once old times rushed back upon methe remembrance of old serviceshis rescuing me from the brigandshis gallant conduct in the affair with the countess dei spinachihis lending me the 1700l i almost burst into tears with joymy voice trembled with emotion george my boy i exclaimed george marrowfat my dear fellow a glass of wine  blushingdeeply movedalmost as tremulous as i was myself george answered frank shall it be hock or madeira i could have hugged him to my heart but for the presence of the company little did lady golloper know what was the cause of the emotion which sent the duckling i was carving into her ladyships pink satin lap the most goodnatured of women pardoned the error and the butler removed the bird  we have been the closest friends over since nor of course has george repeated his odious habit he acquired it at a country school where they cultivated peas and only used twopronged forks and it was only by living on the continent where the usage of the fourprong is general that he lost the horrible custom  in this pointand in this onlyi confess myself a member of the silverfork school and if this tale but induce one of my readers to pause to examine in his own mind solemnly and ask do i or do i not eat peas with a knifeto see the ruin which may fall upon himself by continuing the practice or his family by beholding the example these lines will not have been written in vain and now whatever other authors may be i flatter myself it will be allowed that i at least am a moral man  by the way as some readers are dull of comprehension i may as well say what the moral of this history is the moral is thissociety having ordained certain customs men are bound to obey the law of society and conform to its harmless orders  if i should go to the british and foreign institute and heaven forbid i should go under any pretext or in any costume whateverif i should go to one of the teaparties in a dressinggown and slippers and not in the usual attire of a gentleman viz pumps a gold waistcoat a crush hat a sham frill and a white chokeri should be insulting society and eating pease with my knife let the porters of the institute hustle out the individual who shall so offend such an offender is as regards society a most emphatical and refractory snob it has its code and police as well as governments and he must conform who would profit by the decrees set forth for their common comfort  i am naturally averse to egotism and hate selflaudation consumedly but i cant help relating here a circumstance illustrative of the point in question in which i must think i acted with considerable prudence  being at constantinople a few years sinceon a delicate missionthe russians were playing a double game between ourselves and it became necessary on our part to employ an extra negotiatorleckerbiss pasha of roumelia then chief galeongee of the porte gave a diplomatic banquet at his summer palace at bujukdere i was on the left of the galeongee and the russian agent count de diddloff on his dexter side diddloff is a dandy who would die of a rose in aromatic pain he had tried to have me assassinated three times in the course of the negotiation but of course we were friends in public and saluted each other in the most cordial and charming manner  the galeongee isor was alas for a bowstring has done for hima staunch supporter of the old school of turkish politics we dined with our fingers and had flaps of bread for plates the only innovation he admitted was the use of european liquors in which he indulged with great gusto he was an enormous eater amongst the dishes a very large one was placed before him of a lamb dressed in its wool stuffed with prunes garlic assafoetida capsicums and other condiments the most abominable mixture that ever mortal smelt or tasted the galeongee ate of this hugely and pursuing the eastern fashion insisted on helping his friends right and left and when he came to a particularly spicy morsel would push it with his own hands into his guests very mouths  i never shall forget the look of poor diddloff when his excellency rolling up a large quantity of this into a ball and exclaiming buk buk it is very good administered the horrible bolus to diddloff the russians eyes rolled dreadfully as he received it he swallowed it with a grimace that i thought must precede a convulsion and seizing a bottle next him which he thought was sauterne but which turned out to be french brandy he drank off nearly a pint before he know his error it finished him he was carried away from the diningroom almost dead and laid out to cool in a summerhouse on the bosphorus  when it came to my turn i took down the condiment with a smile said bismillah licked my lips with easy gratification and when the next dish was served made up a ball myself so dexterously and popped it down the old galeongees mouth with so much grace that his heart was won russia was put out of court at once and the treaty of kabobanople was signed as for diddloff all was over with him he was recalled to st petersburg and sir roderick murchison saw him under the no 3967 working in the ural mines  the moral of this tale i need not say is that there are many disagreeable things in society which you are bound to take down and to do so with a smiling face    chapter iithe snob royal  long since at the commencement of the reign of her present gracious majesty it chanced on a fair summer evening as mr james would say that three or four young cavaliers were drinking a cup of wine after dinner at the hostelry called the kings arms kept by mistress anderson in the royal village of kensington twas a balmy evening and the wayfarers looked out on a cheerful scene the tall elms of the ancient gardens were in full leaf and countless chariots of the nobility of england whirled by to the neighbouring palace where princely sussex whose income latterly only allowed him to give teaparties entertained his royal niece at a state banquet when the caroches of the nobles had set down their owners at the banquethall their varlets and servitors came to quaff a flagon of nutbrown ale in the kings arms gardens hard by we watched these fellows from our lattice by saint boniface twas a rare sight  the tulips in mynheer van duncks gardens were not more gorgeous than the liveries of these piecoated retainers all the flowers of the field bloomed in their ruffled bosoms all the hues of the rainbow gleamed in their plush breeches and the longcaned ones walked up and down the garden with that charming solemnity that delightful quivering swagger of the calves which has always had a frantic fascination for us the walk was not wide enough for them as the shoulderknots strutted up and down it in canary and crimson and light blue  suddenly in the midst of their pride a little bell was rung a side door opened and after setting down their royal mistress her majestys own crimson footmen with epaulets and black plushes came in  it was pitiable to see the other poor johns slink off at this arrival not one of the honest private plushes could stand up before the royal flunkeys they left the walk they sneaked into dark holes and drank their beer in silence the royal plush kept possession of the garden until the royal plush dinner was announced when it retired and we heard from the pavilion where they dined conservative cheers and speeches and kentish fires the other flunkeys we never saw more  my dear flunkeys so absurdly conceited at one moment and so abject at the next are but the types of their masters in this world he who meanly admires mean things is a snobperhaps that is a safe definition of the character  and this is why i have with the utmost respect ventured to place the snob royal at the head of my list causing all others to give way before him as the flunkeys before the royal representative in kensington gardens to say of such and such a gracious sovereign that he is a snob is but to say that his majesty is a man kings too are men and snobs in a country where snobs are in the majority a prime one surely cannot be unfit to govern with us they have succeeded to admiration  for instance james i was a snob and a scotch snob than which the world contains no more offensive creature he appears to have had not one of the good qualities of a manneither courage nor generosity nor honesty nor brains but read what the great divines and doctors of england said about him charles ii his grandson was a rogue but not a snob whilst louis xiv his old squaretoes of a contemporarythe great worshipper of bigwiggeryhas always struck me as a most undoubted and royal snob  i will not however take instances from our own country of royal snobs but refer to a neighbouring kingdom that of brentfordand its monarch the late great and lamented gorgius iv with the same humility with which the footmen at the kings arms gave way before the plush royal the aristocracy of the brentford nation bent down and truckled before gorgius and proclaimed him the first gentleman in europe and its a wonder to think what is the gentlefolks opinion of a gentleman when they gave gorgius such a title  what is it to be a gentleman is it to be honest to be gentle to be generous to be brave to be wise and possessing all these qualities to exercise them in the most graceful outward manner ought a gentleman to be a loyal son a true husband and honest father ought his life to be decenthis bills to be paidhis tastes to be high and eleganthis aims in life lofty and noble in a word ought not the biography of a first gentleman in europe to be of such a nature that it might be read in young ladies schools with advantage and studied with profit in the seminaries of young gentlemen i put this question to all instructors of youthto mrs ellis and the women of england to all schoolmasters from doctor hawtrey down to mr squeers i conjure up before me an awful tribunal of youth and innocence attended by its venerable instructors like the ten thousand redcheeked charitychildren in saint pauls sitting in judgment and gorgius pleading his cause in the midst out of court out of court fat old florizel beadles turn out that bloated pimplefaced manif gorgius must have a statue in the new palace which the brentford nation is building it ought to be set up in the flunkeys hall he should be represented cutting out a coat in which art he is said to have excelled he also invented maraschino punch a shoebuckle this was in the vigour of his youth and the prime force of his invention and a chinese pavilion the most hideous building in the world he could drive a fourinhand very nearly as well as the brighton coachman could fence elegantly and it is said played the fiddle well and he smiled with such irresistible fascination that persons who were introduced into his august presence became his victims body and soul as a rabbit becomes the prey of a great big boaconstrictor  i would wager that if mr widdicomb were by a revolution placed on the throne of brentford people would be equally fascinated by his irresistibly majestic smile and tremble as they knelt down to kiss his hand if he went to dublin they would erect an obelisk on the spot where he first landed as the paddylanders did when gorgius visited them we have all of us read with delight that story of the kings voyage to haggisland where his presence inspired such a fury of loyalty and where the most famous man of the countrythe baron of bradwardinecoming on board the royal yacht and finding a glass out of which gorgius had drunk put it into his coatpocket as an inestimable relic and went ashore in his boat again but the baron sat down upon the glass and broke it and cut his coattails very much and the inestimable relic was lost to the world for ever o noble bradwardine what oldworld superstition could set you on your knees before such an idol as that  if you want to moralise upon the mutability of human affairs go and see the figure of gorgius in his real identical robes at the waxworkadmittance one shilling children and flunkeys sixpence go and pay sixpence    chapter iiithe influence of the aristocracy on snobs  last sunday week being at church in this city and the service just ended i heard two snobs conversing about the parson one was asking the other who the clergyman was he is mr soandso the second snob answered domestic chaplain to the earl of whatdyecallim oh is he said the first snob with a tone of indescribable satisfactionthe parsons orthodoxy and identity were at once settled in this snobs mind he knew no more about the earl than about the chaplain but he took the latters character upon the authority of the former and went home quite contented with his reverence like a little truckling snob  this incident gave me more matter for reflection even than the sermon and wonderment at the extent and prevalence of lordolatory in this country what could it matter to snob whether his reverence were chaplain to his lordship or not what peerageworship there is all through this free country how we are all implicated in it and more or less down on our kneesand with regard to the great subject on hand i think that the influence of the peerage upon snobbishness has been more remarkable than that of any other institution the increase encouragement and maintenance of snobs are among the priceless services as lord john russell says which we owe to the nobility  it cant be otherwise a man becomes enormously rich or he jobs successfully in the aid of a minister or he wins a great battle or executes a treaty or is a clever lawyer who makes a multitude of fees and ascends the bench and the country rewards him for ever with a gold coronet with more or less balls or leaves and a title and a rank as legislator your merits are so great says the nation that your children shall be allowed to reign over us in a manner it does not in the least matter that your eldest son be a fool we think your services so remarkable that he shall have the reversion of your honours when death vacates your noble shoes if you are poor we will give you such a sum of money as shall enable you and the eldestborn of your race for ever to live in fat and splendour it is our wish that there should be a race set apart in this happy country who shall hold the first rank have the first prizes and chances in all government jobs and patronages we cannot make all your dear children peersthat would make peerage common and crowd the house of lords uncomfortablybut the young ones shall have everything a government can give they shall get the pick of all the places they shall be captains and lieutenantcolonels at nineteen when hoaryheaded old lieutenants are spending thirty years at drill they shall command ships at oneandtwenty and veterans who fought before they were born and as we are eminently a free people and in order to encourage all men to do their duty we say to any man of any rankget enormously rich make immense fees as a lawyer or great speeches or distinguish yourself and win battlesand you even you shall come into the privileged class and your children shall reign naturally over ours  how can we help snobbishness with such a prodigious national institution erected for its worship how can we help cringing to lords flesh and blood cant do otherwise what man can withstand this prodigious temptation inspired by what is called a noble emulation some people grasp at honours and win them others too weak or mean blindly admire and grovel before those who have gained them others not being able to acquire them furiously hate abuse and envy there are only a few bland and notintheleastconceited philosophers who can behold the state of society viz toadyism organisedbase manandmammon worship instituted by command of lawsnobbishness in a word perpetuatedand mark the phenomenon calmly and of these calm moralists is there one i wonder whose heart would not throb with pleasure if he could be seen walking arminarm with a couple of dukes down pall mall no it is impossible in our condition of society not to be sometimes a snob  on one hand it encourages the commoner to be snobbishly mean and the noble to be snobbishly arrogant when a noble marchioness writes in her travels about the hard necessity under which steamboat travellers labour of being brought into contact with all sorts and conditions of people implying that a fellowship with gods creatures is disagreeable to to her ladyship who is their superiorwhen i say the marchioness of  writes in this fashion we must consider that out of her natural heart it would have been impossible for any woman to have had such a sentiment but that the habit of truckling and cringing which all who surround her have adopted towards this beautiful and magnificent ladythis proprietor of so many black and other diamondshas really induced her to believe that she is the superior of the world in general and that people are not to associate with her except awfully at a distance i recollect being once at the city of grand cairo through which a european royal prince was passing indiawards one night at the inn there was a great disturbance a man had drowned himself in the well hard by all the inhabitants of the hotel came bustling into the court and amongst others your humble servant who asked of a certain young man the reason of the disturbance how was i to know that this young gent was a prince he had not his crown and sceptre on he was dressed in a white jacket and felt hat but he looked surprised at anybody speaking to him answered an unintelligible monosyllable andbeckoned his aiddecamp to come and speak to me it is our fault not that of the great that they should fancy themselves so far above us if you will fling yourself under the wheels juggernaut will go over you depend upon it and if you and i my dear friend had kotow performed before us every dayfound people whenever we appeared grovelling in slavish adoration we should drop into the airs of superiority quite naturally and accept the greatness with which the world insisted upon endowing us  here is an instance out of lord ls travels of that calm goodnatured undoubting way in which a great man accepts the homage of his inferiors after making some profound and ingenious remarks about the town of brussells his lordship saysstaying some day at the hotel de belle vue a greatly overrated establishment and not nearly as comfortable as the hotel de francei made acquaintance with dr l the physician of the mission he was desirous of doing the honours of the place to me and he ordered for us a diner en gourmand at the chief restaurateurs maintaining it surpassed the rocher at paris six or eight partook of the entertainment and we all agreed it was infinitely inferior to the paris display and much more extravagant so much for the copy  and so much for the gentleman who gave the dinner dr l desirous to do his lordship the honour of the place feasts him with the best victuals money can procureand my lord finds the entertainment extravagant and inferior extravagant it was not extravagant to himinferior mr l did his best to satisfy those noble jaws and my lord receives the entertainment and dismisses the giver with a rebuke it is like a threetailed pasha grumbling about an unsatisfactory backsheesh  but how should it be otherwise in a country where lordolatry is part of our creed and where our children are brought up to respect the peerage as the englishmans second bible    chapter ivthe court circular and its influence on snobs  example is the best of precepts so let us begin with a true and authentic story showing how young aristocratic snobs are reared and how early their snobbishness may be made to bloom a beautiful and fashionable ladypardon gracious madam that your story should be made public but it is so moral that it ought to be known to the universal worldtold me that in her early youth she had a little acquaintance who is now indeed a beautiful and fashionable lady too in mentioning miss snobky daughter of sir snobby snobky whose presentation at court caused such a sensation need i say more  when miss snobky was so very young as to be in the nursery regions and to walk off early mornings in st jamess park protected by a french governess and followed by a huge hirsute flunkey in the canary coloured livery of the snobkys she used occasionally in these promenades to meet with young lord claude lollipop the marquis of sillabubs younger son in the very height of the season from some unexplained cause the snobkys suddenly determined upon leaving town miss snobky spoke to her female friend and confidante what will poor claude lollipop say when he hears of my absence asked the tenderhearted child  oh perhaps he wont hear of it answers the confidante  my dear he will read it in the papers replied the dear little fashionable rogue of seven years old she knew already her importance and how all the world of england how all the wouldbegenteel people how all the silverfork worshippers how all the tattlemongers how all the grocers ladies the tailors ladies the attorneys and merchants ladies and the people living at clapham and brunswick squarewho have no more chance of consorting with a snobky than my beloved reader has of dining with the emperor of chinayet watched the movements of the snobkys with interest and were glad to know when they came to london and left it  here is the account of miss snobkys dress and that of her mother lady snobky from the papers  miss snobky  habit de cour composed of a yellow nankeen illusion dress over a slip of rich peagreen corduroy trimmed en tablier with bouquets of brussels sprouts the body and sleeves handsomely trimmed with calimanco and festooned with a pink train and white radishes headdress carrots and lappets  lady snobky  costume de cour composed of a train of the most superb pekin bandannas elegantly trimmed with spangles tinfoil and redtape bodice and underdress of skyblue velveteen trimmed with bouffants and noeuds of bellpulls stomacher a muffin headdress a birds nest with a bird of paradise over a rich brass knocker en ferroniere this splendid costume by madame crinoline of regent street was the object of universal admiration  this is what you read oh mrs ellis oh mothers daughters aunts grandmothers of england this is the sort of writing which is put in the newspapers for you how can you help being the mothers daughters c of snobs so long as this balderdash is set before you  you stuff the little rosy foot of a chinese young lady of fashion into a slipper that is about the size of a saltcruet and keep the poor little toes there imprisoned and twisted up so long that the dwarfishness becomes irremediable later the foot would not expand to the natural size were you to give her a washingtub for a shoe and for all her life she has little feet and is a cripple oh my dear miss wiggins thank your stars that those beautiful feet of yoursthough i declare when you walk they are so small as to be almost invisiblethank your stars that society never so practised upon them but look around and see how many friends of ours in the highest circles have had their brains so prematurely and hopelessly pinched and distorted  how can you expect that those poor creatures are to move naturally when the world and their parents have mutilated them so cruelly as long as a court circular exists how the deuce are people whose names are chronicled in it ever to believe themselves the equals of the cringing race which daily reads that abominable trash i believe that ours is the only country in the world now where the court circular remains in full flourishwhere you read this day his royal highness prince pattypan was taken an airing in his gocart the princess pimminy was taken a drive attended by her ladies of honour and accompanied by her doll c we laugh at the solemnity with which saint simon announces that sa majeste se medicamente aujourdhui under our very noses the same folly is daily going on that wonderful and mysterious man the author of the court circular drops in with his budget at the newspaper offices every night i once asked the editor of a paper to allow me to lie in wait and see him  i am told that in a kingdom where there is a german kingconsort portugal it must be for the queen of that country married a german prince who is greatly admired and respected by the natives whenever the consort takes the diversion of shooting among the rabbitwarrens of cintra or the pheasantpreserve of mafra he has a keeper to load his guns as a matter of course and then they are handed to the nobleman his equerry and the nobleman hands them to the prince who blazes awaygives back the discharged gun to the nobleman who gives it to the keeper and so on but the prince wont take the gun from the hands of the loader  as long as this unnatural and monstrous etiquette continues snobs there must be the three persons engaged in this transaction are for the time being snobs  1 the keeperthe least snob of all because he is discharging his daily duty but he appears here as a snob that is to say in a position of debasement before another human being the prince with whom he is allowed to communicate through another party a free portuguese gamekeeper who professes himself to be unworthy to communicate directly with any person confesses himself to be a snob  2 the nobleman in waiting is a snob if it degrades the prince to receive the gun from the gamekeeper it is degrading to the nobleman in waiting to execute that service he acts as a snob towards the keeper whom he keeps from communication with the princea snob to the prince to whom he pays a degrading homage  3 the kingconsort of portugal is a snob for insulting fellowmen in this way theres no harm in his accepting the services of the keeper directly but indirectly he insults the service performed and the servants who perform it and therefore i say respectfully is a most undoubted though royal snob  and then you read in the diario do gobernoyesterday his majesty the king took the diversion of shooting the woods off cintra attended by colonel the honourable whiskerando sombrero his majesty returned to the necessidades to lunch at c c  oh that court circular once more i exclaim  down with the court circularthat engine and propagator of snobbishness i promise to subscribe for a year to any daily paper that shall come out without a court circularwere it the morning herald itself when i read that trash i rise in my wrath i feel myself disloyal a regicide a member of the calfs head club the only court circular story which ever pleased me was that of the king of spain who in great part was roasted because there was not time for the prime minister to command the lord chamberlain to desire the grand gold stick to order the first page in waiting to bid the chief of the flunkeys to request the housemaid of honour to bring up a pail of water to put his majesty out  i am like the pasha of three tails to whom the sultan sends his court circular the bowstring  it chokes me may its usage be abolished for ever    chapter vwhat snobs admire  now let us consider how difficult it is even for great men to escape from being snobs it is very well for the reader whose fine feelings are disgusted by the assertion that kings princes lords are snobs to say you are confessedly a snob yourself in professing to depict snobs it is only your own ugly mug which you are copying with a narcissuslike conceit and fatuity but i shall pardon this explosion of illtemper on the part of my constant reader reflecting upon the misfortune of his birth and country it is impossible for any briton perhaps not to be a snob in some degree if people can be convinced of this fact an immense point is gained surely if i have pointed out the disease let us hope that other scientific characters may discover the remedy  if you who are a person of the middle ranks of life are a snobyou whom nobody flatters particularly you who have no toadies you whom no cringing flunkeys or shopmen bow out of doors you whom the policeman tells to move on you who are jostled in the crowd of this world and amongst the snobs our brethren consider how much harder it is for a man to escape who has not your advantages and is all his life long subject to adulation the butt of meanness consider how difficult it is for the snobs idol not to be a snob  as i was discoursing with my friend eugenio in this impressive way lord buckram passed us the son of the marquis of bagwig and knocked at the door of the family mansion in red lion square his noble father and mother occupied as everybody knows distinguished posts in the courts of late sovereigns the marquis was lord of the pantry and her ladyship lady of the powder closet to queen charlotte buck as i call him for we are very familiar gave me a nod as he passed and i proceeded to show eugenio how it was impossible that this nobleman should not be one of ourselves having been practised upon by snobs all his life  his parents resolved to give him a public education and sent him to school at the earliest possible period the reverend otto rose dd principal of the preparatory academy for young noblemen and gentlemen richmond lodge took this little lord in hand and fell down and worshipped him he always introduced him to fathers and mothers who came to visit their children at the school he referred with pride and pleasure to the most noble the marquis of bagwig as one of the kind friends and patrons of his seminary he made lord buckram a bait for such a multiplicity of pupils that a new wing was built to richmond lodge and thirtyfive new little white dimity beds were added to the establishment mm rose used to take out the little lord in the onehorse chaise with her when she paid visits until the rectors lady and the surgeons wife almost died with envy his own son and lord buckram having been discovered robbing an orchard together the doctor flogged his own flesh and blood most unmercifully for leading the young lord astray he parted from him with tears there was always a letter directed to the most noble the marquis ef bagwig on the doctors study table when any visitors were received by him  at eton a great deal of snobbishness was thrashed out of lord buckram and he was birched with perfect impartiality even there however a select band of sucking tufthunters followed him young croesus lent him threeandtwenty brannew sovereigns out of his fathers bank young snaily did his exercises for him and tried to know him at home but young bull licked him in a fight of fiftyfive minutes and he was caned several times with great advantage for not sufficiently polishing his master smiths shoes boys are not all toadies in the morning of life  but when he went to the university crowds of toadies sprawled over him the tutors toadied him the fellows in hall paid him great clumsy compliments the dean never remarked his absence from chapel or heard any noise issuing from his rooms a number of respectable young fellows it is among the respectable the baker street class that snobbishness flourishes more than among any set of people in englanda number of these clung to him like leeches there was no end now to croesuss loans of money and buckram couldnt ride out with the hounds but snaily a timid creature by nature was in the field and would take any leap at which his friend chose to ride young rose came up to the same college having been kept back for that express purpose by his father he spent a quarters allowance in giving buckram a single dinner but he knew there was always pardon for him for extravagance in such a cause and a tenpound note always came to him from home when he mentioned buckrams name in a letter what wild visions entered the brains of mrs podge and miss podge the wife and daughter of the principal of lord buckrams college i dont know but that reverend old gentleman was too profound a flunkey by nature ever for one minute to think that a child of his could marry a nobleman he therefore hastened on his daughters union with professor crab  when lord buckram after taking his honorary degree for alma mater is a snob too and truckles to a lord like the restwhen lord buckram went abroad to finish his education you all know what dangers he ran and what numbers of caps were set at him lady leach and her daughters followed him from paris to rome and from rome to badenbaden miss leggitt burst into tears before his face when he announced his determination to quit naples and fainted on the neck of her mamma captain macdragon of macdragonstown county tipperary called upon him to explene his intintions with respect to his sisther miss amalia macdragon of macdragonstown and proposed to shoot him unless he married that spotless and beautiful young creature who was afterwards led to the altar by mr muff at cheltenham if perseverance and forty thousand pounds down could have tempted him miss lydia croesus would certainly have been lady buckram count towrowski was glad to take her with half the meney as all the genteel world knows  and now perhaps the reader is anxious to know what sort of a man this is who wounded so many ladies hearts and who has been such a prodigious favourite with men if we were to describe him it would be personal besides it really does not matter in the least what sort of a man he is or what his personal qualities are  suppose he is a young nobleman of a literary turn and that he published poems ever so foolish and feeble the snobs would purchase thousands of his volumes the publishers who refused my passionflowers and my grand epic at any price would give him his own suppose he is a nobleman of a jovial turn and has a fancy for wrenching off knockers frequenting ginshops and half murdering policemen the public will sympathize goodnaturedly with his amusements and say he is a hearty honest fellow suppose he is fond of play and the turf and has a fancy to be a blackleg and occasionally condescends to pluck a pigeon at cards the public will pardon him and many honest people will court him as they would court a housebreaker if he happened to be a lord suppose he is an idiot yet by the glorious constitution he is good enough to govern us suppose he is an honest highminded gentleman so much the better for himself but he may be an ass and yet respected or a ruffian and yet be exceedingly popular or a rogue and yet excuses will be found for him snobs will still worship him male snobs will do him honour and females look kindly upon him however hideous he may be    chapter vion some respectable snobs  having received a great deal of obloquy for dragging monarchs princes and the respected nobility into the snob category i trust to please everybody in the present chapter by stating my firm opinion that it is among the respectable classes of this vast and happy empire that the greatest profusion of snobs is to be found i pace down my beloved baker street i am engaged on a life of baker founder of this celebrated street i walk in harley street where every other house has a hatchment wimpole street that is as cheerful as the catacombsa dingy mausoleum of the genteeli rove round regents park where the plaster is patching off the house walls where methodist preachers are holding forth to three little children in the green inclosures and puffy valetudinarians are cantering in the solitary mudi thread the doubtful zigzags of may fair where mrs kitty lorimers brougham may be seen drawn up next door to old lady lollipops belozenged family coachi roam through belgravia that pale and polite district where all the inhabitants look prim and correct and the mansions are painted a faint whitybrown i lose myself in the new squares and terraces of the brilliant brannew bayswaterandtyburnjunction line and in one and all of these districts the same truth comes across me i stop before any house at hazard and say o house you are inhabitedo knocker you are knocked ato undressed flunkey sunning your lazy calves as you lean against the iron railings you are paidby snobs it is a tremendous thought that and it is almost sufficient to drive a benevolent mind to madness to think that perhaps there is not one in ten of those houses where the peerage does not lie on the drawingroom table considering the harm that foolish lying book does i would have all the copies of it burned as the barber burned all quixotes books of humbugging chivalry  look at this grand house in the middle of the square the earl of loughcorrib lives there he has fifty thousand a year a dejeuner dansant given at his house last week cost who knows how much the mere flowers for the room and bouquets for the ladies cost four hundred pounds that man in drab trousers coming crying down the stops is a dun lord loughcorrib has ruined him and wont see him that is his lordship peeping through the blind of his study at him now go thy ways loughcorrib thou art a snob a heartless pretender a hypocrite of hospitality a rogue who passes forged notes upon societybut i am growing too eloquent  you see that nice house no 23 where a butchers boy is ringing the areabell he has three muttonchops in his tray they are for the dinner of a very different and very respectable family for lady susan scraper and her daughters miss scraper and miss emily scraper the domestics luckily for them are on board wagestwo huge footmen in light blue and canary a fat steady coachman who is a methodist and a butler who would never have stayed in the family but that he was orderly to general scraper when the general distinguished himself at walcheren his widow sent his portrait to the united service club and it is hung up in one of the back dressingclosets there he is represented at a parlour window with red curtains in the distance is a whirlwind in which cannon are firing off and he is pointing to a chart on which are written the words walcheren tobago  lady susan is as everybody knows by referring to the british bible a daughter of the great and good earl bagwig before mentioned she thinks everything belonging to her the greatest and best in the world the first of men naturally are the buckrams her own race then follow in rank the scrapers the general was the greatest general his eldest son scraper buckram scraper is at present the greatest and best his second son the next greatest and best and herself the paragon of women  indeed she is a most respectable and honourable lady she goes to church of course she would fancy the church in danger if she did not she subscribes to church and parish charities and is a directress of meritorious charitable institutionsof queen charlottes lyingin hospital the washerwomens asylum the british drummers daughters home c she is a model of a matron  the tradesman never lived who could say that he was not paid on the quarterday the beggars of her neighbourhood avoid her like a pestilence for while she walks out protected by john that domestic has always two or three mendicity tickets ready for deserving objects ten guineas a year will pay all her charities there is no respectable lady in all london who gets her name more often printed for such a sum of money  those three muttonchops which you see entering at the kitchendoor will be served on the familyplate at seven oclock this evening the huge footman being present and the butler in black and the crest and coatofarms of the scrapers blazing everywhere i pity miss emily scrapershe is still youngyoung and hungry is it a fact that she spends her pocketmoney in buns malicious tongues say so but she has very little to spare for buns the poor little hungry soul for the fact is that when the footmen and the ladies maids and the fat coachhorses which are jobbed and the six dinnerparties in the season and the two great solemn eveningparties and the rent of the big house and the journey to an english or foreign wateringplace for the autumn are paid my ladys income has dwindled away to a very small sum and she is as poor as you or i  you would not think it when you saw her big carriage rattling up to the drawingroom and caught a glimpse of her plumes lappets and diamonds waving over her ladyships sandy hair and majestical hooked noseyou would not think it when you hear lady susan scrapers carriage bawled out at midnight so as to disturb all belgraviayou would not think it when she comes rustling into church the obsequious john behind with the bag of prayerbooks is it possible you would say that so grand and awful a personage as that can be hardup for money alas so it is  she never heard such a word as snob i will engage in this wicked and vulgar world and o stars and garters how she would start if she heard that sheshe as solemn as minervashe as chaste as diana without that heathen goddesss unladylike propensity for fieldsportsthat she too was a snob  a snob she is as long as she sets that prodigious value upon herself upon her name upon her outward appearance and indulges in that intolerable pomposity as long as she goes parading abroad like solomon in all his glory as long as she goes to bedas i believe she doeswith a turban and a bird of paradise in it and a court train to her nightgown as long as she is so insufferably virtuous and condescending as long as she does not cut at least one of those footmen down into muttonchops for the benefit of the young ladies  i had my notions of her from my old schoolfellowher son sydney scrapera chancery barrister without any practicethe most placid polite and genteel of snobs who never exceeded his allowance of two hundred a year and who may be seen any evening at the oxford and cambridge club simpering over the quarterly review in the blameless enjoyment of his halfpint of port    chapter viion some respectable snobs  look at the next house to lady susan scrapers the first mansion with the awning over the door that canopy will be let down this evening for the comfort of the friends of sir alured and lady s de mogyns whose parties are so much admired by the public and the givers themselves  peachcoloured liveries laced with silver and peagreen plush inexpressibles render the de mogyns flunkeys the pride of the ring when they appear in hyde park where lady de mogyns as she sits upon her satin cushions with her dwarf spaniel in her arms bows to the very selectest of the genteel times are altered now with mary anne or as she calls herself marian de mogyns  she was the daughter of captain flack of the rathdrum fencibles who crossed with his regiment over from ireland to caermarthenshire ever so many years ago and defended wales from the corsican invader the rathdrums were quartered at pontydwdlm where marian wooed and won her de mogyns a young banker in the place his attentions to miss flack at a race ball were such that her father said de mogyns must either die on the field of honour or become his soninlaw he preferred marriage his name was muggins then and his fathera flourishing banker armycontractor smuggler and general jobberalmost disinherited him on account of this connection  there is a story that muggins the elder was made a baronet for having lent money to a ryl prsnge i do not believe it the ryl family always paid their debts from the prince of wales downwards  howbeit to his lifes end he remained simple sir thomas muggins representing pontydwdlm in parliament for many years after the war the old banker died in course of time and to use the affectionate phrase common on such occasions cut up prodigiously well his son alfred smith mogyns succeeded to the main portion of his wealth and to his titles and the bloody hand of his scutcheon it was not for many years after that he appeared as sir alured mogyns smyth de mogyns with a genealogy found out for him by the editor of flukes peerage and which appears as follows in that workde mogynssir alured mogyns smyth second baronet this gentleman is a representative of one of the most ancient families of wales who trace their descent until it is lost in the mists of antiquity a genealogical tree beginning with shem is in the possession of the family and is stated by a legend of many thousand years date to have been drawn on papyrus by a grandson of the patriarch himself be this as it may there can be no doubt of the immense antiquity of the race of mogyns  in the time of boadicea hogyn mogyn of the hundred beeves was a suitor and a rival of caractacus for the hand of that princess he was a person gigantic in stature and was slain by suetonius in the battle which terminated the liberties of britain from him descended directly the princes of pontydwdlm mogyn of the golden harp see the mabinogion of lady charlotte guest bogynmerodacapmogyn the black fiend son of mogyn and a long list of bards and warriors celebrated both in wales and armorica the independent princes of mogyn long held out against the ruthless kings of england until finally gam mogyns made his submission to prince henry son of henry iv and under the name of sir david gam de mogyns was distinguished at the battle of agincourt  from him the present baronet is descended and here the descent follows in order until it comes to thomas muggins first baronet of pontydwdlm castle for 23 years member of parliament for that borough who had issue alured mogyns smyth the present baronet who married marian daughter of the late general p flack of ballyflack in the kingdom of ireland of the counts flack of the h r empire sir alured has

cresta tomtit rampant regardant mottoung roy ung mogyns  it was long before lady de mogyns shone as a star in the fashionable world at first poor muggins was the in the hands of the flacks the clancys the tooles the shanahans his wifes irish relations and whilst he was yet but heirapparent his house overflowed with claret and the national nectar for the benefit of hibernian relatives tom tufto absolutely left the street in which they lived in london because he said it was infected with such a confounded smell of whisky from the house of those iwish people  it was abroad that they learned to be genteel they pushed into all foreign courts and elbowed their way into the halls of ambassadors they pounced upon the stray nobility and seized young lords travelling with their bearleaders they gave parties at naples rome and paris they got a royal prince to attend their soirees at the latter place and it was here that they first appeared under the name of de mogyns which they bear with such splendour to this day  all sorts of stories are told of the desperate efforts made by the indomitable lady de mogyns to gain the place she now occupies and those of my beloved readers who live in middle life and are unacquainted with the frantic struggles the wicked feuds the intrigues cabals and disappointments which as i am given to understand reign in the fashionable world may bless their stars that they at least are not fashionable snobs the intrigues set afoot by the de mogyns to get the duchess of buckskin to her parties would strike a talleyrand with admiration she had a brain fever after being disappointed of an invitation to lady aldermanburys the dansant and would have committed suicide but for a ball at windsor i have the following story from my noble friend lady clapperclaw herselflady kathleen oshaughnessy that was and daughter of the earl of turfanthunder  when that odious disguised irishwoman lady muggins was struggling to take her place in the world and was bringing out her hidjous daughter blanche said old lady clapperclawmarian has a humpback and doesnt show but shes the only lady in the familywhen that wretched polly muggins was bringing out blanche with her radish of a nose and her carrots of ringlets and her turnip for a face she was most anxiousas her father had been a cowboy on my fathers landto be patronized by us and asked me pointblank in the midst of a silence at count volauvents the french ambassadors dinner why i had not sent her a card for my ball  because my rooms are already too full and your ladyship would be crowded inconveniently says i indeed she takes up as much room as an elephant besides i wouldnt have her and that was flat  i thought my answer was a settler to her but the next day she comes weeping to my armsdear lady clapperclaw says she its not for me i ask it for my blessed blanche a young creature in her first season and not at your ball my tender child will pine and die of vexation i dont want to come i will stay at home to nurse sir alured in the gout mrs bolster is going i know she will be blanches chaperon  you wouldnt subscribe for the rathdrum blanket and potato fund you who come out of the parish says i and whose grandfather honest man kept cows there  will twenty guineas be enough dearest lady clapperclaw  twenty guineas is sufficient says i and she paid them so i said blanche may come but not you mind and she left me with a world of thanks  would you believe itwhen my ball came the horrid woman made her appearance with her daughter  didnt i tell you not to come said i in a mighty passion what would the world have said cries my lady muggins my carriage is gone for sir alured to the club let me stay only ten minutes dearest lady clapperclaw  well as you are here madam you may stay and get your supper i answered and so left her and never spoke a word more to her all night  and now screamed out old lady clapperclaw clapping her hands and speaking with more brogue than ever what do you think after all my kindness to her the wicked vulgar odious impudent upstart of s cowboys granddaughter has doneshe cut me yesterday in hy park and hasnt sent me a ticket for her ball tonight though they say prince george is to be there  yes such is the fact in the race of fashion the resolute and active de mogyns has passed the poor old clapperclaw her progress in gentility may be traced by the sets of friends whom she has courted and made and cut and left behind her she has struggled so gallantly for polite reputation that she has won it pitilessly kicking down the ladder as she advanced degree by degree  irish relations were first sacrificed she made her father dine in the stewards room to his perfect contentment and would send sir alured thither likewise but that he is a peg on which she hopes to hang her future honours and is after all paymaster of her daughters fortunes he is meek and content he has been so long a gentleman that he is used to it and acts the part of governor very well in the daytime he goes from the union to arthurs and from arthurs to the union he is a dead hand at piquet and loses a very comfortable maintenance to some young fellows at whist at the travellers  his son has taken his fathers seat in parliament and has of course joined young england he is the only man in the country who believes in the de mogynses and sighs for the days when a de mogyns led the van of battle he has written a little volume of spoony puny poems he wears a lock of the hair of laud the confessor and martyr and fainted when he kissed the popes toe at rome he sleeps in white kidgloves and commits dangerous excesses upon green tea    chapter viiigreat city snobs  there is no disguising the fact that this series of papers is making a prodigious sensation among all classes in this empire notes of admiration  of interrogation  of remonstrance approval or abuse come pouring into mr punchs box we have been called to task for betraying the secrets of three different families of de mogyns no less than four lady scrapers have been discovered and young gentlemen are quite shy of ordering halfapint of port and simpering over the quarterly review at the club lest they should be mistaken for sydney scraper esq what can be your antipathy to baker street asks some fair remonstrant evidently writing from that quarter  why only attack the aristocratic snobs says one estimable correspondent are not the snobbish snobs to have their turnpitch into the university snobs writes an indignant gentleman who spelt elegant with two isshow up the clerical snob suggests anotherbeing at meurices hotel paris some time since some wag hints i saw lord b leaning out of the window with his boots in his hand and bawling out garcon cirezmoi ces bottes oughtnt he to be brought in among the snobs  no far from it if his lordships boots are dirty it is because he is lord b and walks there is nothing snobbish in having only one pair of boots or a favourite pair and certainly nothing snobbish in desiring to have them cleaned lord b in so doing performed a perfectly natural and gentlemanlike action for which i am so pleased with him that i have had him designed in a favourable and elegant attitude and put at the head of this chapter in the place of honour no we are not personal in these candid remarks as phidias took the pick of a score of beauties before he completed a venus so have we to examine perhaps a thousand snobs before one is expressed upon paper  great city snobs are the next in the hierarchy and ought to be considered but here is a difficulty the great city snob is commonly most difficult of access unless you are a capitalist you cannot visit him in the recesses of his bank parlour in lombard street unless you are a sprig of nobility there is little hope of seeing him at home in a great city snob firm there is generally one partner whose name is down for charities and who frequents exeter hall you may catch a glimpse of another a scientific city snob at my lord ns soirees or the lectures of the london institution of a third a city snob of taste at pictureauctions at private views of exhibitions or at the opera or the philharmonic but intimacy is impossible in most cases with this grave pompous and awful being  a mere gentleman may hope to sit at almost anybodys tableto take his place at my lord dukes in the countryto dance a quadrille at buckingham palace itselfbeloved lady wilhelmina wagglewiggle do you recollect the sensation we made at the ball of our late adored sovereign queen caroline at brandenburg house hammersmith but the city snobs doors are for the most part closed to him and hence all that one knows of this great class is mostly from hearsay  in other countries of europe the banking snob is more expansive and communicative than with us and receives all the world into his circle for instance everybody knows the princely hospitalities of the scharlaschild family at paris naples frankfort c they entertain all the world even the poor at their fetes prince polonia at rome and his brother the duke of strachino are also remarkable for their hospitalities i like the spirit of the firstnamed nobleman titles not costing much in the roman territory he has had the head clerk of the bankinghouse made a marquis and his lordship will screw a bajocco out of you in exchange as dexterously as any commoner could do it is a comfort to be able to gratify such grandees with a farthing or two it makes the poorest man feel that he can do good the polonias have intermarried with the greatest and most ancient families of rome and you see their heraldic cognizance a mushroom or on an azure field quartered in a hundred places in the city with the arms of the colonnas and dorias  city snobs have the same mania for aristocratic marriages i like to see such i am of a savage and envious naturei like to see these two humbugs which dividing as they do the social empire of this kingdom between them hate each other naturally making truce and uniting for the sordid interests of either i like to see an old aristocrat swelling with pride of race the descendant of illustrious norman robbers whose blood has been pure for centuries and who looks down upon common englishmen as a free american does on a niggeri like to see old stiffneck obliged to bow down his head and swallow his infernal pride and drink the cup of humiliation poured out by pump and aldgates butler pump and aldgate says he your grandfather was a bricklayer and his hod is still kept in the bank your pedigree begins in a workhouse mine can be dated from all the royal palaces of europe i came over with the conqueror i am own cousin to charles martel orlando furioso philip augustus peter the cruel and frederick barbarossa i quarter the royal arms of brentford in my coat i despise you but i want money and i will sell you my beloved daughter blanche stiffneck for a hundred thousand pounds to pay off my mortgages let your son marry her and she shall become lady blanche pump and aldgate  old pump and aldgate clutches at the bargain and a comfortable thing it is to think that birth can be bought for money so you learn to value it why should we who dont possess it set a higher store on it than those who do perhaps the best use of that book the peerage is to look down the list and see how many have bought and sold birthhow poor sprigs of nobility somehow sell themselves to rich city snobs daughters how rich city snobs purchase noble ladiesand so to admire the double baseness of the bargain  old pump and aldgate buys the article and pays the money the sale of the girls person is blessed by a bishop at st georges hanover square and next year you read at roehampton on saturday the lady blanche pump of a son and heir  after this interesting event some old acquaintance who saw young pump in the parlour at the bank in the city said to him familiarly hows your wife pump my boy  mr pump looked exceedingly puzzled and disgusted and after a pause said lady blanche pump is pretty well i thank you  oh i thought she was your wife said the familiar brute snooks wishing him goodbye and ten minutes after the story was all over the stock exchange where it is told when young pump appears to this very day  we can imagine the weary life this poor pump this martyr to mammon is compelled to undergo fancy the domestic enjoyments of a man who has a wife who scorns him who cannot see his own friends in his own house who having deserted the middle rank of life is not yet admitted to the higher but who is resigned to rebuffs and delay and humiliation contented to think that his son will be more fortunate  it used to be the custom of some very oldfashioned clubs in this city when a gentleman asked for change a guinea always to bring it to him in washed silver that which had passed immediately out of the hands of vulgar being considered as too coarse to soil a gentlemans fingers so when the city snobs money has been washed during a generation or so has been washed into estates and woods and castles and townmansions it is allowed to pass current as real aristocratic coin old pump sweeps a shop runs of messages becomes a confidential clerk and partner pump the second becomes chief of the house spins more and more money marries his son to an earls daughter pump tertius goes on with the bank but his chief business in life is to become the father of pump quartus who comes out a fullblown aristocrat and takes his seat as baron pumpington and his race rules hereditarily over this nation of snobs    chapter ixon some military snobs  as no society in the world is more agreeable than that of wellbred and wellinformed military gentlemen so likewise none is more insufferable than that of military snobs they are to be found of all grades from the general officer whose padded old breast twinkles over with a score of stars clasps and decorations to the budding cornet who is shaving for a beard and has just been appointed to the saxecoburg lancers  i have always admired that dispensation of rank in our country which sets up this lastnamed little creature who was flogged only last week because he could not spell to command great whiskered warriors who have faced all dangers of climate and battle which because he has money to lodge at the agents will place him over the heads of men who have a thousand times more experience and desert and which in the course of time will bring him all the honours of his profession when the veteran soldier he commanded has got no other reward for his bravery than a berth in chelsea hospital and the veteran officer he superseded has slunk into shabby retirement and ends his disappointed life on a threadbare halfpay  when i read in the gazette such announcements as lieutenant and captain grig from the bombardier guards to be captain vice grizzle who retires i know what becomes of the peninsular grizzle i follow him in spirit to the humble country town where he takes up his quarters and occupies himself with the most desperate attempts to live like a gentleman on the stipend of half a tailors foreman and i picture to myself little grig rising from rank to rank skipping from one regiment to another with an increased grade in each avoiding disagreeable foreign service and ranking as a colonel at thirtyall because he has money and lord grigsby is his father who had the same luck before him grig must blush at first to give his orders to old men in every way his betters and as it is very difficult for a spoiled child to escape being selfish and arrogant so it is a very hard task indeed for this spoiled child of fortune not to be a snob  it must have often been a matter of wonder to the candid reader that the army the most enormous job of all our political institutions should yet work so well in the field and we must cheerfully give grig and his like the credit for courage which they display whenever occasion calls for it the dukes dandy regiments fought as well as any they said better than any but that is absurd the great duke himself was a dandy once and jobbed on as marlborough did before him but this only proves that dandies are brave as well as other britonsas all britons let us concede that the highborn grig rode into the entrenchments at sobraon as gallantly as corporal wallop the exploughboy  the times of war are more favourable to him than the periods of peace think of grigs life in the bombardier guards or the jackboot guards his marches from windsor to london from london to windsor from knightsbridge to regents park the idiotic services he has to perform which consist in inspecting the pipeclay of his company or the horses in the stable or bellowing out shoulder humps carry humps all which duties the very smallest intellect that ever belonged to mortal man would suffice to comprehend the professional duties of a footman are quite as difficult and various the redjackets who hold gentlemens horses in st jamess street could do the work just as well as those vacuous goodnatured gentlemanlike rickety little lieutenants who may be seen sauntering about pall mall in highheeled little boots or rallying round the standard of their regiment in the palace court at eleven oclock when the band plays did the beloved reader ever see one of the young fellows staggering under the flag or above all going through the operation of saluting it it is worth a walk to the palace to witness that magnificent piece of tomfoolery  i have had the honour of meeting once or twice an old gentleman whom i look upon to be a specimen of armytraining and who has served in crack regiments or commanded them all his life i allude to lieutenantgeneral the honourable sir george granby tufto kcb kts kh ksw c c his manners are irreproachable generally in society he is a perfect gentleman and a most thorough snob  a man cant help being a fool be he ever so old and sir george is a greater ass at sixtyeight than he was when he first entered the army at fifteen he distinguished himself everywhere his name is mentioned with praise in a score of gazettes he is the man in fact whose padded breast twinkling over with innumerable decorations has already been introduced to the reader it is difficult to say what virtues this prosperous gentleman possesses he never read a book in his life and with his purple old gouty fingers still writes a schoolboy hand he has reached old age and grey hairs without being the least venerable he dresses like an outrageously young man to the present moment and laces and pads his old carcass as if he were still handsome george tufto of 1800 he is selfish brutal passionate and a glutton it is curious to mark him at table and see him heaving in his waistband his little bloodshot eyes gloating over his meal he swears considerably in his talk and tells filthy garrison stories after dinner on account of his rank and his services people pay the bestarred and betitled old brute a sort of reverence and he looks down upon you and me and exhibits his contempt for us with a stupid and artless candour which is quite amusing to watch perhaps had he been bred to another profession he would not have been the disreputable old creature he now is but what other he was fit for none too incorrigibly idle and dull for any trade but this in which he has distinguished himself publicly as a good and gallant officer and privately for riding races drinking port fighting duels and seducing women he believes himself to be one of the most honourable and deserving beings in the world about waterloo place of afternoons you may see him tottering in his varnished boots and leering under the bonnets of the women who pass by when he dies of apoplexy the times will have a quarter of a column about his services and battlesfour lines of print will be wanted to describe his titles and orders aloneand the earth will cover one of the wickedest and dullest old wretches that ever strutted over it  lest it should be imagined that i am of so obstinate a misanthropic nature as to be satisfied with nothing i beg for the comfort of the forces to state my belief that the army is not composed of such persons as the above he has only been selected for the study of civilians and the military as a specimen of a prosperous and bloated army snob no when epaulets are not sold when corporal punishments are abolished and corporal smith has a chance to have his gallantry rewarded as well as that of lieutenant grig when there is no such rank as ensign and lieutenant the existence of which rank is an absurd anomaly and an insult upon all the rest of the army and should there be no war i should not be disinclined to be a majorgeneral myself  i have a little sheaf of army snobs in my portfolio but shall pause in my attack upon the forces till next week    chapter xmilitary snobs  walking in the park yesterday with my young friend tagg and discoursing with him upon the next number of the snob at the very nick of time who should pass us but two very good specimens of military snobsthe sporting military snob capt rag and the lurking or raffish military snob ensign famish indeed you are fully sure to meet them lounging on horseback about five oclock under the trees by the serpentine examining critically the inmates of the flashy broughams which parade up and down the ladys mile  tagg and rag are very well acquainted and so the former with that candour inseparable from intimate friendship told me his dear friends history captain rag is a small dapper northcountry man he went when quite a boy into a crack light cavalry regiment and by the time he got his troop had cheated all his brother officers so completely selling them lame horses for sound ones and winning their money by all manner of strange and ingenious contrivances that his colonel advised him to retire which he did without much reluctance accommodating a youngster who had just entered the regiment with a glandered charger at an uncommonly stiff figure  he has since devoted his time to billiards steeplechasing and the turf his headquarters are rummers in conduit street where he keeps his kit but he is ever on the move in the exercise of his vocation as a gentlemanjockey and gentlemanleg  according to bells life he is an invariable attendant at all races and an actor in most of them he rode the winner at leamington he was left for dead in a ditch a fortnight ago at harrow and yet there he was last week at the croix de berny pale and determined as ever astonishing the badauds of paris by the elegance of his seat and the neatness of his rig as he took a preliminary gallop on that vicious brute the disowned before starting for the french grand national  he is a regular attendant at the corner where he compiles a limited but comfortable libretto during season he rides often in the park mounted on a clever wellbred pony he is to be seen escorting celebrated horsewoman fanny highflyer or in confidential converse with lord thimblerig the eminent handicapper  he carefully avoids decent society and would rather dine off a steak at the one tun with sam snaffle the jockey captain orourke and two or three other notorious turf robbers than with the choicest company in london he likes to announce at rummers that he is going to run down and spend his saturday and sunday in a friendly way with hocus the leg at his little box near epsom where if report speak true many rummish plants are concocted  he does not play billiards often and never in public but when he does play he always contrives to get hold of a good flat and never leaves him till he has done him uncommonly brown he has lately been playing a good deal with famish  when he makes his appearance in the drawingroom which occasionally happens at a huntmeeting or a raceball he enjoys himself extremely  his young friend is ensign famish who is not a little pleased to be seen with such a smart fellow as rag who bows to the best turf company in the park rag lets famish accompany him to tattersalls and sells him bargains in horseflesh and uses famishs cab that young gentlemans regiment is in india and he is at home on sick leave he recruits his health by being intoxicated every night and fortifies his lungs which are weak by smoking cigars all day the policemen about the haymarket know the little creature and the early cabmen salute him the closed doors of fish and lobster shops open after service and vomit out little famish who is either tipsy and quarrelsomewhen he wants to fight the cabmen or drunk and helplesswhen some kind friend in yellow satin takes care of him all the neighbourhood the cabmen the police the early potatomen and the friends in yellow satin know the young fellow and he is called little bobby by some of the very worst reprobates in europe  his mother lady fanny famish believes devoutly that robert is in london solely for the benefit of consulting the physician is going to have him exchanged into a dragoon regiment which doesnt go to that odious india and has an idea that his chest is delicate and that he takes gruel every evening when he puts his feet in hot water her ladyship resides at cheltenham and is of a serious turn  bobby frequents the union jack club of course where he breakfasts on pale ale and devilled kidneys at three oclock where beardless young heroes of his own sort congregate and make merry and give each other dinners where you may see halfadozen of young rakes of the fourth or fifth order lounging and smoking on the steps where you behold slappers longtailed leggy mare in the custody of a redjacket until the captain is primed for the park with a glass of curacoa and where you see hobby of the highland buffs driving up with dobby of the madras fusiliers in the great banging swinging cab which the latter hires from rumble of bond street  in fact military snobs are of such number and variety that a hundred weeks of punch would not suffice to give an audience to them there is besides the disreputable old military snob who has seen service the respectable old military snob who has seen none and gives himself the most prodigious martinet airs there is the medicalmilitary snob who is generally more outrageously military in his conversation than the greatest sabreur in the army there is the heavydragoon snob whom young ladies admire with his great stupid pink face and yellow moustachesa vacuous solemn foolish but brave and honourable snob there is the amateurmilitary snob who writes captain on his card because he is a lieutenant in the bungay militia there is the ladykilling military snob and more who need not be named  but let no man we repeat charge mr punch with disrespect for the army in generalthat gallant and judicious army every man of which from fm the duke of wellington c downwardswith the exception of hrh fieldmarshal prince albert who however can hardly count as a military manreads punch in every quarter of the globe  let those civilians who sneer at the acquirements of the army read sir harry smiths account of the battle of aliwal a noble deed was never told in nobler language and you who doubt if chivalry exists or the age of heroism has passed by think of sir henry hardinge with his son dear little arthur riding in front of the lines at ferozeshah i hope no english painter will endeavour to illustrate that scene for who is there to do justice to it the history of the world contains no more brilliant and heroic picture no no the men who perform these deeds with such brilliant valour and describe them with such modest manlinesssuch are not snobs their country admires them their sovereign rewards them and punch the universal railer takes off his hat and says heaven save them    chapter xion clerical snobs  after snobsmilitary snobsclerical suggest themselves quite naturally and it is clear that with every respect for the cloth yet having a regard for truth humanity and the british public such a vast and influential class must not be omitted from our notices of the great snob world  of these clerics there are some whose claim to snobbishness is undoubted and yet it cannot be discussed here for the same reason that punch would not set up his show in a cathedral out of respect for the solemn service celebrated within there are some places where he acknowledges himself not privileged to make a noise and puts away his show and silences his drum and takes off his hat and holds his peace  and i know this that if there are some clerics who do wrong there are straightway a thousand newspapers to haul up those unfortunates and cry fie upon them fie upon them while though the press is always ready to yell and bellow excommunication against these stray delinquent parsons it somehow takes very little count of the many good onesof the tens of thousands of honest men who lead christian lives who give to the poor generously who deny themselves rigidly and live and die in their duty without ever a newspaper paragraph in their favour my beloved friend and reader i wish you and i could do the same and let me whisper my belief entre nous that of those eminent philosophers who cry out against parsons the loudest there are not many who have got their knowledge of the church by going thither often  but you who have ever listened to village bells or walked to church as children on sunny sabbath mornings you who have ever seen the parsons wife tending the poor mans bedside or the town clergyman threading the dirty stairs of noxious alleys upon his businessdo not raise a shout when one falls away or yell with the mob that howls after him  every man can do that when old father noah was overtaken in his cups there was only one of his sons that dared to make merry at his disaster and he was not the most virtuous of the family let us too turn away silently nor huzza like a parcel of schoolboys because some big young rebel suddenly starts up and whops the schoolmaster  i confess though if i had by me the names of those seven or eight irish bishops the probates of whose wills were mentioned in last years journals and who died leaving behind them some two hundred thousand apiecei would like to put them up as patrons of my clerical snobs and operate upon them as successfully as i see from the newspapers mr eisenberg chiropodist has lately done upon his grace the reverend lord bishop of tapioca  i confess that when those right reverend prelates come up to the gates of paradise with their probates of wills in their hands i think that their chance is but the gates of paradise is a far way to follow their lordships so let us trip down again lest awkward questions be asked there about our own favourite vices too  and dont let us give way to the vulgar prejudice that clergymen are an overpaid and luxurious body of men when that eminent ascetic the late sydney smithby the way by what law of nature is it that so many smiths in this world are called sydney smithlauded the system of great prizes in the churchwithout which he said gentlemen would not be induced to follow the clerical profession he admitted most pathetically that the clergy in general were by no means to be envied for their worldly prosperity from reading the works of some modern writers of repute you would fancy that a parsons life was passed in gorging himself with plumpudding and portwine and that his reverences fat chaps were always greasy with the crackling of tithe pigs caricaturists delight to represent him so round shortnecked pimplefaced apoplectic bursting out of waistcoat like a blackpudding a shovelhatted fuzzwigged silenus whereas if you take the real man the poor fellows fleshpots are very scantily furnished with meat he labours commonly for a wage that a tailors foreman would despise he has too such claims upon his dismal income as most philosophers would rather grumble to meet many tithes are levied upon his pocket let it be remembered by those who grudge him his means of livelihood he has to dine with the squire and his wife must dress neatly and he must look like a gentleman as they call it and bring up six great hungry sons as such add to this if he does his duty he has such temptations to spend his money as no mortal man could withstand yes you who cant resist purchasing a chest of cigars because they are so good or an ormolu clock at howell and jamess because it is such a bargain or a box at the opera because lablache and grisi are divine in the puritani fancy how difficult it is for a parson to resist spending a halfcrown when john breakstones family are without a loaf or standing a bottle of port for poor old polly rabbits who has her thirteenth child or treating himself to a suit of corduroys for little bob scarecrow whose breeches are sadly out at elbows think of these temptations brother moralists and philosophers and dont be too hard on the parson  but what is this instead of showing up the parsons are we indulging in maudlin praises of that monstrous blackcoated race o saintly francis lying at rest under the turf o jimmy and johnny and willy friends of my youth o noble and dear old elias how should he who knows you not respect you and your calling may this pen never write a pennyworth again if it ever casts ridicule upon either    chapter xiion clerical snobs and snobbishness  dear mr snob an amiable young correspondent writes who signs himself snobling ought the clergyman who at the request of a noble duke lately interrupted a marriage ceremony between two persons perfectly authorised to marry to be ranked or not among the clerical snobs  this my dear young friend is not a fair question one of the illustrated weekly papers has already seized hold of the clergyman and blackened him most unmercifully by representing him in his cassock performing the marriage service let that be sufficient punishment and if you please do not press the query  it is very likely that if miss smith had come with a licence to marry jones the parson in question not seeing old smith present would have sent off the beadle in a cab to let the old gentleman know what was going on and would have delayed the service until the arrival of smith senior he very likely thinks it his duty to ask all marriageable young ladies who come without their papa why their parent is absent and no doubt always sends off the beadle for that missing governor  or it is very possible that the duke of coeurdelion was mr whatdyecallims most intimate friend and has often said to him whatdyecallim my boy my daughter must never marry the capting if ever they try at your church i beseech you considering the terms of intimacy on which we are to send off rattan in a hack cab to fetch me  in either of which cases you see dear snobling that though the parson would not have been authorised yet he might have been excused for interfering he has no more right to stop my marriage than to stop my dinner to both of which as a freeborn briton i am entitled by law if i can pay for them but consider pastoral solicitude a deep sense of the duties of his office and pardon this inconvenient but genuine zeal  but if the clergyman did in the dukes case what he would not do in smiths if he has no more acquaintance with the coeurdelion family than i have with the royal and serene house of saxecoburg gothathen i confess my dear snobling your question might elicit a disagreeable reply and one which i respectfully decline to give i wonder what sir george tufto would say if a sentry left his post because a noble lord not the least connected with the service begged the sentinel not to do his duty  alas that the beadle who canes little boys and drives them out cannot drive worldliness out too what is worldliness but snobbishness when for instance i read in the newspapers that the right reverend the lord charles james administered the rite of confirmation to a party of the juvenile nobility at the chapel royalas if the chapel royal were a sort of ecclesiastical almacks and young people were to get ready for the next world in little exclusive genteel knots of the aristocracy who were not to be disturbed in their journey thither by the company of the vulgarwhen i read such a paragraph as that and one or two such generally appear during the present fashionable season it seems to me to be the most odious mean and disgusting part of that odious mean and disgusting publication the court circular and that snobbishness is therein carried to quite an awful pitch what gentlemen cant we even in the church acknowledge a republic there at least the heralds college itself might allow that we all of us have the same pedigree and are direct descendants of eve and adam whose inheritance is divided amongst us  i hereby call upon all dukes earls baronets and other potentates not to lend themselves to this shameful scandal and error and beseech all bishops who read this publication to take the matter into consideration and to protest against the continuance of the practice and to declare we wont confirm or christen lord tomnoddy or sir carnaby jenks to the exclusion of any other young christian the which declaration if their lordships are induced to make a great lapis offensionis will be removed and the snob papers will not have been written in vain  a story is current of a celebrated nouveauriche who having had occasion to oblige that excellent prelate the bishop of bullocksmithy asked his lordship in return to confirm his children privately in his lordships own chapel which ceremony the grateful prelate accordingly performed can satire go farther than this is there even in this most amusing of prints any more naive absurdity it is as if a man wouldnt go to heaven unless he went in a special train or as if he thought as some people think about vaccination confirmation more effectual when administered at first hand when that eminent person the begum sumroo died it is said she left ten thousand pounds to the pope and ten thousand to the archbishop of canterburyso that there should be no mistakeso as to make sure of having the ecclesiastical authorities on her side this is only a little more openly and undisguisedly snobbish than the cases before alluded to a wellbred snob is just as secretly proud of his riches and honours as a parvenu snob who makes the most ludicrous exhibition of them and a highborn marchioness or duchess just as vain of herself and her diamonds as queen quashyboo who sews a pair of epaulets on to her skirt and turns out in state in a cocked hat and feathers  it is not out of disrespect to my peerage which i love and honour indeed have i not said before that i should be ready to jump out of my skin if two dukes would walk down pall mall with meit is not out of disrespect for the individuals that i wish these titles had never been invented but consider if there were no tree there would be no shadow and how much more honest society would be and how much more serviceable the clergy would be which is our present consideration if these temptations of rank and continual baits of worldliness were not in existence and perpetually thrown out to lead them astray  i have seen many examples of their falling away when for instance tom sniffle first went into the country as curate for mr fuddleston sir huddleston fuddlestons brother who resided on some other living there could not be a more kind hardworking and excellent creature than tom he had his aunt to live with him his conduct to his poor was admirable he wrote annually reams of the bestintentioned and vapid sermons when lord brandyballs family came down into the country and invited him to dine at brandyball park sniffle was so agitated that he almost forgot how to say grace and upset a bowl of currantjelly sauce in lady fanny toffys lap  what was the consequence of his intimacy with that noble family he quarrelled with his aunt for dining out every night the wretch forgot his poor altogether and killed his old nag by always riding over to brandyball where he revelled in the maddest passion for lady fanny he ordered the neatest new clothes and ecclesiastical waistcoats from london he appeared with corazzashirts lackered boots and perfumery he bought a bloodhorse from bob toffy was seen at archery meetings public breakfastsactually at cover and i blush to say that i saw him in a stall at the opera and afterwards riding by lady fannys side in rotten row he doublebarrelled his name as many poor snobs do and instead of t sniffle as formerly came out in a porcelain card as rev t darcy sniffle burlington hotel  the end of all this may be imagined when the earl of brandyball was made acquainted with the curates love for lady fanny he had that fit of the gout which so nearly carried him off to the inexpressible grief of his son lord alicompayne and uttered that remarkable speech to sniffle which disposed of the claims of the latter if i didnt respect the church sir his lordship said by jove id kick you downstairs his lordship then fell back into the fit aforesaid and lady fanny as we all know married general podager  as for poor tom he was over head and ears in debt as well as in love his creditors came down upon him mr hemp of portugal street proclaimed his name lately as a reverend outlaw and he has been seen at various foreign wateringplaces sometimes doing duty sometimes coaching a stray gentlemans son at carlsruhe or kissingen sometimesmust we say itlurking about the roulettetables with a tuft to his chin  if temptation had not come upon this unhappy fellow in the shape of a lord brandyball he might still have been following his profession humbly and worthily he might have married his cousin with four thousand pounds the winemerchants daughter the old gentleman quarrelled with his nephew for not soliciting wineorders from lord b for him he might have had seven children and taken private pupils and eked out his income and lived and died a country parson  could he have done better you who want to know how great and good and noble such a character may be read stanleys life of doctor arnold    chapter xiiion clerical snobs  among the varieties of the snob clerical the university snob and the scholastic snob ought never to be forgotten they form a very strong battalion in the blackcoated army  the wisdom of our ancestors which i admire more and more every day seemed to have determined that education of youth was so paltry and unimportant a matter that almost any man armed with a birch and regulation cassock and degree might undertake the charge and many an honest country gentleman may be found to the present day who takes very good care to have a character with his butler when he engages him and will not purchase a horse without the warranty and the closest inspection but sends off his son young john thomas to school without asking any questions about the schoolmaster and places the lad at switchester college under doctor block because he the good old english gentleman had been at switchester under doctor buzwig forty years ago  we have a love for all little boys at school for many scores of thousands of them read and love punchmay he never write a word that shall not be honest and fit for them to read he will not have his young friends to be snobs in the future or to be bullied by snobs or given over to such to be educated our connexion with the youth at the universities is very close and affectionate the candid undergraduate is our friend the pompous old college don trembles in his common room lest we should attack him and show him up as a snob  when railroads were threatening to invade the land which they have since conquered it may be recollected what a shrieking and outcry the authorities of oxford and eton made lest the iron abominations should come near those seats of pure learning and tempt the british youth astray the supplications were in vain the railroad is in upon them and the oldworld institutions are doomed i felt charmed to read in the papers the other day a most veracious puffing advertisement headed to college and back for five shillings the college gardens it said will be thrown open on this occasion the college youths will perform a regatta the chapel of kings college will have its celebrated musicand all for five shillings the goths have got into rome napoleon stephenson draws his republican lines round the sacred old cities and the ecclesiastical bigwigs who garrison them must prepare to lay down key and crosier before the iron conqueror  if you consider dear reader what profound snobbishness the university system produced you will allow that it is time to attack some of those feudal middleage superstitions if you go down for five shillings to look at the college youths you may see one sneaking down the court without a tassel to his cap another with a gold or silver fringe to his velvet trencher a third lad with a masters gown and hat walking at ease over the sacred college grassplats which common men must not tread on  he may do it because he is a nobleman because a lad is a lord the university gives him a degree at the end of two years which another is seven in acquiring because he is a lord he has no call to go through an examination any man who has not been to college and back for five shillings would not believe in such distinctions in a place of education so absurd and monstrous do they seem to be  the lads with gold and silver lace are sons of rich gentlemen and called fellow commoners they are privileged to feed better than the pensioners and to have wine with their victuals which the latter can only get in their rooms  the unlucky boys who have no tassels to their caps are called sizarsservitors at oxforda very pretty and gentlemanlike title a distinction is made in their clothes because they are poor for which reason they wear a badge of poverty and are not allowed to take their meals with their fellowstudents  when this wicked and shameful distinction was set up it was of a piece with all the resta part of the brutal unchristian blundering feudal system distinctions of rank were then so strongly insisted upon that it would have been thought blasphemy to doubt them as blasphemous as it is in parts of the united states now for a nigger to set up as the equal of a white man a ruffian like henry viii talked as gravely about the divine powers vested in him as if he had been an inspired prophet a wretch like james i not only believed that there was in himself a particular sanctity but other people believed him government regulated the length of a merchants shoes as well as meddled with his trade prices exports machinery it thought itself justified in roasting a man for his religion or pulling a jews teeth out if he did not pay a contribution or ordered him to dress in a yellow gabardine and locked him in a particular quarter  now a merchant may wear what boots he pleases and has pretty nearly acquired the privilege of buying and selling without the government laying its paws upon the bargain the stake for heretics is gone the pillory is taken down bishops are even found lifting up their voices against the remains of persecution and ready to do away with the last catholic disabilities sir robert peel though he wished it ever so much has no power over mr benjamin disraelis grinders or any means of violently handling that gentlemans jaw jews are not called upon to wear badges on the contrary they may live in piccadilly or the minories according to fancy they may dress like christians and do sometimes in a most elegant and fashionable manner  why is the poor college servitor to wear that name and that badge still because universities are the last places into which reform penetrates but now that she can go to college and back for five shillings let her travel down thither    chapter xivon university snobs  all the men of saint boniface will recognize hugby and crump in these two pictures they were tutors in our time and crump is since advanced to be president of the college he was formerly and is now a rich specimen of a university snob  at fiveandtwenty crump invented three new metres and published an edition of an exceedingly improper greek comedy with no less than twenty emendations upon the german text of schnupfenius and schnapsius these services to religion instantly pointed him out for advancement in the church and he is now president of saint boniface and very narrowly escaped the bench  crump thinks saint boniface the centre of the world and his position as president the highest in england he expects the fellows and tutors to pay him the same sort of service that cardinals pay to the pope i am sure crawler would have no objection to carry his trencher or page to hold up the skirts of his gown as he stalks into chapel he roars out the responses there as if it were an honour to heaven that the president of saint boniface should take a part in the service and in his own lodge and college acknowledges the sovereign only as his superior  when the allied monarchs came down and were made doctors of the university a breakfast was given at saint boniface on which occasion crump allowed the emperor alexander to walk before him but took the pas himself of the king of prussia and prince blucher he was going to put the hetman platoff to breakfast at a sidetable with the under college tutors but he was induced to relent and merely entertained that distinguished cossack with a discourse on his own language in which he showed that the hetman knew nothing about it  as for us undergraduates we scarcely knew more about crump than about the grand llama a few favoured youths are asked occasionally to tea at the lodge but they do not speak unless first addressed by the doctor and if they venture to sit down crumps follower mr toady whispers gentlemen will you have the kindness to get upthe president is passing or gentlemen the president prefers that undergraduates should not sit down or words to a similar effect  to do crump justice he does not cringe now to great people he rather patronizes them than otherwise and in london speaks quite affably to a duke who has been brought up at his college or holds out a finger to a marquis he does not disguise his own origin but brags of it with considerable selfgratulationi was a charityboy says he see what i am now the greatest greek scholar of the greatest college of the greatest university of the greatest empire in the world the argument being that this is a capital world for beggars because he being a beggar has managed to get on horseback  hugby owes his eminence to patient merit and agreeable perseverance he is a meek mild inoffensive creature with just enough of scholarship to fit him to hold a lecture or set an examination paper he rose by kindness to the aristocracy it was wonderful to see the way in which that poor creature grovelled before a nobleman or a lords nephew or even some noisy and disreputable commoner the friend of a lord he used to give the young noblemen the most painful and elaborate breakfasts and adopt a jaunty genteel air and talk with them although he was decidedly serious about the opera or the last run with the hounds it was good to watch him in the midst of a circle of young tufts with his mean smiling eager uneasy familiarity he used to write home confidential letters to their parents and made it his duty to call upon them when in town to condole or rejoice with them when a death birth or marriage took place in their family and to feast them whenever they came to the university i recollect a letter lying on a desk in his lectureroom for a whole term beginning my lord duke it was to show us that he corresponded with such dignities  when the late lamented lord glenlivat who broke his neck at a hurdlerace at the premature age of twentyfour was at the university the amiable young fellow passing to his rooms in the early morning and seeing hugbys boots at his door on the same staircase playfully wadded the insides of the boots with cobblers wax which caused excruciating pains to the rev mr hugby when he came to take them off the same evening before dining with the master of st crispins  everybody gave the credit of this admirable piece of fun to lord glenlivats friend bob tizzy who was famous for such feats and who had already made away with the college pumphandle filed st bonifaces nose smooth with his face carried off four images of niggerboys from the tobacconists painted the senior proctors horse peagreen c c and bob who was of the party certainly and would not peach was just on the point of incurring expulsion and so losing the family living which was in store for him when glenlivat nobly stepped forward owned himself to be the author of the delightful jeudesprit apologized to the tutor and accepted the rustication  hugby cried when glenlivat apologized if the young nobleman had kicked him round the court i believe the tutor would have been happy so that an apology and a reconciliation might subsequently ensue my lord said he in your conduct on this and all other occasions you have acted as becomes a gentleman you have been an honour to the university as you will be to the peerage i am sure when the amiable vivacity of youth is calmed down and you are called upon to take your proper share in the government of the nation and when his lordship took leave of the university hugby presented him with a copy of his sermons to a noblemans family hugby was once private tutor to the sons of the earl of muffborough which glenlivat presented in return to mr william ramm known to the fancy as the tutbury pet and the sermons now figure on the boudoirtable of mrs ramm behind the bar of her house of entertainment the game cock and spurs near woodstock oxon  at the beginning of the long vacation hugby comes to town and puts up in handsome lodgings near st jamess square rides in the park in the afternoon and is delighted to read his name in the morning papers among the list of persons present at muffborough house and the marquis of farintoshs eveningparties he is a member of sydney scrapers club where however he drinks his pint of claret  sometimes you may see him on sundays at the hour when tavern doors open whence issue little girls with great jugs of porter when charityboys walk the streets bearing brown dishes of smoking shoulders of mutton and baked taturs when sheeny and moses are seen smoking their pipes before their lazy shutters in seven dials when a crowd of smiling persons in clean outlandish dresses in monstrous bonnets and flaring printed gowns or in crumpled glossy coats and silks that bear the creases of the drawers where they have lain all the week file down high streetsometimes i say you may see hugby coming out of the church of st gilesinthefields with a stout gentlewoman leaning on his arm whose old face bears an expression of supreme pride and happiness as she glances round at all the neighbours and who faces the curate himself and marches into holborn where she pulls the bell of a house over which is inscribed hugby haberdasher it is the mother of the rev f hugby as proud of her son in his white choker as cornelia of her jewels at rome that is old hugby bringing up the rear with the prayerbooks and betsy hugby the old maid his daughterold hugby haberdasher and churchwarden  in the front room upstairs where the dinner is laid out there is a picture of muffborough castle of the earl of muffborough kx lordlieutenant for diddlesex an engraving from an almanac of saint boniface college oxon and a stickingplaster portrait of hugby when young in a cap and gown a copy of his sermons to a noblemans family is on the bookshelf by the whole duty of man the reports of the missionary societies and the oxford university calendar old hugby knows part of this by heart every living belonging to saint boniface and the name of every tutor fellow nobleman and undergraduate  he used to go to meeting and preach himself until his son took orders but of late the old gentleman has been accused of puseyism and is quite pitiless against the dissenters    chapter xvon university snobs  i should like to fill several volumes with accounts of various university snobs so fond are my reminiscences of them and so numerous are they i should like to speak above all of the wives and daughters of some of the professorsnobs their amusements habits jealousies their innocent artifices to entrap young men their picnics concerts and eveningparties i wonder what has become of emily blades daughter of blades the professor of the mandingo language i remember her shoulders to this day as she sat in the midst of a crowd of about seventy young gentlemen from corpus and catherine hall entertaining them with ogles and french songs on the guitar are you married fair emily of the shoulders what beautiful ringlets those were that used to dribble over themwhat a waistwhat a killing seagreen shotsilk gownwhat a cameo the size of a muffin there were thirtysix young men of the university in love at one time with emily blades and no words are sufficient to describe the pity the sorrow the deep deep commiserationthe rage fury and uncharitableness in other wordswith which the miss trumps daughter of trumps the professor of phlebotomy regarded her because she didnt squint and because she wasnt marked with the smallpox  as for the young university snobs i am getting too old now to speak of such very familiarly my recollections of them lie in the far far pastalmost as far back as pelhams time  we then used to consider snobs rawlooking lads who never missed chapel who wore highlows and no straps who walked two hours on the trumpington road every day of their lives who carried off the college scholarships and who overrated themselves in hall we were premature in pronouncing our verdict of youthful snobbishness the man without straps fulfilled his destiny and duty he eased his old governor the curate in westmoreland or helped his sisters to set up the ladies school he wrote a dictionary or a treatise on conic sections as his nature and genius prompted he got a fellowship and then took to himself a wife and a living he presides over a parish now and thinks it rather a dashing thing to belong to the oxford and cambridge club and his parishioners love him and snore under his sermons no no he is not a snob it is not straps that make the gentleman or highlows that unmake him be they ever so thick my son it is you who are the snob if you lightly despise a man for doing his duty and refuse to shake an honest mans hand because it wears a berlin glove  we then used to consider it not the least vulgar for a parcel of lads who had been whipped three months previous and were not allowed more than three glasses of port at home to sit down to pineapples and ices at each others rooms and fuddle themselves with champagne and claret  one looks back to what was called a wineparty with a sort of wonder thirty lads round a table covered with bad sweetmeats drinking bad wines telling bad stories singing bad songs over and over again milk punchsmokingghastly headachefrightful spectacle of desserttable next morning and smell of tobaccoyour guardian the clergyman dropping in in the midst of thisexpecting to find you deep in algebra and discovering the gyp administering sodawater  there were young men who despised the lads who indulged in the coarse hospitalities of wineparties who prided themselves in giving recherche little french dinners both winepartygivers and dinnergivers were snobs  there were what used to be called dressy snobsjimmy who might be seen at five oclock elaborately rigged out with a camellia in his buttonhole glazed boots and fresh kidgloves twice a dayjessamy who was conspicuous for his jewellerya young donkey glittering all over with chains rings and shirtstudsjacky who rode every day solemnly on the blenheim road in pumps and white silk stockings with his hair curledall three of whom flattered themselves they gave laws to the university about dressall three most odious varieties of snobs  sporting snobs of course there were and are alwaysthose happy beings in whom nature has implanted a love of slang who loitered about the horsekeepers stables and drove the london coachesa stage in and outand might be seen swaggering through the courts in pink of early mornings and indulged in dice and blindhookey at nights and never missed a race or a boxingmatch and rode flatraces and kept bullterriers worse snobs even than these were poor miserable wretches who did not like hunting at all and could not afford it and were in mortal fear at a twofoot ditch but who hunted because glenlivat and cinqbars hunted the billiard snob and the boating snob were varieties of these and are to be found elsewhere than in universities  then there were philosophical snobs who used to ape statesmen at the spoutingclubs and who believed as a fact that government always had an eye on the university for the selection of orators for the house of commons there were audacious young freethinkers who adored nobody or nothing except perhaps robespierre and the koran and panted for the day when the pale name of priest should shrink and dwindle away before the indignation of an enlightened world  but the worst of all university snobs are those unfortunates who go to rack and ruin from their desire to ape their betters smith becomes acquainted with great people at college and is ashamed of his father the tradesman jones has fine acquaintances and lives after their fashion like a gay freehearted fellow as he is and ruins his father and robs his sisters portion and cripples his younger brothers outset in life for the pleasure of entertaining my lord and riding by the side of sir john and though it may be very good fun for robinson to fuddle himself at home as he does at college and to be brought home by the policeman he has just been trying to knock downthink what fun it is for the poor old soul his motherthe halfpay captains widow who has been pinching herself all her life long in order that that jolly young fellow might have a university education    chapter xvion literary snobs  what will he say about literary snobs has been a question i make no doubt often asked by the public how can he let off his own profession will that truculent and unsparing monster who attacks the nobility the clergy the army and the ladies indiscriminately hesitate when the turn comes to egorger his own flesh and blood  my dear and excellent querist whom does the schoolmaster flog so resolutely as his own son didnt brutus chop his offsprings head off you have a very bad opinion indeed of the present state of literature and of literary men if you fancy that any one of us would hesitate to stick a knife into his neighbour penman if the latters death could do the state any service  but the fact is that in the literary profession there are no snobs look round at the whole body of british men of letters and i defy you to point out among them a single instance of vulgarity or envy or assumption  men and women as far as i have known them they are all modest in their demeanour elegant in their manners spotless in their lives and honourable in their conduct to the world and to each other you may occasionally it is true hear one literary man abusing his brother but why not in the least out of malice not at all from envy merely from a sense of truth and public duty suppose for instance i goodnaturedly point out a blemish in my friend mr punchs person and say mr p has a humpback and his nose and chin are more crooked than those features in the apollo or antinous which we are accustomed to consider as our standards of beauty does this argue malice on my part towards mr punch not in the least it is the critics duty to point out defects as well as merits and he invariably does his duty with utmost gentleness and candour  an intelligent foreigners testimony about our manners is always worth having and i think in this respect the work of an eminent american mr n p willis is eminently valuable and impartial in his history of ernest clay a crack magazinewriter the reader will get an exact account of the life of a popular man of letters in england he is always the lion of society  he takes the pas of dukes and earls all the nobility crowd to see him i forget how many baronesses and duchesses fall in love with him but on this subject let us hold our tongues modesty forbids that we should reveal the names of the heartbroken countesses and dear marchionesses who are pining for every one of the contributors in punch  if anybody wants to know how intimately authors are connected with the fashionable world they have but to read the genteel novels what refinement and delicacy pervades the works of mrs barnaby what delightful good company do you meet with in mrs armytage she seldom introduces you to anybody under a marquis i dont know anything more delicious than the pictures of genteel life in ten thousand a year except perhaps the young duke and coningsby theres a modest grace about them and an air of easy high fashion which only belongs to blood my dear sirto true blood  and what linguists many of our writers are lady bulwer lady londonderry sir edward himselfthey write the french language with a luxurious elegance and ease which sets them far above their continental rivals of whom not one except paul de kock knows a word of english  and what briton can read without enjoyment the works of james so admirable for terseness and the playful humour and dazzling offhand lightness of ainsworth among other humourists one might glance at a jerrold the chivalrous advocate of toryism and church and state an a beckett with a lightsome pen but a savage earnestness of purpose a jeames whose pure style and wit unmingled with buffoonery was relished by a congenial public  speaking of critics perhaps there never was a review that has done so much for literature as the admirable quarterly it has its prejudices to be sure as which of us has not it goes out of its way to abuse a great man or lays mercilessly on to such pretenders as keats and tennyson but on the other hand it is the friend of all young authors and has marked and nurtured all the rising talent of the country it is loved by everybody there again is blackwoods magazineconspicuous for modest elegance and amiable satire that review never passes the bounds of politeness in a joke it is the arbiter of manners and while gently exposing the foibles of londoners for whom the beaux esprits of edinburgh entertain a justifiable contempt it is never coarse in its fun the fiery enthusiasm of the athenaeum is well known and the bitter wit of the too difficult literary gazette the examiner is perhaps too timid and the spectator too boisterous in its praisebut who can carp at these minor faults no no the critics of england and the authors of england are unrivalled as a body and hence it becomes impossible for us to find fault with them  above all i never knew a man of letters ashamed of his profession those who know us know what an affectionate and brotherly spirit there is among us all sometimes one of us rises in the world we never attack him or sneer at him under those circumstances but rejoice to a man at his success if jones dines with a lord smith never says jones is a courtier and cringer nor on the other hand does jones who is in the habit of frequenting the society of great people give himself any airs on account of the company he keeps but will leave a dukes arm in pall mall to come over and speak to poor brown the young pennyaliner  that sense of equality and fraternity amongst authors has always struck me as one of the most amiable characteristics of the class it is because we know and respect each other that the world respects us so much that we hold such a good position in society and demean ourselves so irreproachably when there  literary persons are held in such esteem by the nation that about two of them have been absolutely invited to court during the present reign and it is probable that towards the end of the season one or two will be asked to dinner by sir robert peel  they are such favourites with the public that they are continually obliged to have their pictures taken and published and one or two could be pointed out of whom the nation insists upon having a fresh portrait every year nothing can be more gratifying than this proof of the affectionate regard which the people has for its instructors  literature is held in such honour in england that there is a sum of near twelve hundred pounds per annum set apart to pension deserving persons following that profession and a great compliment this is too to the professors and a proof of their generally prosperous and flourishing condition they are generally so rich and thrifty that scarcely any money is wanted to help them  if every word of this is true how i should like to know am i to write about literary snobs    chapter xviia little about irish snobs  you do not to be sure imagine that there are no other snobs in ireland than those of the amiable party who wish to make pikes of iron railroads its a fine irish economy and to cut the throats of the saxon invaders these are of the venomous sort and had they been invented in his time st patrick would have banished them out of the kingdom along with the other dangerous reptiles  i think it is the four masters or else its olaus magnus or else its certainly oneill daunt in the catechism of irish history who relates that when richard the second came to ireland and the irish chiefs did homage to him going down on their kneesthe poor simple creaturesand worshipping and wondering before the english king and the dandies of his court my lords the english noblemen mocked and jeered at their uncouth irish admirers mimicked their talk and gestures pulled their poor old beards and laughed at the strange fashion of their garments  the english snob rampant always does this to the present day there is no snob in existence perhaps that has such an indomitable belief in himself that sneers you down all the rest of the world besides and has such an insufferable admirable stupid contempt for all people but his ownnay for all sets but his own gwacious gad what stories about the iwish these young dandies accompanying king richard must have had to tell when they returned to pall mall and smoked their cigars upon the steps of whites  the irish snobbishness developes itself not in pride so much as in servility and mean admirations and trumpery imitations of their neighbours and i wonder de tocqueville and de beaumont and the times commissioner did not explain the snobbishness of ireland as contrasted with our own ours is that of richards norman knightshaughty brutal stupid and perfectly selfconfidenttheirs of the poor wondering kneeling simple chieftains they are on their knees still before english fashionthese simple wild people and indeed it is hard not to grin at some of their naive exhibitions  some years since when a certain great orator was lord mayor of dublin he used to wear a red gown and a cocked hat the splendour of which delighted him as much as a new curtainring in her nose or a string of glassbeads round her neck charms queen quasheeneboo he used to pay visits to people in this dress to appear at meetings hundreds of miles off in the red velvet gown and to hear the people crying yes me lard and no me lard and to read the prodigious accounts of his lordship in the papers it seemed as if the people and he liked to be taken in by this twopenny splendour twopenny magnificence indeed exists all over ireland and may be considered as the great characteristic of the snobbishness of that country  when mrs mulholligan the grocers lady retires to kingstown she has mulholliganville painted over the gate of her villa and receives you at a door that wont shut or gazes at you out of a window that is glazed with an old petticoat  be it ever so shabby and dismal nobody ever owns to keeping a shop a fellow whose stock in trade is a penny roll or a tumbler of lollipops calls his cabin the american flour stores or the depository for colonial produce or some such name  as for inns there are none in the country hotels abound as well furnished as mulholliganville but again there are no such people as landlords and landladies the landlord is out with the hounds and my lady in the parlour talking with the captain or playing the piano  if a gentleman has a hundred a year to leave to his family they all become gentlemen all keep a nag ride to hounds and swagger about in the phaynix and grow tufts to their chins like so many real aristocrats  a friend of mine has taken to be a painter and lives out of ireland where he is considered to have disgraced the family by choosing such a profession his father is a winemerchant and his elder brother an apothecary  the number of men one meets in london and on the continent who have a pretty little property of fiveandtwenty hundred a year in ireland is prodigious those who will have nine thousand a year in land when somebody dies are still more numerous i myself have met as many descendants from irish kings as would form a brigade  and who has not met the irishman who apes the englishman and who forgets his country and tries to forget his accent or to smother the taste of it as it were come dine with me my boy says odowd of odowdstown youll find us all english there which he tells you with a brogue as broad as from here to kingstown pier and did you never hear mrs captain macmanus talk about iahland and her account of her fawthers esteet very few men have rubbed through the world without hearing and witnessing some of these hibernian phenomenathese twopenny splendours  and what say you to the summit of societythe castlewith a sham king and sham lordsinwaiting and sham loyalty and a sham haroun alraschid to go about in a sham disguise making believe to be affable and splendid that castle is the pink and pride of snobbishness a court circular is bad enough with two columns of print about a little baby thats christenedbut think of people liking a sham court circular  i think the shams of ireland are more outrageous than those of any country a fellow shows you a hill and says thats the highest mountain in all ireland a gentleman tells you he is descended from brian boroo and has his fiveandthirty hundred a year or mrs macmanus describes her fawthers esteet or ould dan rises and says the irish women are the loveliest the irish men the bravest the irish land the most fertile in the world and nobody believes anybodythe latter does not believe his story nor the hearerbut they makebelieve to believe and solemnly do honour to humbug  o ireland o my country for i make little doubt i am descended from brian boroo too when will you acknowledge that two and two make four and call a pikestaff a pikestaffthat is the very best use you can make of the latter irish snobs will dwindle away then and we shall never hear tell of hereditary bondsmen    chapter xviiipartygiving snobs  our selection of snobs has lately been too exclusively of a political character give us private snobs cry the dear ladies i have before me the letter of one fair correspondent of the fishing village of brighthelmstone in sussex and could her commands ever be disobeyed tell us more dear mr snob about your experience of snobs in society heaven bless the dear soulsthey are accustomed to the word nowthe odious vulgar horrid unpronounceable word slips out of their lips with the prettiest glibness possible i should not wonder if it were used at court amongst the maids of honour in the very best society i know it is and why not snobbishness is vulgarthe mere words are not that which we call a snob by any other name would still be snobbish  well then as the season is drawing to a close as many hundreds of kind souls snobbish or otherwise have quitted london as many hospitable carpets are taken up and windowblinds are pitilessly papered with the morning herald and mansions once inhabited by cheerful owners are now consigned to the care of the housekeepers dreary locum tenenssome mouldy old woman who in reply to the hopeless clanging of the bell peers at you for a moment from the area and then slowly unbolting the great halldoor informs you my lady has left town or that the familys in the country or gone up the rindor what not as the season and parties are over why not consider partygiving snobs for a while and review the conduct of some of those individuals who have quitted the town for six months  some of those worthy snobs are makingbelieve to go yachting and dressed in telescopes and peajackets are passing their time between cherbourg and cowes some living higgledypiggledy in dismal little huts in scotland provisioned with canisters of portable soup and fricandeaux hermetically sealed in tin are passing their days slaughtering grouse upon the moors some are dozing and bathing away the effects of the season at kissingen or watching the ingenious game of trente et quarante at homburg and ems we can afford to be very bitter upon them now they are all gone now there are no more parties let us have at the partygiving snobs the dinnergiving the ballgiving the dejeunergiving the conversazionegiving snobslord lord what havoc might have been made amongst them had we attacked them during the plethora of the season i should have been obliged to have a guard to defend me from fiddlers and pastrycooks indignant at the abuse of their patrons already im told that from some flippant and unguarded expressions considered derogatory to baker street and harley street rents have fallen in these respectable quarters and orders have been issued that at least mr snob shall be asked to parties there no more well thennow they are all away let us frisk at our ease and have at everything like the bull in the chinashop they maynt hear of what is going on in their absence and if they do they cant bear malice for six months we will begin to make it up with them about next february and let next year take care of itself we shall have no dinners from the dinnergiving snobs no more from the ballgivers no more conversaziones thank mussy as jeames says from the conversaziones snob and what is to prevent us from telling the truth  the snobbishness of conversazione snobs is very soon disposed of as soon as that cup of washy bohea is handed to you in the tearoom or the muddy remnant of ice that you grasp in the suffocating scuffle of the assembly upstairs  good heavens what do people mean by going there what is done there that everybody throngs into those three little rooms was the black hole considered to be an agreeable reunion that britons in the dogdays here seek to imitate it after being rammed to a jelly in a doorway where you feel your feet going through lady barbara macbeths lace flounces and get a look from that haggard and painted old harpy compared to which the gaze of ugolino is quite cheerful after withdrawing your elbow out of poor gasping bob guttletons white waistcoat from which cushion it was impossible to remove it though you knew you were squeezing poor bob into an apoplexyyou find yourself at last in the receptionroom and try to catch the eye of mrs botibol the conversazionegiver when you catch her eye you are expected to grin and she smiles too for the four hundredth time that night and if shes very glad to see you waggles her little hand before her face as if to blow you a kiss as the phrase is  why the deuce should mrs botibol blow me a kiss i wouldnt kiss her for the world why do i grin when i see her as if i was delighted am i i dont care a straw for mrs botibol i know what she thinks about me i know what she said about my last volume of poems i had it from a dear mutual friend why i say in a word are we going on ogling and telegraphing each other in this insane waybecause we are both performing the ceremonies demanded by the great snob society whose dictates we all of us obey  well the recognition is overmy jaws have returned to their usual english expression of subdued agony and intense gloom and the botibol is grinning and kissing her fingers to somebody else who is squeezing through the aperture by which we have just entered it is lady ann clutterbuck who has her friday evenings as botibol botty we call her has wednesdays that is miss clementina clutterbuck the cadaverous young woman in green with florid auburn hair who has published her volume of poems the deathshriek damiens the faggot of joan of arc and translations from the german of course the conversazionewomen salute each other calling each other my dear lady ann and my dear good eliza and hating each other as women hate who give parties on wednesdays and fridays with inexpressible pain dear good eliza sees ann go up and coax and wheedle abou gosh who has just arrived from syria and beg him to patronize her fridays  all this while amidst the crowd and the scuffle and a perpetual buzz and chatter and the flare of the waxcandles and an intolerable smell of muskwhat the poor snobs who write fashionable romances call the gleam of gems the odour of perfumes the blaze of countless lampsa scrubbylooking yellowfaced foreigner with cleaned gloves is warbling inaudibly in a corner to the accompaniment of another the great cacafogo mrs botibol whispers as she passes you by a great creature thumpenstrumpff is at the instrumentthe hetman platoffs pianist you know  to hear this cacafogo and thumpenstrumpff a hundred people are gathered togethera bevy of dowagers stout or scraggy a faint sprinkling of misses six moodylooking lords perfectly meek and solemn wonderful foreign counts with bushy whiskers and yellow faces and a great deal of dubious jewellery young dandies with slim waists and open necks and selfsatisfied simpers and flowers in their buttons the old stiff stout baldheaded conversazione roues whom you meet everywherewho never miss a night of this delicious enjoyment the three lastcaught lions of the seasonhiggs the traveller biggs the novelist and toffey who has come out so on the sugar question captain flash who is invited on account of his pretty wife and lord ogleby who goes wherever she goes  que scaisje who are the owners of all those showy scarfs and white neckclothsask little tom prig who is there in all his glory knows everybody has a story about every one and as he trips home to his lodgings in jermyn street with his gibushat and his little glazed pumps thinks he is the fashionablest young fellow in town and that he really has passed a night of exquisite enjoyment  you go up with our usual easy elegance of manner and talk to miss smith in a corner oh mr snob im afraid youre sadly satirical  thats all she says if you say its fine weather she bursts out laughing or hint that its very hot she vows you are the drollest wretch meanwhile mrs botibol is simpering on fresh arrivals the individual at the door is roaring out their names poor cacafogo is quavering away in the musicroom under the impression that he will be lance in the world by singing inaudibly here and what a blessing it is to squeeze out of the door and into the street where a halfhundred of carriages are in waiting and where the linkboy with that unnecessary lantern of his pounces upon all who issue out and will insist upon getting your noble honours lordships cab  and to think that there are people who after having been to botibol on wednesday will go to clutterbuck on friday    chapter xixdiningout snobs  in england dinnergiving snobs occupy a very important place in society and the task of describing them is tremendous there was a time in my life when the consciousness of having eaten a mans salt rendered me dumb regarding his demerits and i thought it a wicked act and a breach of hospitality to speak ill of him  but why should a saddleofmutton blind you or a turbot and lobstersauce shut your mouth for ever with advancing age men see their duties more clearly i am not to be hoodwinked any longer by a slice of venison be it ever so fat and as for being dumb on account of turbot and lobstersauceof course i am good manners ordain that i should be so until i have swallowed the compoundbut not afterwards directly the victuals are discussed and john takes away the plate my tongue begins to wag does not yours if you have a pleasant neighboura lovely creature say of some fiveandthirty whose daughters have not yet quite come outthey are the best talkers as for your young misses they are only put about the table to look atlike the flowers in the centrepiece their blushing youth and natural modesty preclude them from easy confidential conversational abandon which forms the delight of the intercourse with their dear mothers it is to these if he would prosper in his profession that the diningout snob should address himself suppose you sit next to one of these how pleasant it is in the intervals of the banquet actually to abuse the victuals and the giver of the entertainment its twice as piquant to make fun of a man under his very nose  what is a dinnergiving snob some innocent youth who is not repandu in the world may askor some simple reader who has not the benefits of london experience  my dear sir i will show younot all for that is impossiblebut several kinds of dinnergiving snobs for instance suppose you in the middle rank of life accustomed to mutton roast on tuesday cold on wednesday hashed on thursday c with small means and a small establishment choose to waste the former and set the latter topsyturvy by giving entertainments unnaturally costlyyou come into the dinnergiving snob class at once suppose you get in cheapmade dishes from the pastrycooks and hire a couple of greengrocers or carpetbeaters to figure as footmen dismissing honest molly who waits on common days and bedizening your table ordinarily ornamented with willowpattern crockery with twopennyhalfpenny birmingham plate suppose you pretend to be richer and grander than you ought to beyou are a dinnergiving snob and oh i tremble to think how many and many a one will read this  a man who entertains in this wayand alas how few do notis like a fellow who would borrow his neighbours coat to make a show in or a lady who flaunts in the diamonds from next doora humbug in a word and amongst the snobs he must be set down  a man who goes out of his natural sphere of society to ask lords generals aldermen and other persons of fashion but is niggardly of his hospitality towards his own equals is a dinnergiving snob my dear friend jack tufthunt for example knows one lord whom he met at a wateringplace old lord mumble who is as toothless as a threemonthsold baby and as mum as an undertaker and as dull aswell we will not particularise tufthunt never has a dinner now but you see this solemn old toothless patrician at the righthand of mrs tufthunttufthunt is a dinnergiving snob  old livermore old soy old chutney the east indian director old cutler the surgeon cthat society of old fogies in fine who give each other dinners round and round and dine for the mere purpose of guttlingthese again are dinnergiving snobs  again my friend lady macscrew who has three grenadier flunkeys in lace round the table and serves up a scragofmutton on silver and dribbles you out bad sherry and port by thimblefuls is a dinnergiving snob of the other sort and i confess for my part i would rather dine with old livermore or old soy than with her ladyship  stinginess is snobbish ostentation is snobbish too great profusion is snobbish tufthunting is snobbish but i own there are people more snobbish than all those whose defects are above mentioned viz those individuals who can and dont give dinners at all the man without hospitality shall never sit sub iisdem trabibus with me let the sordid wretch go mumble his bone alone  what again is true hospitality alas my dear friends and brother snobs how little do we meet of it after all are the motives pure which induce your friends to ask you to dinner this has often come across me does your entertainer want something from you for instance i am not of a suspicious turn but it is a fact that when hookey is bringing out a new work he asks the critics all round to dinner that when walker has got his picture ready for the exhibition he somehow grows exceedingly hospitable and has his friends of the press to a quiet cutlet and a glass of sillery old hunks the miser who died lately leaving his money to his housekeeper lived many years on the fat of the land by simply taking down at all his friends the names and christian names of all the children but though you may have your own opinion about the hospitality of your acquaintances and though men who ask you from sordid motives are most decidedly dinnergiving snobs it is best not to inquire into their motives too keenly be not too curious about the mouth of a gifthorse after all a man does not intend to insult you by asking you to dinner  though for that matter i know some characters about town who actually consider themselves injured and insulted if the dinner or the company is not to their liking there is guttleton who dines at home off a shillingsworth of beef from the cookshop but if he is asked to dine at a house where there are not pease at the end of may or cucumbers in march along with the turbot thinks himself insulted by being invited good ged says he what the deuce do the forkers mean by asking me to a family dinner i can get mutton at home or what infernal impertinence it is of the spooners to get entrees from the pastrycooks and fancy that i am to be deceived with their stories about their french cook then again there is jack puddingtoni saw that honest fellow tother day quite in a rage because as chance would have it sir john carver asked him to meet the very same party he had met at colonel cramleys the day before and he had not got up a new set of stories to entertain them poor dinnergiving snobs you dont know what small thanks you get for all your pains and money how we diningout snobs sneer at your cookery and poohpooh your old hock and are incredulous about your fourandsixpenny champagne and know that the sidedishes of today are rechauffes from the dinner of yesterday and mark how certain dishes are whisked off the table untasted so that they may figure at the banquet tomorrow whenever for my part i see the head man particularly anxious to escamoter a fricandeau or a blancmange i always call out and insist upon massacring it with a spoon all this sort of conduct makes one popular with the dinnergiving snob one friend of mine i know has made a prodigious sensation in good society by announcing apropos of certain dishes when offered to him that he never eats aspic except at lord tittups and that lady jimmys chef is the only man in london who knows how to dressfilet en serpenteauor supreme de volaille aux truffes    chapter xxdinnergiving snobs further considered  if my friends would but follow the present prevailing fashion i think they ought to give me a testimonial for the paper on dinnergiving snobs which i am now writing what do you say now to a handsome comfortable dinnerservice of plate not including plates for i hold silver plates to be sheer wantonness and would almost as soon think of silver teacups a couple of neat teapots a coffeepot trays c with a little inscription to my wife mrs snob and a halfscore of silver tankards for the little snoblings to glitter on the homely table where they partake of their quotidian mutton  if i had my way and my plans could be carried out dinnergiving would increase as much on the one hand as dinnergiving snobbishness would diminishto my mind the most amiable part of the work lately published by my esteemed friend if upon a very brief acquaintance he will allow me to call him so alexis soyer the regeneratorwhat he in his noble style would call the most succulent savoury and elegant passagesare those which relate not to the grand banquets and ceremonial dinners but to his dinners at home  the dinner at home ought to be the centre of the whole system of dinnergiving your usual style of mealthat is plenteous comfortable and in its perfectionshould be that to which you welcome your friends as it is that of which you partake yourself  for towards what woman in the world do i entertain a higher regard than towards the beloved partner of my existence mrs snob who should have a greater place in my affections than her six brothers three or four of whom we are pretty sure will favour us with their company at seven oclock or her angelic mother my own valued motherinlawfor whom finally would i wish to cater more generously than for your very humble servant the present writer now nobody supposes that the birmingham plate is had out the disguised carpetbeaters introduced to the exclusion of the neat parlourmaid the miserable entrees from the pastrycooks ordered in and the children packed off as it is supposed to the nursery but really only to the staircase down which they slide during the dinnertime waylaying the dishes as they come out and fingering the round bumps on the jellies and the forcedmeat balls in the soupnobody i say supposes that a dinner at home is characterized by the horrible ceremony the foolish makeshifts the mean pomp and ostentation which distinguish our banquets on grand fielddays  such a notion is monstrous i would as soon think of having my dearest bessy sitting opposite me in a turban and bird of paradise and showing her jolly mottled arms out of blond sleeves in her famous red satin gown ay or of having mr toole every day in a white waistcoat at my back shouting silence faw the chair  now if this be the case if the brummagemplate pomp and the processions of disguised footmen are odious and foolish in everyday life why not always why should jones and i who are in the middle rank alter the modes of our being to assume an eclat which does not belong to usto entertain our friends who if we are worth anything and honest fellows at bottom are men of the middle rank too who are not in the least deceived by our temporary splendour and who play off exactly the same absurd trick upon us when they ask us to dine  if it be pleasant to dine with your friends as all persons with good stomachs and kindly hearts will i presume allow it to be it is better to dine twice than to dine once it is impossible for men of small means to be continually spending fiveandtwenty or thirty shillings on each friend who sits down to their table people dine for less i myself have seen at my favourite club the senior united service his grace the duke of wellington quite contented with the joint oneandthree and halfpint of sherry nine and if his grace why not you and i  this rule i have made and found the benefit of whenever i ask a couple of dukes and a marquis or so to dine with me i set them down to a piece of beef or a legofmutton and trimmings the grandees thank you for this simplicity and appreciate the same my dear jones ask any of those whom you have the honour of knowing if such be not the case  i am far from wishing that their graces should treat me in a similar fashion splendour is a part of their station as decent comfort let us trust of yours and mine fate has comfortably appointed gold plate for some and has bidden others contentedly to wear the willowpattern and being perfectly contented indeed humbly thankfulfor look around o jones and see the myriads who are not so fortunate to wear honest linen while magnificos of the world are adorned with cambric and pointlace surely we ought to hold as miserable envious fools those wretched beaux tibbss of society who sport a lace dickey and nothing besidesthe poor silly jays who trail a peacocks feather behind them and think to simulate the gorgeous bird whose nature it is to strut on palaceterraces and to flaunt his magnificent fantail in the sunshine  the jays with peacocks feathers are the snobs of this world and never since the days of aesop were they more numerous in any land than they are at present in this free country  how does this most ancient apologue apply to the subject in handthe dinnergiving snob the imitation of the great is universal in this city from the palaces of kensingtonia and belgravia even to the remotest corner of brunswick square  peacocks feathers are stuck in the tails of most families scarce one of us domestic birds but imitates the lanky pavonine strut and shrill genteel scream o you misguided dinnergiving snobs think how much pleasure you lose and how much mischief you do with your absurd grandeurs and hypocrisies you stuff each other with unnatural forcedmeats and entertain each other to the ruin of friendship let alone health and the destruction of hospitality and goodfellowshipyou who but for the peacocks tail might chatter away so much at your ease and be so jovial and happy  when a man goes into a great set company of dinnergiving and dinnerreceiving snobs if he has a philosophical turn of mind he will consider what a huge humbug the whole affair is the dishes and the drink and the servants and the plate and the host and hostess and the conversation and the companythe philosopher included  the host is smiling and hobnobbing and talking up and down the table but a prey to secret terrors and anxieties lest the wines he has brought up from the cellar should prove insufficient lest a corked bottle should destroy his calculations or our friend the carpetbeater by making some bevue should disclose his real quality of greengrocer and show that he is not the family butler  the hostess is smiling resolutely through all the courses smiling through her agony though her heart is in the kitchen and she is speculating with terror lest there be any disaster there if the souffle should collapse or if wiggins does not send the ices in timeshe feels as if she would commit suicidethat smiling jolly woman  the children upstairs are yelling as their maid is crimping their miserable ringlets with hot tongs tearing miss emmys hair out by the roots or scrubbing miss pollys dumpy nose with mottled soap till the little wretch screams herself into fits the young males of the family are employed as we have stated in piratical exploits upon the landingplace  the servants are not servants but the beforementioned retail tradesmen  the plate is not plate but a mere shiny birmingham lacquer and so is the hospitality and everything else  the talk is birmingham talk the wag of the party with bitterness in his heart having just quitted his laundress who is dunning him for her bill is firing off good stories and the opposition wag is furious that he cannot get an innings jawkins the great conversationalist is scornful and indignant with the pair of them because he is kept out of court young muscadel that cheap dandy is talking fashion and almacks out of the morning post and disgusting his neighbour mrs fox who reflects that she has never been there the widow is vexed out of patience because her daughter maria has got a place beside young cambric the penniless curate and not by colonel goldmore the rich widower from india the doctors wife is sulky because she has not been led out before the barristers lady old doctor cork is grumbling at the wine and guttleton sneering at the cookery  and to think that all these people might be so happy and easy and friendly were they brought together in a natural unpretentious way and but for an unhappy passion for peacocks feathers in england gentle shades of marat and robespierre when i see how all the honesty of society is corrupted among us by the miserable fashionworship i feel as angry as mrs fox just mentioned and ready to order a general battue of peacocks    chapter xxisome continental snobs  now that september has come and all our parliamentary duties are over perhaps no class of snobs are in such high feather as the continental snobs i watch these daily as they commence their migrations from the beach at folkestone i see shoals of them depart not perhaps without an innate longing too to quit the island along with those happy snobs farewell dear friends i say you little know that the individual who regards you from the beach is your friend and historiographer and brother  i went today to see our excellent friend snooks on board the queen of the french many scores of snobs were there on the deck of that fine ship marching forth in their pride and bravery they will be at ostend in four hours they will inundate the continent next week they will carry into far lands the famous image of the british snob i shall not see thembut am with them in spirit and indeed there is hardly a country in the known and civilized world in which these eyes have not beheld them  i have seen snobs in pink coats and huntingboots scouring over the campagna of rome and have heard their oaths and their wellknown slang in the galleries of the vatican and under the shadowy arches of the colosseum i have met a snob on a dromedary in the desert and picnicking under the pyramid of cheops i like to think how many gallant british snobs there are at this minute of writing pushing their heads out of every window in the courtyard of meurices in the rue de rivoli or roaring out garsong du pang garsong du yang or swaggering down the toledo at naples or even how many will be on the lookout for snooks on ostend pierfor snooks and the rest of the snobs on board the queen of the french  look at the marquis of carabas and his two carriages my lady marchioness comes on board looks round with that happy air of mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship and rushes to her carriage for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other snobs on deck there she sits and will be ill in private the strawberry leaves on her chariotpanels are engraved on her ladyships heart if she were going to heaven instead of to ostend i rather think she would expect to have des places reservees for her and would send to order the best rooms a courier with his moneybag of office round his shouldersa huge scowling footman whose dark pepperandsalt livery glistens with the heraldic insignia of the carabasesa brazenlooking tawdry french femmedechambre none but a female pen can do justice to that wonderful tawdry toilette of the ladysmaid en voyageand a miserable dame de compagnie are ministering to the wants of her ladyship and her king charless spaniel they are rushing to and fro with eaudecologne pockethandkerchiefs which are all fringe and cipher and popping mysterious cushions behind and before and in every available corner of the carriage  the little marquis her husband is walking about the deck in a bewildered manner with a lean daughter on each arm the carrotytufted hope of the family is already smoking on the foredeck in a travelling costume checked all over and in little lacquertip pod jean boots and a shirt embroidered with pink boaconstrictors what is it that gives travelling snobs such a marvellous propensity to rush into a costume why should a man not travel in a coat c but think proper to dress himself like a harlequin in mourning see even young aldermanbury the tallowmerchant who has just stepped on board has got a travellingdress gaping all over with pockets and little tom tapeworm the lawyers clerk out of the city who has but three weeks leave turns out in gaiters and a brannew shootingjacket and must let the moustaches grow on his little sniffy upper lip forsooth  pompey hicks is giving elaborate directions to his servant and asking loudly davis wheres the dwessingcase and davis youd best take the pistolcase into the cabin little pompey travels with a dressingcase and without a beard whom he is going to shoot with his pistols who on earth can tell and what he is to do with his servant but wait upon him i am at a loss to conjecture  look at honest nathan houndsditch and his lady and their little son what a noble air of blazing contentment illuminates the features of those snobs of eastern race what a toilette houndsditchs is what rings and chains what goldheaded canes and diamonds what a tuft the rogue has got to his chin the rogue he will never spare himself any cheap enjoyment little houndsditch has a little cane with a gilt head and little mosaic ornamentsaltogether an extra air as for the lady she is all the colours of the rainbow she has a pink parasol with a white lining and a yellow bonnet and an emerald green shawl and a shotsilk pelisse and drab boots and rhubarbcoloured gloves and particoloured glass buttons expanding from the size of a fourpennypiece to a crown glitter and twiddle all down the front of her gorgeous costume i have said before i like to look at the peoples on their gala days they are so picturesquely and outrageously splendid and happy  yonder comes captain bull spick and span tight and trim who travels for four or six months every year of his life who does not commit himself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour but i think is as great a snob as any man on board bull passes the season in london sponging for dinners and sleeping in a garret near his club abroad he has been everywhere he knows the best wine at every inn in every capital in europe lives with the best english company there has seen every palace and picturegallery from madrid to stockholm speaks an abominable little jargon of halfadozen languagesand knows nothingnothing bull hunts tufts on the continent and is a sort of amateur courier he will scrape acquaintance with old carabas before they make ostend and will remind his lordship that he met him at vienna twenty years ago or gave him a glass of schnapps up the righi we have said bull knows nothing he knows the birth arms and pedigree of all the peerage has poked his little eyes into every one of the carriages on boardtheir panels noted and their crests surveyed he knows all the continental stories of english scandalhow count towrowski ran off with miss baggs at napleshow very thick lady smigsmag was with young cornichon of the french legation at florencethe exact amount which jack deuceace won of bob greengoose at badenwhat it is that made the staggs settle on the continent the sum for which the ogoggarty estates are mortgaged c if he cant catch a lord he will hook on to a baronet or else the old wretch will catch hold of some beardless young stripling of fashion and show him life in various and amiable and inaccessible quarters faugh the old brute if he has every one of the vices of the most boisterous youth at least he is comforted by having no conscience he is utterly stupid but of a jovial turn he believes himself to be quite a respectable member of society but perhaps the only good action he ever did in his life is the involuntary one of giving an example to be avoided and showing what an odious thing in the social picture is that figure of the debauched old man who passes through life rather a decorous silenus and dies some day in his garret alone unrepenting and unnoted save by his astonished heirs who find that the dissolute old miser has left money behind him see he is up to old carabas already i told you he would  yonder you see the old lady mary macscrew and those middleaged young women her daughters they are going to cheapen and haggle in belgium and up the rhine until they meet with a boardinghouse where they can live upon less boardwages than her ladyship pays her footmen but she will exact and receive considerable respect from the british snobs located in the watering place which she selects for her summer residence being the daughter of the earl of haggistoun that broadshouldered buck with the great whiskers and the cleaned white kidgloves is mr phelim clancy of poldoodystown he calls himself mr de clancy he endeavours to disguise his native brogue with the richest superposition of english and if you play at billiards or ecarte with him the chances are that you will win the first game and he the seven or eight games ensuing  that overgrown lady with the four daughters and the young dandy from the university her son is mrs kewsy the eminent barristers lady who would rather die than not be in the fashion she has the peerage in her carpetbag you may be sure but she is altogether cut out by mrs quod the attorneys wife whose carriage with the apparatus of rumbles dickeys and imperials scarcely yields in splendour to the marquis of carabass own travellingchariot and whose courier has even bigger whiskers and a larger morocco moneybag than the marquiss own travelling gentleman remark her well she is talking to mr spout the new member for jawborough who is going out to inspect the operations of the zollverein and will put some very severe questions to lord palmerston next session upon england and her relations with the prussianblue trade the naplessoap trade the germantinder trade c spout will patronize king leopold at brussels will write letters from abroad to the jawborough independent and in his quality of member du parliamong britannique will expect to be invited to a family dinner with every sovereign whose dominions he honours with a visit during his tour  the next person isbut hark the bell for shore is ringing and shaking snooks hand cordially we rush on to the pier waving him a farewell as the noble black ship cuts keenly through the sunny azure waters bearing away that cargo of snobs outward bound    chapter xxiicontinental snobbery continued  we are accustomed to laugh at the french for their braggadocio propensities and intolerable vanity about la france la gloire lempereur and the like and yet i think in my heart that the british snob for conceit and selfsufficiency and braggartism in his way is without a parallel there is always something uneasy in a frenchmans conceit he brags with so much fury shrieking and gesticulation yells out so loudly that the francais is at the head of civilization the centre of thought c that one cant but see the poor fellow has a lurking doubt in his own mind that he is not the wonder he professes to be  about the british snob on the contrary there is commonly no noise no bluster but the calmness of profound conviction we are better than all the world we dont question the opinion at all its an axiom and when a frenchman bellows out la france monsieur la france est a la tete du monde civilise we laugh goodnaturedly at the frantic poor devil we are the first chop of the world we know the fact so well in our secret hearts that a claim set up elsewhere is simply ludicrous my dear brother reader say as a man of honour if you are not of this opinion do you think a frenchman your equal you dontyou gallant british snobyou know you dont no more perhaps does the snob your humble servant brother  and i am inclined to think it is this conviction and the consequent bearing of the englishman towards the foreigner whom he condescends to visit this confidence of superiority which holds up the head of the owner of every english hatbox from sicily to st petersburg that makes us so magnificently hated throughout europe as we are thismore than all our little victories and of which many frenchmen and spaniards have never heardthis amazing and indomitable insular pride which animates my lord in his travellingcarriage as well as john in the rumble  if you read the old chronicles of the french wars you find precisely the same character of the englishman and henry vs people behaved with just the cool domineering manner of our gallant veterans of france and the peninsula did you never hear colonel cutler and major slasher talking over the war after dinner or captain boarder describing his action with the indomptable hang the fellows says boarder their practice was very good i was beat off three times before i took her cuss those carabineers of milhauds says slasher what work they made of our light cavalry implying a sort of surprise that the frenchman should stand up against britons at all a goodnatured wonder that the blind mad vainglorious brave poor devils should actually have the courage to resist an englishman legions of such englishmen are patronizing europe at this moment being kind to the pope or goodnatured to the king of holland or condescending to inspect the prussian reviews when nicholas came here who reviews a quarter of a million of pairs of moustaches to his breakfast every morning we took him off to windsor and showed him two whole regiments of six or eight hundred britons apiece with an air as much as to saythere my boy look at that those are englishmen those are and your master whenever you please as the nursery song says the british snob is long long past scepticism and can afford to laugh quite goodhumouredly at those conceited yankees or besotted little frenchmen who set up as models of mankind they forsooth  i have been led into these remarks by listening to an old fellow at the hotel du nord at boulogne and who is evidently of the slasher sort he came down and seated himself at the breakfasttable with a surly scowl on his salmoncoloured bloodshot face strangling in a tight crossbarred cravat his linen and his appointments so perfectly stiff and spotless that everybody at once recognized him as a dear countryman only our portwine and other admirable institutions could have produced a figure so insolent so stupid so gentlemanlike after a while our attention was called to him by his roaring out in a voice of plethoric fury o  everybody turned round at the o conceiving the colonel to be as his countenance denoted him in intense pain but the waiters knew better and instead of being alarmed brought the colonel the kettle o it appears is the french for hotwater the colonel though he despises it heartily thinks he speaks the language remarkably well whilst he was inhausting his smoking tea which went rolling and gurgling down his throat and hissing over the hot coppers of that respectable veteran a friend joined him with a wizened face and very black wig evidently a colonel too  the two warriors waggling their old heads at each other presently joined breakfast and fell into conversation and we had the advantage of hearing about the old war and some pleasant conjectures as to the next which they considered imminent they pshad the french fleet they poohpoohd the french commercial marine they showed how in a war there would be a cordon a cordong by of steamers along our coast and by  ready at a minute to land anywhere on the other shore to give the french as good a thrashing as they got in the last war by  in fact a rumbling cannonade of oaths was fired by the two veterans during the whole of their conversation  there was a frenchman in the room but as he had not been above ten years in london of course he did not speak the language and lost the benefit of the conversation but o my country said i to myself its no wonder that you are so beloved if i were a frenchman how i would hate you  that brutal ignorant peevish bully of an englishman is showing himself in every city of europe one of the dullest creatures under heaven he goes travelling europe under foot shouldering his way into galleries and cathedrals and bustling into palaces with his buckram uniform at church or theatre gala or picturegallery his face never varies a thousand delightful sights pass before his bloodshot eyes and dont affect him countless brilliant scenes of life and manners are shown him but never move him he goes to church and calls the practices there degrading and superstitious as if his altar was the only one that was acceptable he goes to picturegalleries and is more ignorant about art than a french shoeblack art nature pass and there is no dot of admiration in his stupid eyes nothing moves him except when a very great man comes his way and then the rigid proud selfconfident inflexible british snob can be as humble as a flunkey and as supple as a harlequin    chapter xxiiienglish snobs on the continent  what is the use of lord romes telescope my friend panwiski exclaimed the other day it only enables you to see a few hundred thousands of miles farther what were thought to be mere nebulae turn out to be most perceivable starry systems and beyond these you see other nebulae which a more powerful glass will show to be stars again and so they go on glittering and winking away into eternity with which my friend pan heaving a great sigh as if confessing his inability to look infinity in the face sank back resigned and swallowed a large bumper of claret  i who like other great men have but one idea thought to myself that as the stars are so are the snobsthe more you gaze upon those luminaries the more you beholdnow nebulously congregatednow faintly distinguishablenow brightly defineduntil they twinkle off in endless blazes and fade into the immeasurable darkness i am but as a child playing on the seashore some telescopic philosopher will arise one day some great snobonomer to find the laws of the great science which we are now merely playing with and to define and settle and classify that which is at present but vague theory and loose though elegant assertion  yes a single eye can but trace a very few and simple varieties of the enormous universe of snobs i sometimes think of appealing to the public and calling together a congress of savans such as met at southamptoneach to bring his contributions and read his paper on the great subject for what can a single poor few do even with the subject at present in hand english snobs on the continentthough they are a hundred thousand times less numerous than on their native island yet even these few are too many one can only fix a stray one here and there the individuals are caughtthe thousands escape i have noted down but three whom i have met with in my walk this morning through this pleasant marine city of boulogne  there is the english raff snob that frequents estaminets and cabarets who is heard yelling we wont go home till morning and startling the midnight echoes of quiet continental towns with shrieks of english slang the boozy unshorn wretch is seen hovering round quays as packets arrive and tippling drains in inn bars where he gets credit he talks french with slang familiarity he and his like quite people the debtprisons on the continent he plays pool at the billiardhouses and may be seen engaged at cards and dominoes of forenoons his signature is to be seen on countless bills of exchange it belonged to an honourable family once very likely for the english raff most probably began by being a gentleman and has a father over the water who is ashamed to hear his name he has cheated the old governor repeatedly in better days and swindled his sisters of their portions and robbed his younger brothers now he is living on his wifes jointure she is hidden away in some dismal garret patching shabby finery and cobbling up old clothes for her childrenthe most miserable and slatternly of women  or sometimes the poor woman and her daughters go about timidly giving lessons in english and music or do embroidery and work underhand to purchase the means for the potaufeu while raff is swaggering on the quay or tossing off glasses of cognac at the cafÉ the unfortunate creature has a child still every year and her constant hypocrisy is to try and make her girls believe that their father is a respectable man and to huddle him out of the way when the brute comes home drunk  those poor ruined souls get together and have a society of their own the which it is very affecting to watchthose tawdry pretences at gentility those flimsy attempts at gaiety those woful sallies that jingling old piano oh it makes the heart sick to see and hear them as mrs raff with her company of pale daughters gives a penny tea to mrs diddler they talk about bygone times and the fine society they kept and they sing feeble songs out of tattered old musicbooks and while engaged in this sort of entertainment in comes captain raff with his greasy hat on one side and straightway the whole of the dismal room reeks with a mingled odour of smoke and spirits  has not everybody who has lived abroad met captain raff his name is proclaimed every now and then by mr sheriffs officer hemp and about boulogne and paris and brussels there are so many of his sort that i will lay a wager that i shall be accused of gross personality for showing him up many a less irreclaimable villain is transported many a more honourable man is at present at the treadmill and although we are the noblest greatest most religious and most moral people in the world i would still like to know where except in the united kingdom debts are a matter of joke and making tradesmen suffer a sport that gentlemen own to it is dishonourable to owe money in france you never hear people in other parts of europe brag of their swindling or see a prison in a large continental town which is not more or less peopled with english rogues  a still more loathsome and dangerous snob than the above transparent and passive scamp is frequent on the continent of europe and my young snob friends who are travelling thither should be especially warned against him captain legg is a gentleman like raff though perhaps of a better degree he has robbed his family too but of a great deal more and has boldly dishonoured bills for thousands where raff has been boggling over the clumsy conveyance of a tenpound note legg is always at the best inn with the finest waistcoats and moustaches or tearing about in the flashest of britzkas while poor raff is tipsifying himself with spirits and smoking cheap tobacco it is amazing to think that legg so often shown up and known everywhere is flourishing yet he would sink into utter ruin but for the constant and ardent love of gentility that distinguishes the english snob there is many a young fellow of the middle classes who must know legg to be a rogue and a cheat and yet from his desire to be in the fashion and his admiration of tiptop swells and from his ambition to air himself by the side of a lords son will let legg make an income out of him content to pay so long as he can enjoy that society many a worthy father of a family when he hears that his son is riding about with captain legg lord levants son is rather pleased that young hopeful should be in such good company  legg and his friend major macer make professional tours through europe and are to be found at the right places at the right time last year i heard how my young acquaintance mr muff from oxford going to see a little life at a carnival ball at paris was accosted by an englishman who did not know a word of the dlanguage and hearing muff speak it so admirably begged him to interpret to a waiter with whom there was a dispute about refreshments it was quite a comfort the stranger said to see an honest english face and did muff know where there was a good place for supper so those two went to supper and who should come in of all men in the world but major macer and so legg introduced macer and so there came on a little intimacy and threecard loo c c year after year scores of muffs in various places in the world are victimised by legg and macer the story is so stale the trick of seduction so entirely old and clumsy that it is only a wonder people can be taken in any more but the temptations of vice and gentility together are too much for young english snobs and those simple young victims are caught fresh every day though it is only to be kicked and cheated by men of fashion your true british snob will present himself for the honour  i need not allude here to that very common british snob who makes desperate efforts at becoming intimate with the great continental aristocracy such as old rolls the baker who has set up his quarters in the faubourg saint germain and will receive none but carlists and no french gentleman under the rank of a marquis we can all of us laugh at that fellows pretensions well enoughwe who tremble before a great man of our own nation but as you say my brave and honest john bull of a snob a french marquis of twenty descents is very different from an english peer and a pack of beggarly german and italian fuersten and principi awaken the scorn of an honestminded briton but our aristocracythats a very different matter they are the real leaders of the worldthe real old original andnomistake nobility  off with your cap snob down on your knees snob and truckle    chapter xxivon some country snobs  tired of the town where the sight of the closed shutters of the nobility my friends makes my heart sick in my walks afraid almost to sit in those vast pall mall solitudes the clubs and of annoying the club waiters who might i thought be going to shoot in the country but for me i determined on a brief tour in the provinces and paying some visits in the country which were long due  my first visit was to my friend major ponto hp of the horse marines in mangelwurzelshire the major in his little phaeton was in waiting to take me up at the station the vehicle was not certainly splendid but such a carriage as would accommodate a plain man as ponto said he was and a numerous family we drove by beautiful fresh fields and green hedges through a cheerful english landscape the highroad as smooth and trim as the way in a noblemans park was charmingly chequered with cool shade and golden sunshine rustics in snowy smockfrocks jerked their hats off smiling as we passed children with cheeks as red as the apples in the orchards bobbed curtsies to us at the cottagedoors blue church spires rose here and there in the distance and as the buxom gardeners wife opened the white gate at the majors little ivycovered lodge and we drove through the neat plantations of firs and evergreens up to the house my bosom felt a joy and elation which i thought it was impossible to experience in the smoky atmosphere of a town here i mentally exclaimed is all peace plenty happiness here i shall be rid of snobs there can be none in this charming arcadian spot  stripes the majors man formerly corporal in his gallant corps received my portmanteau and an elegant little present which i had brought from town as a peaceoffering to mrs ponto viz a cod and oysters from groves in a hamper about the size of a coffin  pontos house the evergreens mrs p has christened it is a perfect paradise of a place it is all over creepers and bowwindows and verandahs a wavy lawn tumbles up and down all round it with flowerbeds of wonderful shapes and zigzag gravel walks and beautiful but damp shrubberies of myrtles and glistening laurustines which have procured it its change of name it was called little bullocks pound in old doctor pontos time i had a view of the pretty grounds and the stable and the adjoining village and church and a great park beyond from the windows of the bedroom whither ponto conducted me it was the yellow bedroom the freshest and pleasantest of bedchambers the air was fragrant with a large bouquet that was placed on the writingtable the linen was fragrant with the lavender in which it had been laid the chintz hangings of the bed and the big sofa were if not fragrant with flowers at least painted all over with them the penwiper on the table was the imitation of a double dahlia and there was accommodation for my watch in a sunflower on the mantelpiece a scarletleaved creeper came curling over the windows through which the setting sun was pouring a flood of golden light it was all flowers and freshness oh how unlike those black chimneypots in st albans place london on which these weary eyes are accustomed to look  it must be all happiness here ponto said i flinging myself down into the snug bergere and inhaling such a delicious draught of country air as all the millefleurs of mr atkinsons shop cannot impart to any the most expensive pockethandkerchief  nice place isnt it said ponto quiet and unpretending i like everything quiet youve not brought your valet with you stripes will arrange your dressing things and that functionary entering at the same time proceeded to gut my portmanteau and to lay out the black kerseymeres the rich cut velvet genoa waistcoat the white choker and other polite articles of evening costume with great gravity and despatch a great dinnerparty thinks i to myself seeing these preparations and not perhaps displeased at the idea that some of the best people in the neighbourhood were coming to see me hark theres the first bell ringing said ponto moving away and in fact a clamorous harbinger of victuals began clanging from the stable turret and announced the agreeable fact that dinner would appear in halfanhour if the dinner is as grand as the dinnerbell thought i faith im in good quarters and had leisure during the halfhours interval not only to advance my own person to the utmost polish of elegance which it is capable of receiving to admire the pedigree of the pontos hanging over the chimney and the ponto crest and arms emblazoned on the washhand basin and jug but to make a thousand reflections on the happiness of a country lifeupon the innocent friendliness and cordiality of rustic intercourse and to sigh for an opportunity of retiring like ponto to my own fields to my own vine and figtree with a placens uxor in my domus and a halfscore of sweet young pledges of affection sporting round my paternal knee  clang at the end of thirty minutes dinnerbell number two pealed from the adjacent turret i hastened downstairs expecting to find a score of healthy country folk in the drawingroom there was only one person there a tall and romannosed lady glistering over with bugles in deep mourning she rose advanced two steps made a majestic curtsey during which all the bugles in her awful headdress began to twiddle and quiverand then said mr snob we are very happy to see you at the evergreens and heaved a great sigh  this then was mrs major ponto to whom making my very best bow i replied that i was very proud to make her acquaintance as also that of so charming a place as the evergreens  another sigh we are distantly related mr snob said she shaking her melancholy head poor dear lord rubadub  oh said i not knowing what the deuce mrs major ponto meant  major ponto told me that you were of the leicestershire snobs a very old family and related to lord snobbington who married laura rubadub who is a cousin of mine as was her poor dear father for whom we are mourning what a seizure only sixtythree and apoplexy quite unknown until now in our family in life we are in death mr snob does lady snobbington bear the deprivation well  why really maam ii dont know i replied more and more confused  as she was speaking i heard a sort of cloop by which wellknown sound i was aware that somebody was opening a bottle of wine and ponto entered in a huge white neckcloth and a rather shabby black suit  my love mrs major ponto said to her husband we were talking of our cousinpoor dear lord rubadub his death has placed some of the first families in england in mourning does lady rubadub keep the house in hill street do you know  i didnt know but i said i believe she does at a venture and looking down to the drawingroom table saw the inevitable abominable maniacal absurd disgusting peerage open on the table interleaved with annotations and open at the article snobbington  dinner is served says stripes flinging open the door and i gave mrs major ponto my arm    chapter xxva visit to some country snobs  of the dinner to which we now sat down i am not going to be a severe critic the mahogany i hold to be inviolable but this i will say that i prefer sherry to marsala when i can get it and the latter was the wine of which i have no doubt i heard the cloop just before dinner nor was it particularly good of its kind however mrs major ponto did not evidently know the difference for she called the liquor amontillado during the whole of the repast and drank but half a glass of it leaving the rest for the major and his guest  stripes was in the livery of the ponto familya thought shabby but gorgeous in the extremelots of magnificent worsted lace and livery buttons of a very notable size the honest fellows hands i remarked were very large and black and a fine odour of the stable was wafted about the room as he moved to and fro in his ministration i should have preferred a clean maidservant but the sensations of londoners are too acute perhaps on these subjects and a faithful john after all is more genteel  from the circumstance of the dinner being composed of pigshead mockturtle soup of pigs fry and roast ribs of pork i am led to imagine that one of pontos black hampshires had been sacrificed a short time previous to my visit it was an excellent and comfortable repast only there was rather a sameness in it certainly i made a similar remark the next day  during the dinner mrs ponto asked me many questions regarding the nobility my relatives when lady angelina skeggs would come out and if the countess her mamma this was said with much archness and heheing still wore that extraordinary purple hairdye whether my lord guttlebury kept besides his french chef and an english cordonbleu for the roasts an italian for the confectionery  who attended at lady clapperclaws conversazioni and whether sir john champignons thursday mornings were pleasant was it true that lady carabas wanting to pawn her diamonds found that they were paste and that the marquis had disposed of them beforehand how was it that snuffin the great tobaccomerchant broke off the marriage which was on the tapis between him and their second daughter and was it true that a mulatto lady came over from the havanna and forbade the match  upon my word madam i had begun and was going on to say that i didnt know one word about all these matters which seemed so to interest mrs major ponto when the major giving me a tread or stamp with his large foot under the table saidcome come snob my boy we are all tiled you know we know youre one of the fashionable people about town we saw your name at lady clapperclaws soirees and the champignon breakfasts and as for the rubadubs of course as relations   oh of course i dine there twice aweek i said and then i remembered that my cousin humphry snob of the middle temple is a great frequenter of genteel societies and to have seen his name in the morning post at the tagend of several party lists so taking the hint i am ashamed to say i indulged mrs major ponto with a deal of information about the first families in england such as would astonish those great personages if they knew it i described to her most accurately the three reigning beauties of last season at almacks told her in confidence that his grace the d of w was going to be married the day after his statue was put up that his grace the d of d was also about to lead the fourth daughter of the archduke stephen to the hymeneal altarand talked to her in a word just in the style of mrs gores last fashionable novel  mrs major was quite fascinated by this brilliant conversation she began to trot out scraps of french just for all the world as they do in the novels and kissed her hand to me quite graciously telling me to come soon to caffy ung pu de musick o salongwith which she tripped off like an elderly fairy  shall i open a bottle of port or do you ever drink such a thing as hollands and water says ponto looking ruefully at me this was a very different style of thing to what i had been led to expect from him at our smokingroom at the club where he swaggers about his horses and his cellar and slapping me on the shoulder used to say come down to mangelwurzelshire snob my boy and ill give you as good a days shooting and as good a glass of claret as any in the countywell i said i like hollands much better than port and gin even better than hollands this was lucky it was gin and stripes brought in hot water on a splendid plated tray  the jingling of a harp and piano soon announced that mrs pontos ung pu de musick had commenced and the smell of the stable again entering the diningroom in the person of stripes summoned us to caffy and the little concert she beckoned me with a winning smile to the sofa on which she made room for me and where we could command a fine view of the backs of the young ladies who were performing the musical entertainment very broad backs they were too strictly according to the present mode for crinoline or its substitutes is not an expensive luxury and young people in the country can afford to be in the fashion at very trifling charges miss emily ponto at the piano and her sister maria at that somewhat exploded instrument the harp were in light blue dresses that looked all flounce and spread out like mr greens balloon when inflated  brilliant touch emily haswhat a fine arm marias is mrs ponto remarked goodnaturedly pointing out the merits of her daughters and waving her own arm in such a way as to show that she was not a little satisfied with the beauty of that member i observed she had about nine bracelets and bangles consisting of chains and padlocks the majors miniature and a variety of brass serpents with fiery ruby or tender turquoise eyes writhing up to her elbow almost in the most profuse contortions  you recognize those polkas they were played at devonshire house on the 23rd of july the day of the grand fête so i said yesi knew em quite intimately and began wagging my head as if in acknowledgment of those old friends  when the performance was concluded i had the felicity of a presentation and conversation with the two tall and scraggy miss pontos and miss wirt the governess sat down to entertain us with variations on sich a gettin up stairs they were determined to be in the fashion  for the performance of the gettin up stairs i have no other name but that it was a stunner first miss wirt with great deliberation played the original and beautiful melody cutting it as it were out of the instrument and firing off each note so loud clear and sharp that i am sure stripes must have heard it in the stable  what a finger says mrs ponto and indeed it was a finger as knotted as a turkeys drumstick and splaying all over the piano when she had banged out the tune slowly she began a different manner of gettin up stairs and did so with a fury and swiftness quite incredible she spun up stairs she whirled up stairs she galloped up stairs she rattled up stairs and then having got the tune to the top landing as it were she hurled it down again shrieking to the bottom floor where it sank in a crash as if exhausted by the breathless rapidity of the descent then miss wirt played the gettin up stairs with the most pathetic and ravishing solemnity plaintive moans and sobs issued from the keysyou wept and trembled as you were gettin up stairs miss wirts hands seemed to faint and wail and die in variations again and she went up with a savage clang and rush of trumpets as if miss wirt was storming a breach and although i knew nothing of music as i sat and listened with my mouth open to this wonderful display my caffy grew cold and i wondered the windows did not crack and the chandelier start out of the beam at the sound of this earthquake of a piece of music  glorious creature isnt she said mrs ponto squirtzs favourite pupilinestimable to have such a creature lady carabas would give her eyes for her a prodigy of accomplishments thank you miss wirtand the young ladies gave a heave and a gasp of admirationa deepbreathing gushing sound such as you hear at church when the sermon comes to a full stop  miss wirt put her two great doubleknuckled hands round a waist of her two pupils and said my dear children i hope you will be able to play it soon as well as your poor little governess when i lived with the dunsinanes it was the dear duchesss favourite and lady barbara and lady jane mcbeth learned it it was while hearing jane play that i remember that dear lord castletoddy first fell in love with her and though he is but an irish peer with not more than fifteen thousand a year i persuaded jane to have him do you know castletoddy mr snobround towerssweet placecounty mayo old lord castletoddy the present lord was then lord inishowan was a most eccentric old manthey say he was mad i heard his royal highness the poor dear duke of sussexsuch a man my dears but alas addicted to smokingi heard his royal highness say to the marquis of anglesey i am sure castletoddy is mad but inishowan wasnt in marrying my sweet jane though the dear child had but her ten thousand pounds pour tout potage  most invaluable person whispered mrs major ponto to me has lived in the very highest society and i who have been accustomed to see governesses bullied in the world was delighted to find this one ruling the roast and to think that even the majestic mrs ponto bent before her  as for my pipe so to speak it went out at once i hadnt a word to say against a woman who was intimate with every duchess in the red book she wasnt the rosebud but she had been near it she had rubbed shoulders with the great and about these we talked all the evening incessantly and about the fashions and about the court until bedtime came  and are there snobs in this elysium i exclaimed jumping into the lavenderperfumed bed pontos snoring boomed from the neighbouring bedroom in reply    chapter xxvion some country snobs  something like a journal of the proceedings at the evergreens may be interesting to those foreign readers of punch who want to know the customs of an english gentlemans family and household theres plenty of time to keep the journal pianostrumming begins at six oclock in the morning it lasts till breakfast with but a minutes intermission when the instrument changes hands and miss emily practises in place of her sister miss maria  in fact the confounded instrument never stops when the young ladies are at their lessons miss wirt hammers away at those stunning variations and keeps her magnificent finger in exercise  i asked this great creature in what other branches of education she instructed her pupils the modern languages says she modestly french german spanish and italian latin and the rudiments of greek if desired english of course the practice of elocution geography and astronomy and the use of the globes algebra but only as far as quadratic equations for a poor ignorant female you know mr snob cannot be expected to know everything ancient and modern history no young woman can be without and of these i make my beloved pupils perfect mistresses botany geology and mineralogy i consider as amusements and with these i assure you we manage to pass the days at the evergreens not unpleasantly  only these thought iwhat an education but i looked in one of miss pontos manuscript songbooks and found five faults of french in four words and in a waggish mood asking miss wirt whether dante algiery was so called because he was born at algiers received a smiling answer in the affirmative which made me rather doubt about the accuracy of miss wirts knowledge  when the above little morning occupations are concluded these unfortunate young women perform what they call calisthenic exercises in the garden i saw them today without any crinoline pulling the gardenroller  dear mrs ponto was in the garden too and as limp as her daughters in a faded bandeau of hair in a battered bonnet in a holland pinafore in pattens on a broken chair snipping leaves off a vine mrs ponto measures many yards about in an evening ye heavens what a guy she is in that skeleton morningcostume  besides stripes they keep a boy called thomas or tummus tummus works in the garden or about the pigsty and stable thomas wears a pages costume of eruptive buttons  when anybody calls and stripes is out of the way tummus flings himself like mad into thomass clothes and comes out metamorphosed like harlequin in the pantomime today as mrs p was cutting the grapevine as the young ladies were at the roller down comes tummus like a roaring whirlwind with missus missus theres company coomin away skurry the young ladies from the roller down comes mrs p from the old chair off flies tummus to change his clothes and in an incredibly short space of time sir john hawbuck my lady hawbuck and master hugh hawbuck are introduced into the garden with brazen effrontery by thomas who says please sir jan and my lady to walk this year way i know missus is in the rosegarden  and there sure enough she was  in a pretty little garden bonnet with beautiful curling ringlets with the smartest of aprons and the freshest of pearlcoloured gloves this amazing woman was in the arms of her dearest lady hawbuck dearest lady hawbuck how good of you always among my flowers cant live away from them  sweets to the sweet humahahaw says sir john hawbuck who piques himself on his gallantry and says nothing without ahumahaahaw  whereth yaw pinnafaw cries master hugh we thaw you in it over the wall didnt we pa  humahaahaw burst out sir john dreadfully alarmed wheres ponto why wasnt he at quarter sessions how are his birds this year mrs pontohave those carabas pheasants done any harm to your wheat ahumahaahaw and all this while he was making the most ferocious and desperate signals to his youthful heir  well she wath in her pinnafaw wathnt she ma says hugh quite unabashed which question lady hawbuck turned away with a sudden query regarding her dear darling daughters and the enfant terrible was removed by his father  i hope you werent disturbed by the music ponto says my girls you know practise four hours a day you knowmust do it you knowabsolutely necessary as for me you know im an early man and in my farm every morning at fiveno no laziness for me  the facts are these ponto goes to sleep directly after dinner on entering the drawingroom and wakes up when the ladies leave off practice at ten from seven till ten from ten till five is a very fair allowance of slumber for a man who says hes not a lazy man it is my private opinion that when ponto retires to what is called his study he sleeps too he locks himself up there daily two hours with the newspaper  i saw the hawbuck scene out of the study which commands the garden its a curious object that study pontos library mostly consists of boots he and stripes have important interviews here of mornings when the potatoes are discussed or the fate of the calf ordained or sentence passed on the pig c all the majors bills are docketed on the study table and displayed like a lawyers briefs here too lie displayed his hooks knives and other gardening irons his whistles and strings of spare buttons he has a drawer of endless brown paper for parcels and another containing a prodigious and neverfailing supply of string what a man can want with so many gigwhips i can never conceive these and fishingrods and landingnets and spurs and boottrees and balls for horses and surgical implements for the same and favourite pots of shiny blacking with which he paints his own shoes in the most elegant manner and buckskin gloves stretched out on their trees and his gorget sash and sabre of the horse marines with his boothooks underneath in atrophy and the family medicinechest and in a corner the very rod with which he used to whip his son wellesley ponto when a boy wellesley never entered the study but for that awful purposeall these with moggs road book the gardeners chronicle and a backgammonboard form the majors library under the trophy theres a picture of mrs ponto in a light blue dress and train and no waist when she was first married a foxs brush lies over the frame and serves to keep the dust off that work of art  my librarys small says ponto with the most amazing impudence but well selected my boywell selected i have been reading the history of england all the morning    chapter xxviia visit to some country snobs  we had the fish which as the kind reader may remember i had brought down in a delicate attention to mrs ponto to variegate the repast of next day and cod and oystersauce twice laid salt cod and scolloped oysters formed parts of the bill of fare until i began to fancy that the ponto family like our late revered monarch george ii had a fancy for stale fish and about this time the pig being consumed we began upon a sheep  but how shall i forget the solemn splendour of a second course which was served up in great state by stripes in a silver dish and cove a napkin round his dirty thumbs and consisted of a landrail not much bigger than a corpulent sparrow  my love will you take any game says ponto with prodigious gravity and stuck his fork into that little mouthful of an island in the silver sea stripes too at intervals dribbled out the marsala with a solemnity which would have done honour to a dukes butler the bamnecides dinner to shacabac was only one degree removed from these solemn banquets  as there were plenty of pretty country places close by a comfortable country town with good houses of gentlefolks a beautiful old parsonage close to the church whither we went and where the carabas family have their ancestral carved and monumented gothic pew and every appearance of good society in the neighbourhood i rather wondered we were not enlivened by the appearance of some of the neighbours at the evergreens and asked about them  we cant in our position of lifewe cant well associate with the attorneys family as i leave you to suppose says mrs ponto confidentially of course not i answered though i didnt know why and the doctor said i  a most excellent worthy creature says mrs p saved marias lifereally a learned man but what can one do in ones position one may ask ones medical man to ones table certainly but his family my dear mr snob  halfadozen little gallipots interposed miss wirt the governess he he he and the young ladies laughed in chorus  we only live with the county families miss wirt 1 continued tossing up her head the duke is abroad we are at feud with the carabases the ringwoods dont come down till christmas in fact nobodys here till the hunting seasonpositively nobody  whose is the large red house just outside of the town  what the chateaucalicot he he he that purseproud exlinendraper mr yardley with the yellow liveries and the wife in red velvet how can you my dear mr snob be so satirical the impertinence of those people is really something quite overwhelming  well then there is the parson doctor chrysostom hes a gentleman at any rate at this mrs ponto looked at miss wirt after their eyes had met and they had wagged their heads at each other they looked up to the ceiling so did the young ladies they thrilled it was evident i had said something terrible another black sheep in the church thought i with a little sorrow for i dont care to own that i have a respect for the cloth ihope theres nothing wrong  wrong says mrs p clasping her hands with a tragic air  oh says miss wirt and the two girls gasping in chorus  well says i im very sorry for it i never saw a nicerlooking old gentleman or a better school or heard a better sermon  he used to preach those sermons in a surplice hissed out mrs ponto hes a puseyite mr snob  heavenly powers says i admiring the pure ardour of these female theologians and stripes came in with the tea its so weak that no wonder pontos sleep isnt disturbed by it  of mornings we used to go out shooting we had pontos own fields to sport over where we got the landrail and the nonpreserved part of the hawbuck property and one evening in a stubble of pontos skirting the carabas woods we got among some pheasants and had some real sport i shot a hen i know greatly to my delight bag it says ponto in rather a hurried manner heres somebody coming so i pocketed the bird  you infernal poaching thieves roars out a man from the hedge in the garb of a gamekeeper i wish i could catch you on this side of the hedge id put a brace of barrels into you that i would  curse that snapper says ponto moving off hes always watching me like a spy  carry off the birds you sneaks and sell em in london roars the individual who it appears was a keeper of lord carabas youll get six shillings a brace for em  you know the price of em well enough and so does your master too you scoundrel says ponto still retreating  we kill em on our ground cries mr snapper we dont set traps for other peoples birds were no decoy ducks were no sneaking poachers we dont shoot ens like that ere cockney whos got the tail of one asticking out of his pocket only just come across the hedge thats all  i tell you what says stripes who was out with us as keeper this day in fact hes keeper coachman gardener valet and bailiff with tummus under him if youll come across john snapper and take your coat off ill give you such a whopping as youve never had since the last time i did it at guttlebury fair  whop one of your own weight mr snapper said whistling his dogs and disappearing into the wood and so we came out of this controversy rather victoriously but i began to alter my preconceived ideas of rural felicity  notes  1 i have since heard that this aristocratic ladys father was a liverybutton maker in st martins lane where he met with misfortunes and his daughter acquired her taste for heraldry but it may be told to her credit that out of her earnings she has kept the bedridden old bankrupt in great comfort and secrecy at pentonville and furnished her brothers outfit for the cadetship which her patron lord swigglebiggle gave her when he was at the board of control i have this information from a friend to hear miss wirt herself you would fancy that her papa was a rothschild and that the markets of europe were convulsed when he went into the gazette    chapter xxviiion some country snobs  be hanged to your aristocrats ponto said in some conversation we had regarding the family at carabas between whom and the evergreens there was a feud when i first came into the countyit was the year before sir john buff contested in the blue interestthe marquis then lord st michaels who of course was orange to the core paid me and mrs ponto such attentions that i fairly confess i was taken in by the old humbug and thought that id met with a rare neighbour gad sir we used to get pines from carabas and pheasants from carabas and it wasponto when will you come over and shootandponto our pheasants want thinningand my lady would insist upon her dear mrs ponto coming over to carabas to sleep and put me i dont know to what expense for turbans and velvet gowns for my wifes toilette well sir the election takes place and though i was always a liberal personal friendship of course induces me to plump for st michaels who comes in at the head of the poll next year mrs p insists upon going to townwith lodgings in clarges street at ten pounds a week with a hired brougham and new dresses for herself and the girls and the deuce and all to pay our first cards were to carabas house my ladys are returned by a great big flunkey and i leave you to fancy my poor betsys discomfiture as the lodginghouse maid took in the cards and lady st michaels drives away though she actually saw us at the drawingroom window would you believe it sir that though we called four times afterwards those infernal aristocrats never returned our visit that though lady st michaels gave nine dinnerparties and four dejeuners that season she never asked us to one and that she cut us dead at the opera though betsy was nodding to her the whole night we wrote to her for tickets for almacks she writes to say that all hers were promised and said in the presence of wiggins her ladysmaid who told it to diggs my wifes woman that she couldnt conceive how people in our station of life could so far forget themselves as to wish to appear in any such place go to castle carabas id sooner die than set my foot in the house of that impertinent insolvent insolent jackanapesand i hold him in scorn after this ponto gave me some private information regarding lord carabass pecuniary affairs how he owed money all over the county how jukes the carpenter was utterly ruined and couldnt get a shilling of his bill how biggs the butcher hanged himself for the same reason how the six big footmen never received a guinea of wages and snaffle the state coachman actually took off his blownglass wig of ceremony and flung it at lady carabass feet on the terrace before the castle all which stories as they are private i do not think proper to divulge but these details did not stifle my desire to see the famous mansion of castle carabas nay possibly excited my interest to know more about that lordly house and its owners  at the entrance of the park there are a pair of great gaunt mildewed lodgesmouldy doric temples with black chimneypots in the finest classic taste and the gates of course are surmounted by the chats bottes the wellknown supporters of the carabas family give the lodgekeeper a shilling says ponto who drove me near to it in his fourwheeled crueltychaise i warrant its the first piece of ready money he has received for some time i dont know whether there was any foundation for this sneer but the gratuity was received with a curtsey and the gate opened for me to enter poor old porteress says i inwardly you little know that it is the historian of snobs whom you let in the gates were passed a damp green stretch of park spread right and left immeasurably confined by a chilly grey wall and a damp long straight road between two huge rows of moist dismal limetrees leads up to the castle in the midst of the park is a great black tank or lake bristling over with rushes and here and there covered over with patches of peasoup a shabby temple rises on an island in this delectable lake which is approached by a rotten barge that lies at roost in a dilapidated boat house clumps of elms and oaks dot over the huge green flat every one of them would have been down long since but that the marquis is not allowed to cut the timber  up that long avenue the snobographer walked in solitude at the seventyninth tree on the lefthand side the insolvent butcher hanged himself i scarcely wondered at the dismal deed so woful and sad were the impressions connected with the place so for a mile and a half i walkedalone and thinking of death  i forgot to say the house is in full view all the wayexcept when intercepted by the trees on the miserable island in the lakean enormous redbrick mansion square vast and dingy it is flanked by four stone towers with weathercocks in the midst of the grand facade is a huge ionic portico approached by a vast lonely ghastly staircase rows of black windows framed in stone stretch on either side right and leftthree storeys and eighteen windows of a row you may see a picture of the palace and staircase in the views of england and wales with four carved and gilt carriages waiting at the gravel walk and several parties of ladies and gentlemen in wigs and hoops dotting the fatiguing lines of stairs  but these stairs are made in great houses for people not to ascend the first lady carabas they are but eighty years in the peerage if she got out of her gilt coach in a shower would be wet to the skin before she got halfway to the carved ionic portico where four dreary statues of peace plenty piety and patriotism are the only sentinels you enter these palaces by backdoors that was the way the carabases got their peerage the misanthropic ponto said after dinner  welli rang the bell at a little low sidedoor it clanged and jingled and echoed for a long long while till at length a face as of a housekeeper peered through the door and as she saw my hand in my waistcoat pocket opened it unhappy lonely housekeeper i thought is miss crusoe in her island more solitary the door clapped to and i was in castle carabas  the side entrance and all says the housekeeper the halligator hover the mantelpiece was brought home by hadmiral st michaels when a capting with lord hanson the harms on the cheers is the harms of the carabas family the hall was rather comfortable we went clapping up a clean stone backstair and then into a back passage cheerfully decorated with ragged lightgreen

the grandjunction canal venis by candleetty and italian bandix by slavata rosaand so this worthy woman went on from one room into another from the blue room to the green and the green to the grand saloon and the grand saloon to the tapestry closet cackling her list of pictures and wonders and furtively turning up a corner of brown holland to show the colour of the old faded seedy mouldy dismal hangings  at last we came to her ladyships bedroom in the centre of this dreary apartment there is a bed about the size of one of those whizgig temples in which the genius appears in a pantomime the huge gilt edifice is approached by steps and so tall that it might be let off in floors for sleepingrooms for all the carabas family an awful bed a murder might be done at one end of that bed and people sleeping at the other end be ignorant of it gracious powers fancy little lord carabas in a nightcap ascending those steps after putting out the candle  the sight of that seedy and solitary splendour was too much for me i should go mad were i that lonely housekeeperin those enormous galleriesin that lonely library filled up with ghastly folios that nobody dares read with an inkstand on the centre table like the coffin of a baby and sad portraits staring at you from the bleak walls with their solemn mouldy eyes no wonder that carabas does not come down here often  it would require two thousand footmen to make the place cheerful no wonder the coachman resigned his wig that the masters are insolvent and the servants perish in this huge dreary outatelbow place  a single family has no more right to build itself a temple of that sort than to erect a tower of babel such a habitation is not decent for a mere mortal man but after all i suppose poor carabas had no choice fate put him there as it sent napoleon to st helena suppose it had been decreed by nature that you and i should be marquises we wouldnt refuse i suppose but take castle carabas and all with debts duns and mean makeshifts and shabby pride and swindling magnificence  next season when i read of lady carabass splendid entertainments in the morning post and see the poor old insolvent cantering through the parki shall have a much tenderer interest in these great people than i have had heretofore poor old shabby snob ride on and fancy the world is still on its knees before the house of carabas give yourself airs poor old bankrupt magnifico who are under moneyobligations to your flunkeys and must stoop so as to swindle poor tradesmen and for us o my brother snobs oughtnt we to feel happy if our walk through life is more even and that we are out of the reach of that surprising arrogance and that astounding meanness to which this wretched old victim is obliged to mount and descend    chapter xxixa visit to some country snobs  notable as my reception had been under that unfortunate mistake of mrs ponto that i was related to lord snobbington which i was not permitted to correct it was nothing compared to the bowing and kotooing the raptures and flurry which preceded and welcomed the visit of a real live lord and lords son a brother officer of cornet wellesley ponto in the 120th hussars who came over with the young cornet from guttlebury where their distinguished regiment was quartered this was my lord gules lord saltires grandson and heir a very young short sandyhaired and tobaccosmoking nobleman who cannot have left the nursery very long and who though he accepted the honest majors invitation to the evergreens in a letter written in a schoolboy handwriting with a number of faults of spelling may yet be a very fine classical scholar for what i know having had his education at eton where he and young ponto were inseparable  at any rate if he cant write he has mastered a number of other accomplishments wonderful for one of his age and size he is one of the best shots and riders in england he rode his horse abracadabra and won the famous guttlebury steeplechase he has horses entered at half the races in the country under other peoples names for the old lord is a strict hand and will not hear of betting or gambling he has lost and won such sums of money as my lord george himself might be proud of he knows all the stables and all the jockeys and has all the information and is a match for the best leg at newmarket nobody was ever known to be too much for him at play or in the stable  although his grandfather makes him a moderate allowance by the aid of postobits and convenient friends he can live in a splendour becoming his rank he has not distinguished himself in the knocking down of policemen much he is not big enough for that but as a lightweight his skill is of the very highest order at billiards he is said to be firstrate he drinks and smokes as much as any two of the biggest officers in his regiment with such high talents who can say how far he may not go he may take to politics as a delassement and be prime minister after lord george bentinck  my young friend wellesley ponto is a gaunt and bony youth with a pale face profusely blotched from his continually pulling something on his chin i am led to fancy that he believes he has what is called an imperial growing there that is not the only tuft that is hunted in the family by the way he cant of course indulge in those expensive amusements which render his aristocratic comrade so respected he bets pretty freely when he is in cash and rides when somebody mounts him for he cant afford more than his regulation chargers at drinking he is by no means inferior and why do you think he brought his noble friend lord gules to the evergreenswhy because he intended to ask his mother to order his father to pay his debts which she couldnt refuse before such an exalted presence young ponto gave me all this information with the most engaging frankness we are old friends i used to tip him when he was at school  gad says he our wedgments so doothid exthpenthif must hunt you know a man couldnt live in the wedgment if he didnt mess expenses enawmuth must dine at mess must drink champagne and claret ours aint a port and sherry lightinfantry mess

the governor is very sulky about shelling out just to talk my mother over who can do anything with him gules told her that i was fitzstultzs favourite of the whole regiment and gad she thinks the horse guards will give me my troop for nothing and he humbugged the governor that i was the greatest screw in the army aint it a good dodge  with this wellesley left me to go and smoke a cigar in the stables with lord gules and make merry over the cattle there under stripess superintendence young ponto laughed with his friend at the venerable fourwheeled crueltychaise but seemed amazed that the latter should ridicule still more an ancient chariot of the build of 1824 emblazoned immensely with the arme of the pontos and the snaileys from which latter distinguished family mrs ponto issued  i found poor pon in his study among his boots in such a rueful attitude of despondency that i could not but remark it look at that says the poor fellow handing me over a document its the second change in uniform since hes been in the army and yet theres no extravagance about the lad lord gules tells me he is the most careful youngster in the regiment god bless him but look at that by heaven snob look at that and say how can a man of nine hundred keep out of the bench he gave a sob as he handed me the paper across the table and his old face and his old corduroys and his shrunk shootingjacket

that evening mrs ponto and her family made their darling wellesley give a full true and particular account of everything that had taken place at lord fitzstultzs how many servants waited at dinner and how the ladies schneider dressed and what his royal highness said when he came down to shoot and who was there what a blessing that boy is to me said she as my pimplefaced young friend moved off to resume smoking operations with gules in the now vacant kitchenand poor pontos dreary and desperate look shall i ever forget that  o you parents and guardians o you men and women of sense in england o you legislators about to assemble in parliament read over that tailors bill above printed read over that absurd catalogue of insane gimcracks and madmans tomfooleryand say how are you ever to get rid of snobbishness when society does so much for its education  three hundred and forty pounds for a young chaps saddle and breeches before george i would rather be a hottentot or a highlander we laugh at poor jocko the monkey dancing in uniform or at poor jeames the flunkey with his quivering calves and plush tights or at the nigger marquis of marmalade dressed out with sabre and epaulets and giving himself the airs of a fieldmarshal lo is not one of the queens pyebalds in full fig as great and foolish a monster    chapter xxxon some country snobs  at last came that fortunate day at the evergreens when i was to be made acquainted with some of the county families with whom only people of pontos rank condescended to associate and now although poor ponto had just been so cruelly made to bleed on occasion of his sons new uniform and though he was in the direst and most cutthroat spirits with an overdrawn account at the bankers and other pressing evils of poverty although a tenpenny bottle of marsala and an awful parsimony presided generally at his table yet the poor fellow was obliged to assume the most frank and jovial air of cordiality and all the covers being removed from the hangings and new dresses being procured for the young ladies and the family plate being unlocked and displayed the house and all within assumed a benevolent and festive appearance the kitchen fires began to blaze the good wine ascended from the cellar a professed cook actually came over from guttlebury to compile culinary abominations stripes was in a new coat and so was ponto for a wonder and tummuss buttonsuit was worn en permanence  and all this to show off the little lord thinks i all this in honour of a stupid little cigarrified cornet of dragoons who can barely write his namewhile an eminent and profound moralist likesomebodyis fobbed off with cold mutton and relays of pig well well a martyrdom of cold mutton is just bearable i pardon mrs ponto from my heart i do especially as i wouldnt turn out of the best bedroom in spite of all her hints but held my ground in the chintz tester vowing that lord gules as a young man was quite small and hardy enough to make himself comfortable elsewhere  the great ponto party was a very august one the hawbucks came in their family coach with the bloodred band emblazoned all over it and their man in yellow livery waited in country fashion at table only to be exceeded in splendour by the hipsleys the opposition baronet in light blue the old ladies fitzague drove over in their little old chariot with the fat black horses the fat coachman the fat footmanwhy are dowagers horses and footmen always fat and soon after these personages had arrived with their auburn fronts and red beaks and turbans came the honourable and reverend lionel pettipois who with general and mrs sago formed the rest of the party lord and lady frederick howlet were asked but they have friends at ivybush mrs ponto told me and that very morning the castlehaggards sent an excuse as her ladyship had a return of the quinsy between ourselves lady castlehaggards quinsy always comes on when there is dinner at the evergreens  if the keeping of polite company could make a woman happy surely my kind hostess mrs ponto was on that day a happy woman every person present except the unlucky impostor who pretended to a connexion with the snobbington family and general sago who had brought home i dont know how many lacs of rupees from india was related to the peerage or the baronetage mrs p had her hearts desire if she had been an earls daughter herself could she have expected better companyand her family were in the oiltrade at bristol as all her friends very well know  what i complained of in my heart was not the diningwhich for this once was plentiful and comfortable enoughbut the prodigious dulness of the talking part of the entertainment o my beloved brother snobs of the city if we love each other no better than our country brethren at least we amuse each other more if we bore ourselves we are not called upon to go ten miles to do it  for instance the hipsleys came ten miles from the south and the hawbucks ten miles from the north of the evergreens and were magnates in two different divisions of the county of mangelwurzelshire hipsley who is an old baronet with a bothered estate did not care to show his contempt for hawbuck who is a new creation and rich hawbuck on his part gives himself patronizing airs to general sago who looks upon the pontos as little better than paupers old lady blanche says ponto i hope will leave something to her goddaughtermy second girlweve all of us halfpoisoned ourselves with taking her physic  lady blanche and lady rose fitzague have the first a medical and the second a literary turn i am inclined to believe the former had a wet compresse around her body on the occasion when i had the happiness of meeting her she doctors everybody in the neighbourhood of which she is the ornament and has tried everything on her own person she went into court and testified publicly her faith in st john long she swore by doctor buchan she took quantities of gambouges universal medicine and whole boxfuls of parrs life pills she has cured a multiplicity of headaches by squinstones eyesnuff she wears a picture of hahnemann in her bracelet and a lock of priessnitzs hair in a brooch she talked about her own complaints and those of her confidante for the time being to every lady in the room successively from our hostess down to miss wirt taking them into corners and whispering about bronchitis hepatitis st vitus neuralgia cephalalgia and so forth i observed poor fat lady hawbuck in a dreadful alarm after some communication regarding the state of her daughter miss lucy hawbucks health and mrs sago turned quite yellow and put down her third glass of madeira at a warning glance from lady blanche  lady rose talked literature and about the bookclub at guttlebury and is very strong in voyages and travels she has a prodigious interest in borneo and displayed a knowledge of the history of the punjaub and kaffirland that does credit to her memory old general sago who sat perfectly silent and plethoric roused up as from a lethargy when the former country was mentioned and gave the company his story about a hoghunt at ramjugger i observed her ladyship treated with something like contempt her neighbour the reverend lionel pettipois a young divine whom you may track through the country by little awakening books at halfacrown a hundred which dribble out of his pockets wherever he goes i saw him give miss wirt a sheaf of the little washerwoman on putney common and to miss hawbuck a couple of dozen of meat in the tray or the young butcherboy rescued and on paying a visit to guttlebury gaol i saw two notorious fellows waiting their trial there and temporarily occupied with a game of cribbage to whom his reverence offered a tract as he was walking over crackshins common and who robbed him of his purse umbrella and cambric handkerchief leaving him the tracts to distribute elsewhere    chapter xxxia visit to some country snobs  why dear mr snob said a young lady of rank and fashion to whom i present my best compliments if you found everything so snobbish at the evergreens if the pig bored you and the mutton was not to your liking and mrs ponto was a humbug and miss wirt a nuisance with her abominable piano practicewhy did you stay so long  ah miss what a question have you never heard of gallant british soldiers storming batteries of doctors passing nights in plague wards of lazarettos and other instances of martyrdom what do you suppose induced gentlemen to walk two miles up to the batteries of sabroan with a hundred and fifty thundering guns bowling them down by hundredsnot pleasure surely what causes your respected father to quit his comfortable home for his chambers after dinner and pore over the most dreary law papers until long past midnight mademoiselle duty which must be done alike by military or legal or literary gents theres a power of martyrdom in our profession  you wont believe it your rosy lips assume a smile of incredulitya most naughty and odious expression in a young ladys face well then the fact is that my chambers no 24 pump court temple were being painted by the honourable society and mrs slamkin my laundress having occasion to go into durham to see her daughter who is married and has presented her with the sweetest little grandsona few weeks could not be better spent than in rusticating but ah how delightful pump court looked when i revisited its wellknown chimneypots cari luoghi welcome welcome o fog and smut  but if you think there is no moral in the foregoing account of the pontine family you are madam most painfully mistaken in this very chapter we are going to have the moralwhy the whole of the papers are nothing but the moral setting forth as they do the folly of being a snob  you will remark that in the country snobography my poor friend ponto has been held up almost exclusively for the public gazeand why because we went to no other house because other families did not welcome us to their mahogany no no sir john hawbuck of the haws sir john hipsley of briary hall dont shut the gates of hospitality of general sagos mulligatawny i could speak from experience and the two old ladies at guttlebury were they nothing do you suppose that an agreeable young dog who shall be nameless would not be made welcome dont you know that people are too glad to see anybody in the country  but those dignified personages do not enter into the scheme of the present work and are but minor characters of our snob drama just as in the play kings and emperors are not half so important as many humble persons the doge of venice for instance gives way to othello who is but a nigger and the king of france to falconbridge who is a gentleman of positively no birth at all so with the exalted characters above mentioned i perfectly well recollect that the claret at hawbucks was not by any means so good as that of hipsleys while on the contrary some white hermitage at the haws by the way the butler only gave me half a glass each time was supernacular and i remember the conversations o madam madam how stupid they were the subsoil ploughing the pheasants and poaching the row about the representation of the county the earl of mangelwurzelshire being at variance with his relative and nominee the honourable marmaduke tomnoddy all these i could put down had i a mind to violate the confidence of private life and a great deal of conversation about the weather the mangelwurzelshire hunt new manures and eating and drinking of course  but cui bono in these perfectly stupid and honourable families there is not that snobbishness which it is our purpose to expose an ox is an oxa great hulking fatsided bellowing munching beef he ruminates according to his nature and consumes his destined portion of turnips or oilcake until the time comes for his disappearance from the pastures to be succeeded by other deeplunged and fatribbed animals perhaps we do not respect an ox we rather acquiesce in him the snob my dear madam is the frog that tries to swell himself to ox size let us pelt the silly brute out of his folly  look i pray you at the case of my unfortunate friend ponto a goodnatured kindly english gentlemannot overwise but quite passablefond of portwine of his family of country sports and agriculture hospitably minded with as pretty a little patrimonial countryhouse as heart can desire and a thousand pounds a year it is not much but entre nous people can live for less and not uncomfortably  for instance there is the doctor whom mrs p does not condescend to visit that man educates a mirific family and is loved by the poor for miles round and gives them portwine for physic and medicine gratis and how those people can get on with their pittance as mrs ponto says is a wonder to her  again there is the clergyman doctor chrysostommrs p says they quarrelled about puseyism but i am given to understand it was because mrs c had the pas of her at the hawsyou may see what the value of his living is any day in the clerical guide but you dont know what he gives away  even pettipois allows that in whose eyes the doctors surplice is a scarlet abomination and so does pettipois do his duty in his way and administer not only his tracts and his talk but his money and his means to his people as a lords son by the way mrs ponto is uncommonly anxious that he should marry either of the girls whom lord gules does not intend to choose  well although pons income would make up almost as much as that of these three worthies put togetheroh my dear madam see in what hopeless penury the poor fellow lives what tenant can look to his forbearance what poor man can hope for his charity masters the best of men honest stripes says and when we was in the ridgment a more freehanded chap didnt live but the way in which missus du scryou i wonder the young ladies is alive that i du  they live upon a fine governess and fine masters and have clothes made by lady carabass own milliner and their brother rides with earls to cover and only the best people in the county visit at the evergreens and mrs ponto thinks herself a paragon of wives and mothers and a wonder of the world for doing all this misery and humbug and snobbishness on a thousand a year  what an inexpressible comfort it was my dear madam when stripes put my portmanteau in the fourwheeled chaise and poor p on being touched with sciatica drove me over to carabas arms at guttlebury where we took leave there were some bagmen there in the commercial room and one talked about the house he represented and another about his dinner and a third about the inns on the road and so fortha talk not very wise but honest and to the purposeabout as good as that of the country gentlemen and oh how much pleasanter than listening to miss wirts showpieces on the piano and mrs pontos genteel cackle about the fashion and the county families    chapter xxxiisnobbium gatherum  when i see the great effect which these papers are producing on an intelligent public i have a strong hope that before long we shall have a regular snob department in the newspapers just as we have the police courts and the court news at present when a flagrant case of bonecrushing or poorlaw abuse occurs in the world who so eloquent as the times to point it out when a gross instance of snobbishness happens why should not the indignant journalist call the public attention to that delinquency too  how for instance could that wonderful case of the earl of mangelwurzel and his brother be examined in the snobbish point of view let alone the hectoring the bullying the vapouring the bad grammar the mutual recriminations liegivings challenges retractations which abound in the fraternal disputeput out of the question these points as concerning the individual nobleman and his relative with whose personal affairs we have nothing to doand consider how intimately corrupt how habitually grovelling and mean how entirely snobbish in a word a whole county must be which can find no better chiefs or leaders than these two gentlemen we dont want the great county of mangelwurzelshire seems to say that a man should be able to write good grammar or that he should keep a christian tongue in his head or that he should have the commonest decency of temper or even a fair share of good sense in order to represent us in parliament  all we require is that a man should be recommended to us by the earl of mangelwurzelshire and all that we require of the earl of mangelwurzelshire is that he should have fifty thousand a year and hunt the country o you pride of all snobland o you crawling truckling selfconfessed lackeys and parasites  but this is growing too savage dont let us forget our usual amenity and that tone of playfulness and sentiment with which the beloved reader and writer have pursued their mutual reflections hitherto well snobbishness pervades the little social farce as well as the great state comedy and the selfsame moral is tacked to either  there was for instance an account in the papers of a young lady who misled by a fortuneteller actually went part of the way to india as far as bagnigge wells i think in search of a husband who was promised her there do you suppose this poor deluded little soul would have left her shop for a man below her in rank or for anything but a darling of a captain in epaulets and a red coat it was her snobbish sentiment that misled her and made her vanities a prey to the swindling fortuneteller  case 2 was that of mademoiselle de saugrenue the interesting young frenchwoman with a profusion of jetty ringlets who lived for nothing at a boardinghouse at gosport was then conveyed to fareham gratis and being there and lying on the bed of the good old lady her entertainer the dear girl took occasion to rip open the mattress and steal a cashbox with which she fled to london how would you account for the prodigious benevolence exercised towards the interesting young french lady was it her jetty ringlets or her charming facebah do ladies love others for having faces and black hairshe said she was a relation of de saugrenue talked of her ladyship her aunt and of herself as a de saugrenue the honest boardinghouse people were at her feet at once good honest simple lordloving children of snobland  finally there was the case of the right honourable mr vernon at york the right honourable was the son of a nobleman and practised on an old lady he procured from her dinners money wearingapparel spoons implicit credence and an entire refit of linen then he cast his nets over a family of father mother and daughters one of whom he proposed to marry the father lent him money the mother made jams and pickles for him the daughters vied with each other in cooking dinners for the right honourableand what was the end one day the traitor fled with a teapot and a basketful of cold victuals it was the right honourable which baited the hook which gorged all these greedy simple snobs would they have been taken in by a commoner what old lady is there my dear sir who would take in you and me were we ever so ill to do and comfort us and clothe us and give us her money and her silver forks alas and alas what mortal man that speaks the truth can hope for such a landlady and yet all these instances of fond and credulous snobbishness have occurred in the same weeks paper with who knows how many score more  just as we had concluded the above remarks comes a pretty little note sealed with a pretty little butterflybearing a northern postmarkand to the following effect  19th november  mr punchtaking great interest in your snob papers we are very anxious to know under what class of that respectable fraternity you would designate us  we are three sisters from seventeen to twentytwo our father is honestly and truly of a very good family you will say it is snobbish to mention that but i wish to state the plain fact our maternal grandfather was an earl 1  we can afford to take in a stamped edition of you and all dickens works as fast as they come out but we do not keep such a thing as a peerage or even a baronetage in the house  we live with every comfort excellent cellar c c but as we cannot well afford a butler we have a neat tablemaid though our father was a military man has travelled much been in the best society c we have a coachman and helper but we dont put the latter into buttons nor make them wait at table like stripes and tummus 2  we are just the same to persons with a handle to their name as to those without it we wear a moderate modicum of crinoline 3and are never limp 4 in the morning we have good and abundant dinners on china though we have plate 5 and just as good when alone as with company  now my dear mr punch will you please give us a short answer in your next number and i will be so much obliged to you nobody knows we are writing to you not even our father nor will we ever tease 6 you again if you will only give us an answerjust for fun now do  if you get as far as this which is doubtful you will probably fling it into the fire if you do i cannot help it but i am of a sanguine disposition and entertain a lingering hope at all events i shall be impatient for next sunday for you reach us on that day and i am ashamed to confess we cannot resist opening you in the carriage driving home from church 7  i remain c c for myself and sisters  excuse this scrawl but i always write headlong 8  p syou were rather stupid last week dont you think 9 we keep no gamekeeper and yet have always abundant game for friends to shoot in spite of the poachers we never write on perfumed paperin short i cant help thinking that if you knew us you would not think us snobs  to this i reply in the following mannermy dear young ladies i know your posttown and shall be at church there the sunday after next when will you please to wear a tulip or some little trifle in your bonnets so that i may know you you will recognize me and my dressa quietlooking young fellow in a white topcoat a crimson satin neckcloth light blue trousers with glossy tipped boots and an emerald breastpin i shall have a black crape round my white hat and my usual bamboo cane with the richlygilt knob i am sorry there will be no time to get up moustaches between now and next week  from seventeen to twoandtwenty ye gods what ages dear young creatures i can see you all three seventeen suits me as nearest my own time of life but mind i dont say twoandtwenty is too old no no and that pretty roguish demure middle one peace peace thou silly little fluttering heart  you snobs dear young ladies i will pull any mans nose who says so there is no harm in being of a good family you cant help it poor dears whats in a name what is in a handle to it i confess openly that i should not object to being a duke myself and between ourselves you might see a worse leg for a garter  you snobs dear little goodnatured things no that is i hope noti think noti wont be too confidentnone of us should bethat we are not snobs that very confidence savours of arrogance and to be arrogant is to be a snob in all the social gradations from sneak to tyrant nature has placed a most wondrous and various progeny of snobs but are there no kindly natures no tender hearts no souls humble simple and truthloving ponder well on this question sweet young ladies and if you can answer it as no doubt you canlucky are youand lucky the respected herr papa and lucky the three handsome young gentlemen who are about to become each others brothersinlaw   1 the introduction of grandpapa is i fear snobbish  2 that is as you like i dont object to buttons in moderation  3 quite right  4 bless you  5 snobbish and i doubt whether you ought to dine as well alone as with company you will be getting too good dinners  6 we like to be teased but tell papa  7 o garters and stars what will captain gordon and exeter hall say to this  8 dear little enthusiast  9 you were never more mistaken miss in your life    chapter xxxiiisnobs and marriage  everybody of the middle rank who walks through this life with a sympathy for his companions on the same journeyat any rate every man who has been jostling in the world for some three or four lustresmust make no end of melancholy reflections upon the fate of those victims whom society that is snobbishness is immolating every day with love and simplicity and natural kindness snobbishness is perpetually at war people dare not be happy for fear of snobs people dare not love for fear of snobs people pine away lonely under the tyranny of snobs honest kindly hearts dry up and die gallant generous lads blooming with hearty youth swell into bloated oldbachelorhood and burst and tumble over tender girls wither into shrunken decay and perish solitary from whom snobbishness has cut off the common claim to happiness and affection with which nature endowed us all my heart grows sad as i see the blundering tyrants handiwork as i behold it i swell with cheap rage and glow with fury against the snob come down i say thou skulking dulness come down thou stupid bully and give up thy brutal ghost and i arm myself with the sword and spear and taking leave of my family go forth to do battle with that hideous ogre and giant that brutal despot in snob castle who holds so many gentle hearts in torture and thrall  when punch is king i declare there shall be no such thing as old maids and old bachelors the reverend mr malthus shall be burned annually instead of guy fawkes those who dont marry shall go into the workhouse it shall be a sin for the poorest not to have a pretty girl to love him  the above reflections came to mind after taking a walk with an old comrade jack spiggot by name who is just passing into the state of oldbachelorhood after the manly and blooming youth in which i remember him jack was one of the handsomest fellows in england when we entered together in the highland buffs but i quitted the cuttykilts early and lost sight of him for many years  ah how changed he is from those days he wears a waistband now and has begun to dye his whiskers his cheeks which were red are now mottled his eyes once so bright and steadfast are the colour of peeled plovers eggs  are you married jack says i remembering how consumedly in love he was with his cousin letty lovelace when the cuttykilts were quartered at strathbungo some twenty years ago  married no says he not money enough hard enough to keep myself much more a family on five hundred a year come to dickinsons theres some of the best madeira in london there my boy so we went and talked over old times the bill for dinner and wine consumed was prodigious and the quantity of brandyandwater that jack took showed what a regular boozer he was a guinea or two guineas what the devil do i care what i spend for my dinner says he  and letty lovelace says i  jacks countenance fell however he burst into a loud laugh presently letty lovelace says he shes letty lovelace still but gad such a wizened old woman shes as thin as a threadpaper you remember what a figure she had her nose has got red and her teeth blue shes always ill always quarrelling with the rest of the family always psalmsinging and always taking pills gad i had a rare escape there push round the grog old boy  straightway memory went back to the days when letty was the loveliest of blooming young creatures when to hear her sing was to make the heart jump into your throat when to see her dance was better than montessu or noblet they were the ballet queens of those days when jack used to wear a locket of her hair with a little gold chain round his neck and exhilarated with toddy after a sederunt of the cuttykilt mess used to pull out this token and kiss it and howl about it to the great amusement of the bottlenosed old major and the rest of the table  my father and hers couldnt put their horses together jack said the general wouldnt come down with more than six thousand my governor said it shouldnt be done under eight lovelace told him to go and be hanged and so we parted company they said she was in a decline gammon shes forty and as tough and as sour as this bit of lemonpeel dont put much into your punch snob my boy no man can stand punch after wine  and what are your pursuits jack says i  sold out when the governor died mother lives at bath go down there once a year for a week dreadful slow shilling whist four sistersall unmarried except the youngestawful work scotland in august italy in the winter cursed rheumatism come to london in march and toddle about at the club old boy and we wont go home till mawawrning till daylight does appear  and heres the wreck of two lives mused the present snobographer after taking leave of jack spiggot pretty merry letty lovelaces rudder lost and she cast away and handsome jack spiggot stranded on the shore like a drunken trinculo  what was it that insulted nature to use no higher name and perverted her kindly intentions towards them what cursed frost was it that nipped the love that both were bearing and condemned the girl to sour sterility and the lad to selfish oldbachelorhood it was the infernal snob tyrant who governs us all who says thou shalt not love without a ladys maid thou shalt not marry without a carriage and horses thou shalt have no wife in thy heart and no children on thy knee without a page in buttons and a french bonne thou shalt go to the devil unless thou hast a brougham marry poor and society shall forsake thee thy kinsmen shall avoid thee as a criminal thy aunts and uncles shall turn up their eyes and bemoan the sad sad manner in which tom or harry has thrown himself away you young woman may sell yourself without shame and marry old croesus you young man may lie away your heart and your life for a jointure but if you are poor woe be to you society the brutal snob autocrat consigns you to solitary perdition wither poor girl in your garret rot poor bachelor in your club  when i see those graceless reclusesthose unnatural monks and nuns of the order of st beelzebub 1 my hatred for snobs and their worship and their idols passes all continence let us hew down that maneating juggernaut i say that hideous dagon and i glow with the heroic courage of tom thumb and join battle with the giant snob  1 this of course is understood to apply only to those unmarried persons whom a mean and snobbish fear about money has kept from fulfilling their natural destiny many persons there are devoted to celibacy because they cannot help it of these a man would be a brute who spoke roughly indeed after miss otooles conduct to the writer he would be the last to condemn but never mind these are personal matters    chapter xxxivsnobs and marriage  in that noble romance called ten thousand a year i remember a profoundly pathetic description of the christian manner in which the hero mr aubrey bore his misfortunes after making a display of the most florid and grandiloquent resignation and quitting his country mansion the writer supposes aubrey to come to town in a postchaise and pair sitting bodkin probably between his wife and sister it is about seven oclock carriages are rattling about knockers are thundering and tears bedim the fine eyes of kate and mrs aubrey as they think that in happier times at this hourtheir aubrey used formerly to go out to dinner to the houses of the aristocracy his friends this is the gist of the passagethe elegant words i forget but the noble noble sentiment i shall always cherish and remember what can be more sublime than the notion of a great mans relatives in tears abouthis dinner with a few touches what author ever more happily described a snob  we were reading the passage lately at the house of my friend raymond gray esquire barristeratlaw an ingenuous youth without the least practice but who has luckily a great share of good spirits which enables him to bide his time and bear laughingly his humble position in the world meanwhile until it is altered the stern laws of necessity and the expenses of the northern circuit oblige mr gray to live in a very tiny mansion in a very queer small square in the airy neighbourhood of grays inn lane  what is the more remarkable is that gray has a wife there mrs gray was a miss harley baker and i suppose i need not say that is a respectable family allied to the cavendishes the oxfords the marrybones they still though rather dechus from their original splendour hold their heads as high as any mrs harley baker i know never goes to church without john behind to carry her prayerbook nor will miss welbeck her sister walk twenty yards ashopping without the protection of figby her sugarloaf page though the old lady is as ugly as any woman in the parish and as tall and whiskery as a grenadier the astonishment is how emily harley baker could have stooped to marry raymond gray she who was the prettiest and proudest of the family she who refused sir cockle byles of the bengal service she who turned up her little nose at essex temple qc and connected with the noble house of albyn she who had but 4000l pour tout potage to marry a man who had scarcely as much more a scream of wrath and indignation was uttered by the whole family when they heard of this mesalliance mrs harley baker never speaks of her daughter now but with tears in her eyes and as a ruined creature miss welbeck says i consider that man a villain and has denounced poor goodnatured mrs perkins as a swindler at whose ball the young people met for the first time  mr and mrs gray meanwhile live in grays inn lane aforesaid with a maidservant and a nurse whose hands are very full and in a most provoking and unnatural state of happiness they have never once thought of crying about their dinner like the wretchedly puling and snobbish womankind of my favourite snob aubrey of ten thousand a year but on the contrary accept such humble victuals as fate awards them with a most perfect and thankful good gracenay actually have a portion for a hungry friend at timesas the present writer can gratefully testify  i was mentioning these dinners and some admirable lemon puddings which mrs gray makes to our mutual friend the great mr goldmore the east india director when that gentlemans face assumed an expression of almost apoplectic terror and he gasped out what do they give dinners he seemed to think it a crime and a wonder that such people should dine at all and that it was their custom to huddle round their kitchenfire over a bone and a crust whenever he meets them in society it is a matter of wonder to him and he always expresses his surprise very loud how the lady can appear decently dressed and the man have an unpatched coat to his back i have heard him enlarge upon this poverty before the whole room at the conflagrative club to which he and i and gray have the honour to belong  we meet at the club on most days at halfpast four goldmore arrives in st jamess street from the city and you may see him reading the evening papers in the bowwindow of the club which enfilades pall malla large plethoric man with a bunch of seals in a large bowwindowed light waistcoat he has large coattails stuffed with agents letters and papers about companies of which he is a director his seals jingle as he walks i wish i had such a man for an uncle and that he himself were childless i would love and cherish him and be kind to him  at six oclock in the full season when all the world is in st jamess street and the carriages are cutting in and out among the cabs on the stand and the tufted dandies are showing their listless faces out of whites and you see respectable greyheaded gentlemen waggling their heads to each other through the plateglass windows of arthurs and the redcoats wish to be briareian so as to hold all the gentlemens horses and that wonderful redcoated royal porter is sunning himself before marlborough houseat the noon of london time you see a lightyellow carriage with black horses and a coachman in a tight flosssilk wig and two footmen in powder and white and yellow liveries and a large woman inside in shotsilk a poodle and a pink parasol which drives up to the gate of the conflagrative and the page goes and says to mr goldmore who is perfectly aware of the fact as he is looking out of the windows with about forty other conflagrative bucks your carriage sir g wags his head remember eight oclock precisely says he to mulligatawney the other east india director and ascending the carriage plumps down by the side of mrs goldmore for a drive in the park and then home to portland place as the carriage whirls off all the young bucks in the club feel a secret elation it is a part of their establishment as it were that carriage belongs to their club and their club belongs to them they follow the equipage with interest they eye it knowingly as they see it in the park but halt we are not come to the club snobs yet o my brave snobs what a flurry there will be among you when those papers appear  well you may judge from the above description what sort of a man goldmore is a dull and pompous leadenhall street croesus goodnatured withal and affablecruelly affable mr goldmore can never forget his lady used to say that it was mrs grays grandfather who sent him to india and though that young woman has made the most imprudent marriage in the world and has left her station in society her husband seems an ingenious and laborious young man and we shall do everything in our power to be of use to him so they used to ask the grays to dinner twice or thrice in a season when by way of increasing the kindness buff the butler is ordered to hire a fly to convey them to and from portland place  of course i am much too goodnatured a friend of both parties not to tell gray of goldmores opinion in him and the nabobs astonishment at the of the briefless barrister having any dinner at all indeed goldmores saying became a joke against gray amongst us wags at the club and we used to ask him when he tasted meat last whether we should bring him home something from dinner and cut a thousand other mad pranks with him in our facetious way  one day then coming home from the club mr gray conveyed to his wife the astounding information that he had asked goldmore to dinner  my love says mrs gray in a tremor how could you be so cruel why the diningroom wont hold mrs goldmore  make your mind easy mrs gray her ladyship is in paris it is only croesus thats coming and we are going to the play afterwardsto sadlers wells goldmore said at the club that he thought shakspeare was a great dramatic poet and ought to be patronized whereupon fired with enthusiasm i invited him to our banquet  goodness gracious what can we give him for dinner he has two french cooks you know mrs goldmore is always telling us about them and he dines with aldermen every day  a plain leg of mutton my lucy i prythee get ready at three have it tender and smoking and juicy and what better meat can there be  says gray quoting my favourite poet  but the cook is ill and you know that horrible pattypan the pastrycooks  silence frau says gray in a deep tragedy voice i will have the ordering of this repast do all things as i bid thee invite our friend snob here to partake of the feast be mine the task of procuring it  dont be expensive raymond says his wife  peace thou timid partner of the briefless one goldmores dinner shall be suited to our narrow means only do thou in all things my commands and seeing by the peculiar expression of the rogues countenance that some mad waggery was in preparation i awaited the morrow with anxiety    chapter xxxvsnobs and marriage  punctual to the hourby the way i cannot omit to mark down my hatred scorn and indignation towards those miserable snobs who come to dinner at nine when they are asked at eight in order to make a sensation in the company may the loathing of honest folks the backbiting of others the curses of cooks pursue these wretches and avenge the society on which they tramplepunctual i say to the hour of five which mr and mrs raymond gray had appointed a youth of an elegant appearance in a neat eveningdress whose trim whiskers indicated neatness whose light step denoted activity for in sooth he was hungry and always is at the dinner hour whatsoever that hour may be and whose rich golden hair curling down his shoulders was set off by a perfectly new fourandninepenny silk hat was seen wending his way down bittlestone street bittlestone square grays inn the person in question i need not say was mr snob he was never late when invited to dine but to proceed my narrative  mr snob may have flattered himself that he made a sensation as he strutted down bittlestone with his richly gilt knobbed cane and indeed i vow i saw heads looking at me from miss squilsbys the brassplated milliner opposite raymond grays who has three silverpaper bonnets and two flyblown prints of fashion in the window yet what was the emotion produced by my arrival compared to that which the little street thrilled when at five minutes past five the flosswigged coachman the yellow hammercloth and flunkeys the black horses and blazing silver harness of mr goldmore whirled down the street  it is a very little street of very little houses most of them with very large brass plates like miss squilsbys coalmerchants architects and surveyors two surgeons a solicitor a dancingmaster and of course several houseagents occupy the houseslittle twostoreyed edifices with little stucco porticoes goldmores carriage overtopped the roofs almost the first floors might shake hands with croesus as he lolled inside all the windows of those first floors thronged with children and women in a twinkling there was mrs hammerly in curlpapers mrs saxby with her front awry mr wriggles peering through the gauze curtains holding the while his hot glass of rumandwaterin fine a tremendous commotion in bittlestone street as the goldmore carriage drove up to mr raymond grays door  how kind it is of him to come with both the footmen says little mrs gray peeping at the vehicle too the huge domestic descending from his perch gave a rap at the door which almost drove in the building all the heads were out the sun was shining the very organboy paused the footman the coach and goldmores red face and white waistcoat were blazing in splendour the herculean plushed one went back to open the carriagedoor  raymond gray opened hisin his shirtsleeves he ran up to the carriage come in goldmore says he just in time my boy open the door whatdyecallum and let your master outand whatdyecallum obeyed mechanically with a face of wonder and horror only to be equalled by the look of stupefied astonishment which ornamented the purple countenance of his master  wawt taim will you please have the cage sir says whatdyecallum in that peculiar unspellable inimitable flunkefied pronunciation which forms one of the chief charms of existence  best have it to the theatre at night gray exclaims it is but a step from here to the wells and we can walk there ive got tickets for all be at sadlers wells at eleven  yes at eleven exclaims goldmore perturbedly and walks with a flurried step into the house as if he were going to execution as indeed he was with that wicked gray as a jack ketch over him the carriage drove away followed by numberless eyes from doorsteps and balconies its appearance is still a wonder in bittlestone street  go in there and amuse yourself with snob says gray opening the little drawingroom door ill call out as soon as the chops are ready fannys below seeing to the pudding  gracious mercy says goldmore to me quite confidentially how could he ask us i really had no idea of thisthis utter destitution  dinner dinner roars out gray from the diningroom whence issued a great smoking and frying and entering that apartment we find mrs gray ready to receive us and looking perfectly like a princess who by some accident had a bowl of potatoes in her hand which vegetables she placed on the table her husband was meanwhile cooking muttonchops on a gridiron over the fire  fanny has made the rolypoly pudding says he the chops are my part heres a fine one try this goldmore and he popped a fizzing cutlet on that gentlemans plate what words what notes of exclamation can describe the nabobs astonishment  the tablecloth was a very old one darned in a score places there was mustard in a teacup a silver fork for goldmoreall ours were iron  i wasnt born with a silver spoon in my mouth says gray gravely that fork is the only one we have fanny has it generally  raymondcries mrs gray with an imploring face she was used to better things you know and i hope one day to get her a dinnerservice im told the electroplate is uncommonly good where the deuce is that boy with the beer and now said he springing up ill be a gentleman and so he put on his coat and sat down quite gravely with four fresh muttonchops which he had by this time broiled  we dont have meat every day mr goldmore he continued and its a treat to me to get a dinner like this you little know you gentlemen of england who live at home at ease what hardships briefless barristers endure  gracious mercy says mr goldmore  wheres the halfandhalf fanny go over to the keys and get the beer heres sixpence and what was our astonishment when fanny got up as if to go  gracious mercy let me cries goldmore  not for worlds my dear sir shes used to it they wouldnt serve you as well as they serve her leave her alone law bless you raymond said with astounding composure and mrs gray left the room and actually came back with a tray on which there was a pewter flagon of beer little polly to whom at her christening i had the honour of presenting a silver mug ex officio followed with a couple of tobaccopipes and the queerest roguish look in her round little chubby face  did you speak to tapling about the gin fanny my dear gray asked after bidding polly put the pipes on the chimneypiece which that little person had some difficulty in reaching the last was turpentine and even your brewing didnt make good punch of it  you would hardly suspect goldmore that my wife a harley baker would ever make ginpunch i think my motherinlaw would commit suicide if she saw her  dont be always laughing at mamma raymond says mrs gray  well well she wouldnt die and i dont wish she would and you dont make ginpunch and you dont like it either andgoldmore do you drink your beer out of the glass or out of the pewter  gracious mercy ejaculates croesus once more as little polly taking the pot with both her little bunches of hands offers it smiling to that astonished director  and so in a word the dinner commenced and was presently ended in a similar fashion gray pursued his unfortunate guest with the most queer and outrageous description of his struggles misery and poverty he described how he cleaned the knives when they were first married and how he used to drag the children in a little cart how his wife could toss pancakes and what parts of his dress she made he told tibbits his clerk who was in fact the functionary who had brought the beer from the publichouse which mrs fanny had fetched from the neighbouring apartmentto fetch the bottle of portwine when the dinner was over and told goldmore as wonderful a history about the way in which that bottle of wine had come into his hands as any of his former stories had been when the repast was all over and it was near time to move to the play and mrs gray had retired and we were sitting ruminating rather silently over the last glasses of the port gray suddenly breaks the silence by slapping goldmore on the shoulder and saying now goldmore tell me something  what asks croesus  havent you had a good dinner  goldmore started as if a sudden truth had just dawned upon him he had had a good dinner and didnt know it until then the three muttonchops consumed by him were best of the mutton kind the potatoes were perfect of their order as for the rolypoly it was too good the porter was frothy and cool and the portwine was worthy of the gills of a bishop i speak with ulterior views for there is more in grays cellar  well says goldmore after a pause during which he took time to consider the momentous question gray put to him pon my wordnow you say soii havei really have had a monsous good dinnahmonsous good upon my ward heres your health gray my boy and your amiable lady and when mrs goldmore comes back i hope we shall see you more in portland place and with this the time came for the play and we went to see mr phelps at sadlers wells the best of this story for the truth of every word of which i pledge my honour is that after this banquet which goldmore enjoyed so the honest fellow felt a prodigious compassion and regard for the starving and miserable giver of the feast and determined to help him in his profession and being a director of the newlyestablished antibilious life assurance company he has had gray appointed standing counsel with a pretty annual fee and only yesterday in an appeal from bombay buckmuckjee bobbachee v ramchowderbahawder in the privy council lord brougham complimented mr gray who was in the case on his curious and exact knowledge of the sanscrit language  whether he knows sanscrit or not i cant say but goldmore got him the business and so i cannot help having a lurking regard for that pompous old bigwig    chapter xxxvisnobs and marriage  we bachelors in clubs are very much obliged to you says my old school and college companion essex temple for the opinion which you hold of us you call us selfish purplefaced bloated and other pretty names you state in the simplest possible terms that we shall go to the deuce you bid us rot in loneliness and deny us all claims to honesty conduct decent christian life who are you mr snob to judge us who are you with your infernal benevolent smirk and grin that laugh at all our generation  i will tell you my case says essex temple mine and my sister pollys and you may make what you like of it and sneer at old maids and bully old bachelors if you will  i will whisper to you confidentially that my sister was engaged to serjeant shirkera fellow whose talents one cannot deny and be hanged to them but whom i have always known to be mean selfish and a prig however women dont see these faults in the men whom love throws in their way shirker who has about as much warmth as an eel made up to polly years and years ago and was no bad match for a briefless barrister as he was then  have you ever read lord eldons life do you remember how the sordid old snob narrates his going out to purchase twopenceworth of sprats which he and mrs scott fried between them and how he parades his humility and exhibits his miserable povertyhe who at that time must have been making a thousand pounds a year well shirker was just as proud of his prudencejust as thankful for his own meanness and of course would not marry without a competency who so honourable polly waited and waited faintly from year to year he wasnt sick at heart his passion never disturbed his six hours sleep or kept his ambition out of mind he would rather have hugged an attorney any day than have kissed polly though she was one of the prettiest creatures in the world and while she was pining alone upstairs reading over the stock of halfadozen frigid letters that the confounded prig had condescended to write to her he be sure was never busy with anything but his briefs in chambersalways frigid rigid selfsatisfied and at his duty the marriage trailed on year after year while mr serjeant shirker grew to be the famous lawyer he is  meanwhile my younger brother pump temple who was in the 120th hussars and had the same little patrimony which fell to the lot of myself and polly must fall in love with our cousin fanny figtree and marry her out of hand you should have seen the wedding six bridesmaids in pink to hold the fan bouquet gloves scentbottle and pockethandkerchief of the bride basketfuls of white favours in the vestry to be pinned on to the footmen and horses a genteel congregation of curious acquaintance in the pews a shabby one of poor on the steps all the carriages of all our acquaintance whom aunt figtree had levied for the occasion and of course four horses for mr pumps bridal vehicle  then comes the breakfast or dejeuner if you please with a brass band in the street and policemen to keep order the happy bridegroom spends about a years income in dresses for the bridesmaids and pretty presents and the bride must have a trousseau of laces satins jewelboxes and tomfoolery to make her fit to be a lieutenants wife there was no hesitation about pump he flung about his money as if it had been dross and mrs p temple on the horse tom tiddler which her husband gave her was the most dashing of military women at brighton or dublin  how old mrs figtree used to bore me and polly with stories of pumps grandeur and the noble company he kept polly lives with the figtrees as i am not rich enough to keep a home for her  pump and i have always been rather distant not having the slightest notions about horseflesh he has a natural contempt for me and in our mothers lifetime when the good old lady was always paying his debts and petting him im not sure there was not a little jealousy it used to be polly that kept the peace between us  she went to dublin to visit pump and brought back grand accounts of his doingsgayest man about townaidedecamp to the lordlieutenantfanny admired everywhereher excellency godmother to the second boy the eldest with a string of aristocratic christiannames that made the grandmother wild with delight presently fanny and pump obligingly came to london where the third was born  polly was godmother to this and who so loving as she and pump now oh essex says she to me he is so good so generous so fond of his family so handsome who can help loving him and pardoning his little errors one day while mrs pump was yet in the upper regions and doctor fingerfees brougham at her door every day having business at guildhall whom should i meet in cheapside but pump and polly the poor girl looked more happy and rosy than i have seen her these twelve years pump on the contrary was rather blushing and embarrassed  i couldnt be mistaken in her face and its look of mischief and triumph she had been committing some act of sacrifice i went to the family stockbroker she had sold out two thousand pounds that morning and given them to pump quarrelling was uselesspump had the money he was off to dublin by the time i reached his mothers and polly radiant still he was going to make his fortune he was going to embark the money in the bog of alleni dont know what the fact is he was going to pay his losses upon the last manchester steeplechase and i leave you to imagine how much principal or interest poor polly ever saw back again  it was more than half her fortune and he has had another thousand since from her then came efforts to stave off ruin and prevent exposure struggles on all our parts and sacrifices that here mr essex temple began to hesitatethat neednt be talked of but they are of no more use than such sacrifices ever are pump and his wife are abroadi dont like to ask where polly has the three children and mr serjeant shirker has formally written to break off an engagement on the conclusion of which miss temple must herself have speculated when she alienated the greater part of her fortune  and heres your famous theory of poor marriages essex temple cries concluding the above history how do you know that i dont want to marry myself how do you dare sneer at my poor sister what are we but martyrs of the reckless marriage system which mr snob forsooth chooses to advocate and he thought he had the better of the argument which strange to say is not my opinion  but for the infernal snobworship might not every one of these people be happy if poor pollys happiness lay in linking her tender arms round such a heartless prig as the sneak who has deceived her she might have been happy nowas happy as raymond raymond in the ballad with the stone statue by his side she is wretched because mr serjeant shirker worships money and ambition and is a snob and a coward  if the unfortunate pump temple and his giddy hussy of a wife have ruined themselves and dragged down others into their calamity it is because they loved rank and horses and plate and carriages and court guides and millinery and would sacrifice all to attain those objects  and who misguides them if the world were more simple would not those foolish people follow the fashion does not the world love court guides and millinery and plate and carriages mercy on us read the fashionable intelligence read the court circular read the genteel novels survey mankind from pimlico to red lion square and see how the poor snob is aping the rich snob how the mean snob is grovelling at the feet of the proud snob and the great snob is lording it over his humble brother does the idea of equality ever enter dives head will it ever will the duchess of fitzbattleaxe i like a good name ever believe that lady croesus her nextdoor neighbour in belgrave square is as good a lady as her grace will lady croesus ever leave off pining the duchesss parties and cease patronizing mrs broadcloth whose husband has not got his baronetcy yet will mrs broadcloth ever heartily shake hands with mrs seedy and give up those odious calculations about poor dear mrs seedys income will mrs seedy who is starving in her great house go and live comfortably in a little one or in lodgings will her landlady miss letsam ever stop wondering at the familiarity of tradespeople or rebuking the insolence of suky the maid who wears flowers under her bonnet like a lady  but why hope why wish for such times do i wish all snobs to perish do i wish these snob papers to determine suicidal fool art not thou too a snob and a brother    chapter xxxviiclub snobs  as i wish to be particularly agreeable to the ladies to whom i make my most humble obeisance we will now if you please commence maligning a class of snobs against whom i believe most female minds are embitteredi mean club snobs i have very seldom heard even the most gentle and placable woman speak without a little feeling of bitterness against those social institutions those palaces swaggering in st jamess which are open to the men while the ladies have but their dingy threewindowed brick boxes in belgravia or in paddingtonia or in the region between the road of edgware and that of grays inn  in my grandfathers time it used to be freemasonry that roused their anger it was my grandaunt whose portrait we still have in the family who got into the clockcase at the royal rosicrucian lodge at bungay suffolk to spy the proceedings of the society of which her husband was a member and being frightened by the sudden whirring and striking eleven of the clock just as the deputygrandmaster was bringing in the mystic gridiron for the reception of a neophyte rushed out into the midst of the lodge assembled and was elected by a desperate unanimity deputygrandmistress for life though that admirable and courageous female never subsequently breathed a word with regard to the secrets of the initiation yet she inspired all our family with such a terror regarding the mysteries of jachin and boaz that none of our family have ever since joined the society or worn the dreadful masonic insignia  it is known that orpheus was torn to pieces by some justly indignant thracian ladies for belonging to an harmonic lodge let him go back to eurydice they said whom he is pretending to regret so but the history is given in dr lemprieres elegant dictionary in a manner much more forcible than any this feeble pen can attempt at once then and without verbiage let us take up this subjectmatter of clubs  clubs ought not in my mind to be permitted to bachelors if my friend of the cuttykilts had not our club the union jack to go to i belong to the uj and nine other similar institutions who knows but he never would be a bachelor at this present moment instead of being made comfortable and cockered up with every luxury as they are at clubs bachelors ought to be rendered profoundly miserable in my opinion every encouragement should be given to the rendering their spare time disagreeable there can be no more odious object according to my sentiments than young smith in the pride of health commanding his dinner of three courses than middleaged jones wallowing as i may say in an easy padded armchair over the delicious novel or brilliant magazine or than old brown that selfish old reprobate for whom mere literature has no charms stretched on the best sofa sitting on the second edition of the times having the morning chronicle between his knees the herald pushed in between his coat and waistcoat the standard under his arm the globe under the other pinion and the daily news in perusal ill trouble you for punch mr wiggins says the unconscionable old gormandiser interrupting our friend who is laughing over the periodical in question  this kind of selfishness ought not to be no no young smith instead of his dinner and his wine ought to be whereat the festive teatable to be sure by the side of miss higgs sipping the bohea or tasting the harmless muffin while old mrs higgs looks on pleased at their innocent dalliance and my friend miss wirt the governess is performing thalbergs last sonata in treble x totally unheeded at the piano  where should the middleaged jones be at his time of life he ought to be the father of a family at such an hoursay at nine oclock at nightthe nurserybell should have just rung the children to bed he and mrs j ought to be by rights seated on each side of the fire by the diningroom table a bottle of portwine between them not so full as it was an hour since mrs j has had two glasses mrs grumble joness motherinlaw has had three jones himself has finished the rest and dozes comfortably until bedtime  and brown that old newspaperdevouring miscreant what right has he at a club at a decent hour of night he ought to be playing his rubber with miss macwhirter his wife and the family apothecary his candle ought to be brought to him at ten oclock and he should retire to rest just as the young people were thinking of a dance how much finer simpler nobler are the several employments i have sketched out for these gentlemen than their present nightly orgies at the horrid club  and ladies think of men who do not merely frequent the diningroom and library but who use other apartments of those horrible dens which it is my purpose to batter down think of cannon the wretch with his coat off at his age and size clattering the balls over the billiardtable all night and making bets with that odious captain spotthink of pam in a dark room with bob trumper jack deuceace and charley vole playing the poor dear misguided wretch guinea points and five pounds on the rubberabove all thinkoh think of that den of abomination which i am told has been established in some clubs called the smokingroomthink of the debauchees who congregate there the quantities of reeking whiskypunch or more dangerous sherrycobbler which they consumethink of them coming home at cockcrow and letting themselves into the quiet house with the chubb keythink of them the hypocrites taking off their insidious boots before they slink upstairs the children sleeping overhead the wife of their bosom alone with the waning rushlight in the twopair frontthat chamber so soon to be rendered hateful by the smell of their stale cigars i am not an advocate of violence i am not by nature of an incendiary turn of mind but if my dear ladies you are for assassinating mr chubb and burning down clubhouses in st jamess there is one snob at who will not think the worse of you  the only men who as i opine ought to be allowed the use of clubs are married men without a profession the continual presence of these in a house cannot be thought even by the most loving of wives desirable say the girls are beginning to practise their music which in an honourable english family ought to occupy every young gentlewoman three hours it would be rather hard to call upon poor papa to sit in the drawingroom all that time and listen to the interminable discords and shrieks which are elicited from the miserable piano during the above necessary operation a man with a good ear especially would go mad if compelled daily to submit to this horror  or suppose you have a fancy to go to the milliners or to howell and jamess it is manifest my dear madam that your husband is much better at the club during these operations than by your side in the carriage or perched in wonder upon one of the stools at shawl and gimcracks whilst young counterdandies are displaying their wares  this sort of husbands should be sent out after breakfast and if not members of parliament or directors of a railroad or an insurance company should be put into their clubs and told to remain there until dinnertime no sight is more agreeable to my truly regulated mind than to see the noble characters so worthily employed whenever i pass by st jamess street having the privilege like the rest of the world of looking in at the windows of blights or foodles or snooks or the great bay at the contemplative club i behold with respectful appreciation the figures withinthe honest rosy old fogies the mouldy old dandies the waistbelts and glossy wigs and tight cravats of those most vacuous and respectable men such men are best there during the daytime surely when you part with them dear ladies think of the rapture consequent on their return you have transacted your household affairs you have made your purchases you have paid your visits you have aired your poodle in the park your french maid has completed the toilette which renders you so ravishingly beautiful by candlelight and you are fit to make home pleasant to him who has been absent all day  such men surely ought to have their clubs and we will not class them among club snobs thereforeon whom let us reserve our attack for the next chapter    chapter xxxviiiclub snobs  such a sensation has been created in the clubs by the appearance of the last paper on club snobs as cant but be complimentary to me who am one of their number  i belong to many clubs the union jack the sash and marlinspikemilitary clubs the true blue the no surrender the blue and buff the guy fawkes and the cato streetpolitical clubs the brummel and the regentdandy clubs the acropolis the palladium the areopagus the pnyx the pentelicus the ilissus and the poluphloisboio thalassesliterary clubs i never could make out how the latter set of clubs got their names i dont know greek for one and i wonder how many other members of those institutions do ever since the club snobs have been announced i observe a sensation created on my entrance into any one of these places members get up and hustle together they nod they scowl as they glance towards the present snob infernal impudent jackanapes if he shows me up says colonel bludyer ill break every bone in his skin i told you what would come of admitting literary men into the club says ranville ranville to his colleague spooney of the tape and sealingwax office these people are very well in their proper places and as a public man i make a point of shaking hands with them and that sort of thing but to have ones privacy obtruded upon by such people is really too much come along spooney and the pair of prigs retire superciliously  as i came into the coffeeroom at the no surrender old jawkins was holding out to a knot of men who were yawning as usual there he stood waving the standard and swaggering before the fire what says he did i tell peel last year if you touch the corn laws you touch the sugar question if you touch the sugar you touch the tea i am no monopolist i am a liberal man but i cannot forget that i stand on the brink of a precipice and if were to have free trade give me reciprocity and what was sir robert peels answer to me mr jawkins he said  here jawkinss eye suddenly turning on your humble servant he stopped his sentence with a guilty lookhis stale old stupid sentence which every one of us at the club has heard over and over again  jawkins is a most pertinacious club snob every day he is at that fireplace holding that standard of which he reads up the leadingarticle and pours it out ore rotundo with the most astonishing composure in the face of his neighbour who has just read every word of it in the paper jawkins has money as you may see by the tie of his neckcloth he passes the morning swaggering about the city in bankers and brokers parlours and saysi spoke with peel yesterday and his intentions are so and so graham and i were talking over the matter and i pledge you my word of honour his opinion coincides with mine and that whatdyecallum is the only measure government will venture on trying by eveningpaper time he is at the club i can tell you the opinion of the city my lord says he and the way in which jones loyd looks at it is briefly this rothschilds told me so themselves in mark lane peoples minds are quite made up he is considered rather a wellinformed man  he lives in belgravia of course in a drabcoloured genteel house and has everything about him that is properly grave dismal and comfortable his dinners are in the morning herald among the parties for the week and his wife and daughters make a very handsome appearance at the drawingroom once a year when he comes down to the club in his deputylieutenants uniform  he is fond of beginning a speech to you by saying when i was in the house i cin fact he sat for skittlebury for three weeks in the first reformed parliament and was unseated for bribery since which he has three times unsuccessfully contested that honourable borough  another sort of political snob i have seen at most clubs and that is the man who does not care so much for home politics but is great upon foreign affairs i think this sort of man is scarcely found anywhere but in clubs it is for him the papers provide their foreign articles at the expense of some ten thousand ayear each he is the man who is really seriously uncomfortable about the designs of russia and the atrocious treachery of louis philippe he it is who expects a french fleet in the thames and has a constant eye upon the american president every word of whose speech goodness help him he reads he knows the names of the contending leaders in portugal and what they are fighting about and it is he who says that lord aberdeen ought to be impeached and lord palmerston hanged or vice versa  lord palmerstons being sold to russia the exact number of roubles paid by what house in the city is a favourite theme with this kind of snob i once overheard himit was captain spitfire rn who had been refused a ship by the whigs by the wayindulging in the following conversation with mr minns after dinner  why wasnt the princess scragamoffsky at lady palmerstons party minns because she cant showwhy cant she show shall i tell you minns why she cant show the princess scragainoffskys back is flayed

about and thinks him the greatest and wisest of human beings    chapter xxxixclub snobs  why does not some great author write the mysteries of the clubhouses or st jamess street unveiled it would be a fine subject for an imaginative writer we must all as boys remember when we went to the fair and had spent all our moneythe sort of awe and anxiety with which we loitered round the outside of the show speculating upon the nature of the entertainment going on within  man is a dramaof wonder and passion and mystery and meanness and beauty and truthfulness and etcetera each bosom is a booth in vanity fair but let us stop this capital style i should die if i kept it up for a column a pretty thing a column all capitals would be by the way in a club though there maynt be a soul of your acquaintance in the room you have always the chance of watching strangers and speculating on what is going on within those tents and curtains of their souls their coats and waistcoats this is a neverfailing sport indeed i am told there are some clubs in the town where nobody ever speaks to anybody they sit in the coffeeroom quite silent and watching each other  yet how little you can tell from a mans outward demeanour theres a man at our clublarge heavy middleagedgorgeously dressedrather baldwith lacquered bootsand a boa when he goes out quiet in demeanour always ordering and consuming a recherche little dinner whom i have mistaken for sir john pocklington any time these five years and respected as a man with five hundred pounds per diem and i find he is but a clerk in an office in the city with not two hundred pounds income and his name is jubber sir john pocklington was on the contrary the dirty little snuffy man who cried out so about the bad quality of the beer and grumbled at being overcharged threehalfpence for a herring seated at the next table to jubber on the day when some one pointed the baronet out to me  take a different sort of mystery i see for instance old fawney stealing round the rooms of the club with glassy meaningless eyes and an endless greasy simperhe fawns on everybody he meets and shakes hands with you and blesses you and betrays the most tender and astonishing interest in your welfare you know him to be a quack and a rogue and he knows you know it but he wriggles on his way and leaves a track of slimy flattery after him wherever he goes who can penetrate that mans mystery what earthly good can he get from you or me you dont know what is working under that leering tranquil mask you have only the dim instinctive repulsion that warns you you are in the presence of a knavebeyond which fact all fawneys soul is a secret to you  i think i like to speculate on the young men best their play is opener you know the cards in their hand as it were take for example messrs spavin and cockspur  a specimen or two of the above sort of young fellows may be found i believe at most clubs they know nobody they bring a fine smell of cigars into the room with them and they growl together in a corner about sporting matters they recollect the history of that short period in which they have been ornaments of the world by the names of winning horses as political men talk about the reform year the year the whigs went out and so forth these young sporting bucks speak of tarnations year or opodeldocs year or the year when catawampus ran second for the chester cup they play at billiards in the morning they absorb pale ale for breakfast and top up with glasses of strong waters they read bells life and a very pleasant paper too with a great deal of erudition in the answers to correspondents they go down to tattersalls and swagger in the park with their hands plunged in the pockets of their paletots  what strikes me especially in the outward demeanour of sporting youth is their amazing gravity their conciseness of speech and careworn and moody air in the smokingroom at the regent when joe millerson will be setting the whole room in a roar with laughter you hear young messrs spavin and cockspur grumbling together in a corner ill take your fiveandtwenty to one about brother to bluenose whispers spavin cant do it at the price cockspur says wagging his head ominously the bettingbook is always present in the minds of those unfortunate youngsters i think i hate that work even more than the peerage there is some good in the latterthough generally speaking a vain record though de mogyns is not descended from the giant hogyn mogyn though half the other genealogies are equally false and foolish yet the mottoes are good readingsome of them and the book itself a sort of goldlaced and livened lackey to history and in so far serviceable but what good ever came out of or went into a bettingbook if i could be caliph omar for a week i would pitch every one of those despicable manuscripts into the flames from my lords who is in with jack snaffles stable and is overreaching worseinformed rogues and swindling greenhorns down to sams the butcherboys who books eighteenpenny odds in the taproom and stands to win fiveandtwenty bob  in a turf transaction either spavin or cockspur would try to get the better of his father and to gain a point in the odds victimise his best friends one day we shall hear of one or other levanting an event at which not being sporting men we shall not break our hearts seemr spavin is settling his toilette previous to departure giving a curl in the glass to his sidewisps of hair look at him it is only at the hulks or among turfmen that you ever see a face so mean so knowing and so gloomy  a much more humane being among the youthful clubbists is the ladykilling snob i saw wiggle just now in the dressingroom talking to waggle his inseparable  wagglepon my honour wiggle she did  wigglewell waggle as you sayi own i think she did look at me rather kindly well see tonight at the french play  and having arrayed their little persons these two harmless young bucks go upstairs to dinner    chapter xlclub snobs  both sorts of young men mentioned in my last under the flippant names of wiggle and waggle may be found in tolerable plenty i think in clubs wiggle and waggle are both idle they come of the middle classes one of them very likely makes believe to be a barrister and the other has smart apartments about piccadilly they are a sort of secondchop dandies they cannot imitate that superb listlessness of demeanour and that admirable vacuous folly which distinguish the noble and highborn chiefs of the race but they lead lives almost as bad were it but for the example and are personally quite as useless i am not going to arm a thunderbolt and launch it at the beads of these little pall mall butterflies they dont commit much public harm or private extravagance they dont spend a thousand pounds for diamond earrings for an operadancer as lord tarquin can neither of them ever set up a publichouse or broke the bank of a gamblingclub like the young earl of martingale they have good points kind feelings and deal honourably in moneytransactionsonly in their characters of men of secondrate pleasure about town they and their like are so utterly mean selfcontented and absurd that they must not be omitted in a work treating on snobs  wiggle has been abroad where he gives you to understand that his success among the german countesses and italian princesses whom he met at the tablesdhote was perfectly terrific his rooms are hung round with pictures of actresses and balletdancers he passes his mornings in a fine dressinggown burning pastilles and reading don juan and french novels by the way the life of the author of don juan as described by himself was the model of the life of a snob he has twopennyhalfpenny french prints of women with languishing eyes dressed in dominoesguitars gondolas and so forthand tells you stories about them  its a bad print says he i know but ive a reason for liking it it reminds me of somebodysomebody i knew in other climes you have heard of the principessa di monte pulciano i met her at rimini dear dear francesca that fairhaired brighteyed thing in the bird of paradise and the turkish simar with the lovebird on her finger im sure must have been taken fromfrom somebody perhaps whom you dont knowbut shes known at munich waggle my boyeverybody knows the countess ottilia de eulenschreckenstein gad sir what a beautiful creature she was when i danced with her on the birthday of prince attila of bavaria in 44 prince carloman was our visavis and prince pepin danced the same contredanse she had a polyanthus in her bouquet waggle i have it now his countenance assumes an agonized and mysterious expression and he buries his head in the sofa cushions as if plunging into a whirlpool of passionate recollections  last year he made a considerable sensation by having on his table a morocco miniaturecase locked by a gold key which he always wore round his neck and on which was stamped a serpentemblem of eternitywith the letter m in the circle sometimes he laid this upon his little morocco writingtable as if it were on an altargenerally he had flowers upon it in the middle of a conversation he would start up and kiss it he would call out from his bedroom to his valet hicks bring me my casket  i dont know who it is waggle would say who does know that fellows intrigues desborough wiggle sir is the slave of passion i suppose you have heard the story of the italian princess locked up in the convent of saint barbara at rimini he hasnt told you then im not at liberty to speak or the countess about whom he nearly had the duel with prince witikind of bavaria perhaps you havent even heard about that beautiful girl at pentonville daughter of a most respectable dissenting clergyman she broke her heart when she found he was engaged to a most lovely creature of high family who afterwards proved false to him and shes now in hanwell  waggles belief in his friend amounts to frantic adoration what a genius he is if he would but apply himself he whispers to me he could be anything sir but for his passions his poems are the most beautiful things you ever saw hes written a continuation of don juan from his own adventures did you ever read his lines to mary theyre superior to byron sirsuperior to byron  i was glad to hear this from so accomplished a critic as waggle for the fact is i had composed the verses myself for honest wiggle one day whom i found at his chambers plunged in thought over a very dirty oldfashioned album in which he had not as yet written a single word  i cant says he sometimes i can write whole cantos and today not a line oh snob such an opportunity such a divine creature shes asked me to write verses for her album and i cant  is she rich said i i thought you would never marry any but an heiress  oh snob shes the most accomplished highlyconnected creatureand i cant get out a line  how will you have it says i hot with sugar  dont dont you trample on the most sacred feelings snob i want something wild and tenderlike byron i want to tell her that amongst the festive balls and that sort of thing you knowi only think about her you knowthat i scorn the world and am weary of it you know andsomething about a gazelle and a bulbul you know  and a yataghan to finish off with the present writer observed and we began  to mary  i seem in the midst of the crowd the lightest of all my laughter rings cheery and loud in banquet and ball my lip hath its smiles and its sneers for all men to see but my soul and my truth and my tears are for thee are for thee  do you call that neat wiggle says i i declare it almost makes me cry myself  now suppose says wiggle we say that all the world is at my feetmake her jealous you know and that sort of thingand thatthat im going to travel you know that perhaps may work upon her feelings  so we as this wretched prig said began again  around me they flatter and fawnthe young and the old the fairest are ready to pawn their hearts for my gold they sue mei laugh as i spurn the slaves at my knee but in faith and in fondness i turn unto thee unto thee  now for the travelling wiggle my boy and i began in a voice choked with emotion  away for my heart knows no rest since you taught it to feel the secret must die in my breast i burn to reveal the passion i may not     i say snob wiggle here interrupted the excited bard just as i was about to break out into four lines so pathetic that they would drive you into hysterics i sayahemcouldnt you say that i wasamilitary man and that there was some danger of my life  you a military mandanger of your life what the deuce do you mean  why said wiggle blushing a great deal i told her i was going outontheecuadorexpedition  you abominable young impostor i exclaimed finish the poem for yourself and so he did and entirely out of all metre and bragged about the work at the club as his own performance  poor waggle fully believed in his friends genius until one day last week he came with a grin on his countenance to the club and said oh snob ive made such a discovery going down to the skating today whom should i see but wiggle walking with that splendid womanthat lady of illustrious family and immense fortune mary you know whom he wrote the beautiful verses about shes fiveandforty shes red hair shes a nose like a pumphandle her father made his fortune by keeping a hamandbeef shop and wiggles going to marry her next week  so much the better waggle my young friend i exclaimed better for the sake of womankind that this dangerous dog should leave off ladykillingthis bluebeard give up practice or better rather for his own sake for as there is not a word of truth in any of those prodigious lovestories which you used to swallow nobody has been hurt except wiggle himself whose affections will now centre in the hamandbeef shop there are people mr waggle who do these things in earnest and hold a good rank in the world too but these are not subjects for ridicule and though certainly snobs are scoundrels likewise their cases go up to a higher court    chapter xliclub snobs  bacchus is the divinity to whom waggle devotes his especial worship give me wine my boy says he to his friend wiggle who is prating about lovely woman and holds up his glass full of the rosy fluid and winks at it portentously and sips it and smacks his lips after it and meditates on it as if he were the greatest of connoisseurs  i have remarked this excessive wineamateurship especially in youth snoblings from college fledglings from the army goslings from the public schools who ornament our clubs are frequently to be heard in great force upon wine questions this bottles corked says snobling and mr sly the butler taking it away returns presently with the same wine in another jug which the young amateur pronounces excellent hang champagne says fledgling its only fit for gals and children give me pale sherry at dinner and my twentythree claret afterwards whats port now says gosling disgusting thick sweet stuffwheres the old dry wine one used to get until the last twelvemonth fledgling drank smallbeer at doctor swishtails and gosling used to get his dry old port at a ginshop in westminstertill he quitted that seminary in 1844  anybody who has looked at the caricatures of thirty years ago must remember how frequently bottlenoses pimpled faces and other bardolphian features are introduced by the designer they are much more rare now in nature and in pictures therefore than in those good old times but there are still to be found amongst the youth of our clubs lads who glory in drinkingbouts and whose faces quite sickly and yellow for the most part are decorated with those marks which rowlands kalydor is said to efface i was so cut last nightold boy hopkins says to tomkins with amiable confidence i tell you what we did we breakfasted with jack herring at twelve and kept up with brandy and sodawater and weeds till four then we toddled into the park for an hour then we dined and drank mulled port till halfprice then we looked in for an hour at the haymarket then we came back to the club and had grills and whisky punch till all was bluehullo waiter get me a glass of cherrybrandy club waiters the civilest the kindest the patientest of men die under the infliction of these cruel young topers but if the reader wishes to see a perfect picture on the stage of this class of young fellows i would recommend him to witness the ingenious comedy of london assurancethe amiable heroes of which are represented not only as drunkards and fiveoclockinthemorning men but as showing a hundred other delightful traits of swindling lying and general debauchery quite edifying to witness  how different is the conduct of these outrageous youths to the decent behaviour of my friend mr papworthy who says to poppins the butler at the club  papworthypoppins im thinking of dining early is there any cold game in the house  poppinstheres a game pie sir theres cold grouse sir theres cold pheasant sir theres cold peacock sir cold swan sir cold ostrich sir c c as the case may be  papworthyhem whats your best claret now poppinsin pints i

papworthyhumhahwellgive me a crust of bread and a glass of beer ill only lunch poppins  captain shindy is another sort of club bore he has been known to throw all the club in an uproar about the quality of his muttonchop  look at it sir is it cooked sir smell it sir is it meat fit for a gentleman he roars out to the steward who stands trembling before him and who in vain tells him that the bishop of bullocksmithy has just had three from the same loin all the waiters in the club are huddled round the captains muttonchop he roars out the most horrible curses at john for not bringing the pickles he utters the most dreadful oaths because thomas has not arrived with the harvey sauce peter comes tumbling with the waterjug over jeames who is bringing the glittering canisters with bread whenever shindy enters the room such is the force of character every table is deserted every gentleman must dine as he best may and all those big footmen are in terror  he makes his account of it he scolds and is better waited upon in consequence at the club he has ten servants scudding about to do his bidding  poor mrs shindy and the children are meanwhile in dingy lodgings somewhere waited upon by a charitygirl in pattens    chapter xliiclub snobs  every wellbred english female will sympathize with the subject of the harrowing tale the history of sackville maine i am now about to recount the pleasures of clubs have been spoken of let us now glance for a moment at the dangers of those institutions and for this purpose i must introduce you to my young acquaintance sackville maine  it was at a ball at the house of my respected friend mrs perkins that i was introduced to this gentleman and his charming lady seeing a young creature before me in a white dress with white satin shoes with a pink ribbon about a yard in breadth flaming out as she twirled in a polka in the arms of monsieur de springbock the german diplomatist with a green wreath on her head and the blackest hair this individual set eyes onseeing i say before me a charming young woman whisking beautifully in a beautiful dance and presenting as she wound and wound round the room now a full face then a threequarter face then a profilea face in fine which in every way you saw it looked pretty and rosy and happy i felt as i trust a not unbecoming curiosity regarding the owner of this pleasant countenance and asked wagley who was standing by in conversation with an acquaintance who was the lady in question  which says wagley  that one with the coalblack eyes i replied  hush says he and the gentleman with whom he was talking moved off with rather a discomfited air  when he was gone wagley burst out laughing coalblack eyes said he youve just hit it thats mrs sackville maine and that was her husband who just went away hes a coalmerchant snob my boy and i have no doubt mr perkinss wallsends are supplied from his wharf he is in a flaming furnace when he hears coals mentioned he and his wife and his mother are very proud of mrs sackvilles family she was a miss chuff daughter of captain chuff rn that is the widow that stout woman in crimson tabinet battling about the odd trick with old mr dumps at the cardtable  and so in fact it was sackville maine whose name is a hundred times more elegant surely than that of chuff was blest with a pretty wife and a genteel motherinlaw both of whom some people may envy him  soon after his marriage the old lady was good enough to come and pay him a visitjust for a fortnightat his pretty little cottage kennington oval and such is her affection for the place has never quitted it these four years she has also brought her son nelson collingwood chuff to live with her but he is not so much at home as his mamma going as a dayboy to merchant taylors school where he is getting a sound classical education  if these beings so closely allied to his wife and so justly dear to her may be considered as drawbacks to maines happiness what man is there that has not some things in life to complain of and when i first knew mr maine no man seemed more comfortable than he his cottage was a picture of elegance and comfort his table and cellar were excellently and neatly supplied there was every enjoyment but no ostentation the omnibus took him to business of a morning the boat brought him back to the happiest of homes where he would while away the long evenings by reading out the fashionable novels to the ladies as they worked or accompany his wife on the flute which he played elegantly or in any one of the hundred pleasing and innocent amusements of the domestic circle mrs chuff covered the drawingrooms with prodigious tapestries the work of her hands mrs sackville had a particular genius for making covers of tape or network for these tapestried cushions she could make homemade wines she could make preserves and pickles she had an album into which during the time of his courtship sackville maine bad written choice scraps of byrons and moores poetry analogous to his own situation and in a fine mercantile hand she had a large manuscript receiptbookevery quality in a word which indicated a virtuous and wellbred english female mind  and as for nelson collingwood sackville would say laughing we couldnt do without him in the house if he didnt spoil the tapestry we should be overcushioned in a few months and whom could we get but him to drink lauras homemade wine the truth is the gents who came from the city to dine at the oval could not be induced to drink itin which fastidiousness i myself when i grew to be intimate with the family confess that i shared  and yet sir that green ginger has been drunk by some of englands proudest heroes mrs chuff would exclaim admiral lord exmouth tasted and praised it sir on board captain chuffs ship the nebuchadnezzar 74 at algiers and he had three dozen with turn in the pitchfork frigate a part of which was served out to the men before he went into his immortal action with the furibonde captain choufleur in the gulf of panama  all this though the old dowager told us the story every day when the wine was produced never served to get rid of any quantity of itand the green ginger though it had fired british tars for combat and victory was not to the taste of us peaceful and degenerate gents of modern times  i see sackville now as on the occasion when presented by wagley i paid my first visit to him it was in julya sunday afternoonsackville maine was coming from church with his wife on one arm and his motherilllaw in red tabinet as usual on the other a halfgrown or hobbadehoyish footman so to speak walked after them carrying their shining golden prayerbooksthe ladies had splendid parasols with tags and fringes mrs chuffs great gold watch fastened to her stomach gleamed there like a ball of fire nelson collingwood was in the distance shying stones at an old horse on kennington common twas on that verdant spot we metnor can i ever forget the majestic courtesy of mrs chuff as she remembered having had the pleasure of seeing me at mrs perkinssnor the glance of scorn which she threw at an unfortunate gentleman who was preaching an exceedingly desultory discourse to a sceptical audience of omnibuscads and nursemaids on a tub as we passed by i cannot help it sir says she i am the widow of an officer of britains navy i was taught to honour my church and my king and i cannot bear a radical or a dissenter  with these fine principles i found sackville maine impressed wagley said he to my introducer if no better engagement why shouldnt self and friend dine at the oval mr snob sir the muttons coming off the spit at this very minute laura and mrs chuff he said laurar and mrs chuff but i hate people who make remarks on these peculiarities of pronunciation will be most happy to see you and i can promise you a hearty welcome and as good a glass of portwine as any in england  this is better than dining at the sarcophagus thinks i to myself at which club wagley and i had intended to take our meal and so we accepted the kindly invitation whence arose afterwards a considerable intimacy  everything about this family and house was so goodnatured comfortable and wellconditioned that a cynic would have ceased to growl there mrs laura was all graciousness and smiles and looked to as great advantage in her pretty morninggown as in her dressrobe at mrs perkinss mrs chuff fired off her stories about the nebuchadnezzar 74 the action between the pitchfork and the furibondethe heroic resistance of captain choufleur and the quantity of snuff he took c c which as they were heard for the first time were pleasanter than i have subsequently found them sackville maine was the best of hosts he agreed in everything everybody said altering his opinions without the slightest reservation upon the slightest possible contradiction he was not one of those beings who would emulate a schonbein or friar bacon or act the part of an incendiary towards the thames his neighbourbut a good kind simple honest easy fellowin love with his wifewell disposed to all the worldcontent with himself content even with his motherinlaw nelson collingwood i remember in the course of the evening when whiskyandwater was for some reason produced grew a little tipsy this did not in the least move sackvilles equanimity take him upstairs joseph said he to the hobbadehoy andjosephdont tell his mamma  what could make a man so happily disposed unhappy what could cause discomfort bickering and estrangement in a family so friendly and united ladies it was not my faultit was mrs chuffs doingbut the rest of the tale you shall have on a future day    chapter xliiiclub snobs  the misfortune which befell the simple and goodnatured young sackville arose entirely from that abominable sarcophagus club and that he ever entered it was partly the fault of the present writer  for seeing mrs chuff his motherinlaw had a taste for the genteelindeed her talk was all about lord collingwood lord gambier sir jahaleel brenton and the gosport and plymouth ballswagley and i according to our wont trumped her conversation and talked about lords dukes marquises and baronets as if those dignitaries were our familiar friends  lord sextonbury says i seems to have recovered her ladyships death he and the duke were very jolly over their wine at the sarcophagus last night werent they wagley  good fellow the duke wagley replied pray maam to mrs chuff you who know the world and etiquette will you tell me what a man ought to do in my case last june his grace his son lord castlerampant tom smith and myself were dining at the club when i offered the odds against daddylonglegs for the derbyforty to one in sovereigns only his grace took the bet and of course i won he has never paid me now can i ask such a great man for a sovereignone more lump of sugar if you please my dear madam  it was lucky wagley gave her this opportunity to elude the question for it prostrated the whole worthy family among whom we were they telegraphed each other with wondering eyes mrs chuffs stories about the naval nobility grew quite faint and kind little mrs sackville became uneasy and went upstairs to look at the childrennot at that young monster nelson collingwood who was sleeping off the whiskyandwaterbut at a couple of little ones who had made their appearance at dessert and of whom she and sackville were the happy parents  the end of this and subsequent meetings with mr maine was that we proposed and got him elected as a member of the sarcophagus club  it was not done without a deal of oppositionthe secret having been whispered that the candidate was a coalmerchant you may be sure some of the proud people and most of the parvenus of the club were ready to blackball him we combated this opposition successfully however we pointed out to the parvenus that the lambtons and the stuarts sold coals we mollified the proud by accounts of his good birth good nature and good behaviour and wagley went about on the day of election describing with great eloquence the action between the pitchfork and the furibonde and the valour of captain maine our friends father there was a slight mistake in the narrative but we carried our man with only a trifling sprinkling of black beans in the boxes byless of course who blackballs everybody and bungs who looks down upon a coalmerchant having himself lately retired from the winetrade  some fortnight afterwards i saw sackville maine under the following circumstances  he was showing the club to his family he had brought them thither in the lightblue fly waiting at the club door with mrs chuffs hobbadehoy footboy on the box by the side of the flyman in a sham livery nelson collingwood pretty mrs sackville mrs captain chuff mrs commodore chuff we call her were all there the latter of course in the vermilion tabinet which splendid as it is is nothing in comparison to the splendour of the sarcophagus the delighted sackville maine was pointing out the beauties of the place to them it seemed as beautiful as paradise to that little party  the sarcophagus displays every known variety of architecture and decoration the great library is elizabethan the small library is pointed gothic the diningroom is severe doric the strangers room has an egyptian look the drawingrooms are louis quatorze so called because the hideous ornaments displayed were used in the time of louis quinze the cortile or hall is moriscoitalian it is all over marble maplewood lookingglasses arabesques ormolu and scagliola scrolls ciphers dragons cupids polyanthuses and other flowers writhe up the walls in every kind of cornucopiosity fancy every gentleman in julliens band playing with all his might and each performing a different tune the ornaments at our club the sarcophagus so bewilder and affect me dazzled with emotions which i cannot describe and which she dared not reveal mrs chuff followed by her children and soninlaw walked wondering amongst these blundering splendours  in the great library 225 feet long by 150 the only man mrs chuff saw was tiggs he was lying on a crimsonvelvet sofa reading a french novel of paul de kock it was a very little book he is a very little man in that enormous hall he looked like a mere speck as the ladies passed breathless and trembling in the vastness of the magnificent solitude he threw a knowing killing glance at the fair strangers as much as to say aint i a fine fellow they thought so i am sure  who is that hisses out mrs chuff when we were about fifty yards off him at the other end of the room  tiggs says i in a similar whisper  pretty comfortable this isnt it my dear says maine in a freeandeasy way to mrs sackville all the magazines you seewriting materialsnew workschoice library containing every work of importancewhat have we heredugdales monasticon a most valuable and i believe entertaining book  and proposing to take down one of the books for mrs maines inspection he selected volume vii to which he was attracted by the singular fact that a brass doorhandle grew out of the back instead of pulling out a book however he pulled open a cupboard only inhabited by a lazy housemaids broom and duster at which he looked exceedingly discomfited while nelson collingwood losing all respect burst into a roar of laughter  thats the rummest book i ever saw says nelson i wish wed no others at merchant taylors  hush nelson cries mrs chuff and we went into the other magnificent apartments  how they did admire the drawingroom hangings pink and silver brocade most excellent wear for london and calculated the price per yard and revelled on the luxurious sofas and gazed on the immeasurable lookingglasses  pretty well to shave by eh says maine to his motherinlaw he was getting more abominably conceited every minute get away sackville says she quite delighted and threw a glance over her shoulder and spread out the wings of the red tabinet and took a good look at herself so did mrs sackvillejust one and i thought the glass reflected a very smiling pretty creature  but whats a woman at a lookingglass bless the little dears its their place they fly to it naturally it pleases them and they adorn it what i like to see and watch with increasing joy and adoration is the club men at the great lookingglasses old gills pushing up his collars and grinning at his own mottled face hulker looking solemnly at his great person and tightening his coat to give himself a waist fred minchin simpering by as he is going out to dine and casting upon the reflection of his white neckcloth a pleased moony smile what a deal of vanity that club mirror has reflected to be sure  well the ladies went through the whole establishment with perfect pleasure they beheld the coffeerooms and the little tables laid for dinner and the gentlemen who were taking their lunch and old jawkins thundering away as usual they saw the readingrooms and the rush for the evening papers they saw the kitchensthose wonders of artwhere the chef was presiding over twenty pretty kitchenmaids and ten thousand shining saucepans and they got into the lightblue fly perfectly bewildered with pleasure  sackville did not enter it though little laura took the back seat on purpose and left him the front place alongside of mrs chuffs red tabinet  we have your favourite dinner says she in a timid voice wont you come sackville  i shall take a chop here today my dear sackville replied home james and he went up the steps of the sarcophagus and the pretty face looked very sad out of the carriage as the blue fly drove away    chapter xlivclub snobs  whywhy did i and wagley ever do so cruel an action as to introduce young sackville maine into that odious sarcophagus let our imprudence and his example be a warning to other gents let his fate and that of his poor wife be remembered by every british female the consequences of his entering the club were as follows  one of the first vices the unhappy wretch acquired in this abode of frivolity was that of smoking some of the dandies of the club such as the marquis of macabaw lord doodeen and fellows of that high order are in the habit of indulging in this propensity upstairs in the billiardrooms of the sarcophagusand partly to make their acquaintance partly from a natural aptitude for crime sackville maine followed them and became an adept in the odious custom where it is introduced into a family i need not say how sad the consequences are both to the furniture and the morals sackville smoked in his diningroom at home and caused an agony to his wife and motherinlaw which i do not venture to describe  he then became a professed billiardplayer wasting hours upon hours at that amusement betting freely playing tolerably losing awfully to captain spot and col cannon he played matches of a hundred games with these gentlemen and would not only continue until four or five oclock in the morning at this work but would be found at the club of a forenoon indulging himself to the detriment of his business the ruin of his health and the neglect of his wife  from billiards to whist is but a stepand when a man gets to whist and five pounds on a rubber my opinion is that it is all up with him how was the coal business to go on and the connection of the firm to be kept up and the senior partner always at the cardtable  consorting now with genteel persons and pall mall bucks sackville became ashamed of his snug little residence in kennington oval and transported his family to pimlico where though mrs chuff his motherinlaw was at first happy as the quarter was elegant and near her sovereign poor little laura and the children found a woful difference where were her friends who came in with their work of a morningat kennington and in the vicinity of clapham where were her childrens little playmateson kennington common the great thundering carriages that roared up and down the drabcoloured streets of the new quarter contained no friends for the sociable little laura the children that paced the squares attended by a bonne or a prim governess were not like those happy ones that flew kites or played hopscotch on the wellbeloved old common and ah what a difference at church toobetween st benedicts of pimlico with open seats service in singsongtapersalbssurplicesgarlands and processions and the honest old ways of kennington the footmen too attending st benedicts were so splendid and enormous that james mrs chuffs boy trembled amongst them and said he would give warning rather than carry the books to that church any more  the furnishing of the house was not done without expense  and ye gods what a difference there was between sackvilles dreary french banquets in pimlico and the jolly dinners at the oval no more legsofmutton no more of the best portwine in england but entrees on plate and dismal twopenny champagne and waiters in gloves and the club bucks for companyamong whom mrs chuff was uneasy and mrs sackville quite silent  not that he dined at home often the wretch had become a perfect epicure and dined commonly at the club with the gormandising clique there with old doctor maw colonel cramley who is as lean as a greyhound and has jaws like a jack and the rest of them here you might see the wretch tippling sillery champagne and gorging himself with french viands and i often looked with sorrow from my table on which cold meat the club smallbeer and a halfpint of marsala form the modest banquet and sighed to think it was my work  and there were other beings present to my repentant thoughts wheres his wife thought i wheres poor good kind little laura at this very momentits about the nursery bedtime and while yonder goodfornothing is swilling his winethe little ones are at lauras knees lisping their prayers and she is teaching them to saypray god bless papa  when she has put them to bed her days occupation is gone and she is utterly lonely all night and sad and waiting for him  oh for shame oh for shame go home thou idle tippler  how sackville lost his health how he lost his business how he got into scrapes how he got into debt how he became a railroad director how the pimlico house was shut up how he went to boulogneall this i could tell only i am too much ashamed of my part of the transaction they returned to england because to the surprise of everybody mrs chuff came down with a great sum of money which nobody knew she had saved and paid his liabilities he is in england but at kennington his name is taken off the books of the sarcophagus long ago when we meet he crosses over to the other side of the street i dont call as i should be sorry to see a look of reproach or sadness in lauras sweet face  not however all evil as i am proud to think has been the influence of the snob of england upon clubs in generalcaptain shindy is afraid to bully the waiters any more and eats his muttonchop without moving acheron gobemouche does not take more than two papers at a time for his private reading tiggs does not ring the bell and cause the librarywaiter to walk about a

takes his own umbrella from the hallthe cotton one and sydney scrapers paletot lined with silk has been brought back by jobbins who entirely mistook it for his own wiggle has discontinued telling

fire for the admiration of two hundred gentlemen and if one club snob has been brought back to the paths of rectitude and if one poor john has been spared a journey or a scoldingsay friends and brethren if these sketches of club snobs have been in vain     concluding observations on snobs  how it is that we have come to no 45 of this present series of papers my dear friends and brother snobs i hardly knowbut for a whole mortal year have we been together prattling and abusing the human race and were we to live for a hundred years more i believe there is plenty of subject for conversation in the enormous theme of snobs  the national mind is awakened to the subject letters pour in every day conveying marks of sympathy directing the attention of the snob of england to races of snobs yet undescribed where are your theatrical snobs your commercial snobs your medical and chirurgical snobs your official snobs your legal snobs your artistical snobs your musical snobs your sporting snobs write my esteemed correspondents surely you are not going to miss the cambridge chancellor election and omit showing up your don snobs who are coming cap in hand to a young prince of sixandtwenty and to implore him to be the chief of their renowned university writes a friend who seals with the signet of the cam and isis club pray pray cries another now the operas are opening give us a lecture about omnibus snobs indeed i should like to write a chapter about the snobbish dons very much and another about the snobbish dandies of my dear theatrical snobs i think with a pang and i can hardly break away from some snobbish artists with whom i have long long intended to have a palaver  but whats the use of delaying when these were done there would be fresh snobs to pourtray the labour is endless no single man could complete it here are but fiftytwo bricksand a pyramid to build it is best to stop as jones always quits the room as soon as he has said his good thingas cincinnatus and general washington both retired into private life in the height of their popularityas prince albert when he laid the first stone of the exchange left the bricklayers to complete that edifice and went home to his royal dinneras the poet bunn comes forward at the end of the season and with feelings too tumultuous to describe blesses his kyind friends over the footlights so friends in the flush of conquest and the splendour of victory amid the shouts and the plaudits of a peopletriumphant yet modestthe snob of england bids ye farewell  but only for a season not for ever no no there is one celebrated author whom i admire very muchwho has been taking leave of the public any time these ten years in his prefaces and always comes back again when everybody is glad to see him how can he have the heart to be saying goodbye so often i believe that bunn is affected when he blesses the people parting is always painful even the familiar bore is dear to you i should be sorry to shake hands even with jawkins for the last time i think a wellconstituted convict on coming home from transportation ought to be rather sad when he takes leave of van diemens land when the curtain goes down on the last night of a pantomime poor old clown must be very dismal depend on it ha with what joy he rushes forward on the evening of the 26th of december next and sayshow are youhere we are but i am growing too sentimentalto return to the theme  the national mind is awakened to the subject of snobs the word snob has taken a place in our honest english vocabulary we cant define it perhaps we cant say what it is any more than we can define wit or humour or humbug but we know what it is some weeks since happening to have the felicity to sit next to a young lady at a hospitable table where poor old jawkins was holding forth in a very absurd pompous manner i wrote upon the spotless damask sb and called my neighbours attention to the little remark  that young lady smiled she knew it at once her mind straightway filled up the two letters concealed by apostrophic reserve and i read in her assenting eyes that she knew jawkins was a snob you seldom get them to make use of the word as yet it is true but it is inconceivable how pretty an expression their little smiling mouths assume when they speak it out if any young lady doubts just let her go up to her own room look at herself steadily in the glass and say snob if she tries this simple experiment my life for it she will smile and own that the word becomes her mouth amazingly a pretty little round word all composed of soft letters with a hiss at the beginning just to make it piquant as it were  jawkins meanwhile went on blundering and bragging and boring quite unconsciously and so he will no doubt go on roaring and braying to the end of time or at least so long as people will hear him you cannot alter the nature of men and snobs by any force of satire as by laying ever so many stripes on a donkeys back you cant turn him into a zebra  but we can warn the neighbourhood that the person whom they and jawkins admire is an impostor we apply the snob test to him and try whether he is conceited and a quack whether pompous and lacking humilitywhether uncharitable and proud of his narrow soul how does he treat a great manhow regard a small one how does he comport himself in the presence of his grace the duke and how in that of smith the tradesman  and it seems to me that all english society is cursed by this mammoniacal superstition and that we are sneaking and bowing and cringing on the one hand or bullying and scorning on the other from the lowest to the highest my wife speaks with great circumspectionproper pride she calls itto our neighbour the tradesmans lady and she i mean mrs snobelizawould give one of her eyes to go to court as her cousin the captains wife did she again is a good soul but it costs her agonies to be obliged to confess that we live in upper thompson street somers town and though i believe in her heart mrs whiskerington is fonder of us than of her cousins the smigsmags you should hear how she goes on prattling about lady smigsmagand i said to sir john my dear john and about the smigsmags house and parties in hyde park terrace  lady smigsmag when she meets elizawho is a sort of a kind of a species of a connection of the family pokes out one finger which my wife is at liberty to embrace in the most cordial manner she can devise but oh you should see her ladyships behaviour on her firstchop dinnerparty days when lord and lady longears come  i can bear it no longerthis diabolical invention of gentility which kills natural kindliness and honest friendship proper pride indeed rank and precedence forsooth the table of ranks and degrees is a lie and should be flung into the fire organize rank and precedence that was well for the masters of ceremonies of former ages come forward some great marshal and organize equality in society and your rod shall swallow up all the juggling old court goldsticks if this is not gospeltruthif the world does not tend to thisif hereditarygreatman worship is not a humbug and an idolatrylet us have the stuarts back again and crop the free presss ears in the pillory  if ever our cousins the smigsmags asked me to meet lord longears i would like to take an opportunity after dinner and say in the most goodnatured way in the worldsir fortune makes you a present of a number of thousand pounds every year the ineffable wisdom of our ancestors has placed you as a chief and hereditary legislator over me our admirable constitution the pride of britons and envy of surrounding nations obliges me to receive you as my senator superior and guardian your eldest son fitzheehaw is sure of a place in parliament your younger sons the de brays will kindly condescend to be postcaptains and lieutenantscolonels and to represent us in foreign courts or to take a good living when it falls convenient these prizes our admirable constitution the pride and envy of c pronounces to be your due without count of your dulness your vices your selfishness or your entire incapacity and folly dull as you may be and we have as good a right to assume that my lord is an ass as the other proposition that he is an enlightened patriotdull i say as you may be no one will accuse you of such monstrous folly as to suppose that you are indifferent to the good luck which you possess or have any inclination to part with it noand patriots as we are under happier circumstances smith and i i have no doubt were we dukes ourselves would stand by our order  we would submit goodnaturedly to sit in a high place we would acquiesce in that admirable constitution pride and envy of c which made us chiefs and the world our inferiors we would not cavil particularly at that notion of hereditary superiority which brought many simple people cringing to our knees may be we would rally round the cornlaws we would make a stand against the reform bill we would die rather than repeal the acts against catholics and dissenters we would by our noble system of classlegislation bring ireland to its present admirable condition  but smith and i are not earls as yet we dont believe that it is for the interest of smiths army that de bray should be a colonel at fiveandtwenty of smiths diplomatic relations that lord longears should go ambassador to constantinopleof our politics that longears should put his hereditary foot into them  this bowing and cringing smith believes to be the act of snobs and he will do all in his might and main to be a snob and to submit to snobs no longer to longears he says we cant help seeing longears that we are as good as you we can spell even better can think quite as rightly we will not have you for our master or black your shoes any more your footmen do it but they are paid and the fellow who comes to get a list of the company when you give a banquet or a dancing breakfast at longueoreille house gets money from the newspapers for performing that service but for us thank you for nothing longears my boy and we dont wish to pay you any more than we owe we will take off our hats to wellington because he is wellington but to youwho are you  i am sick of court circulars i loathe hautton intelligence i believe such words as fashionable exclusive aristocratic and the like to be wicked unchristian epithets that ought to be banished from honest vocabularies a court system that sends men of genius to the second table i hold to be a snobbish system a society that sets up to be polite and ignores arts and letters i hold to be a snobbish society you who despise your neighbour are a snob you who forget your own friends meanly to follow after those of a higher degree are a snob you who are ashamed of your poverty and blush for your calling are a snob as are you who boast of your pedigree or are proud of your wealth  to laugh at such is mr punchs business may he laugh honestly hit no foul blow and tell the truth when at his very broadest grinnever forgetting that if fun is good truth is still better and love best of all
