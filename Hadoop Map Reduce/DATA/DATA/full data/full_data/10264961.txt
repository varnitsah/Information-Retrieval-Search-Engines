10264961	the papers and writings of abraham lincoln  volume one  constitutional edition  by abraham lincoln   edited by arthur brooks lapsley  with an introduction by theodore roosevelt  the essay on lincoln by carl schurz  the address on lincoln by joseph choate      volume 1     introductory  immediately after lincolns reelection to the presidency in an offhand speech delivered in response to a serenade by some of his admirers on the evening of november 10 1864 he spoke as follows  it has long been a grave question whether any government not too strong for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies on this point the present rebellion brought our republic to a severe test and the presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion added not a little to the strain the strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts in the case what has occurred in this case must ever occur in similar cases human nature will not change in any future great national trial compared with the men of this we shall have as weak and as strong as silly and as wise as bad and as good let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy to learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged now that the election is over may not all having a common interest reunite in a common fort to save our common country for my own part i have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way so long as i have been here i have not willingly planted a thorn in any mans bosom while i am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a reelection and duly grateful as i trust to almighty god for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion as i think for their own good it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the result  this speech has not attracted much general attention yet it is in a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great statesman who made it alike in its strong commonsense and in its lofty standard of morality lincolns life lincolns deeds and words are not only of consuming interest to the historian but should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard practical work of american political life it is difficult to overstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two foremost figures in its history men like washington and lincoln it is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to feel that the highest ambition any american can possibly have will be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward the standards set by these two men  it is a very poor thing whether for nations or individuals to advance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse for doing poorly in the present but it is an excellent thing to study the history of the great deeds of the past and of the great men who did them with an earnest desire to profit thereby so as to render better service in the present in their essentials the men of the present day are much like the men of the past and the live issues of the present can be faced to better advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the leaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past such a study of lincolns life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of immorality and inefficiencythe gulfs which always lie one on each side of the careers alike of man and of nation it helps nothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the other the fanatic the wellmeaning moralist of unbalanced mind the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power himself to do good and but little power to do illall these were as alien to lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves his life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom because otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury without substance and that they must also act highmindedly or else what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the most destructive kind of folly  throughout his entire life and especially after he rose to leadership in his party lincoln was stirred to his depths by the sense of fealty to a lofty ideal but throughout his entire life he also accepted human nature as it is and worked with keen practical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at hand it is impossible to conceive of a man farther removed from baseness farther removed from corruption from mere selfseeking but it is also impossible to conceive of a man of more sane and healthy minda man less under the influence of that fantastic and diseased morality so fantastic and diseased as to be in reality profoundly immoral which makes a man in this workaday world refuse to do what is possible because he cannot accomplish the impossible  in the fifth volume of leckys history of england the historian draws an interesting distinction between the qualities needed for a successful political career in modern society and those which lead to eminence in the spheres of pure intellect or pure moral effort he says  the moral qualities that are required in the higher spheres of statesmanship are not those of a hero or a saint passionate earnestness and selfdevotion complete concentration of every faculty on an unselfish aim uncalculating daring a delicacy of conscience and a loftiness of aim far exceeding those of the average of men are here likely to prove rather a hindrance than an assistance the politician deals very largely with the superficial and the commonplace his art is in a great measure that of skilful compromise and in the conditions of modern life the statesman is likely to succeed best who possesses secondary qualities to an unusual degree who is in the closest intellectual and moral sympathy with the average of the intelligent men of his time and who pursues common ideals with more than common ability tact business talent knowledge of men resolution promptitude and sagacity in dealing with immediate emergencies a character which lends itself easily to conciliation diminishes friction and inspires confidence are especially needed and they are more likely to be found among shrewd and enlightened men of the world than among men of great original genius or of an heroic type of character  the american people should feel profoundly grateful that the greatest american statesman since washington the statesman who in this absolutely democratic republic succeeded best was the very man who actually combined the two sets of qualities which the historian thus puts in antithesis abraham lincoln the railsplitter the western country lawyer was one of the shrewdest and most enlightened men of the world and he had all the practical qualities which enable such a man to guide his countrymen and yet he was also a genius of the heroic type a leader who rose level to the greatest crisis through which this nation or any other nation had to pass in the nineteenth century  theodore roosevelt  sagamore hill oyster bay n y september 22 1905     introductory note  i have endured wrote lincoln not long before his death a great deal of ridicule without much malice and have received a great deal of kindness not quite free from ridicule on easter day 1865 the world knew how little this ridicule how much this kindness had really signified thereafter lincoln the man became lincoln the hero year by year more heroic until today with the swift passing of those who knew him his figure grows ever dimmer less real this should not be for lincoln the man patient wise set in a high resolve is worth far more than lincoln the hero vaguely glorious invaluable is the example of the man intangible that of the hero  and though it is not for us as for those who in awed stillness listened at gettysburg with inspired perception to know abraham lincoln yet there is for us another way whereby we may attain such knowledgethrough his wordsuttered in all sincerity to those who loved or hated him cold unsatisfying they may seem these printed words while we can yet speak with those who knew him and look into eyes that once looked into his but in truth it is here that we find his simple greatness his great simplicity and though no man tried less so to show his power no man has so shown it more clearly  thus these writings of abraham lincoln are associated with those of washington hamilton franklin and of the other founders of the republic not that lincoln should become still more of the past but rather that he with them should become still more of the present however faint and mythical may grow the story of that great struggle the leader lincoln at least should remain a real living american no matter how clearly how directly lincoln has shown himself in his writings we yet should not forget those men whose minds from their various viewpoints have illumined for us his character as this nation owes a great debt to lincoln so also lincolns memory owes a great debt to a nation which as no other nation could have done has been able to appreciate his full worth among the many who have brought about this appreciation those only whose estimates have been placed in these volumes may be mentioned here to president roosevelt to mr schurz and to mr choate the editor for himself for

material may there properly belong material much of which is widely scattered in public libraries and in private collections he has been fortunate in securing certain interesting correspondence and papers which had not before come into print in book form information concerning some of these papers had reached him too late to enable the papers to find place in their proper chronological order in the set rather however than not to present these papers to the readers they have been included in the seventh volume of the set which concludes the writings     these later papers are in this etext rearranged into chronologic     order dw  october 1905 a b l     abraham lincoln an essay by carl shurz  no american can study the character and career of abraham lincoln without being carried away by sentimental emotions we are always inclined to idealize that which we lovea state of mind very unfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment it is therefore not surprising that most of those who have written or spoken on that extraordinary man even while conscientiously endeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being and to form a just estimate of his public conduct should have drifted into more or less indiscriminating eulogy painting his great features in the most glowing colors and covering with tender shadings whatever might look like a blemish  but his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere praise of his virtues and abilities nor by any concealment of his limitations and faults the stature of the great man one of whose peculiar charms consisted in his being so unlike all other great men will rather lose than gain by the idealization which so easily runs into the commonplace for it was distinctly the weird mixture of qualities and forces in him of the lofty with the common the ideal with the uncouth of that which he had become with that which he had not ceased to be that made him so fascinating a character among his fellowmen gave him his singular power over their minds and hearts and fitted him to be the greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life  his was indeed a marvellous growth the statesman or the military hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure in american history but we may search in vain among our celebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled abraham lincolns in wretchedness he first saw the light in a miserable hovel in kentucky on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in a dreary neighborhood his father a typical poor southern white shiftless and without ambition for himself or his children constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he might make a living without much work his mother in her youth handsome and bright grown prematurely coarse in feature and soured in mind by daily toil and care the whole household squalid cheerless and utterly void of elevating inspirations only when the family had moved into the malarious backwoods of indiana the mother had died and a stepmother a woman of thrift and energy had taken charge of the children the shaggyheaded ragged barefooted forlorn boy then seven years old began to feel like a human being hard work was his early lot when a mere boy he had to help in supporting the family either on his fathers clearing or hired out to other farmers to plough or dig ditches or chop wood or drive ox teams occasionally also to tend the baby when the farmers wife was otherwise engaged he could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of activity when he obtained work in a crossroads store where he amused the customers by his talk over the counter for he soon distinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had something to say worth listening to to win that distinction he had to draw mainly upon his wits for while his thirst for knowledge was great his opportunities for satisfying that thirst were wofully slender  in the log schoolhouse which he could visit but little he was taught only reading writing and elementary arithmetic among the people of the settlement bush farmers and small tradesmen he found none of uncommon intelligence or education but some of them had a few books which he borrowed eagerly thus he read and reread aesops fables learning to tell stories with a point and to argue by parables he read robinson crusoe the pilgrims progress a short history of the united states and weemss life of washington to the town constables he went to read the revised statutes of indiana every printed page that fell into his hands he would greedily devour and his family and friends watched him with wonder as the uncouth boy after his daily work crouched in a corner of the log cabin or outside under a tree absorbed in a book while munching his supper of corn bread in this manner he began to gather some knowledge and sometimes he would astonish the girls with such startling remarks as that the earth was moving around the sun and not the sun around the earth and they marvelled where abe could have got such queer notions soon he also felt the impulse to write not only making extracts from books he wished to remember but also composing little essays of his own first he sketched these with charcoal on a wooden shovel scraped white with a drawingknife or on basswood shingles then he transferred them to paper which was a scarce commodity in the lincoln household taking care to cut his expressions close so that they might not cover too much spacea styleforming method greatly to be commended seeing boys put a burning coal on the back of a wood turtle he was moved to write on cruelty to animals seeing men intoxicated with whiskey he wrote on temperance in versemaking too he tried himself and in satire on persons offensive to him or otherssatire the rustic wit of which was not always fit for ears polite also political thoughts he put upon paper and some of his pieces were even deemed good enough for publication in the county weekly  thus he won a neighborhood reputation as a clever young man which he increased by his performances as a speaker not seldom drawing upon himself the dissatisfaction of his employers by mounting a stump in the field and keeping the farm hands from their work by little speeches in a jocose and sometimes also a serious vein at the rude social frolics of the settlement he became an important person telling funny stories mimicking the itinerant preachers who had happened to pass by and making his mark at wrestling matches too for at the age of seventeen he had attained his full height six feet four inches in his stockings if he had any and a terribly muscular clodhopper he was but he was known never to use his extraordinary strength to the injury or humiliation of others rather to do them a kindly turn or to enforce justice and fair dealing between them all this made him a favorite in backwoods society although in some things he appeared a little odd to his friends far more than any of them he was given not only to reading but to fits of abstraction to quiet musing with himself and also to strange spells of melancholy from which he often would pass in a moment to rollicking outbursts of droll humor but on the whole he was one of the people among whom he lived in appearance perhaps even a little more uncouth than most of thema very tall rawboned youth with large features dark shrivelled skin and rebellious hair his arms and legs long out of proportion clad in deerskin trousers which from frequent exposure to the rain had shrunk so as to sit tightly on his limbs leaving several inches of bluish shin exposed between their lower end and the heavy tancolored shoes the nether garment held usually by only one suspender that was strung over a coarse homemade shirt the head covered in winter with a coonskin cap in summer with a rough straw hat of uncertain shape without a band  it is doubtful whether he felt himself much superior to his surroundings although he confessed to a yearning for some knowledge of the world outside of the circle in which he lived this wish was gratified but how at the age of nineteen he went down the mississippi to new orleans as a flatboat hand temporarily joining a trade many members of which at that time still took pride in being called half horse and half alligator after his return he worked and lived in the old way until the spring of 1830 when his father moved again this time to illinois and on the journey of fifteen days abe had to drive the ox wagon which carried the household goods another log cabin was built and then fencing a field abraham lincoln split those historic rails which were destined to play so picturesque a part in the presidential campaign twentyeight years later  having come of age lincoln left the family and struck out for himself he had to take jobs whenever he could get them the first of these carried him again as a flatboat hand to new orleans there something happened that made a lasting impression upon his soul he witnessed a slave auction his heart bled wrote one of his companions said nothing much was silent looked bad i can say knowing it that it was on this trip that he formed his opinion on slavery it run its iron in him then and there may 1831 i have heard him say so often then he lived several years at new salem in illinois a small mushroom village with a mill some stores and whiskey shops that rose quickly and soon disappeared again it was a desolate disjointed halfworking and halfloitering life without any other aim than to gain food and shelter from day to day he served as pilot on a steamboat trip then as clerk in a store and a mill business failing he was adrift for some time being compelled to measure his strength with the chief bully of the neighborhood and overcoming him he became a noted person in that muscular community and won the esteem and friendship of the ruling gang of ruffians to such a degree that when the black hawk war broke out they elected him a young man of twentythree captain of a volunteer company composed mainly of roughs of their kind he took the field and his most noteworthy deed of valor consisted not in killing an indian but in protecting against his own men at the peril of his own life the life of an old savage who had strayed into his camp  the black hawk war over he turned to politics the step from the captaincy of a volunteer company to a candidacy for a seat in the legislature seemed a natural one but his popularity although great in new salem had not spread far enough over the district and he was defeated then the wretched handtomouth struggle began again he set up in storebusiness with a dissolute partner who drank whiskey while lincoln was reading books the result was a disastrous failure and a load of debt thereupon he became a deputy surveyor and was appointed postmaster of new salem the business of the postoffice being so small that he could carry the incoming and outgoing mail in his hat all this could not lift him from poverty and his surveying instruments and horse and saddle were sold by the sheriff for debt  but while all this misery was upon him his ambition rose to higher aims he walked many miles to borrow from a schoolmaster a grammar with which to improve his language a lawyer lent him a copy of blackstone and he began to study law  people would look wonderingly at the grotesque figure lying in the grass with his feet up a tree or sitting on a fence as absorbed in a book he learned to construct correct sentences and made himself a jurist at once he gained a little practice pettifogging before a justice of the peace for friends without expecting a fee judicial functions too were thrust upon him but only at horseraces or wrestling matches where his acknowledged honesty and fairness gave his verdicts undisputed authority his popularity grew apace and soon he could be a candidate for the legislature again although he called himself a whig an ardent admirer of henry clay his clever stump speeches won him the election in the strongly democratic district then for the first time perhaps he thought seriously of his outward appearance so far he had been content with a garb of kentucky jeans not seldom ragged usually patched and always shabby now he borrowed some money from a friend to buy a new suit of clothesstore clothes fit for a sangamon county statesman and thus adorned he set out for the state capital vandalia to take his seat among the lawmakers  his legislative career which stretched over several sessionsfor he was thrice reelected in 1836 1838 and 1840was not remarkably brilliant he did indeed not lack ambition he dreamed even of making himself the de witt clinton of illinois and he actually distinguished himself by zealous and effective work in those logrolling operations by which the young state received a general system of internal improvements in the shape of railroads canals and banksa reckless policy burdening the state with debt and producing the usual crop of political demoralization but a policy characteristic of the time and the impatiently enterprising spirit of the western people lincoln no doubt with the best intentions but with little knowledge of the subject simply followed the popular current the achievement in which perhaps he gloried most was the removal of the state government from vandalia to springfield one of those triumphs of political management which are apt to be the pride of the small politicians statesmanship one thing however he did in which his true nature asserted itself and which gave distinct promise of the future pursuit of high aims against an overwhelming preponderance of sentiment in the legislature followed by only one other member he recorded his protest against a proslavery resolutionthat protest declaring the institution of slavery to be founded on both injustice and bad policy this was not only the irrepressible voice of his conscience it was true moral valor too for at that time in many parts of the west an abolitionist was regarded as little better than a horsethief and even abe lincoln would hardly have been forgiven his antislavery principles had he not been known as such an uncommon good fellow but here in obedience to the great conviction of his life he manifested his courage to stand alone that courage which is the first requisite of leadership in a great cause  together with his reputation and influence as a politician grew his law practice especially after he had removed from new salem to springfield and associated himself with a practitioner of good standing he had now at last won a fixed position in society he became a successful lawyer less indeed by his learning as a jurist than by his effectiveness as an advocate and by the striking uprightness of his character and it may truly be said that his vivid sense of truth and justice had much to do with his effectiveness as an advocate he would refuse to act as the attorney even of personal friends when he saw the right on the other side he would abandon cases even during trial when the testimony convinced him that his client was in the wrong he would dissuade those who sought his service from pursuing an obtainable advantage when their claims seemed to him unfair presenting his very first case in the united states circuit court the only question being one of authority he declared that upon careful examination he found all the authorities on the other side and none on his persons accused of crime when he thought them guilty he would not defend at all or attempting their defence he was unable to put forth his powers one notable exception is on record when his personal sympathies had been strongly aroused but when he felt himself to be the protector of innocence the defender of justice or the prosecutor of wrong he frequently disclosed such unexpected resources of reasoning such depth of feeling and rose to such fervor of appeal as to astonish and overwhelm his hearers and make him fairly irresistible even an ordinary law argument coming from him seldom failed to produce the impression that he was profoundly convinced of the soundness of his position it is not surprising that the mere appearance of so conscientious an attorney in any case should have carried not only to juries but even to judges almost a presumption of right on his side and that the people began to call him sincerely meaning it honest abe lincoln  in the meantime he had private sorrows and trials of a painfully afflicting nature he had loved and been loved by a fair and estimable girl ann rutledge who died in the flower of her youth and beauty and he mourned her loss with such intensity of grief that his friends feared for his reason recovering from his morbid depression he bestowed what he thought a new affection upon another lady who refused him and finally moderately prosperous in his worldly affairs and having prospects of political distinction before him he paid his addresses to mary todd of kentucky and was accepted but then tormenting doubts of the genuineness of his own affection for her of the compatibility of their characters and of their future happiness came upon him his distress was so great that he felt himself in danger of suicide and feared to carry a pocketknife with him and he gave mortal offence to his bride by not appearing on the appointed wedding day now the torturing consciousness of the wrong he had done her grew unendurable he won back her affection ended the agony by marrying her and became a faithful and patient husband and a good father but it was no secret to those who knew the family well that his domestic life was full of trials the erratic temper of his wife not seldom put the gentleness of his nature to the severest tests and these troubles and struggles which accompanied him through all the vicissitudes of his life from the modest home in springfield to the white house at washington adding untold private heartburnings to his public cares and sometimes precipitating upon him incredible embarrassments in the discharge of his public duties form one of the most pathetic features of his career  he continued to ride the circuit read books while travelling in his buggy told funny stories to his fellowlawyers in the tavern chatted familiarly with his neighbors around the stove in the store and at the postoffice had his hours of melancholy brooding as of old and became more and more widely known and trusted and beloved among the people of his state for his ability as a lawyer and politician for the uprightness of his character and the overflowing spring of sympathetic kindness in his heart his main ambition was confessedly that of political distinction but hardly any one would at that time have seen in him the man destined to lead the nation through the greatest crisis of the century  his time had not yet come when in 1846 he was elected to congress in a clever speech in the house of representatives he denounced president polk for having unjustly forced war upon mexico and he amused the committee of the whole by a witty attack upon general cass more important was the expression he gave to his antislavery impulses by offering a bill looking to the emancipation of the slaves in the district of columbia and by his repeated votes for the famous wilmot proviso intended to exclude slavery from the territories acquired from mexico but when at the expiration of his term in march 1849 he left his seat he gloomily despaired of ever seeing the day when the cause nearest to his heart would be rightly grasped by the people and when he would be able to render any service to his country in solving the great problem nor had his career as a member of congress in any sense been such as to gratify his ambition indeed if he ever had any belief in a great destiny for himself it must have been weak at that period for he actually sought to obtain from the new whig president general taylor the place of commissioner of the general land office willing to bury himself in one of the administrative bureaus of the government fortunately for the country he failed and no less fortunately when later the territorial governorship of oregon was offered to him mrs lincolns protest induced him to decline it returning to springfield he gave himself with renewed zest to his law practice acquiesced in the compromise of 1850 with reluctance and a mental reservation supported in the presidential campaign of 1852 the whig candidate in some spiritless speeches and took but a languid interest in the politics of the day but just then his time was drawing near  the peace promised and apparently inaugurated by the compromise of 1850 was rudely broken by the introduction of the kansasnebraska bill in 1854 the repeal of the missouri compromise opening the territories of the united states the heritage of coming generations to the invasion of slavery suddenly revealed the whole significance of the slavery question to the people of the free states and thrust itself into the politics of the country as the paramount issue something like an electric shock flashed through the north men who but a short time before had been absorbed by their business pursuits and deprecated all political agitation were startled out of their security by a sudden alarm and excitedly took sides that restless trouble of conscience about slavery which even in times of apparent repose had secretly disturbed the souls of northern people broke forth in an utterance louder than ever the bonds of accustomed party allegiance gave way antislavery democrats and antislavery whigs felt themselves drawn together by a common overpowering sentiment and soon they began to rally in a new organization the republican party sprang into being to meet the overruling call of the hour then abraham lincolns time was come he rapidly advanced to a position of conspicuous championship in the struggle this however was not owing to his virtues and abilities alone indeed the slavery question stirred his soul in its profoundest depths it was as one of his intimate friends said the only one on which he would become excited it called forth all his faculties and energies yet there were many others who having long and arduously fought the antislavery battle in the popular assembly or in the press or in the halls of congress far surpassed him in prestige and compared with whom he was still an obscure and untried man his reputation although highly honorable and well earned had so far been essentially local as a stumpspeaker in whig canvasses outside of his state he had attracted comparatively little attention but in illinois he had been recognized as one of the foremost men of the whig party among the opponents of the nebraska bill he occupied in his state so important a position that in 1856 he was the choice of a large majority of the antinebraska men in the legislature for a seat in the senate of the united states which then became vacant and when he an old whig could not obtain the votes of the antinebraska democrats necessary to make a majority he generously urged his friends to transfer their votes to lyman trumbull who was then elected two years later in the first national convention of the republican party the delegation from illinois brought him forward as a candidate for the vicepresidency and he received respectable support still the name of abraham lincoln was not widely known beyond the boundaries of his own state but now it was this local prominence in illinois that put him in a position of peculiar advantage on the battlefield of national politics in the assault on the missouri compromise which broke down all legal barriers to the spread of slavery stephen arnold douglas was the ostensible leader and central figure and douglas was a senator from illinois lincolns state douglass national theatre of action was the senate but in his constituency in illinois were the roots of his official position and power what he did in the senate he had to justify before the people of illinois in order to maintain himself in place and in illinois all eyes turned to lincoln as douglass natural antagonist  as very young men they had come to illinois lincoln from indiana douglas from vermont and had grown up together in public life douglas as a democrat lincoln as a whig they had met first in vandalia in 1834 when lincoln was in the legislature and douglas in the lobby and again in 1836 both as members of the legislature douglas a very able politician of the agile combative audacious pushing sort rose in political distinction with remarkable rapidity in quick succession he became a member of the legislature a states attorney secretary of state a judge on the supreme bench of illinois three times a representative in congress and a senator of the united states when only thirtynine years old in the national democratic convention of 1852 he appeared even as an aspirant to the nomination for the presidency as the favorite of young america and received a respectable vote he had far outstripped lincoln in what is commonly called political success and in reputation but it had frequently happened that in political campaigns lincoln felt himself impelled or was selected by his whig friends to answer douglass speeches and thus the two were looked upon in a large part of the state at least as the representative combatants of their respective parties in the debates before popular meetings as soon therefore as after the passage of his kansasnebraska bill douglas returned to illinois to defend his cause before his constituents lincoln obeying not only his own impulse but also general expectation stepped forward as his principal opponent thus the struggle about the principles involved in the kansasnebraska bill or in a broader sense the struggle between freedom and slavery assumed in illinois the outward form of a personal contest between lincoln and douglas and as it continued and became more animated that personal contest in illinois was watched with constantly increasing interest by the whole country when in 1858 douglass senatorial term being about to expire lincoln was formally designated by the republican convention of illinois as their candidate for the senate to take douglass place and the two contestants agreed to debate the questions at issue face to face in a series of public meetings the eyes of the whole american people were turned eagerly to that one point and the spectacle reminded one of those lays of ancient times telling of two armies in battle array standing still to see their two principal champions fight out the contested cause between the lines in single combat  lincoln had then reached the full maturity of his powers his equipment as a statesman did not embrace a comprehensive knowledge of public affairs what he had studied he had indeed made his own with the eager craving and that zealous tenacity characteristic of superior minds learning under difficulties but his narrow opportunities and the unsteady life he had led during his younger years had not permitted the accumulation of large stores in his mind it is true in political campaigns he had occasionally spoken on the ostensible issues between the whigs and the democrats the tariff internal improvements banks and so on but only in a perfunctory manner had he ever given much serious thought and study to these subjects it is safe to assume that a mind so prolific of original conceits as his would certainly have produced some utterance upon them worth remembering his soul had evidently never been deeply stirred by such topics but when his moral nature was aroused his brain developed an untiring activity until it had mastered all the knowledge within reach as soon as the repeal of the missouri compromise had thrust the slavery question into politics as the paramount issue lincoln plunged into an arduous study of all its legal historical and moral aspects and then his mind became a complete arsenal of argument his rich natural gifts trained by long and varied practice had made him an orator of rare persuasiveness in his immature days he had pleased himself for a short period with that inflated highflown style which among the uncultivated passes for beautiful speaking his inborn truthfulness and his artistic instinct soon overcame that aberration and revealed to him the noble beauty and strength of simplicity he possessed an uncommon power of clear and compact statement which might have reminded those who knew the story of his early youth of the efforts of the poor boy when he copied his compositions from the scraped wooden shovel carefully to trim his expressions in order to save paper his language had the energy of honest directness and he was a master of logical lucidity he loved to point and enliven his reasoning by humorous illustrations usually anecdotes of western life of which he had an inexhaustible store at his command these anecdotes had not seldom a flavor of rustic robustness about them but he used them with great effect while amusing the audience to give life to an abstraction to explode an absurdity to clinch an argument to drive home an admonition the natural kindliness of his tone softening prejudice and disarming partisan rancor would often open to his reasoning a way into minds most unwilling to receive it  yet his greatest power consisted in the charm of his individuality that charm did not in the ordinary way appeal to the ear or to the eye his voice was not melodious rather shrill and piercing especially when it rose to its high treble in moments of great animation his figure was unhandsome and the action of his unwieldy limbs awkward he commanded none of the outward graces of oratory as they are commonly understood his charm was of a different kind it flowed from the rare depth and genuineness of his convictions and his sympathetic feelings sympathy was the strongest element in his nature one of his biographers who knew him before he became president says lincolns compassion might be stirred deeply by an object present but never by an object absent and unseen in the former case he would most likely extend relief with little inquiry into the merits of the case because as he expressed it himself it took a pain out of his own heart only half of this is correct it is certainly true that he could not witness any individual distress or oppression or any kind of suffering without feeling a pang of pain himself and that by relieving as much as he could the suffering of others he put an end to his own this compassionate impulse to help he felt not only for human beings but for every living creature as in his boyhood he angrily reproved the boys who tormented a wood turtle by putting a burning coal on its back so we are told he would when a mature man on a journey dismount from his buggy and wade waistdeep in mire to rescue a pig struggling in a swamp indeed appeals to his compassion were so irresistible to him and he felt it so difficult to refuse anything when his refusal could give pain that he himself sometimes spoke of his inability to say no as a positive weakness but that certainly does not prove that his compassionate feeling was confined to individual cases of suffering witnessed with his own eyes as the boy was moved by the aspect of the tortured wood turtle to compose an essay against cruelty to animals in general so the aspect of other cases of suffering and wrong wrought up his moral nature and set his mind to work against cruelty injustice and oppression in general  as his sympathy went forth to others it attracted others to him especially those whom he called the plain people felt themselves drawn to him by the instinctive feeling that he understood esteemed and appreciated them he had grown up among the poor the lowly the ignorant he never ceased to remember the good souls he had met among them and the many kindnesses they had done him although in his mental development he had risen far above them he never looked down upon them how they felt and how they reasoned he knew for so he had once felt and reasoned himself how they could be moved he knew for so he had once been moved himself and practised moving others his mind was much larger than theirs but it thoroughly comprehended theirs and while he thought much farther than they their thoughts were ever present to him nor had the visible distance between them grown as wide as his rise in the world would seem to have warranted much of his backwoods speech and manners still clung to him although he had become mr lincoln to his later acquaintances he was still abe to the nats and billys and daves of his youth and their familiarity neither appeared unnatural to them nor was it in the least awkward to him he still told and enjoyed stories similar to those he had told and enjoyed in the indiana settlement and at new salem his wants remained as modest as they had ever been his domestic habits had by no means completely accommodated themselves to those of his more highborn wife and though the kentucky jeans apparel had long been dropped his clothes of better material and better make would sit ill sorted on his gigantic limbs his cotton umbrella without a handle and tied together with a coarse string to keep it from flapping which he carried on his circuit rides is said to be remembered still by some of his surviving neighbors this rusticity of habit was utterly free from that affected contempt of refinement and comfort which selfmade men sometimes carry into their more affluent circumstances to abraham lincoln it was entirely natural and all those who came into contact with him knew it to be so in his ways of thinking and feeling he had become a gentleman in the highest sense but the refining process had polished but little the outward form the plain people therefore still considered honest abe lincoln one of themselves and when they felt which they no doubt frequently did that his thoughts and aspirations moved in a sphere above their own they were all the more proud of him without any diminution of fellowfeeling it was this relation of mutual sympathy and understanding between lincoln and the plain people that gave him his peculiar power as a public man and singularly fitted him as we shall see for that leadership which was preeminently required in the great crisis then coming onthe leadership which indeed thinks and moves ahead of the masses but always remains within sight and sympathetic touch of them  he entered upon the campaign of 1858 better equipped than he had ever been before he not only instinctively felt but he had convinced himself by arduous study that in this struggle against the spread of slavery he had right justice philosophy the enlightened opinion of mankind history the constitution and good policy on his side it was observed that after he began to discuss the slavery question his speeches were pitched in a much loftier key than his former oratorical efforts while he remained fond of telling funny stories in private conversation they disappeared more and more from his public discourse he would still now and then point his argument with expressions of inimitable quaintness and flash out rays of kindly humor and witty irony but his general tone was serious and rose sometimes to genuine solemnity his masterly skill in dialectical thrust and parry his wealth of knowledge his power of reasoning and elevation of sentiment disclosed in language of rare precision strength and beauty not seldom astonished his old friends  neither of the two champions could have found a more formidable antagonist than each now met in the other douglas was by far the most conspicuous member of his party his admirers had dubbed him the little giant contrasting in that nickname the greatness of his mind with the smallness of his body but though of low stature his broadshouldered figure appeared uncommonly sturdy and there was something lionlike in the squareness of his brow and jaw and in the defiant shake of his long hair his loud and persistent advocacy of territorial expansion in the name of patriotism and manifest destiny had given him an enthusiastic following among the young and ardent great natural parts a highly combative temperament and long training had made him a debater unsurpassed in a senate filled with able men he could be as forceful in his appeals to patriotic feelings as he was fierce in denunciation and thoroughly skilled in all the baser tricks of parliamentary pugilism while genial and rollicking in his social intercoursethe idol of the boys he felt himself one of the most renowned statesmen of his time and would frequently meet his opponents with an overbearing haughtiness as persons more to be pitied than to be feared in his speech opening the campaign of 1858 he spoke of lincoln whom the republicans had dared to advance as their candidate for his place in the senate with an air of patronizing if not contemptuous condescension as a kind amiable and intelligent gentleman and a good citizen the little giant would have been pleased to pass off his antagonist as a tall dwarf he knew lincoln too well however to indulge himself seriously in such a delusion but the political situation was at that moment in a curious tangle and douglas could expect to derive from the confusion great advantage over his opponent  by the repeal of the missouri compromise opening the territories to the ingress of slavery douglas had pleased the south but greatly alarmed the north he had sought to conciliate northern sentiment by appending to his kansasnebraska bill the declaration that its intent was not to legislate slavery into any state or territory nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states this he called the great principle of popular sovereignty when asked whether under this act the people of a territory before its admission as a state would have the right to exclude slavery he answered that is a question for the courts to decide then came the famous dred scott decision in which the supreme court held substantially that the right to hold slaves as property existed in the territories by virtue of the federal constitution and that this right could not be denied by any act of a territorial government this of course denied the right of the people of any territory to exclude slavery while they were in a territorial condition and it alarmed the northern people still more douglas recognized the binding force of the decision of the supreme court at the same time maintaining most illogically that his great principle of popular sovereignty remained in force nevertheless meanwhile the proslavery people of western missouri the socalled border ruffians had invaded kansas set up a constitutional convention made a constitution of an extreme proslavery type the lecompton constitution refused to submit it fairly to a vote of the people of kansas and then referred it to congress for acceptanceseeking thus to accomplish the admission of kansas as a slave state had douglas supported such a scheme he would have lost all foothold in the north in the name of popular sovereignty he loudly declared his opposition to the acceptance of any constitution not sanctioned by a formal popular vote he did not care he said whether slavery be voted up or down but there must be a fair vote of the people thus he drew upon himself the hostility of the buchanan administration which was controlled by the proslavery interest but he saved his northern following more than this not only did his democratic admirers now call him the true champion of freedom but even some republicans of large influence prominent among them horace greeley sympathizing with douglas in his fight against the lecompton constitution and hoping to detach him permanently from the proslavery interest and to force a lasting breach in the democratic party seriously advised the republicans of illinois to give up their opposition to douglas and to help reelect him to the senate lincoln was not of that opinion he believed that great popular movements can succeed only when guided by their faithful friends and that the antislavery cause could not safely be entrusted to the keeping of one who did not care whether slavery be voted up or down this opinion prevailed in illinois but the influences within the republican party over which it prevailed yielded only a reluctant acquiescence if they acquiesced at all after having materially strengthened douglass position such was the situation of things when the campaign of 1858 between lincoln and douglas began  lincoln opened the campaign on his side at the convention which nominated him as the republican candidate for the senatorship with a memorable saying which sounded like a shout from the watchtower of history a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the statesold as well as new north as well as south then he proceeded to point out that the nebraska doctrine combined with the dred scott decision worked in the direction of making the nation all slave here was the irrepressible conflict spoken of by seward a short time later in a speech made famous mainly by that phrase if there was any new discovery in it the right of priority was lincolns this utterance proved not only his statesmanlike conception of the issue but also in his situation as a candidate the firmness of his moral courage the friends to whom he had read the draught of this speech before he delivered it warned him anxiously that its delivery might be fatal to his success in the election this was shrewd advice in the ordinary sense while a slaveholder could threaten disunion with impunity the mere suggestion that the existence of slavery was incompatible with freedom in the union would hazard the political chances of any public man in the north but lincoln was inflexible it is true said he and i will deliver it as written i would rather be defeated with these expressions in my speech held up and discussed before the people than be victorious without them the statesman was right in his farseeing judgment and his conscientious statement of the truth but the practical politicians were also right in their prediction of the immediate effect douglas instantly seized upon the declaration that a house divided against itself cannot stand as the main objective point of his attack interpreting it as an incitement to a relentless sectional war and there is no doubt that the persistent reiteration of this charge served to frighten not a few timid souls  lincoln constantly endeavored to bring the moral and philosophical side of the subject to the foreground slavery is wrong was the keynote of all his speeches to douglass glittering sophism that the right of the people of a territory to have slavery or not as they might desire was in accordance with the principle of true popular sovereignty he made the pointed answer then true popular sovereignty according to senator douglas means that when one man makes another man his slave no third man shall be allowed to object to douglass argument that the principle which demanded that the people of a territory should be permitted to choose whether they would have slavery or not originated when god made man and placed good and evil before him allowing him to choose upon his own responsibility lincoln solemnly replied no goddid not place good and evil before man telling him to make his choice on the contrary god did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat upon pain of death he did not however place himself on the most advanced ground taken by the radical antislavery men he admitted that under the constitution the southern people were entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law although he did not approve the fugitive slave law then existing he declared also that if slavery were kept out of the territories during their territorial existence as it should be and if then the people of any territory having a fair chance and a clear field should do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them he saw no alternative but to admit such a territory into the union he declared further that while he should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the district of columbia he would as a member of congress with his present views not endeavor to bring on that abolition except on condition that emancipation be gradual that it be approved by the decision of a majority of voters in the district and that compensation be made to unwilling owners on every available occasion he pronounced himself in favor of the deportation and colonization of the blacks of course with their consent he repeatedly disavowed any wish on his part to have social and political equality established between whites and blacks on this point he summed up his views in a reply to douglass assertion that the declaration of independence in speaking of all men as being created equal did not include the negroes saying i do not understand the declaration of independence to mean that all men were created equal in all respects they are not equal in color but i believe that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some respects they are equal in their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  with regard to some of these subjects lincoln modified his position at a later period and it has been suggested that he would have professed more advanced principles in his debates with douglas had he not feared thereby to lose votes this view can hardly be sustained lincoln had the courage of his opinions but he was not a radical the man who risked his election by delivering against the urgent protest of his friends the speech about the house divided against itself would not have shrunk from the expression of more extreme views had he really entertained them it is only fair to assume that he said what at the time he really thought and that if subsequently his opinions changed it was owing to new conceptions of good policy and of duty brought forth by an entirely new set of circumstances and exigencies it is characteristic that he continued to adhere to the impracticable colonization plan even after the emancipation proclamation had already been issued  but in this contest lincoln proved himself not only a debater but also a political strategist of the first order the kind amiable and intelligent gentleman as douglas had been pleased to call him was by no means as harmless as a dove he possessed an uncommon share of that worldly shrewdness which not seldom goes with genuine simplicity of character and the political experience gathered in the legislature and in congress and in many election campaigns added to his keen intuitions had made him as farsighted a judge of the probable effects of a public mans sayings or doings upon the popular mind and as accurate a calculator in estimating political chances and forecasting results as could be found among the party managers in illinois and now he perceived keenly the ugly dilemma in which douglas found himself between the dred scott decision which declared the right to hold slaves to exist in the territories by virtue of the federal constitution and his great principle of popular sovereignty according to which the people of a territory if they saw fit were to have the right to exclude slavery therefrom douglas was twisting and squirming to the best of his ability to avoid the admission that the two were incompatible the question then presented itself if it would be good policy for lincoln to force douglas to a clear expression of his opinion as to whether the dred scott decision notwithstanding the people of a territory could in any lawful way exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution lincoln foresaw and predicted what douglas would answer that slavery could not exist in a territory unless the people desired it and gave it protection by territorial legislation in an improvised caucus the policy of pressing the interrogatory on douglas was discussed lincolns friends unanimously advised against it because the answer foreseen would sufficiently commend douglas to the people of illinois to insure his reelection to the senate but lincoln persisted i am after larger game said he if douglas so answers he can never be president and the battle of 1860 is worth a hundred of this the interrogatory was pressed upon douglas and douglas did answer that no matter what the decision of the supreme court might be on the abstract question the people of a territory had the lawful means to introduce or exclude slavery by territorial legislation friendly or unfriendly to the institution lincoln found it easy to show the absurdity of the proposition that if slavery were admitted to exist of right in the territories by virtue of the supreme law the federal constitution it could be kept out or expelled by an inferior law one made by a territorial legislature again the judgment of the politicians having only the nearest object in view proved correct douglas was reelected to the senate but lincolns judgment proved correct also douglas by resorting to the expedient of his unfriendly legislation doctrine forfeited his last chance of becoming president of the united states he might have hoped to win by sufficient atonement his pardon from the south for his opposition to the lecompton constitution but that he taught the people of the territories a trick by which they could defeat what the proslavery men considered a constitutional right and that he called that trick lawful this the slave power would never forgive the breach between the southern and the northern democracy was thenceforth irremediable and fatal  the presidential election of 1860 approached the struggle in kansas and the debates in congress which accompanied it and which not unfrequently provoked violent outbursts continually stirred the popular excitement within the democratic party raged the war of factions the national democratic convention met at charleston on the 23d of april 1860 after a struggle of ten days between the adherents and the opponents of douglas during which the delegates from the cotton states had withdrawn the convention adjourned without having nominated any candidates to meet again in baltimore on the 18th of june there was no prospect however of reconciling the hostile elements it appeared very probable that the baltimore convention would nominate douglas while the seceding southern democrats would set up a candidate of their own representing extreme proslavery principles  meanwhile the national republican convention assembled at chicago on the 16th of may full of enthusiasm and hope the situation was easily understood the democrats would have the south in order to succeed in the election the republicans had to win in addition to the states carried by fremont in 1856 those that were classed as doubtfulnew jersey pennsylvania and indiana or illinois in the place of either new jersey or indiana the most eminent republican statesmen and leaders of the time thought of for the presidency were seward and chase both regarded as belonging to the more advanced order of antislavery men of the two seward had the largest following mainly from new york new england and the northwest cautious politicians doubted seriously whether seward to whom some phrases in his speeches had undeservedly given the reputation of a reckless radical would be able to command the whole republican vote in the doubtful states besides during his long public career he had made enemies it was evident that those who thought sewards nomination too hazardous an experiment would consider chase unavailable for the same reason they would then look round for an available man and among the available men abraham lincoln was easily discovered to stand foremost his great debate with douglas had given him a national reputation the people of the east being eager to see the hero of so dramatic a contest he had been induced to visit several eastern cities and had astonished and delighted large and distinguished audiences with speeches of singular power and originality an address delivered by him in the cooper institute in new york before an audience containing a large number of important persons was then and has ever since been especially praised as one of the most logical and convincing political speeches ever made in this country the people of the west had grown proud of him as a distinctively western great man and his popularity at home had some peculiar features which could be expected to exercise a potent charm nor was lincolns name as that of an available candidate left to the chance of accidental discovery it is indeed not probable that he thought of himself as a presidential possibility during his contest with douglas for the senatorship as late as april 1859 he had written to a friend who had approached him on the subject that he did not think himself fit for the presidency the vicepresidency was then the limit of his ambition but some of his friends in illinois took the matter seriously in hand and lincoln after some hesitation then formally authorized the use of his name the matter was managed with such energy and excellent judgment that in the convention he had not only the whole vote of illinois to start with but won votes on all sides without offending any rival a large majority of the opponents of seward went over to abraham lincoln and gave him the nomination on the third ballot as had been foreseen douglas was nominated by one wing of the democratic party at baltimore while the extreme proslavery wing put breckinridge into the field as its candidate after a campaign conducted with the energy of genuine enthusiasm on the antislavery side the united republicans defeated the divided democrats and lincoln was elected president by a majority of fiftyseven votes in the electoral colleges  the result of the election had hardly been declared when the disunion movement in the south long threatened and carefully planned and prepared broke out in the shape of open revolt and nearly a month before lincoln could be inaugurated as president of the united states seven southern states had adopted ordinances of secession formed an independent confederacy framed a constitution for it and elected jefferson davis its president expecting the other slaveholding states soon to join them on the 11th of february 1861 lincoln left springfield for washington having with characteristic simplicity asked his law partner not to change the sign of the firm lincoln and herndon during the four years unavoidable absence of the senior partner and having taken an affectionate and touching leave of his neighbors  the situation which confronted the new president was appalling the larger part of the south in open rebellion the rest of the slaveholding states wavering preparing to follow the revolt guided by determined daring and skillful leaders the southern people apparently full of enthusiasm and military spirit rushing to arms some of the forts and arsenals already in their possession the government of the union before the accession of the new president in the hands of men some of whom actively sympathized with the revolt while others were hampered by their traditional doctrines in dealing with it and really gave it aid and comfort by their irresolute attitude all the departments full of southern sympathizers and honeycombed with disloyalty the treasury empty and the public credit at the lowest ebb the arsenals ill supplied with arms if not emptied by treacherous practices the regular army of insignificant strength dispersed over an immense surface and deprived of some of its best officers by defection the navy small and antiquated but that was not all the threat of disunion had so often been resorted to by the slave power in years gone by that most northern people had ceased to believe in its seriousness but when disunion actually appeared as a stern reality something like a chill swept through the whole northern country a cry for union and peace at any price rose on all sides democratic partisanship reiterated this cry with vociferous vehemence and even many republicans grew afraid of the victory they had just achieved at the ballotbox and spoke of compromise the country fairly resounded with the noise of anticoercion meetings expressions of firm resolution from determined antislavery men were indeed not wanting but they were for a while almost drowned by a bewildering confusion of discordant voices even this was not all potent influences in europe with an illconcealed desire for the permanent disruption of the american union eagerly espoused the cause of the southern seceders and the two principal maritime powers of the old world seemed only to be waiting for a favorable opportunity to lend them a helping hand  this was the state of things to be mastered by honest abe lincoln when he took his seat in the presidential chairhonest abe lincoln who was so goodnatured that he could not say no the greatest achievement in whose life had been a debate on the slavery question who had never been in any position of power who was without the slightest experience of high executive duties and who had only a speaking acquaintance with the men upon whose counsel and cooperation he was to depend nor was his accession to power under such circumstances greeted with general confidence even by the members of his party while he had indeed won much popularity many republicans especially among those who had advocated sewards nomination for the presidency saw the simple illinois lawyer take the reins of government with a feeling little short of dismay the orators and journals of the opposition were ridiculing and lampooning him without measure many people actually wondered how such a man could dare to undertake a task which as he himself had said to his neighbors in his parting speech was more difficult than that of washington himself had been  but lincoln brought to that task aside from other uncommon qualities the first requisitean intuitive comprehension of its nature while he did not indulge in the delusion that the union could be maintained or restored without a conflict of arms he could indeed not foresee all the problems he would have to solve he instinctively understood however by what means that conflict would have to be conducted by the government of a democracy he knew that the impending war whether great or small would not be like a foreign war exciting a united national enthusiasm but a civil war likely to fan to uncommon heat the animosities of party even in the localities controlled by the government that this war would have to be carried on not by means of a readymade machinery ruled by an undisputed absolute will but by means to be furnished by the voluntary action of the peoplearmies to be formed by voluntary enlistments large sums of money to be raised by the people through representatives voluntarily taxing themselves trust of extraordinary power to be voluntarily granted and war measures not seldom restricting the rights and liberties to which the citizen was accustomed to be voluntarily accepted and submitted to by the people or at least a large majority of them and that this would have to be kept up not merely during a short period of enthusiastic excitement but possibly through weary years of alternating success and disaster hope and despondency he knew that in order to steer this government by public opinion successfully through all the confusion created by the prejudices and doubts and differences of sentiment distracting the popular mind and so to propitiate inspire mould organize unite and guide the popular will that it might give forth all the means required for the performance of his great task he would have to take into account all the influences strongly affecting the current of popular thought and feeling and to direct while appearing to obey  this was the kind of leadership he intuitively conceived to be needed when a free people were to be led forward en masse to overcome a great common danger under circumstances of appalling difficulty the leadership which does not dash ahead with brilliant daring no matter who follows but which is intent upon rallying all the available forces gathering in the stragglers closing up the column so that the front may advance well supported for this leadership abraham lincoln was admirably fitted better than any other american statesman of his day for he understood the plain people with all their loves and hates their prejudices and their noble impulses their weaknesses and their strength as he understood himself and his sympathetic nature was apt to draw their sympathy to him  his inaugural address foreshadowed his official course in characteristic manner although yielding nothing in point of principle it was by no means a flaming antislavery manifesto such as would have pleased the more ardent republicans it was rather the entreaty of a sorrowing father speaking to his wayward children in the kindliest language he pointed out to the secessionists how ill advised their attempt at disunion was and why for their own sakes they should desist almost plaintively he told them that while it was not their duty to destroy the union it was his sworn duty to preserve it that the least he could do under the obligations of his oath was to possess and hold the property of the united states that he hoped to do this peaceably that he abhorred war for any purpose and that they would have none unless they themselves were the aggressors it was a masterpiece of persuasiveness and while lincoln had accepted many valuable amendments suggested by seward it was essentially his own probably lincoln himself did not expect his inaugural address to have any effect upon the secessionists for he must have known them to be resolved upon disunion at any cost but it was an appeal to the wavering minds in the north and upon them it made a profound impression every candid man however timid and halting had to admit that the president was bound by his oath to do his duty that under that oath he could do no less than he said he would do that if the secessionists resisted such an appeal as the president had made they were bent upon mischief and that the government must be supported against them the partisan sympathy with the southern insurrection which still existed in the north did indeed not disappear but it diminished perceptibly under the influence of such reasoning those who still resisted it did so at the risk of appearing unpatriotic  it must not be supposed however that lincoln at once succeeded in pleasing everybody even among his friendseven among those nearest to him in selecting his cabinet which he did substantially before he left springfield for washington he thought it wise to call to his assistance the strong men of his party especially those who had given evidence of the support they commanded as his competitors in the chicago convention in them he found at the same time representatives of the different shades of opinion within the party and of the different elementsformer whigs and former democratsfrom which the party had recruited itself this was sound policy under the circumstances it might indeed have been foreseen that among the members of a cabinet so composed troublesome disagreements and rivalries would break out but it was better for the president to have these strong and ambitious men near him as his cooperators than to have them as his critics in congress where their differences might have been composed in a common opposition to him as members of his cabinet he could hope to control them and to keep them busily employed in the service of a common purpose if he had the strength to do so whether he did possess this strength was soon tested by a singularly rude trial  there can be no doubt that the foremost members of his cabinet seward and chase the most eminent republican statesmen had felt themselves wronged by their party when in its national convention it preferred to them for the presidency a man whom not unnaturally they thought greatly their inferior in ability and experience as well as in service the soreness of that disappointment was intensified when they saw this western man in the white house with so much of rustic manner and speech as still clung to him meeting his fellowcitizens high and low on a footing of equality with the simplicity of his good nature unburdened by any conventional dignity of deportment and dealing with the great business of state in an easygoing unmethodical and apparently somewhat irreverent way they did not understand such a man especially seward who as secretary of state considered himself next to the chief executive and who quickly accustomed himself to giving orders and making arrangements upon his own motion thought it necessary that he should rescue the direction of public affairs from hands so unskilled and take full charge of them himself at the end of the first month of the administration he submitted a memorandum to president lincoln which has been first brought to light by nicolay and hay and is one of their most valuable contributions to the history of those days in that paper seward actually told the president that at the end of a months administration the government was still without a policy either domestic or foreign that the slavery question should be eliminated from the struggle about the union that the matter of the maintenance of the forts and other possessions in the south should be decided with that view that explanations should be demanded categorically from the governments of spain and france which were then preparing one for the annexation of san domingo and both for the invasion of mexico that if no satisfactory explanations were received war should be declared against spain and france by the united states that explanations should also be sought from russia and great britain and a vigorous continental spirit of independence against european intervention be aroused all over the american continent that this policy should be incessantly pursued and directed by somebody that either the president should devote himself entirely to it or devolve the direction on some member of his cabinet whereupon all debate on this policy must end  this could be understood only as a formal demand that the president should acknowledge his own incompetency to perform his duties content himself with the amusement of distributing postoffices and resign his power as to all important affairs into the hands of his secretary of state it seems today incomprehensible how a statesman of sewards calibre could at that period conceive a plan of policy in which the slavery question had no place a policy which rested upon the utterly delusive assumption that the secessionists who had already formed their southern confederacy and were with stern resolution preparing to fight for its independence could be hoodwinked back into the union by some sentimental demonstration against european interference a policy which at that critical moment would have involved the union in a foreign war thus inviting foreign intervention in favor of the southern confederacy and increasing tenfold its chances in the struggle for independence but it is equally incomprehensible how seward could fail to see that this demand of an unconditional surrender was a mortal insult to the head of the government and that by putting his proposition on paper he delivered himself into the hands of the very man he had insulted for had lincoln as most presidents would have done instantly dismissed seward and published the true reason for that dismissal it would inevitably have been the end of sewards career but lincoln did what not many of the noblest and greatest men in history would have been noble and great enough to do he considered that seward was still capable of rendering great service to his country in the place in which he was if rightly controlled he ignored the insult but firmly established his superiority in his reply which he forthwith despatched he told seward that the administration had a domestic policy as laid down in the inaugural address with sewards approval that it had a foreign policy as traced in sewards despatches with the presidents approval that if any policy was to be maintained or changed he the president was to direct that on his responsibility and that in performing that duty the president had a right to the advice of his secretaries sewards fantastic schemes of foreign war and continental policies lincoln brushed aside by passing them over in silence nothing more was said seward must have felt that he was at the mercy of a superior man that his offensive proposition had been generously pardoned as a temporary aberration of a great mind and that he could atone for it only by devoted personal loyalty this he did he was thoroughly subdued and thenceforth submitted to lincoln his despatches for revision and amendment without a murmur the war with european nations was no longer thought of the slavery question found in due time its proper place in the struggle for the union and when at a later period the dismissal of seward was demanded by dissatisfied senators who attributed to him the shortcomings of the administration lincoln stood stoutly by his faithful secretary of state  chase the secretary of the treasury a man of superb presence of eminent ability and ardent patriotism of great natural dignity and a certain outward coldness of manner which made him appear more difficult of approach than he really was did not permit his disappointment to burst out in such extravagant demonstrations but lincolns ways were so essentially different from his that they never became quite intelligible and certainly not congenial to him it might perhaps have been better had there been at the beginning of the administration some decided clash between lincoln and chase as there was between lincoln and seward to bring on a full mutual explanation and to make chase appreciate the real seriousness of lincolns nature but as it was their relations always remained somewhat formal and chase never felt quite at ease under a chief whom he could not understand and whose character and powers he never learned to esteem at their true value at the same time he devoted himself zealously to the duties of his department and did the country arduous service under circumstances of extreme difficulty nobody recognized this more heartily than lincoln himself and they managed to work together until near the end of lincolns first presidential term when chase after some disagreements concerning appointments to office resigned from the treasury and after taneys death the president made him chief justice  the rest of the cabinet consisted of men of less eminence who subordinated themselves more easily in january 1862 lincoln found it necessary to bow cameron out of the war office and to put in his place edwin m stanton a man of intensely practical mind vehement impulses fierce positiveness ruthless energy immense working power lofty patriotism and severest devotion to duty he accepted the war office not as a partisan for he had never been a republican but only to do all he could in helping to save the country the manner in which lincoln succeeded in taming this lion to his will by frankly recognizing his great qualities by giving him the most generous confidence by aiding him in his work to the full of his power by kindly concession or affectionate persuasiveness in cases of differing opinions or when it was necessary by firm assertions of superior authority bears the highest testimony to his skill in the management of men stanton who had entered the service with rather a mean opinion of lincolns character and capacity became one of his warmest most devoted and most admiring friends and with none of his secretaries was lincolns intercourse more intimate to take advice with candid readiness and to weigh it without any pride of his own opinion was one of lincolns preeminent virtues but he had not long presided over his cabinet council when his was felt by all its members to be the ruling mind  the cautious policy foreshadowed in his inaugural address and pursued during the first period of the civil war was far from satisfying all his party friends the ardent spirits among the union men thought that the whole north should at once be called to arms to crush the rebellion by one powerful blow the ardent spirits among the antislavery men insisted that slavery having brought forth the rebellion this powerful blow should at once be aimed at slavery both complained that the administration was spiritless undecided and lamentably slow in its proceedings lincoln reasoned otherwise the ways of thinking and feeling of the masses of the plain people were constantly present to his mind the masses the plain people had to furnish the men for the fighting if fighting was to be done he believed that the plain people would be ready to fight when it clearly appeared necessary and that they would feel that necessity when they felt themselves attacked he therefore waited until the enemies of the union struck the first blow as soon as on the 12th of april 1861 the first gun was fired in charleston harbor on the union flag upon fort sumter the call was sounded and the northern people rushed to arms  lincoln knew that the plain people were now indeed ready to fight in defence of the union but not yet ready to fight for the destruction of slavery he declared openly that he had a right to summon the people to fight for the union but not to summon them to fight for the abolition of slavery as a primary object and this declaration gave him numberless soldiers for the union who at that period would have hesitated to do battle against the institution of slavery for a time he succeeded in rendering harmless the cry of the partisan opposition that the republican administration were perverting the war for the union into an abolition war but when he went so far as to countermand the acts of some generals in the field looking to the emancipation of the slaves in the districts covered by their commands loud complaints arose from earnest antislavery men who accused the president of turning his back upon the antislavery cause many of these antislavery men will now after a calm retrospect be willing to admit that it would have been a hazardous policy to endanger by precipitating a demonstrative fight against slavery the success of the struggle for the union  lincolns views and feelings concerning slavery had not changed those who conversed with him intimately upon the subject at that period know that he did not expect slavery long to survive the triumph of the union even if it were not immediately destroyed by the war in this he was right had the union armies achieved a decisive victory in an early period of the conflict and had the seceded states been received back with slavery the slave power would then have been a defeated power defeated in an attempt to carry out its most effective threat it would have lost its prestige its menaces would have been hollow sound and ceased to make any one afraid it could no longer have hoped to expand to maintain an equilibrium in any branch of congress and to control the government the victorious free states would have largely overbalanced it it would no longer have been able to withstand the onset of a hostile age it could no longer have ruledand slavery had to rule in order to live it would have lingered for a while but it would surely have been in the course of ultimate extinction a prolonged war precipitated the destruction of slavery a short war might only have prolonged its death struggle lincoln saw this clearly but he saw also that in a protracted death struggle it might still have kept disloyal sentiments alive bred distracting commotions and caused great mischief to the country he therefore hoped that slavery would not survive the war  but the question how he could rightfully employ his power to bring on its speedy destruction was to him not a question of mere sentiment he himself set forth his reasoning upon it at a later period in one of his inimitable letters i am naturally antislavery said he if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong i cannot remember the time when i did not so think and feel and yet i have never understood that the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act upon that judgment and feeling it was in the oath i took that i would to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states i could not take the office without taking the oath nor was it my view that i might take an oath to get power and break the oath in using that power i understood too that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me practically to indulge my private abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery i did understand however also that my oath imposed upon me the duty of preserving to the best of my ability by every indispensable means that government that nation of which the constitution was the organic law i could not feel that to the best of my ability i had even tied to preserve the constitutionif to save slavery or any minor matter i should permit the wreck of government country and constitution all together in other words if the salvation of the government the constitution and the union demanded the destruction of slavery he felt it to be not only his right but his sworn duty to destroy it its destruction became a necessity of the war for the union  as the war dragged on and disaster followed disaster the sense of that necessity steadily grew upon him early in 1862 as some of his friends well remember he saw what seward seemed not to see that to give the war for the union an antislavery character was the surest means to prevent the recognition of the southern confederacy as an independent nation by european powers that slavery being abhorred by the moral sense of civilized mankind no european government would dare to offer so gross an insult to the public opinion of its people as openly to favor the creation of a state founded upon slavery to the prejudice of an existing nation fighting against slavery he saw also that slavery untouched was to the rebellion an element of power and that in order to overcome that power it was necessary to turn it into an element of weakness still he felt no assurance that the plain people were prepared for so radical a measure as the emancipation of the slaves by act of the government and he anxiously considered that if they were not this great step might by exciting dissension at the north injure the cause of the union in one quarter more than it would help it in another he heartily welcomed an effort made in new york to mould and stimulate public sentiment on the slavery question by public meetings boldly pronouncing for emancipation at the same time he himself cautiously advanced with a recommendation expressed in a special message to congress that the united states should cooperate with any state which might adopt the gradual abolishment of slavery giving such state pecuniary aid to compensate the former owners of emancipated slaves the discussion was started and spread rapidly congress adopted the resolution recommended and soon went a step farther in passing a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia the plain people began to look at emancipation on a larger scale as a thing to be considered seriously by patriotic citizens and soon lincoln thought that the time was ripe and that the edict of freedom could be ventured upon without danger of serious confusion in the union ranks  the failure of mcclellans movement upon richmond increased immensely the prestige of the enemy the need of some great act to stimulate the vitality of the union cause seemed to grow daily more pressing on july 21 1862 lincoln surprised his cabinet with the draught of a proclamation declaring free the slaves in all the states that should be still in rebellion against the united states on the 1st of january1863 as to the matter itself he announced that he had fully made up his mind he invited advice only concerning the form and the time of publication seward suggested that the proclamation if then brought out amidst disaster and distress would sound like the last shriek of a perishing cause lincoln accepted the suggestion and the proclamation was postponed another defeat followed the second at bull run but when after that battle the confederate army under lee crossed the potomac and invaded maryland lincoln vowed in his heart that if the union army were now blessed with success the decree of freedom should surely be issued the victory of antietam was won on september 17 and the preliminary emancipation proclamation came forth on the a 22d it was lincolns own resolution and act but practically it bound the nation and permitted no step backward in spite of its limitations it was the actual abolition of slavery thus he wrote his name upon the books of history with the title dearest to his heart the liberator of the slave  it is true the great proclamation which stamped the war as one for union and freedom did not at once mark the turning of the tide on the field of military operations there were more disasters fredericksburg and chancellorsville but with gettysburg and vicksburg the whole aspect of the war changed step by step now more slowly then more rapidly but with increasing steadiness the flag of the union advanced from field to field toward the final consummation the decree of emancipation was naturally followed by the enlistment of emancipated negroes in the union armies this measure had a anther reaching effect than merely giving the union armies an increased supply of men the laboring force of the rebellion was hopelessly disorganized the war became like a problem of arithmetic as the union armies pushed forward the area from which the southern confederacy could draw recruits and supplies constantly grew smaller while the area from which the union recruited its strength constantly grew larger and everywhere even within the southern lines the union had its allies the fate of the rebellion was then virtually decided but it still required much bloody work to convince the brave warriors who fought for it that they were really beaten  neither did the emancipation proclamation forthwith command universal assent among the people who were loyal to the union there were even signs of a reaction against the administration in the fall elections of 1862 seemingly justifying the opinion entertained by many that the president had really anticipated the development of popular feeling the cry that the war for the union had been turned into an abolition war was raised again by the opposition and more loudly than ever but the good sense and patriotic instincts of the plain people gradually marshalled themselves on lincolns side and he lost no opportunity to help on this process by personal argument and admonition there never has been a president in such constant and active contact with the public opinion of the country as there never has been a president who while at the head of the government remained so near to the people beyond the circle of those who had long known him the feeling steadily grew that the man in the white house was honest abe lincoln still and that every citizen might approach him with complaint expostulation or advice without danger of meeting a rebuff from powerproud authority or humiliating condescension and this privilege was used by so many and with such unsparing freedom that only superhuman patience could have endured it all there are men now living who would today read with amazement if not regret what they ventured to say or write to him but lincoln repelled no one whom he believed to speak to him in good faith and with patriotic purpose no good advice would go unheeded no candid criticism would offend him no honest opposition while it might pain him would produce a lasting alienation of feeling between him and the opponent it may truly be said that few men in power have ever been exposed to more daring attempts to direct their course to severer censure of their acts and to more cruel misrepresentation of their motives and all this he met with that goodnatured humor peculiarly his own and with untiring effort to see the right and to impress it upon those who differed from him the conversations he had and the correspondence he carried on upon matters of public interest not only with men in official position but with private citizens were almost unceasing and in a large number of public letters written ostensibly to meetings or committees or persons of importance he addressed himself directly to the popular mind most of these letters stand among the finest monuments of our political literature thus he presented the singular spectacle of a president who in the midst of a great civil war with unprecedented duties weighing upon him was constantly in person debating the great features of his policy with the people  while in this manner he exercised an everincreasing influence upon the popular understanding his sympathetic nature endeared him more and more to the popular heart in vain did journals and speakers of the opposition represent him as a lightminded trifler who amused himself with frivolous storytelling and coarse jokes while the blood of the people was flowing in streams the people knew that the man at the head of affairs on whose haggard face the twinkle of humor so frequently changed into an expression of profoundest sadness was more than any other deeply distressed by the suffering he witnessed that he felt the pain of every wound that was inflicted on the battlefield and the anguish of every woman or child who had lost husband or father that whenever he could he was eager to alleviate sorrow and that his mercy was never implored in vain they looked to him as one who was with them and of them in all their hopes and fears their joys and sorrows who laughed with them and wept with them and as his heart was theirs so their hearts turned to him his popularity was far different from that of washington who was revered with awe or that of jackson the unconquerable hero for whom party enthusiasm never grew weary of shouting to abraham lincoln the people became bound by a genuine sentimental attachment it was not a matter of respect or confidence or party pride for this feeling spread far beyond the boundary lines of his party it was an affair of the heart independent of mere reasoning when the soldiers in the field or their folks at home spoke of father abraham there was no cant in it they felt that their president was really caring for them as a father would and that they could go to him every one of them as they would go to a father and talk to him of what troubled them sure to find a willing ear and tender sympathy thus their president and his cause and his endeavors and his success gradually became to them almost matters of family concern and this popularity carried him triumphantly through the presidential election of 1864 in spite of an opposition within his own party which at first seemed very formidable  many of the radical antislavery men were never quite satisfied with lincolns ways of meeting the problems of the time they were very earnest and mostly very able men who had positive ideas as to how this rebellion should be put down they would not recognize the necessity of measuring the steps of the government according to the progress of opinion among the plain people they criticised lincolns cautious management as irresolute halting lacking in definite purpose and in energy he should not have delayed emancipation so long he should not have confided important commands to men of doubtful views as to slavery he should have authorized military commanders to set the slaves free as they went on he dealt too leniently with unsuccessful generals he should have put down all factious opposition with a strong hand instead of trying to pacify it he should have given the people accomplished facts instead of arguing with them and so on it is true these criticisms were not always entirely unfounded lincolns policy had with the virtues of democratic government some of its weaknesses which in the presence of pressing exigencies were apt to deprive governmental action of the necessary vigor and his kindness of heart his disposition always to respect the feelings of others frequently made him recoil from anything like severity even when severity was urgently called for but many of his radical critics have since then revised their judgment sufficiently to admit that lincolns policy was on the whole the wisest and safest that a policy of heroic methods while it has sometimes accomplished great results could in a democracy like ours be maintained only by constant success that it would have quickly broken down under the weight of disaster that it might have been successful from the start had the union at the beginning of the conflict had its grants and shermans and sheridans its farraguts and porters fully matured at the head of its forces but that as the great commanders had to be evolved slowly from the developments of the war constant success could not be counted upon and it was best to follow a policy which was in friendly contact with the popular force and therefore more fit to stand trial of misfortune on the battlefield but at that period they thought differently and their dissatisfaction with lincolns doings was greatly increased by the steps he took toward the reconstruction of rebel states then partially in possession of the union forces  in december 1863 lincoln issued an amnesty proclamation offering pardon to all implicated in the rebellion with certain specified exceptions on condition of their taking and maintaining an oath to support the constitution and obey the laws of the united states and the proclamations of the president with regard to slaves and also promising that when in any of the rebel states a number of citizens equal to one tenth of the voters in 1860 should reestablish a state government in conformity with the oath above mentioned such should be recognized by the executive as the true government of the state the proclamation seemed at first to be received with general favor but soon another scheme of reconstruction much more stringent in its provisions was put forward in the house of representatives by henry winter davis benjamin wade championed it in the senate it passed in the closing moments of the session in july 1864 and lincoln instead of making it a law by his signature embodied the text of it in a proclamation as a plan of reconstruction worthy of being earnestly considered the differences of opinion concerning this subject had only intensified the feeling against lincoln which had long been nursed among the radicals and some of them openly declared their purpose of resisting his reelection to the presidency similar sentiments were manifested by the advanced antislavery men of missouri who in their hot factionfight with the conservatives of that state had not received from lincoln the active support they demanded still another class of union men mainly in the east gravely shook their heads when considering the question whether lincoln should be reelected they were those who cherished in their minds an ideal of statesmanship and of personal bearing in high office with which in their opinion lincolns individuality was much out of accord they were shocked when they heard him cap an argument upon grave affairs of state with a story about a man out in sangamon countya story to be sure strikingly clinching his point but sadly lacking in dignity they could not understand the man who was capable in opening a cabinet meeting of reading to his secretaries a funny chapter from a recent book of artemus ward with which in an unoccupied moment he had relieved his careburdened mind and who then solemnly informed the executive council that he had vowed in his heart to issue a proclamation emancipating the slaves as soon as god blessed the union arms with another victory they were alarmed at the weakness of a president who would indeed resist the urgent remonstrances of statesmen against his policy but could not resist the prayer of an old woman for the pardon of a soldier who was sentenced to be shot for desertion such men mostly sincere and ardent patriots not only wished but earnestly set to work to prevent lincolns renomination not a few of them actually believed in 1863 that if the national convention of the union party were held then lincoln would not be supported by the delegation of a single state but when the convention met at baltimore in june 1864 the voice of the people was heard on the first ballot lincoln received the votes of the delegations from all the states except missouri and even the missourians turned over their votes to him before the result of the ballot was declared  but even after his renomination the opposition to lincoln within the ranks of the union party did not subside a convention called by the dissatisfied radicals in missouri and favored by men of a similar way of thinking in other states had been held already in may and had nominated as its candidate for the presidency general fremont he indeed did not attract a strong following but opposition movements from different quarters appeared more formidable henry winter davis and benjamin wade assailed lincoln in a flaming manifesto other union men of undoubted patriotism and high standing persuaded themselves and sought to persuade the people that lincolns renomination was ill advised and dangerous to the union cause as the democrats had put off their convention until the 29th of august the union party had during the larger part of the summer no opposing candidate and platform to attack and the political campaign languished neither were the tidings from the theatre of war of a cheering character the terrible losses suffered by grants army in the battles of the wilderness spread general gloom sherman seemed for a while to be in a precarious position before atlanta the opposition to lincoln within the union party grew louder in its complaints and discouraging predictions earnest demands were heard that his candidacy should be withdrawn lincoln himself not knowing how strongly the masses were attached to him was haunted by dark forebodings of defeat then the scene suddenly changed as if by magic  the democrats in their national convention declared the war a failure demanded substantially peace at any price and nominated on such a platform general mcclellan as their candidate their convention had hardly adjourned when the capture of atlanta gave a new aspect to the military situation it was like a sunray bursting through a dark cloud the rank and file of the union party rose with rapidly growing enthusiasm the song we are coming father abraham three hundred thousand strong resounded all over the land long before the decisive day arrived the result was beyond doubt and lincoln was reelected president by overwhelming majorities the election over even his severest critics found themselves forced to admit that lincoln was the only possible candidate for the union party in 1864 and that neither political combinations nor campaign speeches nor even victories in the field were needed to insure his success the plain people had all the while been satisfied with abraham lincoln they confided in him they loved him they felt themselves near to him they saw personified in him the cause of union and freedom and they went to the ballotbox for him in their strength  the hour of triumph called out the characteristic impulses of his nature the opposition within the union party had stung him to the quick now he had his opponents before him baffled and humiliated not a moment did he lose to stretch out the hand of friendship to all now that the election is over he said in response to a serenade may not all having a common interest reunite in a common effort to save our common country for my own part i have striven and will strive to place no obstacle in the way so long as i have been here i have not willingly planted a thorn in any mans bosom while i am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a reelection it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be pained or disappointed by the result may i ask those who were with me to join with me in the same spirit toward those who were against me this was abraham lincolns character as tested in the furnace of prosperity  the war was virtually decided but not yet ended sherman was irresistibly carrying the union flag through the south grant had his iron hand upon the ramparts of richmond the days of the confederacy were evidently numbered only the last blow remained to be struck then lincolns second inauguration came and with it his second inaugural address lincolns famous gettysburg speech has been much and justly admired but far greater as well as far more characteristic was that inaugural in which he poured out the whole devotion and tenderness of his great soul it had all the solemnity of a fathers last admonition and blessing to his children before he lay down to die these were its closing words fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled up by the bondmans two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations  this was like a sacred poem no american president had ever spoken words like these to the american people america never had a president who found such words in the depth of his heart  now followed the closing scenes of the war the southern armies fought bravely to the last but all in vain richmond fell lincoln himself entered the city on foot accompanied only by a few officers and a squad of sailors who had rowed him ashore from the flotilla in the james river a negro picked up on the way serving as a guide never had the world seen a more modest conqueror and a more characteristic triumphal procession no army with banners and drums only a throng of those who had been slaves hastily run together escorting the victorious chief into the capital of the vanquished foe we are told that they pressed around him kissed his hands and his garments and shouted and danced for joy while tears ran down the presidents carefurrowed cheeks  a few days more brought the surrender of lees army and peace was assured the people of the north were wild with joy everywhere festive guns were booming bells pealing the churches ringing with thanksgivings and jubilant multitudes thronging the thoroughfares when suddenly the news flashed over the land that abraham lincoln had been murdered the people were stunned by the blow then a wail of sorrow went up such as america had never heard before thousands of northern households grieved as if they had lost their dearest member many a southern man cried out in his heart that his people had been robbed of their best friend in their humiliation and distress when abraham lincoln was struck down it was as if the tender affection which his countrymen bore him had inspired all nations with a common sentiment all civilized mankind stood mourning around the coffin of the dead president many of those here and abroad who not long before had ridiculed and reviled him were among the first to hasten on with their flowers of eulogy and in that universal chorus of lamentation and praise there was not a voice that did not tremble with genuine emotion never since washingtons death had there been such unanimity of judgment as to a mans virtues and greatness and even washingtons death although his name was held in greater reverence did not touch so sympathetic a chord in the peoples hearts  nor can it be said that this was owing to the tragic character of lincolns end it is true the death of this gentlest and most merciful of rulers by the hand of a mad fanatic was well apt to exalt him beyond his merits in the estimation of those who loved him and to make his renown the object of peculiarly tender solicitude but it is also true that the verdict pronounced upon him in those days has been affected little by time and that historical inquiry has served rather to increase than to lessen the appreciation of his virtues his abilities his services giving the fullest measure of credit to his great ministersto seward for his conduct of foreign affairs to chase for the management of the finances under terrible difficulties to stanton for the performance of his tremendous task as war secretaryand readily acknowledging that without the skill and fortitude of the great commanders and the heroism of the soldiers and sailors under them success could not have been achieved the historian still finds that lincolns judgment and will were by no means governed by those around him that the most important steps were owing to his initiative that his was the deciding and directing mind and that it was preeminently he whose sagacity and whose character enlisted for the administration in its struggles the countenance the sympathy and the support of the people it is found even that his judgment on military matters was astonishingly acute and that the advice and instructions he gave to the generals commanding in the field would not seldom have done honor to the ablest of them history therefore without overlooking or palliating or excusing any of his shortcomings or mistakes continues to place him foremost among the saviours of the union and the liberators of the slave more than that it awards to him the merit of having accomplished what but few political philosophers would have recognized as possibleof leading the republic through four years of furious civil conflict without any serious detriment to its free institutions  he was indeed while president violently denounced by the opposition as a tyrant and a usurper for having gone beyond his constitutional powers in authorizing or permitting the temporary suppression of newspapers and in wantonly suspending the writ of habeas corpus and resorting to arbitrary arrests nobody should be blamed who when such things are done in good faith and from patriotic motives protests against them in a republic arbitrary stretches of power even when demanded by necessity should never be permitted to pass without a protest on the one hand and without an apology on the other it is well they did not so pass during our civil war that arbitrary measures were resorted to is true that they were resorted to most sparingly and only when the government thought them absolutely required by the safety of the republic will now hardly be denied but certain it is that the history of the world does not furnish a single example of a government passing through so tremendous a crisis as our civil war was with so small a record of arbitrary acts and so little interference with the ordinary course of law outside the field of military operations no american president ever wielded such power as that which was thrust into lincolns hands it is to be hoped that no american president ever will have to be entrusted with such power again but no man was ever entrusted with it to whom its seductions were less dangerous than they proved to be to abraham lincoln with scrupulous care he endeavored even under the most trying circumstances to remain strictly within the constitutional limitations of his authority and whenever the boundary became indistinct or when the dangers of the situation forced him to cross it he was equally careful to mark his acts as exceptional measures justifiable only by the imperative necessities of the civil war so that they might not pass into history as precedents for similar acts in time of peace it is an unquestionable fact that during the reconstruction period which followed the war more things were done capable of serving as dangerous precedents than during the war itself thus it may truly be said of him not only that under his guidance the republic was saved from disruption and the country was purified of the blot of slavery but that during the stormiest and most perilous crisis in our history he so conducted the government and so wielded his almost dictatorial power as to leave essentially intact our free institutions in all things that concern the rights and liberties of the citizens he understood well the nature of the problem in his first message to congress he defined it in admirably pointed language must a government be of necessity too strong for the liberties of its own people or too weak to maintain its own existence is there in all republics this inherent weakness this question he answered in the name of the great american republic as no man could have answered it better with a triumphant no  it has been said that abraham lincoln died at the right moment for his fame however that may be he had at the time of his death certainly not exhausted his usefulness to his country he was probably the only man who could have guided the nation through the perplexities of the reconstruction period in such a manner as to prevent in the work of peace the revival of the passions of the war he would indeed not have escaped serious controversy as to details of policy but he could have weathered it far better than any other statesman of his time for his prestige with the active politicians had been immensely strengthened by his triumphant reelection and what is more important he would have been supported by the confidence of the victorious northern people that he would do all to secure the safety of the union and the rights of the emancipated negro and at the same time by the confidence of the defeated southern people that nothing would be done by him from motives of vindictiveness or of unreasoning fanaticism or of a selfish party spirit with malice toward none with charity for all the foremost of the victors would have personified in himself the genius of reconciliation  he might have rendered the country a great service in another direction a few days after the fall of richmond he pointed out to a friend the crowd of officeseekers besieging his door look at that said he now we have conquered the rebellion but here you see something that may become more dangerous to this republic than the rebellion itself it is true lincoln as president did not profess what we now call civil service reform principles he used the patronage of the government in many cases avowedly to reward party work in many others to form combinations and to produce political effects advantageous to the union cause and in still others simply to put the right man into the right place but in his endeavors to strengthen the union cause and in his search for able and useful men for public duties he frequently went beyond the limits of his party and gradually accustomed himself to the thought that while party service had its value considerations of the public interest were as to appointments to office of far greater consequence moreover there had been such a mingling of different political elements in support of the union during the civil war that lincoln standing at the head of that temporarily united motley mass hardly felt himself in the narrow sense of the term a party man and as he became strongly impressed with the dangers brought upon the republic by the use of public offices as party spoils it is by no means improbable that had he survived the allabsorbing crisis and found time to turn to other objects one of the most important reforms of later days would have been pioneered by his powerful authority this was not to be but the measure of his achievements was full enough for immortality  to the younger generation abraham lincoln has already become a halfmythical figure which in the haze of historic distance grows to more and more heroic proportions but also loses in distinctness of outline and feature this is indeed the common lot of popular heroes but the lincoln legend will be more than ordinarily apt to become fanciful as his individuality assembling seemingly incongruous qualities and forces in a character at the same time grand and most lovable was so unique and his career so abounding in startling contrasts as the state of society in which abraham lincoln grew up passes away the world will read with increasing wonder of the man who not only of the humblest origin but remaining the simplest and most unpretending of citizens was raised to a position of power unprecedented in our history who was the gentlest and most peaceloving of mortals unable to see any creature suffer without a pang in his own breast and suddenly found himself called to conduct the greatest and bloodiest of our wars who wielded the power of government when stern resolution and relentless force were the order of the day and then won and ruled the popular mind and heart by the tender sympathies of his nature who was a cautious conservative by temperament and mental habit and led the most sudden and sweeping social revolution of our time who preserving his homely speech and rustic manner even in the most conspicuous position of that period drew upon himself the scoffs of polite society and then thrilled the soul of mankind with utterances of wonderful beauty and grandeur who in his heart the best friend of the defeated south was murdered because a crazy fanatic took him for its most cruel enemy who while in power was beyond measure lampooned and maligned by sectional passion and an excited party spirit and around whose bier friend and foe gathered to praise him which they have since never ceased to doas one of the greatest of americans and the best of men     abraham lincoln by joseph h choate  this address was delivered before the edinburgh philosophical institution november 13 1900 it is included in this set with the courteous permission of the author and of messrs thomas y crowell  company   abraham lincoln  when you asked me to deliver the inaugural address on this occasion i recognized that i owed this compliment to the fact that i was the official representative of america and in selecting a subject i ventured to think that i might interest you for an hour in a brief study in popular government as illustrated by the life of the most american of all americans i therefore offer no apology for asking your attention to abraham lincolnto his unique character and the part he bore in two important achievements of modern history the preservation of the integrity of the american union and the emancipation of the colored race  during his brief term of power he was probably the object of more abuse vilification and ridicule than any other man in the world but when he fell by the hand of an assassin at the very moment of his stupendous victory all the nations of the earth vied with one another in paying homage to his character and the thirtyfive years that have since elapsed have established his place in history as one of the great benefactors not of his own country alone but of the human race  one of many noble utterances upon the occasion of his death was that in which punch made its magnanimous recantation of the spirit with which it had pursued him    beside this corpse that bears for winding sheet    the stars and stripes he lived to rear anew    between the mourners at his head and feet    say scurrile jester is there room for you                yes he had lived to shame me from my sneer    to lame my pencil and confute my pen    to make me own this hindof princes peer    this railsplittera true born king of men  fiction can furnish no match for the romance of his life and biography will be searched in vain for such startling vicissitudes of fortune so great power and glory won out of such humble beginnings and adverse circumstances  doubtless you are all familiar with the salient points of his extraordinary career in the zenith of his fame he was the wise patient courageous successful ruler of men exercising more power than any monarch of his time not for himself but for the good of the people who had placed it in his hands commanderinchief of a vast military power which waged with ultimate success the greatest war of the century the triumphant champion of popular government the deliverer of four millions of his fellowmen from bondage honored by mankind as statesman president and liberator  let us glance now at the first half of the brief life of which this was the glorious and happy consummation nothing could be more squalid and miserable than the home in which abraham lincoln was borna oneroomed cabin without floor or window in what was then the wilderness of kentucky in the heart of that frontier life which swiftly moved westward from the alleghanies to the mississippi always in advance of schools and churches of books and money of railroads and newspapers of all things which are generally regarded as the comforts and even necessaries of life his father ignorant needy and thriftless content if he could keep soul and body together for himself and his family was ever seeking without success to better his unhappy condition by moving on from one such scene of dreary desolation to another the rude society which surrounded them was not much better the struggle for existence was hard and absorbed all their energies they were fighting the forest the wild beast and the retreating savage from the time when he could barely handle tools until he attained his majority lincolns life was that of a simple farm laborer poorly clad housed and fed at work either on his fathers wretched farm or hired out to neighboring farmers but in spite or perhaps by means of this rude environment he grew to be a stalwart giant reaching six feet four at nineteen and fabulous stories are told of his feats of strength with the growth of this mighty frame began that strange education which in his ripening years was to qualify him for the great destiny that awaited him and the development of those mental faculties and moral endowments which by the time he reached middle life were to make him the sagacious patient and triumphant leader of a great nation in the crisis of its fate his whole schooling obtained during such odd times as could be spared from grinding labor did not amount in all to as much as one year and the quality of the teaching was of the lowest possible grade including only the elements of reading writing and ciphering but out of these simple elements when rightly used by the right man education is achieved and lincoln knew how to use them as so often happens he seemed to take warning from his fathers unfortunate example untiring industry an insatiable thirst for knowledge and an evergrowing desire to rise above his surroundings were early manifestations of his character  books were almost unknown in that community but the bible was in every house and somehow or other pilgrims progress aesops fables a history of the united states and a life of washington fell into his hands he trudged on foot many miles through the wilderness to borrow an english grammar and is said to have devoured greedily the contents of the statutes of indiana that fell in his way these few volumes he read and rereadand his power of assimilation was great to be shut in with a few books and to master them thoroughly sometimes does more for the development of character than freedom to range at large in a cursory and indiscriminate way through wide domains of literature this youths mind at any rate was thoroughly saturated with biblical knowledge and biblical language which in after life he used with great readiness and effect but it was the constant use of the little knowledge which he had that developed and exercised his mental powers after the hard days work was done while others slept he toiled on always reading or writing from an early age he did his own thinking and made up his own mindinvaluable traits in the future president paper was such a scarce commodity that by the evening firelight he would write and cipher on the back of a wooden shovel and then shave it off to make room for more by and by as he approached manhood he began speaking in the rude gatherings of the neighborhood and so laid the foundation of that art of persuading his fellowmen which was one rich result of his education and one great secret of his subsequent success  accustomed as we are in these days of steam and telegraphs to have every intelligent boy survey the whole world each morning before breakfast and inform himself as to what is going on in every nation it is hardly possible to conceive how benighted and isolated was the condition of the community at pigeon creek in indiana of which the family of lincolns father formed a part or how eagerly an ambitious and highspirited boy such as he must have yearned to escape the first glimpse that he ever got of any world beyond the narrow confines of his home was in 1828 at the age of nineteen when a neighbor employed him to accompany his son down the river to new orleans to dispose of a flatboat of producea commission which he discharged with great success  shortly after his return from this his first excursion into the outer world his father tired of failure in indiana packed his family and all his worldly goods into a single wagon drawn by two yoke of oxen and after a fourteen days tramp through the wilderness pitched his camp once more in illinois here abraham having come of age and being now his own master rendered the last service of his minority by ploughing the fifteenacre lot and splitting from the tall walnut trees of the primeval forest enough rails to surround the little clearing with a fence such was the meagre outfit of this coming leader of men at the age when the future british prime minister or statesman emerges from the university as a double first or senior wrangler with every advantage that high training and broad culture and association with the wisest and the best of men and women can give and enters upon some form of public service on the road to usefulness and honor the university course being only the first stage of the public training so lincoln at twentyone had just begun his preparation for the public life to which he soon began to aspire for some years yet he must continue to earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow having absolutely no means no home no friend to consult more farm work as a hired hand a clerkship in a village store the running of a mill another trip to new orleans on a flatboat of his own contriving a pilots berth on the riverthese were the means by which he subsisted until in the summer of 1832 when he was twentythree years of age an event occurred which gave him public recognition  the black hawk war broke out and the governor of illinois calling for volunteers to repel the band of savages whose leader bore that name lincoln enlisted and was elected captain by his comrades among whom he had already established his supremacy by signal feats of strength and more than one successful single combat during the brief hostilities he was engaged in no battle and won no military glory but his local leadership was established the same year he offered himself as a candidate for the legislature of illinois but failed at the polls yet his vast popularity with those who knew him was manifest the district consisted of several counties but the unanimous vote of the people of his own county was for lincoln another unsuccessful attempt at storekeeping was followed by better luck at surveying until his horse and instruments were levied upon under execution for the debts of his business adventure  i have been thus detailed in sketching his early years because upon these strange foundations the structure of his great fame and service was built in the place of a school and university training fortune substituted these trials hardships and struggles as a preparation for the great work which he had to do it turned out to be exactly what the emergency required ten years instead at the public school and the university certainly never could have fitted this man for the unique work which was to be thrown upon him some other moses would have had to lead us to our jordan to the sight of our promised land of liberty  at the age of twentyfive he became a member of the legislature of illinois and so continued for eight years and in the meantime qualified himself by reading such law books as he could borrow at randomfor he was too poor to buy any to be called to the bar for his second quarter of a centuryduring which a single term in congress introduced him into the arena of national questionshe gave himself up to law and politics in spite of his soaring ambition his two years in congress gave him no premonition of the great destiny that awaited himand at its close in 1849 we find him an unsuccessful applicant to the president for appointment as commissioner of the general land officea purely administrative bureau a fortunate escape for himself and for his country year by year his knowledge and power his experience and reputation extended and his mental faculties seemed to grow by what they fed on his power of persuasion which had always been marked was developed to an extraordinary degree now that he became engaged in congenial questions and subjects little by little he rose to prominence at the bar and became the most effective public speaker in the west not that he possessed any of the graces of the orator but his logic was invincible and his clearness and force of statement impressed upon his hearers the convictions of his honest mind while his broad sympathies and sparkling and genial humor made him a universal favorite as far and as fast as his acquaintance extended  these twenty years that elapsed from the time of his establishment as a lawyer and legislator in springfield the new capital of illinois furnished a fitting theatre for the development and display of his great faculties and with his new and enlarged opportunities he obviously grew in mental stature in this second period of his career as if to compensate for the absolute lack of advantages under which he had suffered in youth as his powers enlarged his reputation extended for he was always before the people felt a warm sympathy with all that concerned them took a zealous part in the discussion of every public question and made his personal influence ever more widely and deeply felt  my brethren of the legal profession will naturally ask me how could this rough backwoodsman whose youth had been spent in the forest or on the farm and the flatboat without culture or training education or study by the random reading on the wing of a few miscellaneous law books become a learned and accomplished lawyer well he never did he never would have earned his salt as a writer for the signet nor have won a place as advocate in the court of session where the technique of the profession has reached its highest perfection and centuries of learning and precedent are involved in the equipment of a lawyer dr holmes when asked by an anxious young mother when should the education of a child begin replied madam at least two centuries before it is born and so i am sure it is with the scots lawyer  but not so in illinois in 1840 between 1830 and 1880 its population increased twentyfold and when lincoln began practising law in springfield in 1837 life in illinois was very crude and simple and so were the courts and the administration of justice books and libraries were scarce but the people loved justice upheld the law and followed the courts and soon found their favorites among the advocates the fundamental principles of the common law as set forth by blackstone and chitty were not so difficult to acquire and brains common sense force of character tenacity of purpose ready wit and power of speech did the rest and supplied all the deficiencies of learning  the lawsuits of those days were extremely simple and the principles of natural justice were mainly relied on to dispose of them at the bar and on the bench without resort to technical learning railroads corporations absorbing the chief business of the community combined and inherited wealth with all the subtle and intricate questions they breed had not yet come inand so the professional agents and the equipment which they require were not needed but there were many highly educated and powerful men at the bar of illinois even in those early days whom the spirit of enterprise had carried there in search of fame and fortune it was by constant contact and conflict with these that lincoln acquired professional strength and skill every community and every age creates its own bar entirely adequate for its present uses and necessities so in illinois as the population and wealth of the state kept on doubling and quadrupling its bar presented a growing abundance of learning and science and technical skill the early practitioners grew with its growth and mastered the requisite knowledge chicago soon grew to be one of the largest and richest and certainly the most intensely active city on the continent and if any of my professional friends here had gone there in lincolns later years to try or argue a cause or transact other business with any idea that edinburgh or london had a monopoly of legal learning science or subtlety they would certainly have found their mistake  in those early days in the west every lawyer especially every court lawyer was necessarily a politician constantly engaged in the public discussion of the many questions evolved from the rapid development of town county state and federal affairs then and there in this regard public discussion supplied the place which the universal activity of the press has since monopolized and the public speaker who by clearness force earnestness and wit could make himself felt on the questions of the day would rapidly come to the front in the absence of that immense variety of popular entertainments which now feed the public taste and appetite the people found their chief amusement in frequenting the courts and public and political assemblies in either place he who impressed entertained and amused them most was the hero of the hour they did not discriminate very carefully between the eloquence of the forum and the eloquence of the hustings human nature ruled in both alike and he who was the most effective speaker in a political harangue was often retained as most likely to win in a cause to be tried or argued and i have no doubt in this way many retainers came to lincoln fees money in any form had no charms for himin his eager pursuit of fame he could not afford to make money he was ambitious to distinguish himself by some great service to mankind and this ambition for fame and real public service left no room for avarice in his composition however much he earned he seems to have ended every year hardly richer than he began it and yet as the years passed fees came to him freely one of l 1000 is recordeda very large professional fee at that time even in any part of america the paradise of lawyers i lay great stress on lincolns career as a lawyermuch more than his biographers do because in america a state of things exists wholly different from that which prevails in great britain the profession of the law always has been and is to this day the principal avenue to public life and i am sure that his training and experience in the courts had much to do with the development of those forces of intellect and character which he soon displayed on a broader arena  it was in political controversy of course that he acquired his wide reputation and made his deep and lasting impression upon the people of what had now become the powerful state of illinois and upon the people of the great west to whom the political power and control of the united states were already surely and swiftly passing from the older eastern states it was this reputation and this impression and the familiar knowledge of his character which had come to them from his local leadership that happily inspired the people of the west to present him as their candidate and to press him upon the republican convention of 1860 as the fit and necessary leader in the struggle for life which was before the nation  that struggle as you all know arose out of the terrible question of slaveryand i must trust to your general knowledge of the history of that question to make intelligible the attitude and leadership of lincoln as the champion of the hosts of freedom in the final contest negro slavery had been firmly established in the southern states from an early period of their history in 1619 the year before the mayflower landed our pilgrim fathers upon plymouth rock a dutch ship had discharged a cargo of african slaves at jamestown in virginia all through the colonial period their importation had continued a few had found their way into the northern states but none of them in sufficient numbers to constitute danger or to afford a basis for political power at the time of the adoption of the federal constitution there is no doubt that the principal members of the convention not only condemned slavery as a moral social and political evil but believed that by the suppression of the slave trade it was in the course of gradual extinction in the south as it certainly was in the north washington in his will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves and said to jefferson that it was among his first wishes to see some plan adopted by which slavery in his country might be abolished jefferson said referring to the institution i tremble for my country when i think that god is just that his justice cannot sleep foreverand franklin adams hamilton and patrick henry were all utterly opposed to it but it was made the subject of a fatal compromise in the federal constitution whereby its existence was recognized in the states as a basis of representation the prohibition of the importation of slaves was postponed for twenty years and the return of fugitive slaves provided for but no imminent danger was apprehended from it till by the invention of the cotton gin in 1792 cotton culture by negro labor became at once and forever the leading industry of the south and gave a new impetus to the importation of slaves so that in 1808 when the constitutional prohibition took effect their numbers had vastly increased from that time forward slavery became the basis of a great political power and the southern states under all circumstances and at every opportunity carried on a brave and unrelenting struggle for its maintenance and extension  the conscience of the north was slow to rise against it though bitter controversies from time to time took place the southern leaders threatened disunion if their demands were not complied with to save the union compromise after compromise was made but each one in the end was broken the missouri compromise made in 1820 upon the occasion of the admission of missouri into the union as a slave state whereby in consideration of such admission slavery was forever excluded from the northwest territory was ruthlessly repealed in 1854 by a congress elected in the interests of the slave power the intent being to force slavery into that vast territory which had so long been dedicated to freedom this challenge at last aroused the slumbering conscience and passion of the north and led to the formation of the republican party for the avowed purpose of preventing by constitutional methods the further extension of slavery  in its first campaign in 1856 though it failed to elect its candidates it received a surprising vote and carried many of the states no one could any longer doubt that the north had made up its mind that no threats of disunion should deter it from pressing its cherished purpose and performing its long neglected duty from the outset lincoln was one of the most active and effective leaders and speakers of the new party and the great debates between lincoln and douglas in 1858 as the respective champions of the restriction and extension of slavery attracted the attention of the whole country lincolns powerful arguments carried conviction everywhere his moral nature was thoroughly aroused his conscience was stirred to the quick unless slavery was wrong nothing was wrong was each man of whatever color entitled to the fruits of his own labor or could one man live in idle luxury by the sweat of anothers brow whose skin was darker he was an implicit believer in that principle of the declaration of independence that all men are vested with certain inalienable rights the equal rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness on this doctrine he staked his case and carried it we have time only for one or two sentences in which he struck the keynote of the contest  the real issue in this country is the eternal struggle between these two principlesright and wrongthroughout the world they are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time and will ever continue to struggle the one is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings it is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself it is the same spirit that says you work and toil and earn bread and ill eat it  he foresaw with unerring vision that the conflict was inevitable and irrepressiblethat one or the other the right or the wrong freedom or slavery must ultimately prevail and wholly prevail throughout the country and this was the principle that carried the war once begun to a finish  one sentence of his is immortal  under the operation of the policy of compromise the slavery agitation has not only not ceased but has constantly augmented in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south  during the entire decade from 1850 to 1860 the agitation of the slavery question was at the boiling point and events which have become historical continually indicated the near approach of the overwhelming storm no sooner had the compromise acts of 1850 resulted in a temporary peace which everybody said must be final and perpetual than new outbreaks came the forcible carrying away of fugitive slaves by federal troops from boston agitated that ancient stronghold of freedom to its foundations the publication of uncle toms cabin which truly exposed the frightful possibilities of the slave system the reckless attempts by force and fraud to establish it in kansas against the will of the vast majority of the settlers the beating of summer in the senate chamber for words spoken in debate the dred scott decision in the supreme court which made the nation realize that the slave power had at last reached the fountain of federal justice and finally the execution of john brown for his wild raid into virginia to invite the slaves to rally to the standard of freedom which he unfurledall these events tend to illustrate and confirm lincolns contention that the nation could not permanently continue half slave and half free but must become all one thing or all the other when john brown lay under sentence of death he declared that now he was sure that slavery must be wiped out in blood but neither he nor his executioners dreamt that within four years a million soldiers would be marching across the country for its final extirpation to the music of the warsong of the great conflict     john browns body lies amouldering in the grave    but his soul is marching on  and now at the age of fiftyone this child of the wilderness this farm laborer railsputter flatboatman this surveyor lawyer orator statesman and patriot found himself elected by the great party which was pledged to prevent at all hazards the further extension of slavery as the chief magistrate of the republic bound to carry out that purpose to be the leader and ruler of the nation in its most trying hour  those who believe that there is a living providence that overrules and conducts the affairs of nations find in the elevation of this plain man to this extraordinary fortune and to this great duty which he so fitly discharged a signal vindication of their faith perhaps to this philosophical institution the judgment of our philosopher emerson will commend itself as a just estimate of lincolns historical place  his occupying the chair of state was a triumph of the good sense of mankind and of the public conscience he grew according to the need his mind mastered the problem of the day and as the problem grew so did his comprehension of it in the war there was no place for holiday magistrate nor fairweather sailor the new pilot was hurried to the helm in a tornado in four yearsfour years of battle dayshis endurance his fertility of resource his magnanimity were sorely tried and never found wanting there by his courage his justice his even temper his fertile counsel his humanity he stood a heroic figure in the centre of a heroic epoch he is the true history of the american people in his time the true representative of this continentfather of his country the pulse of twenty millions throbbing in his heart the thought of their mindarticulated in his tongue  he was born great as distinguished from those who achieve greatness or have it thrust upon them and his inherent capacity mental moral and physical having been recognized by the educated intelligence of a free people they happily chose him for their ruler in a day of deadly peril  it is now forty years since i first saw and heard abraham lincoln but the impression which he left on my mind is ineffaceable after his great successes in the west he came to new york to make a political address he appeared in every sense of the word like one of the plain people among whom he loved to be counted at first sight there was nothing impressive or imposing about himexcept that his great stature singled him out from the crowd his clothes hung awkwardly on his giant frame his face was of a dark pallor without the slightest tinge of color his seamed and rugged features bore the furrows of hardship and struggle his deepset eyes looked sad and anxious his countenance in repose gave little evidence of that brain power which had raised him from the lowest to the highest station among his countrymen as he talked to me before the meeting he seemed ill at ease with that sort of apprehension which a young man might feel before presenting himself to a new and strange audience whose critical disposition he dreaded it was a great audience including all the noted menall the learned and cultured of his party in new york editors clergymen statesmen lawyers merchants critics they were all very curious to hear him his fame as a powerful speaker had preceded him and exaggerated rumor of his witthe worst forerunner of an oratorhad reached the east when mr bryant presented him on the high platform of the cooper institute a vast sea of eager upturned faces greeted him full of intense curiosity to see what this rude child of the people was like he was equal to the occasion when he spoke he was transformed his eye kindled his voice rang his face shone and seemed to light up the whole assembly for an hour and a half he held his audience in the hollow of his hand his style of speech and manner of delivery were severely simple what lowell called the grand simplicities of the bible with which he was so familiar were reflected in his discourse with no attempt at ornament or rhetoric without parade or pretence he spoke straight to the point if any came expecting the turgid eloquence or the ribaldry of the frontier they must have been startled at the earnest and sincere purity of his utterances it was marvellous to see how this untutored man by mere selfdiscipline and the chastening of his own spirit had outgrown all meretricious arts and found his own way to the grandeur and strength of absolute simplicity  he spoke upon the theme which he had mastered so thoroughly he demonstrated by copious historical proofs and masterly logic that the fathers who created the constitution in order to form a more perfect union to establish justice and to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity intended to empower the federal government to exclude slavery from the territories in the kindliest spirit he protested against the avowed threat of the southern states to destroy the union if in order to secure freedom in those vast regions out of which future states were to be carved a republican president were elected he closed with an appeal to his audience spoken with all the fire of his aroused and kindling conscience with a full outpouring of his love of justice and liberty to maintain their political purpose on that lofty and unassailable issue of right and wrong which alone could justify it and not to be intimidated from their high resolve and sacred duty by any threats of destruction to the government or of ruin to themselves he concluded with this telling sentence which drove the whole argument home to all our hearts let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it that night the great hall and the next day the whole city rang with delighted applause and congratulations and he who had come as a stranger departed with the laurels of great triumph  alas in five years from that exulting night i saw him again for the last time in the same city borne in his coffin through its draped streets with tears and lamentations a heartbroken people accompanied him from washington the scene of his martyrdom to his last restingplace in the young city of the west where he had worked his way to fame  never was a new ruler in a more desperate plight than lincoln when he entered office on the fourth of march 1861 four months after his election and took his oath to support the constitution and the union the intervening time had been busily employed by the southern states in carrying out their threat of disunion in the event of his election as soon as the fact was ascertained seven of them had seceded and had seized upon the forts arsenals navy yards and other public property of the united states within their boundaries and were making every preparation for war in the meantime the retiring president who had been elected by the slave power and who thought the seceding states could not lawfully be coerced had done absolutely nothing lincoln found himself by the constitution commanderinchief of the army and navy of the united states but with only a remnant of either at hand each was to be created on a great scale out of the unknown resources of a nation untried in war  in his mild and conciliatory inaugural address while appealing to the seceding states to return to their allegiance he avowed his purpose to keep the solemn oath he had taken that day to see that the laws of the union were faithfully executed and to use the troops to recover the forts navy yards and other property belonging to the government it is probable however that neither side actually realized that war was inevitable and that the other was determined to fight until the assault on fort sumter presented the south as the first aggressor and roused the north to use every possible resource to maintain the government and the imperilled union and to vindicate the supremacy of the flag over every inch of the territory of the united states the fact that lincolns first proclamation called for only 75000 troops to serve for three months shows how inadequate was even his idea of what the future had in store but from that moment lincoln and his loyal supporters never faltered in their purpose they knew they could win that it was their duty to win and that for america the whole hope of the future depended upon their winning for now by the acts of the seceding states the issue of the election to secure or prevent the extension of slaverystood transformed into a struggle to preserve or to destroy the union  we cannot follow this contest you know its gigantic proportions that it lasted four years instead of three months that in its progress instead of 75000 men more than 2000000 were enrolled on the side of the government alone that the aggregate cost and loss to the nation approximated to 1000000000 pounds sterling and that not less than 300000 brave and precious lives were sacrificed on each side history has recorded how lincoln bore himself during these four frightful years that he was the real president the responsible and actual head of the government through it all that he listened to all advice heard all parties and then always realizing his responsibility to god and the nation decided every great executive question for himself his absolute honesty had become proverbial long before he was president honest abe lincoln was the name by which he had been known for years his every act attested it  in all the grandeur of the vast power that he wielded he never ceased to be one of the plain people as he always called them never lost or impaired his perfect sympathy with them was always in perfect touch with them and open to their appeals and here lay the very secret of his personality and of his power for the people in turn gave him their absolute confidence his courage his fortitude his patience his hopefulness were sorely tried but never exhausted  he was true as steel to his generals but had frequent occasion to change them as he found them inadequate this serious and painful duty rested wholly upon him and was perhaps his most important function as commanderinchief but when at last he recognized in general grant the master of the situation the man who could and would bring the war to a triumphant end he gave it all over to him and upheld him with all his might amid all the pressure and distress that the burdens of office brought upon him his unfailing sense of humor saved him probably it made it possible for him to live under the burden he had always been the great storyteller of the west and he used and cultivated this faculty to relieve the weight of the load he bore  it enabled him to keep the wonderful record of never having lost his temper no matter what agony he had to bear a whole night might be spent in recounting the stories of his wit humor and harmless sarcasm but i will recall only two of his sayings both about general grant who always found plenty of enemies and critics to urge the president to oust him from his command one i am sure will interest all scotchmen they repeated with malicious intent the gossip that grant drank what does he drink asked lincoln whiskey was of course the answer doubtless you can guess the brand well said the president just find out what particular kind he uses and ill send a barrel to each of my other generals the other must be as pleasing to the british as to the american ear when pressed again on other grounds to get rid of grant he declared i cant spare that man he fights  he was tenderhearted to a fault and never could resist the appeals of wives and mothers of soldiers who had got into trouble and were under sentence of death for their offences his secretary of war and other officials complained that they never could get deserters shot as surely as the women of the culprits family could get at him he always gave way certainly you will all appreciate his exquisite sympathy with the suffering relatives of those who had fallen in battle his heart bled with theirs never was there a more gentle and tender utterance than his letter to a mother who had given all her sons to her country written at a time when the angel of death had visited almost every household in the land and was already hovering over him  i have been shown he says in the files of the war department a statement that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from your grief for a loss so overwhelming but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation which may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and the lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom  hardly could your illustrious sovereign from the depths of her queenly and womanly heart have spoken words more touching and tender to soothe the stricken mothers of her own soldiers  the emancipation proclamation with which mr lincoln delighted the country and the world on the first of january 1863 will doubtless secure for him a foremost place in history among the philanthropists and benefactors of the race as it rescued from hopeless and degrading slavery so many millions of his fellowbeings described in the law and existing in fact as chattelspersonal in the hands of their owners and possessors to all intents constructions and purposes whatsoever rarely does the happy fortune come to one man to render such a service to his kindto proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof  ideas rule the world and never was there a more signal instance of this triumph of an idea than here william lloyd garrison who thirty years before had begun his crusade for the abolition of slavery and had lived to see this glorious and unexpected consummation of the hopeless cause to which he had devoted his life well described the proclamation as a great historic event sublime in its magnitude momentous and beneficent in its farreaching consequences and eminently just and right alike to the oppressor and the oppressed  lincoln had always been heart and soul opposed to slavery tradition says that on the trip on the flatboat to new orleans he formed his first and last opinion of slavery at the sight of negroes chained and scourged and that then and there the iron entered into his soul no boy could grow to manhood in those days as a poor white in kentucky and indiana in close contact with slavery or in its neighborhood without a growing consciousness of its blighting effects on free labor as well as of its frightful injustice and cruelty in the legislature of illinois where the public sentiment was all for upholding the institution and violently against every movement for its abolition or restriction upon the passage of resolutions to that effect he had the courage with one companion to put on record his protest believing that the institution of slavery is founded both in injustice and bad policy no great demonstration of courage you will say but that was at a time when garrison for his abolition utterances had been dragged by an angry mob through the streets of boston with a rope around his body and in the very year that lovejoy in the same state of illinois was slain by rioters while defending his press from which he had printed antislavery appeals  in congress he brought in a bill for gradual abolition in the district of columbia with compensation to the owners for until they raised treasonable hands against the life of the nation he always maintained that the property of the slaveholders into which they had come by two centuries of descent without fault on their part ought not to be taken away from them without just compensation he used to say that one way or another he had voted fortytwo times for the wilmot proviso which mr wilmot of pennsylvania moved as an addition to every bill which affected united states territory that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of the said territory and it is evident that his condemnation of the system on moral grounds as a crime against the human race and on political grounds as a cancer that was sapping the vitals of the nation and must master its whole being or be itself extirpated grew steadily upon him until it culminated in his great speeches in the illinois debate  by the mere election of lincoln to the presidency the further extension of slavery into the territories was rendered forever impossiblevox populi vox dei revolutions never go backward and when founded on a great moral sentiment stirring the heart of an indignant people their edicts are irresistible and final had the slave power acquiesced in that election had the southern states remained under the constitution and within the union and relied upon their constitutional and legal rights their favorite institution immoral as it was blighting and fatal as it was might have endured for another century the great party that had elected him unalterably determined against its extension was nevertheless pledged not to interfere with its continuance in the states where it already existed of course when new regions were forever closed against it from its very nature it must have begun to shrink and to dwindle and probably gradual and compensated emancipation which appealed very strongly to the new presidents sense of justice and expediency would in the progress of time by a reversion to the ideas of the founders of the republic have found a safe outlet for both masters and slaves but whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad and when seven states afterwards increased to eleven openly seceded from the union when they declared and began the war upon the nation and challenged its mighty power to the desperate and protracted struggle for its life and for the maintenance of its authority as a nation over its territory they gave to lincoln and to freedom the sublime opportunity of history  in his first inaugural address when as yet not a drop of precious blood had been shed while he held out to them the olive branch in one hand in the other he presented the guarantees of the constitution and after reciting the emphatic resolution of the convention that nominated him that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend he reiterated this sentiment and declared with no mental reservation that all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the laws can be given will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another  when however these magnanimous overtures for peace and reunion were rejected when the seceding states defied the constitution and every clause and principle of it when they persisted in staying out of the union from which they had seceded and proceeded to carve out of its territory a new and hostile empire based on slavery when they flew at the throat of the nation and plunged it into the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century the tables were turned and the belief gradually came to the mind of the president that if the rebellion was not soon subdued by force of arms if the war must be fought out to the bitter end then to reach that end the salvation of the nation itself might require the destruction of slavery wherever it existed that if the war was to continue on one side for disunion for no other purpose than to preserve slavery it must continue on the other side for the union to destroy slavery  as he said events control me i cannot control events and as the dreadful war progressed and became more deadly and dangerous the unalterable conviction was forced upon him that in order that the frightful sacrifice of life and treasure on both sides might not be all in vain it had become his duty as commanderinchief of the army as a necessary war measure to strike a blow at the rebellion which all others failing would inevitably lead to its annihilation by annihilating the very thing for which it was contending his own words are the best  i understood that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every indispensable means that governmentthat nationof which that constitution was the organic law was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life but a life is never wisely given to save a limb i felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation right or wrong i assumed this ground and now avow it i could not feel that to the best of my ability i had ever tried to preserve the constitution if to save slavery or any minor matter i should permit the wreck of government country and constitution all together  and so at last when in his judgment the indispensable necessity had come he struck the fatal blow and signed the proclamation which has made his name immortal by it the president as commanderinchief in time of actual armed rebellion and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing the rebellion proclaimed all persons held as slaves in the states and parts of states then in rebellion to be thenceforward free and declared that the executive with the army and navy would recognize and maintain their freedom  in the other great steps of the government which led to the triumphant prosecution of the war he necessarily shared the responsibility and the credit with the great statesmen who stayed up his hands in his cabinet with seward chase and stanton and the restand with his generals and admirals his soldiers and sailors but this great act was absolutely his own the conception and execution were exclusively his he laid it before his cabinet as a measure on which his mind was made up and could not be changed asking them only for suggestions as to details he chose the time and the circumstances under which the emancipation should be proclaimed and when it should take effect  it came not an hour too soon but public opinion in the north would not have sustained it earlier in the first eighteen months of the war its ravages had extended from the atlantic to beyond the mississippi many victories in the west had been balanced and paralyzed by inaction and disasters in virginia only partially redeemed by the bloody and indecisive battle of antietam a reaction had set in from the general enthusiasm which had swept the northern states after the assault upon sumter it could not truly be said that they had lost heart but faction was raising its head heard through the land like the blast of a bugle the proclamation rallied the patriotism of the country to fresh sacrifices and renewed ardor it was a step that could not be revoked it relieved the conscience of the nation from an incubus that had oppressed it from its birth the united states were rescued from the false predicament in which they had been from the beginning and the great popular heart leaped with new enthusiasm for liberty and union henceforth and forever one and inseparable it brought not only moral but material support to the cause of the government for within two years 120000 colored troops were enlisted in the military service and following the national flag supported by all the loyalty of the north and led by its choicest spirits one mother said when her son was offered the command of the first colored regiment if he accepts it i shall be as proud as if i had heard that he was shot he was shot heading a gallant charge of his regiment the confederates replied to a request of his friends for his body that they had buried him under a layer of his niggers but that mother has lived to enjoy thirtysix years of his glory and boston has erected its noblest monument to his memory  the effect of the proclamation upon the actual progress of the war was not immediate but wherever the federal armies advanced they carried freedom with them and when the summer came round the new spirit and force which had animated the heart of the government and people were manifest in the first week of july the decisive battle of gettysburg turned the tide of war and the fall of vicksburg made the great river free from its source to the gulf  on foreign nations the influence of the proclamation and of these new victories was of great importance in those days when there was no cable it was not easy for foreign observers to appreciate what was really going on they could not see clearly the true state of affairs as in the last year of the nineteenth century we have been able by our new electric vision to watch every event at the antipodes and observe its effect the rebel emissaries sent over to solicit intervention spared no pains to impress upon the minds of public and private men and upon the press their own views of the character of the contest the prospects of the confederacy were always better abroad than at home the stock markets of the world gambled upon its chances and its bonds at one time were high in favor  such ideas as these were seriously held that the north was fighting for empire and the south for independence that the southern states instead of being the grossest oligarchies essentially despotisms founded on the right of one man to appropriate the fruit of other mens toil and to exclude them from equal rights were real republics feebler to be sure than their northern rivals but representing the same idea of freedom and that the mighty strength of the nation was being put forth to crush them that jefferson davis and the southern leaders had created a nation that the republican experiment had failed and the union had ceased to exist but the crowning argument to foreign minds was that it was an utter impossibility for the government to win in the contest that the success of the southern states so far as separation was concerned was as certain as any event yet future and contingent could be that the subjugation of the south by the north even if it could be accomplished would prove a calamity to the united states and the world and especially calamitous to the negro race and that such a victory would necessarily leave the people of the south for many generations cherishing deadly hostility against the government and the north and plotting always to recover their independence  when lincoln issued his proclamation he knew that all these ideas were founded in error that the national resources were inexhaustible that the government could and would win and that if slavery were once finally disposed of the only cause of difference being out of the way the north and south would come together again and by and by be as good friends as ever in many quarters abroad the proclamation was welcomed with enthusiasm by the friends of america but i think the demonstrations in its favor that brought more gladness to lincolns heart than any other were the meetings held in the manufacturing centres by the very operatives upon whom the war bore the hardest expressing the most enthusiastic sympathy with the proclamation while they bore with heroic fortitude the grievous privations which the war entailed upon them mr lincolns expectation when he announced to the world that all slaves in all states then in rebellion were set free must have been that the avowed position of his government that the continuance of the war now meant the annihilation of slavery would make intervention impossible for any foreign nation whose people were lovers of libertyand so the result proved  the growth and development of lincolns mental power and moral force of his intense and magnetic personality after the vast responsibilities of government were thrown upon him at the age of fiftytwo furnish a rare and striking illustration of the marvellous capacity and adaptability of the human intellectof the sound mind in the sound body he came to the discharge of the great duties of the presidency with absolutely no experience in the administration of government or of the vastly varied and complicated questions of foreign and domestic policy which immediately arose and continued to press upon him during the rest of his life but he mastered each as it came apparently with the facility of a trained and experienced ruler as clarendon said of cromwell his parts seemed to be raised by the demands of great station his life through it all was one of intense labor anxiety and distress without one hour of peaceful repose from first to last but he rose to every occasion he led public opinion but did not march so far in advance of it as to fail of its effective support in every great emergency he knew the heart and thought of the people as no man not in constant and absolute sympathy with them could have known it and so holding their confidence he triumphed through and with them not only was there this steady growth of intellect but the infinite delicacy of his nature and its capacity for refinement developed also as exhibited in the purity and perfection of his language and style of speech the rough backwoodsman who had never seen the inside of a university became in the end by selftraining and the exercise of his own powers of mind heart and soul a master of style and some of his utterances will rank with the best the most perfectly adapted to the occasion which produced them  have you time to listen to his twominutes speech at gettysburg at the dedication of the soldiers cemetery his whole soul was in it  four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final restingplace for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a larger sense we cannot dedicatewe cannot consecratewe cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth  he lived to see his work indorsed by an overwhelming majority of his countrymen in his second inaugural address pronounced just forty days before his death there is a single passage which well displays his indomitable will and at the same time his deep religious feeling his sublime charity to the enemies of his country and his broad and catholic humanity  if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offences which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through the appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offence came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmens two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid with another drawn by the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether  with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations  his prayer was answered the forty days of life that remained to him were crowned with great historic events he lived to see his proclamation of emancipation embodied in an amendment of the constitution adopted by congress and submitted to the states for ratification the mighty scourge of war did speedily pass away for it was given him to witness the surrender of the rebel army and the fall of their capital and the starry flag that he loved waving in triumph over the national soil when he died by the madmans hand in the supreme hour of victory the vanquished lost their best friend and the human race one of its noblest examples and all the friends of freedom and justice in whose cause he lived and died joined hands as mourners at his grave     the writings of abraham lincoln 18321843     1832     address to the people of sangamon county  march 9 1832  fellow citizenshaving become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your representatives in the next general assembly of this state in according with an established custom and the principles of true republicanism it becomes my duty to make known to you the people whom i propose to represent my sentiments with regard to local affairs  time and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility of internal improvements that the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits is what no person will deny yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other without first knowing that we are able to finish themas halffinished work generally proves to be labor lost there cannot justly be any objection to having railroads and canals any more than to other good things provided they cost nothing the only objection is to paying for them and the objection arises from the want of ability to pay  with respect to the county of sangamon some  yet however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our country may be however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of itthere is always a heartappalling shock accompanying the amount of its cost which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations the probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at 290000 the bare statement of which in my opinion is sufficient to justify the belief that the improvement of the sangamon river is an object much better suited to our infant resources  what the cost of this work would be i am unable to say it is probable however that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length finally i believe the improvement of the sangamon river to be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county and if elected any measure in the legislature having this for its object which may appear judicious will meet my approbation and receive my support  it appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest has already been opened as a field for discussion so i suppose i may enter upon it without claiming the honor or risking the danger which may await its first explorer it seems as though we are never to have an end to this baneful and corroding system acting almost as prejudicially to the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each county for the benefit of a few individuals only unless there be a law made fixing the limits of usury a law for this purpose i am of opinion may be made without materially injuring any class of people in cases of extreme necessity there could always be means found to cheat the law while in all other cases it would have its intended effect i would favor the passage of a law on this subject which might not be very easily evaded let it be such that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest necessity  upon the subject of education not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it i can only say that i view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in that every man may receive at least a moderate education and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions appears to be an object of vital importance even on this account alone to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the scriptures and other works both of a religious and moral nature for themselves  for my part i desire to see the time when educationand by its means morality sobriety enterprise and industryshall become much more general than at present and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate that happy period  with regard to existing laws some alterations are thought to be necessary many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws the law respecting the issuing of executions the road law and some others are deficient in their present form and require alterations but considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself i should prefer not meddling with them unless they were first attacked by others in which case i should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand which in my view might tend most to the advancement of justice  but fellowcitizens i shall conclude considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth it is probable i have already been more presuming than becomes me however upon the subjects of which i have treated i have spoken as i have thought i may be wrong in regard to any or all of them but holding it a sound maxim that it is better only sometimes to be right than at all times to be wrong so soon as i discover my opinions to be erroneous i shall be ready to renounce them  every man is said to have his peculiar ambition whether it be true or not i can say for one that i have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellowmen by rendering myself worthy of their esteem how far i shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed i am young and unknown to many of you i was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life i have no wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend me my case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the county and if elected they will have conferred a favor upon me for which i shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate but if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background i have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined  your friend and fellowcitizen a lincoln  new salem march 9 1832     1833     to e c blankenship  new salem aug 10 1833  e c blankenship  dear sirin regard to the time david rankin served the enclosed discharge shows correctlyas well as i can recollecthaving no writing to refer the transfer of rankin from my company occurred as follows rankin having lost his horse at dixons ferry and having acquaintance in one of the foot companies who were going down the river was desirous to go with them and one galishen being an acquaintance of mine and belonging to the company in which rankin wished to go wished to leave it and join mine this being the case it was agreed that they should exchange places and answer to each others namesas it was expected we all would be discharged in very few days as to a blanketi have no knowledge of rankin ever getting any the above embraces all the facts now in my recollection which are pertinent to the case  i shall take pleasure in giving any further information in my power should you call on me  your friend a lincoln     response to request for postage receipt  to mr spears  mr spears  at your request i send you a receipt for the postage on your paper i am somewhat surprised at your request i will however comply with it the law requires newspaper postage to be paid in advance and now that i have waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by insinuating that unless you get a receipt i will probably make you pay it again  respectfully a lincoln     1836     announcement of political views  new salem june 13 1836  to the editor of the journalin your paper of last saturday i see a communication over the signature of many voters in which the candidates who are announced in the journal are called upon to show their hands agreed heres mine  i go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in bearing its burdens consequently i go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms by no means excluding females  if elected i shall consider the whole people of sangamon my constituents as well those that oppose as those that support me  while acting as their representative i shall be governed by their will on all subjects upon which i have the means of knowing what their will is and upon all others i shall do what my own judgment teaches me will best advance their interests whether elected or not i go for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several states to enable our state in common with others to dig canals and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying the interest on it if alive on the first monday in november i shall vote for hugh l white for president  very respectfully a lincoln     response to political smear  to robert allen  new salem june 21 1836  dear coloneli am told that during my absence last week you passed through this place and stated publicly that you were in possession of a fact or facts which if known to the public would entirely destroy the prospects of n w edwards and myself at the ensuing election but that through favor to us you should forbear to divulge them no one has needed favors more than i and generally few have been less unwilling to accept them but in this case favor to me would be injustice to the public and therefore i must beg your pardon for declining it that i once had the confidence of the people of sangamon is sufficiently evident and if i have since done anything either by design or misadventure which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence he that knows of that thing and conceals it is a traitor to his countrys interest  i find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or facts real or supposed you spoke but my opinion of your veracity will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you said i am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me but i do hope that on more mature reflection you will view the public interest as a paramount consideration and therefore determine to let the worst come i here assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part however low it may sink me shall never break the tie of personal friendship between us i wish an answer to this and you are at liberty to publish both if you choose  very respectfully a lincoln     to miss mary owens  vandalia december 13 1836  maryi have been sick ever since my arrival or i should have written sooner it is but little difference however as i have very little even yet to write and more the longer i can avoid the mortification of looking in the postoffice for your letter and not finding it the better you see i am mad about that old letter yet i dont like very well to risk you again ill try you once more anyhow  the new state house is not yet finished and consequently the legislature is doing little or nothing the governor delivered an inflammatory political message and it is expected there will be some sparring between the parties about it as soon as the two houses get to business taylor delivered up his petition for the new county to one of our members this morning i am told he despairs of its success on account of all the members from morgan county opposing it there are names enough on the petition i think to justify the members from our county in going for it but if the members from morgan oppose it which they say they will the chance will be bad  our chance to take the seat of government to springfield is better than i expected an internalimprovement convention was held there since we met which recommended a loan of several millions of dollars on the faith of the state to construct railroads some of the legislature are for it and some against it which has the majority i cannot tell there is great strife and struggling for the office of the united states senator here at this time it is probable we shall ease their pains in a few days the opposition men have no candidate of their own and consequently they will smile as complacently at the angry snarl of the contending van buren candidates and their respective friends as the christian does at satans rage you recollect that i mentioned at the outset of this letter that i had been unwell that is the fact though i believe i am about well now but that with other things i cannot account for have conspired and have gotten my spirits so low that i feel that i would rather be any place in the world than here i really cannot endure the thought of staying here ten weeks write back as soon as you get this and if possible say something that will please me for really i have not been pleased since i left you this letter is so dry and stupid that i am ashamed to send it but with my present feelings i cannot do any better  give my best respects to mr and mrs able and family  your friend lincoln     1837     speech in illinois legislature  january  1837  mr chairmanlest i should fall into the too common error of being mistaken in regard to which side i design to be upon i shall make it my first care to remove all doubt on that point by declaring that i am opposed to the resolution under consideration in toto before i proceed to the body of the subject i will further remark that it is not without a considerable degree of apprehension that i venture to cross the track of the gentleman from coles mr linder indeed i do not believe i could muster a sufficiency of courage to come in contact with that gentleman were it not for the fact that he some days since most graciously condescended to assure us that he would never be found wasting ammunition on small game on the same fortunate occasion he further gave us to understand that he regarded himself as being decidedly the superior of our common friend from randolph mr shields and feeling as i really do that i to say the most of myself am nothing more than the peer of our friend from randolph i shall regard the gentleman from coles as decidedly my superior also and consequently in the course of what i shall have to say whenever i shall have occasion to allude to that gentleman i shall endeavor to adopt that kind of court language which i understand to be due to decided superiority in one faculty at least there can be no dispute of the gentlemans superiority over me and most other men and that is the faculty of entangling a subject so that neither himself or any other man can find head or tail to it here he has introduced a resolution embracing ninetynine printed lines across common writing paper and yet more than one half of his opening speech has been made upon subjects about which there is not one word said in his resolution  though his resolution embraces nothing in regard to the constitutionality of the bank much of what he has said has been with a view to make the impression that it was unconstitutional in its inception now although i am satisfied that an ample field may be found within the pale of the resolution at least for small game yet as the gentleman has traveled out of it i feel that i may with all due humility venture to follow him the gentleman has discovered that some gentleman at washington city has been upon the very eve of deciding our bank unconstitutional and that he would probably have completed his very authentic decision had not some one of the bank officers placed his hand upon his mouth and begged him to withhold it the fact that the individuals composing our supreme court have in an official capacity decided in favor of the constitutionality of the bank would in my mind seem a sufficient answer to this it is a fact known to all that the members of the supreme court together with the governor form a council of revision and that this council approved this bank charter i ask then if the extrajudicial decision not quite but almost made by the gentleman at washington before whom by the way the question of the constitutionality of our bank never has nor never can comeis to be taken as paramount to a decision officially made by that tribunal by which and which alone the constitutionality of the bank can ever be settled but aside from this view of the subject i would ask if the committee which this resolution proposes to appoint are to examine into the constitutionality of the bank are they to be clothed with power to send for persons and papers for this object and after they have found the bank to be unconstitutional and decided it so how are they to enforce their decision what will their decision amount to they cannot compel the bank to cease operations or to change the course of its operations what good then can their labors result in certainly none  the gentleman asks if we without an examination shall by giving the state deposits to the bank and by taking the stock reserved for the state legalize its former misconduct now i do not pretend to possess sufficient legal knowledge to decide whether a legislative enactment proposing to and accepting from the bank certain terms would have the effect to legalize or wipe out its former errors or not but i can assure the gentleman if such should be the effect he has already got behind the settlement of accounts for it is well known to all that the legislature at its last session passed a supplemental bank charter which the bank has since accepted and which according to his doctrine has legalized all the alleged violations of its original charter in the distribution of its stock  i now proceed to the resolution by examination it will be found that the first thirtythree lines being precisely one third of the whole relate exclusively to the distribution of the stock by the commissioners appointed by the state now sir it is clear that no question can arise on this portion of the resolution except a question between capitalists in regard to the ownership of stock some gentlemen have their stock in their hands while others who have more money than they know what to do with want it and this and this alone is the question to settle which we are called on to squander thousands of the peoples money what interest let me ask have the people in the settlement of this question what difference is it to them whether the stock is owned by judge smith or sam wiggins if any gentleman be entitled to stock in the bank which he is kept out of possession of by others let him assert his right in the supreme court and let him or his antagonist whichever may be found in the wrong pay the costs of suit it is an old maxim and a very sound one that he that dances should always pay the fiddler now sir in the present case if any gentlemen whose money is a burden to them choose to lead off a dance i am decidedly opposed to the peoples money being used to pay the fiddler no one can doubt that the examination proposed by this resolution must cost the state some ten or twelve thousand dollars and all this to settle a question in which the people have no interest and about which they care nothing these capitalists generally act harmoniously and in concert to fleece the people and now that they have got into a quarrel with themselves we are called upon to appropriate the peoples money to settle the quarrel  i leave this part of the resolution and proceed to the remainder it will be found that no charge in the remaining part of the resolution if true amounts to the violation of the bank charter except one which i will notice in due time it might seem quite sufficient to say no more upon any of these charges or insinuations than enough to show they are not violations of the charter yet as they are ingeniously framed and handled with a view to deceive and mislead i will notice in their order all the most prominent of them the first of these is in relation to a connection between our bank and several banking institutions in other states admitting this connection to exist i should like to see the gentleman from coles or any other gentleman undertake to show that there is any harm in it what can there be in such a connection that the people of illinois are willing to pay their money to get a peep into by a reference to the tenth section of the bank charter any gentleman can see that the framers of the act contemplated the holding of stock in the institutions of other corporations why then is it when neither law nor justice forbids it that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth  the next charge in the order of time is that some officer director clerk or servant of the bank has been required to take an oath of secrecy in relation to the affairs of said bank now i do not know whether this be true or falseneither do i believe any honest man cares i know that the seventh section of the charter expressly guarantees to the bank the right of making under certain restrictions such bylaws as it may think fit and i further know that the requiring an oath of secrecy would not transcend those restrictions what then if the bank has chosen to exercise this right whom can it injure does not every merchant have his secret mark and who is ever silly enough to complain of it i presume if the bank does require any such oath of secrecy it is done through a motive of delicacy to those individuals who deal with it why sir not many days since one gentleman upon this floor who by the way i have no doubt is now ready to join this hue and cry against the bank indulged in a philippic against one of the bank officials because as he said he had divulged a secret  immediately following this last charge there are several insinuations in the resolution which are too silly to require any sort of notice were it not for the fact that they conclude by saying to the great injury of the people at large in answer to this i would say that it is strange enough that the people are suffering these great injuries and yet are not sensible of it singular indeed that the people should be writhing under oppression and injury and yet not one among them to be found to raise the voice of complaint if the bank be inflicting injury upon the people why is it that not a single petition is presented to this body on the subject if the bank really be a grievance why is it that no one of the real people is found to ask redress of it the truth is no such oppression exists if it did our people would groan with memorials and petitions and we would not be permitted to rest day or night till we had put it down the people know their rights and they are never slow to assert and maintain them when they are invaded let them call for an investigation and i shall ever stand ready to respond to the call but they have made no such call i make the assertion boldly and without fear of contradiction that no man who does not hold an office or does not aspire to one has ever found any fault of the bank it has doubled the prices of the products of their farms and filled their pockets with a sound circulating medium and they are all well pleased with its operations no sir it is the politician who is the first to sound the alarm which by the way is a false one it is he who by these unholy means is endeavoring to blow up a storm that he may ride upon and direct it is he and he alone that here proposes to spend thousands of the peoples public treasure for no other advantage to them than to make valueless in their pockets the reward of their industry mr chairman this work is exclusively the work of politicians a set of men who have interests aside from the interests of the people and who to say the most of them are taken as a mass at least one long step removed from honest men i say this with the greater freedom because being a politician myself none can regard it as personal  again it is charged or rather insinuated that officers of the bank have loaned money at usurious rates of interest suppose this to be true are we to send a committee of this house to inquire into it suppose the committee should find it true can they redress the injured individuals assuredly not if any individual had been injured in this way is there not an ample remedy to be found in the laws of the land does the gentleman from coles know that there is a statute standing in full force making it highly penal for an individual to loan money at a higher rate of interest than twelve per cent if he does not he is too ignorant to be placed at the head of the committee which his resolution purposes and if he does his neglect to mention it shows him to be too uncandid to merit the respect or confidence of any one  but besides all this if the bank were struck from existence could not the owners of the capital still loan it usuriously as well as now whatever the bank or its officers may have done i know that usurious transactions were much more frequent and enormous before the commencement of its operations than they have ever been since  the next insinuation is that the bank has refused specie payments this if true is a violation of the charter but there is not the least probability of its truth because if such had been the fact the individual to whom payment was refused would have had an interest in making it public by suing for the damages to which the charter entitles him yet no such thing has been done and the strong presumption is that the insinuation is false and groundless  from this to the end of the resolution there is nothing that merits attentioni therefore drop the particular examination of it  by a general view of the resolution it will be seen that a principal object of the committee is to examine into and ferret out a mass of corruption supposed to have been committed by the commissioners who apportioned the stock of the bank i believe it is universally understood and acknowledged that all men will ever act correctly unless they have a motive to do otherwise if this be true we can only suppose that the commissioners acted corruptly by also supposing that they were bribed to do so taking this view of the subject i would ask if the bank is likely to find it more difficult to bribe the committee of seven which we are about to appoint than it may have found it to bribe the commissioners  here mr linder called to order the chair decided that mr lincoln was not out of order mr linder appealed to the house but before the question was put withdrew his appeal saying he preferred to let the gentleman go on he thought he would break his own neck mr lincoln proceeded  another gracious condescension i acknowledge it with gratitude i know i was not out of order and i know every sensible man in the house knows it i was not saying that the gentleman from coles could be bribed nor on the other hand will i say he could not in that particular i leave him where i found him i was only endeavoring to show that there was at least as great a probability of any seven members that could be selected from this house being bribed to act corruptly as there was that the twentyfour commissioners had been so bribed by a reference to the ninth section of the bank charter it will be seen that those commissioners were john tilson robert k mclaughlin daniel warm ag s wight john c riley w h davidson edward m wilson edward l pierson robert r green ezra baker aquilla wren john taylor samuel c christy edmund roberts benjamin godfrey thomas mather a m jenkins w linn w s gilman charles prentice richard i hamilton ah buckner w f thornton and edmund d taylor  these are twentyfour of the most respectable men in the state probably no twentyfour men could be selected in the state with whom the people are better acquainted or in whose honor and integrity they would more readily place confidence and i now repeat that there is less probability that those men have been bribed and corrupted than that any seven men or rather any six men that could be selected from the members of this house might be so bribed and corrupted even though they were headed and led on by decided superiority himself  in all seriousness i ask every reasonable man if an issue be joined by these twentyfour commissioners on the one part and any other seven men on the other part and the whole depend upon the honor and integrity of the contending parties to which party would the greatest degree of credit be due again another consideration is that we have no right to make the examination what i shall say upon this head i design exclusively for the lawloving and lawabiding part of the house to those who claim omnipotence for the legislature and who in the plenitude of their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the constitution law good faith moral right and everything else i have not a word to say but to the lawabiding part i say examine the bank charter go examine the constitution go examine the acts that the general assembly of this state has passed and you will find just as much authority given in each and every of them to compel the bank to bring its coffers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this floor as to compel it to submit to this examination which this resolution proposes why sir the gentleman from coles the mover of this resolution very lately denied on this floor that the legislature had any right to repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts when those acts were made in the nature of contracts and had been accepted and acted on by other parties now i ask if this resolution does not propose for this house alone to do what he but the other day denied the right of the whole legislature to do he must either abandon the position he then took or he must now vote against his own resolution it is no difference to me and i presume but little to any one else which he does  i am by no means the special advocate of the bank i have long thought that it would be well for it to report its condition to the general assembly and that cases might occur when it might be proper to make an examination of its affairs by a committee accordingly during the last session while a bill supplemental to the bank charter was pending before the house i offered an amendment to the same in these words the said corporation shall at the next session of the general assembly and at each subsequent general session during the existence of its charter report to the same the amount of debts due from said corporation the amount of debts due to the same the amount of specie in its vaults and an account of all lands then owned by the same and the amount for which such lands have been taken and moreover if said corporation shall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books papers and all and everything necessary for a full and fair examination of its affairs to any person or persons appointed by the general assembly for the purpose of making such examination the said corporation shall forfeit its charter  this amendment was negatived by a vote of 34 to 15 eleven of the 34 who voted against it are now members of this house and though it would be out of order to call their names i hope they will all recollect themselves and not vote for this examination to be made without authority inasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it was in their power to do so  i have said that cases might occur when an examination might be proper but i do not believe any such case has now occurred and if it has i should still be opposed to making an examination without legal authority i am opposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic spirit whether in relation to the bank or anything else which is already abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and fearful impetuosity to the ultimate overthrow of every institution of every moral principle in which persons and property have hitherto found security  but supposing we had the authority i would ask what good can result from the examination can we declare the bank unconstitutional and compel it to desist from the abuses of its power provided we find such abuses to exist can we repair the injuries which it may have done to individuals most certainly we can do none of these things why then shall we spend the public money in such employment oh say the examiners we can injure the credit of the bank if nothing else please tell me gentlemen who will suffer most by that you cannot injure to any extent the stockholders they are men of wealthof large capital and consequently beyond the power of malice but by injuring the credit of the bank you will depreciate the value of its paper in the hands of the honest and unsuspecting farmer and mechanic and that is all you can do but suppose you could effect your whole purpose suppose you could wipe the bank from existence which is the grand ultimatum of the project what would be the consequence why sir we should spend several thousand dollars of the public treasure in the operation annihilate the currency of the state render valueless in the hands of our people that reward of their former labors and finally be once more under the comfortable obligation of paying the wiggins loan principal and interest     opposition to mobrule  address before the young mens lyceum of springfield illinois  january 27 1837  as a subject for the remarks of the evening the perpetuation of our political institutions is selected  in the great journal of things happening under the sun we the american people find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the christian era we find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory fertility of soil and salubrity of climate we find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us we when mounting the stage of existence found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings we toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them they are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy brave and patriotic but now lamented and departed race of ancestors theirs was the task and nobly they performed it to possess themselves and through themselves us of this goodly land and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights it is ours only to transmit thesethe former unprofaned by the foot of an invader the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpationto the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know this task gratitude to our fathers justice to ourselves duty to posterity and love for our species in general all imperatively require us faithfully to perform  how then shall we perform it at what point shall we expect the approach of danger by what means shall we fortify against it shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow never all the armies of europe asia and africa combined with all the treasure of the earth our own excepted in their military chest with a bonaparte for a commander could not by force take a drink from the ohio or make a track on the blue ridge in a trial of a thousand years  at what point then is the approach of danger to be expected i answer if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us it cannot come from abroad if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher as a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide  i hope i am overwary but if i am not there is even now something of ill omen amongst us i mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the countrythe growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice this disposition is awfully fearful in any community and that it now exists in ours though grating to our feelings to admit it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times they have pervaded the country from new england to louisiana they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter they are not the creature of climate neither are they confined to the slave holding or the nonslave holding states alike they spring up among the pleasurehunting masters of southern slaves and the orderloving citizens of the land of steady habits whatever then their cause may be it is common to the whole country  it would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them those happening in the state of mississippi and at st louis are perhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity in the mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblersa set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation but one which so far from being forbidden by the laws was actually licensed by an act of the legislature passed but a single year before next negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the state then white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes and finally strangers from neighboring states going thither on business were in many instances subjected to the same fate thus went on this process of hanging from gamblers to negroes from negroes to white citizens and from these to strangers till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside and in numbers almost sufficient to rival the native spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the forest  turn then to that horrorstriking scene at st louis a single victim only was sacrificed there this story is very short and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life a mulatto man by the name of mcintosh was seized in the street dragged to the suburbs of the city chained to a tree and actually burned to death and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with the world  such are the effects of mob law and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark  but you are perhaps ready to ask what has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions i answer it has much to do with it its direct consequences are comparatively speaking but a small evil and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences abstractly considered the hanging of the gamblers at vicksburg was of but little consequence they constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community and their death if no pernicious example be set by it is never matter of reasonable regret with any one if they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or smallpox honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation similar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at st louis he had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city and had he not died as he did he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterwards as to him alone it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been but the example in either case was fearful when men take it in their heads today to hang gamblers or burn murderers they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is and that acting upon the example they set the mob of tomorrow may and probably will hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake and not only so the innocent those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law and thus it goes on step by step till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded but all this even is not the full extent of the evil by such examples by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment they thus become absolutely unrestrained having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation while on the other hand good men men who love tranquillity who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits who would gladly spill their blood in the defense of their country seeing their property destroyed their families insulted and their lives endangered their persons injured and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose thus then by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land the strongest bulwark of any government and particularly of those constituted like ours may effectually be broken down and destroyedi mean the attachment of the people whenever this effect shall be produced among us whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands and burn churches ravage and rob provisionstores throw printing presses into rivers shoot editors and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity depend on it this government cannot last by such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it and thus it will be left without friends or with too few and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual at such a time and under such circumstances men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity strike the blow and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world  i know the american people are much attached to their government i know they would suffer much for its sake i know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for anotheryet notwithstanding all this if the laws be continually despised and disregarded if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence and to that sooner or later it must come  here then is one point at which danger may be expected  the question recurs how shall we fortify against it the answer is simple let every american every lover of liberty every wellwisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country and never to tolerate their violation by others as the patriots of seventysix did to the support of the declaration of independence so to the support of the constitution and laws let every american pledge his life his property and his sacred honor let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father and to tear the charter of his own and his childrens liberty let reverence for the laws be breathed by every american mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap let it be taught in schools in seminaries and in colleges let it be written in primers spelling books and in almanacs let it be preached from the pulpit proclaimed in legislative halls and enforced in courts of justice and in short let it become the political religion of the nation and let the old and the young the rich and the poor the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars  while ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation vain will be every effort and fruitless every attempt to subvert our national freedom  when i so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made i mean to say no such thing but i do mean to say that although bad laws if they exist should be repealed as soon as possible still while they continue in force for the sake of example they should be religiously observed so also in unprovided cases if such arise let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay but till then let them if not too intolerable be borne with  there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law in any case that may arise as for instance the promulgation of abolitionism one of two positions is necessarily truethat is the thing is right within itself and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens or it is wrong and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary justifiable or excusable  but it may be asked why suppose danger to our political institutions have we not preserved them for more than fifty years and why may we not for fifty times as long  we hope there is no sufficient reason we hope all danger may be overcome but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be extremely dangerous there are now and will hereafter be many causes dangerous in their tendency which have not existed heretofore and which are not too insignificant to merit attention that our government should have been maintained in its original form from its establishment until now is not much to be wondered at it had many props to support it through that period which now are decayed and crumbled away through that period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment now it is understood to be a successful one then all that sought celebrity and fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that experiment their all was staked upon it their destiny was inseparably linked with it their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had hitherto been considered at best no better than problematicalnamely the capability of a people to govern themselves if they succeeded they were to be immortalized their names were to be transferred to counties and cities and rivers and mountains and to be revered and sung toasted through all time if they failed they were to be called knaves and fools and fanatics for a fleeting hour then to sink and be forgotten they succeeded the experiment is successful and thousands have won their deathless names in making it so but the game is caught and i believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of the chase this field of glory is harvested and the crop is already appropriated but new reapers will arise and they too will seek a field it is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us and when they do they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them the question then is can that gratification be found in supporting and in maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others most certainly it cannot many great and good men sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in congress a gubernatorial or a presidential chair but such belong not to the family of the lion or the tribe of the eagle what think you these places would satisfy an alexander a caesar or a napoleon never towering genius disdains a beaten path it seeks regions hitherto unexplored it sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others it denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief it scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor however illustrious it thirsts and burns for distinction and if possible it will have it whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen is it unreasonable then to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch will at some time spring up among us and when such an one does it will require the people to be united with each other attached to the government and laws and generally intelligent to successfully frustrate his designs  distinction will be his paramount object and although he would as willingly perhaps more so acquire it by doing good as harm yet that opportunity being past and nothing left to be done in the way of building up he would set boldly to the task of pulling down  here then is a probable case highly dangerous and such an one as could not have well existed heretofore  another reason which once was but which to the same extent is now no more has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far i mean the powerful influence which the interesting scenes of the revolution had upon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment by this influence the jealousy envy and avarice incident to our nature and so common to a state of peace prosperity and conscious strength were for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive while the deeprooted principles of hate and the powerful motive of revenge instead of being turned against each other were directed exclusively against the british nation and thus from the force of circumstances the basest principles of our nature were either made to lie dormant or to become the active agents in the advancement of the noblest of causesthat of establishing and maintaining civil and religious liberty  but this state of feeling must fade is fading has faded with the circumstances that produced it  i do not mean to say that the scenes of the revolution are now or ever will be entirely forgotten but that like everything else they must fade upon the memory of the world and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time in history we hope they will be read of and recounted so long as the bible shall be read but even granting that they will their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest at the close of that struggle nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes the consequence was that of those scenes in the form of a husband a father a son or a brother a living history was to be found in every familya history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity in the limbs mangled in the scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes relateda history too that could be read and understood alike by all the wise and the ignorant the learned and the unlearned but those histories are gone they can be read no more forever they were a fortress of strength but what invading foeman could never do the silent artillery of time has donethe leveling of its walls they are gone they were a forest of giant oaks but the allrestless hurricane has swept over them and left only here and there a lonely trunk despoiled of its verdure shorn of its foliage unshading and unshaded to murmur in a few more gentle breezes and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms then to sink and be no more  they were pillars of the temple of liberty and now that they have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we their descendants supply their places with other pillars hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason passion has helped us but can do so no more it will in future be our enemy reason cold calculating unimpassioned reasonmust furnish all the materials for our future support and defense let those materials be moulded into general intelligence sound morality and in particular a reverence for the constitution and laws and that we improved to the last that we remained free to the last that we revered his name to the last that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our washington  upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest as the rock of its basis and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution the gates of hell shall not prevail against it     protest in the illinois legislature on the subject of slavery  march 3 1837  the following protest was presented to the house which was read and ordered to be spread in the journals to wit  resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both branches of the general assembly at its present session the undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same  they believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but that the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils  they believe that the congress of the united states has no power under the constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the different states  they believe that the congress of the united states has the power under the constitution to abolish slavery in the district of columbia but that the power ought not to be exercised unless at the request of the people of the district  the difference between these opinions and those contained in the said resolutions is their reason for entering this protest  dan stone  a lincoln  representatives from the county of sangamon     to miss mary owens  springfield may 7 1837  miss mary s owens  friend maryi have commenced two letters to send you before this both of which displeased me before i got half done and so i tore them up the first i thought was not serious enough and the second was on the other extreme i shall send this turn out as it may  this thing of living in springfield is rather a dull business after all at least it is so to me i am quite as lonesome here as i ever was anywhere in my life i have been spoken to by but one woman since i have been here and should not have been by her if she could have avoided it i ve never been to church yet and probably shall not be soon i stay away because i am conscious i should not know how to behave myself  i am often thinking of what we said about your coming to live at springfield i am afraid you would not be satisfied there is a great deal of flourishing about in carriages here which it would be your doom to see without sharing it you would have to be poor without the means of hiding your poverty do you believe you could bear that patiently whatever woman may cast her lot with mine should any ever do so it is my intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented and there is nothing i can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in the effort i know i should be much happier with you than the way i am provided i saw no signs of discontent in you what you have said to me may have been in the way of jest or i may have misunderstood you if so then let it be forgotten if otherwise i much wish you would think seriously before you decide what i have said i will most positively abide by provided you wish it my opinion is that you had better not do it you have not been accustomed to hardship and it may be more severe than you now imagine i know you are capable of thinking correctly on any subject and if you deliberate maturely upon this subject before you decide then i am willing to abide your decision  you must write me a good long letter after you get this you have nothing else to do and though it might not seem interesting to you after you had written it it would be a good deal of company to me in this busy wilderness tell your sister i dont want to hear any more about selling out and moving that gives me the hypo whenever i think of it  yours etc lincoln     to john bennett  springfield ill aug 5 1837 john bennett esq  dear sirmr edwards tells me you wish to know whether the act to which your own incorporation provision was attached passed into a law it did you can organize under the general incorporation law as soon as you choose  i also tacked a provision onto a fellows bill to authorize the relocation of the road from salem down to your town but i am not certain whether or not the bill passed neither do i suppose i can ascertain before the law will be published if it is a law bowling greene bennette abe and yourself are appointed to make the change no news no excitement except a little about the election of monday next  i suppose of course our friend dr heney stands no chance in your diggings  your friend and humble servant a lincoln     to mary owens  springfield aug 16 1837  friend mary you will no doubt think it rather strange that i should write you a letter on the same day on which we parted and i can only account for it by supposing that seeing you lately makes me think of you more than usual while at our late meeting we had but few expressions of thoughts you must know that i cannot see you or think of you with entire indifference and yet it may be that you are mistaken in regard to what my real feelings toward you are  if i knew you were not i should not have troubled you with this letter perhaps any other man would know enough without information but i consider it my peculiar right to plead ignorance and your bounden duty to allow the plea  i want in all cases to do right and most particularly so in all cases with women  i want at this particular time more than any thing else to do right with you and if i knew it would be doing right as i rather suspect it would to let you alone i would do it and for the purpose of making the matter as plain as possible i now say that you can drop the subject dismiss your thoughts if you ever had any from me for ever and leave this letter unanswered without calling forth one accusing murmur from me and i will even go further and say that if it will add anything to your comfort or peace of mind to do so it is my sincere wish that you should do not understand by this that i wish to cut your acquaintance i mean no such thing what i do wish is that our further acquaintance shall depend upon yourself if such further acquaintance would contribute nothing to your happiness i am sure it would not to mine if you feel yourself in any degree bound to me i am now willing to release you provided you wish it while on the other hand i am willing and even anxious to bind you faster if i can be convinced that it will in any considerable degree add to your happiness this indeed is the whole question with me nothing would make me more miserable than to believe you miserable nothing more happy than to know you were so  in what i have now said i think i cannot be misunderstood and to make myself understood is the only object of this letter  if it suits you best not to answer this farewell a long life and a merry one attend you but if you conclude to write back speak as plainly as i do there can neither be harm nor danger in saying to me anything you think just in the manner you think it my respects to your sister  your friend lincoln     legal suit of widow vs gen adams  to the people  sangamon journal springfield ill aug 19 1837  in accordance with our determination as expressed last week we present to the reader the articles which were published in handbill form in reference to the case of the heirs of joseph anderson vs james adams these articles can now be read uninfluenced by personal or party feeling and with the sole motive of learning the truth when that is done the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters at issue  we only regret in this case that the publications were not made some weeks before the election such a course might have prevented the expressions of regret which have often been heard since from different individuals on account of the disposition they made of their votes  to the public  it is well known to most of you that there is existing at this time considerable excitement in regard to gen adamss titles to certain tracts of land and the manner in which he acquired them as i understand the gen charges that the whole has been gotten up by a knot of lawyers to injure his election and as i am one of the knot to which he refers and as i happen to be in possession of facts connected with the matter i will in as brief a manner as possible make a statement of them together with the means by which i arrived at the knowledge of them  sometime in may or june last a widow woman by the name of anderson and her son who resides in fulton county came to springfield for the purpose as they said of selling a ten acre lot of ground lying near town which they claimed as the property of the deceased husband and father  when they reached town they found the land was claimed by gen adams john t stuart and myself were employed to look into the matter and if it was thought we could do so with any prospect of success to commence a suit for the land i went immediately to the recorders office to examine adamss title and found that the land had been entered by one dixon deeded by dixon to thomas by thomas to one miller and by miller to gen adams the oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven years old and the latest more than five all recorded at the same time and that within less than one year this i thought a suspicious circumstance and i was thereby induced to examine the deeds very closely with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to overturn the title being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud i discovered that in the deed from thomas to miller although millers name stood in a sort of marginal note on the record book it was nowhere in the deed itself i told the fact to talbott the recorder and proposed to him that he should go to gen adamss and get the original deed and compare it with the record and thereby ascertain whether the defect was in the original or there was merely an error in the recording as talbott afterwards told me he went to the generals but not finding him at home got the deed from his son which when compared with the record proved what we had discovered was merely an error of the recorder after mr talbott corrected the record he brought the original to our office as i then thought and think yet to show us that it was right when he came into the room he handed the deed to me remarking that the fault was all his own on opening it another paper fell out of it which on examination proved to be an assignment of a judgment in the circuit court of sangamon county from joseph anderson the late husband of the widow above named to james adams the judgment being in favor of said anderson against one joseph miller knowing that this judgment had some connection with the land affair i immediately took a copy of it which is word for word letter for letter and cross for cross as follows  joseph anderson vs joseph miller  judgment in sangamon circuit court against joseph miller obtained on a note originally 25 dolls and interest thereon accrued i assign all my right title and interest to james adams which is in consideration of a debt i owe said adams  his joseph x anderson mark  as the copy shows it bore date may 10 1827 although the judgment assigned by it was not obtained until the october afterwards as may be seen by any one on the records of the circuit court two other strange circumstances attended it which cannot be represented by a copy one of them was that the date 1827 had first been made 1837 and without the figure 3 being fully obliterated the figure 2 had afterwards been made on top of it the other was that although the date was ten years old the writing on it from the freshness of its appearance was thought by many and i believe by all who saw it not to be more than a week old the paper on which it was written had a very old appearance and there were some old figures on the back of it which made the freshness of the writing on the face of it much more striking than i suppose it otherwise might have been the readers curiosity is no doubt excited to know what connection this assignment had with the land in question the story is this dixon sold and deeded the land to thomas thomas sold it to anderson but before he gave a deed anderson sold it to miller and took millers note for the purchase money when this note became due anderson sued miller on it and miller procured an injunction from the court of chancery to stay the collection of the money until he should get a deed for the land gen adams was employed as an attorney by anderson in this chancery suit and at the october term 1827 the injunction was dissolved and a judgment given in favor of anderson against miller and it was provided that thomas was to execute a deed for the land in favor of miller and deliver it to gen adams to be held up by him till miller paid the judgment and then to deliver it to him miller left the county without paying the judgment anderson moved to fulton county where he has since died when the widow came to springfield last may or june as before mentioned and found the land deeded to gen adams by miller she was naturally led to inquire why the money due upon the judgment had not been sent to them inasmuch as he gen adams had no authority to deliver thomass deed to miller until the money was paid then it was the general told her or perhaps her son who came with her that anderson in his lifetime had assigned the judgment to him gen adams i am now told that the general is exhibiting an assignment of the same judgment bearing date 1828 and in other respects differing from the one described and that he is asserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me ever existed or if there did it was forged between talbott and the lawyers and slipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him now i can only say that i know precisely such a one did exist and that ben talbott wm butler cr matheny john t stuart judge logan robert irwin p c canedy and s m tinsley all saw and examined it and that at least one half of them will swear that it was in general adamss handwriting and further i know that talbott will swear that he got it out of the generals possession and returned it into his possession again the assignment which the general is now exhibiting purports to have been by anderson in writing the one i copied was signed with a cross  i am told that gen neale says that he will swear that he heard gen adams tell young anderson that the assignment made by his father was signed with a cross  the above are facts as stated i leave them without comment i have given the names of persons who have knowledge of these facts in order that any one who chooses may call on them and ascertain how far they will corroborate my statements i have only made these statements because i am known by many to be one of the individuals against whom the charge of forging the assignment and slipping it into the generals papers has been made and because our silence might be construed into a confession of its truth i shall not subscribe my name but i hereby authorize the editor of the journal to give it up to any one that may call for it     lincoln and talbott in reply to gen adams  sangamon journal springfield ill oct 28 1837  in the republican of this morning a publication of gen adamss appears in which my name is used quite unreservedly for this i thank the general i thank him because it gives me an opportunity without appearing obtrusive of explaining a part of a former publication of mine which appears to me to have been misunderstood by many  in the former publication alluded to i stated in substance that mr talbott got a deed from a son of gen adamss for the purpose of correcting a mistake that had occurred on the record of the said deed in the recorders office that he corrected the record and brought the deed and handed it to me and that on opening the deed another paper being the assignment of a judgment fell out of it this statement gen adams and the editor of the republican have seized upon as a most palpable evidence of fabrication and falsehood they set themselves gravely about proving that the assignment could not have been in the deed when talbott got it from young adams as he talbott would have seen it when he opened the deed to correct the record now the truth is talbott did see the assignment when he opened the deed or at least he told me he did on the same day and i only omitted to say so in my former publication because it was a matter of such palpable and necessary inference i had stated that talbott had corrected the record by the deed and of course he must have opened it and just as the general and his friends argue must have seen the assignment i omitted to state the fact of talbotts seeing the assignment because its existence was so necessarily connected with other facts which i did state that i thought the greatest dunce could not but understand it did i say talbott had not seen it did i say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it before most certainly i did neither and if i did not what becomes of the argument these logical gentlemen can sustain their argument only by assuming that i did say negatively everything that i did not say affirmatively and upon the same assumption we may expect to find the general if a little harder pressed for argument saying that i said talbott came to our office with his head downward not that i actually said so but because i omitted to say he came feet downward  in his publication today the general produces the affidavit of reuben radford in which it is said that talbott told radford that he did not find the assignment in the deed in the recording of which the error was committed but that he found it wrapped in another paper in the recorders office upon which statement the genl comments as follows to wit if it be true as stated by talbott to radford that he found the assignment wrapped up in another paper at his office that contradicts the statement of lincoln that it fell out of the deed  is common sense to be abused with such sophistry did i say what talbott found it in if talbott did find it in another paper at his office is that any reason why he could not have folded it in a deed and brought it to my office can any one be so far duped as to be made believe that what may have happened at talbots office at one time is inconsistent with what happened at my office at another time  now talbotts statement of the case as he makes it to me is this that he got a bunch of deeds from young adams and that he knows he found the assignment in the bunch but he is not certain which particular deed it was in nor is he certain whether it was folded in the same deed out of which it was taken or another one when it was brought to my office is this a mysterious story is there anything suspicious about it  but it is useless to dwell longer on this point any man who is not wilfully blind can see at a flash that there is no discrepancy and lincoln has shown that they are not only inconsistent with truth but each otheri can only say that i have shown that he has done no such thing and if the reader is disposed to require any other evidence than the generals assertion he will be of my opinion  excepting the generals most flimsy attempt at mystification in regard to a discrepance between talbott and myself he has not denied a single statement that i made in my handbill every material statement that i made has been sworn to by men who in former times were thought as respectable as general adams i stated that an assignment of a judgment a copy of which i gave had existedbenj talbott c r matheny wm butler and judge logan swore to its existence i stated that it was said to be in gen adamss handwritingthe same men swore it was in his handwriting i stated that talbott would swear that he got it out of gen adamss possessiontalbott came forward and did swear it  bidding adieu to the former publication i now propose to examine the generals last gigantic production i now propose to point out some discrepancies in the generals address and such too as he shall not be able to escape from speaking of the famous assignment the general says this last charge which was their last resort their dying effort to render my character infamous among my fellow citizens was manufactured at a certain lawyers office in the town printed at the office of the sangamon journal and found its way into the world some time between two days just before the last election now turn to mr keys affidavit in which you will find the following viz i certify that some time in may or the early part of june 1837 i saw at williamss corner a paper purporting to be an assignment from joseph anderson to james adams which assignment was signed by a mark to andersons name etc now mark if keys saw the assignment on the last of may or first of june gen adams tells a falsehood when he says it was manufactured just before the election which was on the 7th of august and if it was manufactured just before the election keys tells a falsehood when he says he saw it on the last of may or first of june either keys or the general is irretrievably in for it and in the generals very condescending language i say let them settle it between them  now again let the reader bearing in mind that general adams has unequivocally said in one part of his address that the charge in relation to the assignment was manufactured just before the election turn to the affidavit of peter s weber where the following will be found viz i peter s weber do certify that from the best of my recollection on the day or day after gen adams started for the illinois rapids in may last that i was at the house of gen adams sitting in the kitchen situated on the back part of the house it being in the afternoon and that benjamin talbott came around the house back into the kitchen and appeared wild and confused and that he laid a package of papers on the kitchen table and requested that they should be handed to lucian he made no apology for coming to the kitchen nor for not handing them to lucian himself but showed the token of being frightened and confused both in demeanor and speech and for what cause i could not apprehend  commenting on webers affidavit gen adams asks why this fright and confusion i reply that this is a question for the general himself weber says that it was in may and if so it is most clear that talbott was not frightened on account of the assignment unless the general lies when he says the assignment charge was manufactured just before the election is it not a strong evidence that the general is not traveling with the polestar of truth in his front to see him in one part of his address roundly asserting that the assignment was manufactured just before the election and then forgetting that position procuring webers most foolish affidavit to prove that talbott had been engaged in manufacturing it two months before  in another part of his address gen adams says that i hold an assignment of said judgment dated the 20th of may 1828 and signed by said anderson i have never pretended to deny or conceal but stated that fact in one of my circulars previous to the election and also in answer to a bill in chancery now i pronounce this statement unqualifiedly false and shall not rely on the word or oath of any man to sustain me in what i say but will let the whole be decided by reference to the circular and answer in chancery of which the general speaks in his circular he did speak of an assignment but he did not say it bore date 20th of may 1828 nor did he say it bore any date in his answer in chancery he did say that he had an assignment but he did not say that it bore date the 20th may 1828 but so far from it he said on oath for he swore to the answer that as well as recollected he obtained it in 1827 if any one doubts let him examine the circular and answer for himself they are both accessible  it will readily be observed that the principal part of adamss defense rests upon the argument that if he had been base enough to forge an assignment he would not have been fool enough to forge one that would not cover the case this argument he used in his circular before the election the republican has used it at least once since then and adams uses it again in his publication of today now i pledge myself to show that he is just such a fool that he and his friends have contended it was impossible for him to be recollecthe says he has a genuine assignment and that he got joseph kleins affidavit stating that he had seen it and that he believed the signature to have been executed by the same hand that signed andersons name to the answer in chancery luckily klein took a copy of this genuine assignment which i have been permitted to see and hence i know it does not cover the case in the first place it is headed joseph anderson vs joseph miller and heads off judgment in sangamon circuit court now mark there never was a case in sangamon circuit court entitled joseph anderson vs joseph miller the case mentioned in my former publication and the only one between these parties that ever existed in the circuit court was entitled joseph miller vs joseph anderson miller being the plaintiff what then becomes of all their sophistry about adams not being fool enough to forge an assignment that would not cover the case it is certain that the present one does not cover the case and if he got it honestly it is still clear that he was fool enough to pay for an assignment that does not cover the case  the general asks for the proof of disinterested witnesses whom does he consider disinterested none can be more so than those who have already testified against him no one of them had the least interest on earth so far as i can learn to injure him true he says they had conspired against him but if the testimony of an angel from heaven were introduced against him he would make the same charge of conspiracy and now i put the question to every reflecting man do you believe that benjamin talbott chas r matheny william butler and stephen t logan all sustaining high and spotless characters and justly proud of them would deliberately perjure themselves without any motive whatever except to injure a mans election and that too a man who had been a candidate time out of mind and yet who had never been elected to any office  adamss assurance in demanding disinterested testimony is surpassing he brings in the affidavit of his own son and even of peter s weber with whom i am not acquainted but who i suppose is some black or mulatto boy from his being kept in the kitchen to prove his points but when such a man as talbott a man who but two years ago ran against gen adams for the office of recorder and beat him more than four votes to one is introduced against him he asks the community with all the consequence of a lord to reject his testimony  i might easily write a volume pointing out inconsistencies between the statements in adamss last address with one another and with other known facts but i am aware the reader must already be tired with the length of this article his opening statements that he was first accused of being a tory and that he refuted that that then the sampsons ghost story was got up and he refuted that that as a last resort a dying effort the assignment charge was got up is all as false as hell as all this community must know sampsons ghost first made its appearance in print and that too after keys swears he saw the assignment as any one may see by reference to the files of papers and gen adams himself in reply to the sampsons ghost story was the first man that raised the cry of toryism and it was only by way of setoff and never in seriousness that it was bandied back at him his effort is to make the impression that his enemies first made the charge of toryism and he drove them from that then sampsons ghost he drove them from that then finally the assignment charge was manufactured just before election now the only general reply he ever made to the sampsons ghost and tory charges he made at one and the same time and not in succession as he states and the date of that reply will show that it was made at least a month after the date on which keys swears he saw the anderson assignment but enough in conclusion i will only say that i have a character to defend as well as gen adams but i disdain to whine about it as he does it is true i have no children nor kitchen boys and if i had i should scorn to lug them in to make affidavits for me  a lincoln september 6 1837     gen adams controversycontinued  to the public  sangamon journal springfield ill oct28 1837  such is the turn which things have taken lately that when gen adams writes a book i am expected to write a commentary on it in the republican of this morning he has presented the world with a new work of six columns in length in consequence of which i must beg the room of one column in the journal it is obvious that a minute reply cannot be made in one column to everything that can be said in six and consequently i hope that expectation will be answered if i reply to such parts of the generals publication as are worth replying to  it may not be improper to remind the reader that in his publication of sept 6th general adams said that the assignment charge was manufactured just before the election and that in reply i proved that statement to be false by keys his own witness now without attempting to explain he furnishes me with another witness tinsley by which the same thing is proved to wit that the assignment was not manufactured just before the election but that it was some weeks before let it be borne in mind that adams made this statementhas himself furnished two witnesses to prove its falsehood and does not attempt to deny or explain it before going farther let a pin be stuck here labeled one lie proved and confessed on the 6th of september he said he had before stated in the handbill that he held an assignment dated may 20th 1828 which in reply i pronounced to be false and referred to the handbill for the truth of what i said this week he forgets to make any explanation of this let another pin be stuck here labelled as before i mention these things because if when i convict him in one falsehood he is permitted to shift his ground and pass it by in silence there can be no end to this controversy  the first thing that attracts my attention in the generals present production is the information he is pleased to give to those who are made to suffer at his my hands  under present circumstances this cannot apply to me for i am not a widow nor an orphan nor have i a wife or children who might by possibility become such such however i have no doubt have been and will again be made to suffer at his hands hands yes they are the mischievous agents the next thing i shall notice is his favorite expression not of lawyers doctors and others which he is so fond of applying to all who dare expose his rascality now let it be remembered that when he first came to this country he attempted to impose himself upon the community as a lawyer and actually carried the attempt so far as to induce a man who was under a charge of murder to entrust the defence of his life in his hands and finally took his money and got him hanged is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing lawyers if he is not himself a lawyer it is for the lack of sense and not of inclination if he is not a lawyer he is a liar for he proclaimed himself a lawyer and got a man hanged by depending on him  passing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument in them i come to the question asked by adams whether any person ever saw the assignment in his possession this is an insult to common sense talbott has sworn once and repeated time and again that he got it out of adamss possession and returned it into the same possession still as though he was addressing fools he has assurance to ask if any person ever saw it in his possession  next i quote a sentence now my son lucian swears that when talbott called for the deed that he talbott opened it and pointed out the error true his son lucian did swear as he says and in doing so he swore what i will prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood turn to lucians affidavit and you will there see that talbott called for the deed by which to correct an error on the record thus it appears that the error in question was on the record and not in the deed how then could talbott open the deed and point out the error where a thing is not it cannot be pointed out the error was not in the deed and of course could not be pointed out there this does not merely prove that the error could not be pointed out as lucian swore it was but it proves too that the deed was not opened in his presence with a special view to the error for if it had been he could not have failed to see that there was no error in it it is easy enough to see why lucian swore this his object was to prove that the assignment was not in the deed when talbott got it but it was discovered he could not swear this safely without first swearing the deed was openedand if he swore it was opened he must show a motive for opening it and the conclusion with him and his father was that the pointing out the error would appear the most plausible  for the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle when talbott got it is the story introduced into lucians affidavit that the deeds were counted it is a remarkable fact and one that should stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators that in this short affidavit of lucians he only attempted to depart from the truth so far as i have the means of knowing in two points to wit in the opening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the deedsand in both of these he caught himself about the counting he caught himself thusafter saying the bundle contained five deeds and a lease he proceeds and i saw no other papers than the said deed and lease first he has six papers and then he saw none but two for my son lucians benefit let a pin be stuck here  adams again adduces the argument that he could not have forged the assignment for the reason that he could have had no motive for it with those that know the facts there is no absence of motive admitting the paper which he has filed in the suit to be genuine it is clear that it cannot answer the purpose for which he designs it hence his motive for making one that he supposed would answer is obvious his making the date too old is also easily enough accounted for the records were not in his hands and then there being some considerable talk upon this particular subject he knew he could not examine the records to ascertain the precise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion and hence he concluded to try it by guess and as it turned out missed it a little about millers deposition i have a word to say in the first place millers answer to the first question shows upon its face that he had been tampered with and the answer dictated to him he was asked if he knew joel wright and james adams and above threefourths of his answer consists of what he knew about joseph anderson a man about whom nothing had been asked nor a word said in the questiona fact that can only be accounted for upon the supposition that adams had secretly told him what he wished him to swear to  another of millers answers i will prove both by common sense and the court of record is untrue to one question he answers anderson brought a suit against me before james adams then an acting justice of the peace in sangamon county before whom he obtained a judgment  qdid you remove the same by injunction to the sangamon circuit court ansi did remove it  now markit is said he removed it by injunction the word injunction in common language imports a command that some person or thing shall not move or be removed in law it has the same meaning an injunction issuing out of chancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to stop all proceedings in a named case until further orders it is not an order to remove but to stop or stay something that is already moving besides this the records of the sangamon circuit court show that the judgment of which miller swore was never removed into said court by injunction or otherwise  i have now to take notice of a part of adamss address which in the order of time should have been noticed before it is in these words i have now shown in the opinion of two competent judges that the handwriting of the forged assignment differed from mine and by one of them that it could not be mistaken for mine that is false tinsley no doubt is the judge referred to and by reference to his certificate it will be seen that he did not say the handwriting of the assignment could not be mistaken for adamssnor did he use any other expression substantially or anything near substantially the same but if tinsley had said the handwriting could not be mistaken for adamss it would have been equally unfortunate for adams for it then would have contradicted keys who says i looked at the writing and judged it the said adamss or a good imitation  adams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on attending lawsuits and the ultimate maintenance of his title to the land in question without wishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream i would say to him that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to sing a different song in relation to the matter  at the end of millers deposition adams asks will mr lincoln now say that he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land is founded in fraud i answer i will not i will now change the phraseology so as to make it runi am quite convinced c i cannot pass in silence adamss assertion that he has proved that the forged assignment was not in the deed when it came from his house by talbott the recorder in this although talbott has sworn that the assignment was in the bundle of deeds when it came from his house adams has the unaccountable assurance to say that he has proved the contrary by talbott let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he proved any such thing by talbott  in his publication of the 6th of september he hinted to talbott that he might be mistaken in his present speaking of talbott and me he says they may have been imposed upon can any man of the least penetration fail to see the object of this after he has stormed and raged till he hopes and imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to softly whisper in our ears if youll quit i will if he could get us to say that some unknown undefined being had slipped the assignment into our hands without our knowledge not a doubt remains but that he would immediately discover that we were the purest men on earth this is the ground he evidently wishes us to understand he is willing to compromise upon but we ask no such charity at his hands we are neither mistaken nor imposed upon we have made the statements we have because we know them to be true and we choose to live or die by them  esq carter who is adamss friend personal and political will recollect that on the 5th of this month he adams with a great affectation of modesty declared that he would never introduce his own child as a witness notwithstanding this affectation of modesty he has in his present publication introduced his child as witness and as if to show with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration he has had this same esq carter to administer the oath to him and so important a witness does he consider him and so entirely does the whole of his entire present production depend upon the testimony of his child that in it he has mentioned my son my son lucian lucian my son and the like expressions no less than fifteen different times let it be remembered here that i have shown the affidavit of my darling son lucian to be false by the evidence apparent on its own face and i now ask if that affidavit be taken away what foundation will the fabric have left to stand upon  general adamss publications and outdoor maneuvering taken in connection with the editorial articles of the republican are not more foolish and contradictory than they are ludicrous and amusing one week the republican notifies the public that gen adams is preparing an instrument that will tear rend split rive blow up confound overwhelm annihilate extinguish exterminate burst asunder and grind to powder all its slanderers and particularly talbott and lincolnall of which is to be done in due time  then for two or three weeks all is calmnot a word said again the republican comes forth with a mere passing remark that public opinion has decided in favor of gen adams and intimates that he will give himself no more trouble about the matter in the meantime adams himself is prowling about and as burns says of the devil for prey and holes and corners tryin and in one instance goes so far as to take an old acquaintance of mine several steps from a crowd and apparently weighed down with the importance of his business gravely and solemnly asks him if he ever heard lincoln say he was a deist  anon the republican comes again we invite the attention of the public to general adamss communication c the victory is a great one the triumph is overwhelming i really believe the editor of the illinois republican is fool enough to think general adams leads offauthors most egregiously mistaken c most woefully shall their presumption be punished c lord have mercy on us the hour is yet to come yea nigh at handhow long first do you reckonwhen the journal and its junto shall say i have appeared too early their infamy shall be laid bare to the public gaze suddenly the general appears to relent at the severity with which he is treating us and he exclaims the condemnation of my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defense for your healths sake dear gen do not permit your tenderness of heart to afflict you so much on our account for some reason perhaps because we are killed so quickly we shall never be sensible of our suffering  farewell general i will see you again at court if not beforewhen and where we will settle the question whether you or the widow shall have the land  a lincoln october 18 1837     1838     to mrs o h browninga farce  springfield april 1 1838  dear madamwithout apologizing for being egotistical i shall make the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since i saw you the subject of this letter and by the way i now discover that in order to give a full and intelligible account of the things i have done and suffered since i saw you i shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before  it was then in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my acquaintance and who was a great friend of mine being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives residing in kentucky proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that i would engage to become her brotherinlaw with all convenient despatch i of course accepted the proposal for you know i could not have done otherwise had i really been averse to it but privately between you and me i was most confoundedly well pleased with the project i had seen the said sister some three years before thought her intelligent and agreeable and saw no good objection to plodding life through hand in hand with her time passed on the lady took her journey and in due time returned sister in company sure enough this astonished me a little for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed that she was a trifle too willing but on reflection it occurred to me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to come without anything concerning me ever having been mentioned to her and so i concluded that if no other objection presented itself i would consent to waive this all this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival in the neighborhoodfor be it remembered i had not yet seen her except about three years previous as above mentioned in a few days we had an interview and although i had seen her before she did not look as my imagination had pictured her i knew she was oversize but she now appeared a fair match for falstaff i knew she was called an old maid and i felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appellation but now when i beheld her i could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother and this not from withered featuresfor her skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinklesbut from her want of teeth weatherbeaten appearance in general and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than thirtyfive or forty years and in short i was not at all pleased with her but what could i do i had told her sister that i would take her for better or for worse and i made a point of honor and conscience in all things to stick to my word especially if others had been induced to act on it which in this case i had no doubt they had for i was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain  well thought i i have said it and be the consequences what they may it shall not be my fault if i fail to do it at once i determined to consider her my wife and this done all my powers of discovery were put to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off against her defects i tried to imagine her handsome which but for her unfortunate corpulency was actually true exclusive of this no woman that i have ever seen has a finer face i also tried to convince myself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person and in this she was not inferior as i could discover to any with whom i had been acquainted  shortly after this without coming to any positive understanding with her i set out for vandalia when and where you first saw me during my stay there i had letters from her which did not change my opinion of either her intellect or intention but on the contrary confirmed it in both  all this while although i was fixed firm as the surgerepelling rock in my resolution i found i was continually repenting the rashness which had led me to make it through life i have been in no bondage either real or imaginary from the thraldom of which i so much desired to be free after my return home i saw nothing to change my opinions of her in any particular she was the same and so was i i now spent my time in planning how i might get along through life after my contemplated change of circumstances should have taken place and how i might procrastinate the evil day for a time which i really dreaded as much perhaps more than an irishman does the halter  after all my suffering upon this deeply interesting subject here i am wholly unexpectedly completely out of the scrape and now i want to know if you can guess how i got out of itout clear in every sense of the term no violation of word honor or conscience i dont believe you can guess and so i might as well tell you at once as the lawyer says it was done in the manner following to wit after i had delayed the matter as long as i thought i could in honor do which by the way had brought me round into the last fall i concluded i might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay and so i mustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct but shocking to relate she answered no at first i supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty which i thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of her case but on my renewal of the charge i found she repelled it with greater firmness than before i tried it again and again but with the same success or rather with the same want of success  i finally was forced to give it up at which i very unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance i was mortified it seemed to me in a hundred different ways my vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection that i had been too stupid to discover her intentions and at the same time never doubting that i understood them perfectly and also that she whom i had taught myself to believe nobody else would have had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness and to cap the whole i then for the first time began to suspect that i was really a little in love with her but let it all go ill try and outlive it others have been made fools of by the girls but this can never with truth be said of me i most emphatically in this instance made a fool of myself i have now come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying and for this reason i can never be satisfied with any one who would be blockhead enough to have me  when you receive this write me a long yarn about something to amuse me give my respects to mr browning  your sincere friend a lincoln     1839     remarks on sale of public lands  in the house of representatives january 17 1839  mr lincoln from committee on finance to which the subject was referred made a report on the subject of purchasing of the united states all the unsold lands lying within the limits of the state of illinois accompanied by resolutions that this state propose to purchase all unsold lands at twentyfive cents per acre and pledging the faith of the state to carry the proposal into effect if the government accept the same within two years  mr lincoln thought the resolutions ought to be seriously considered in reply to the gentleman from adams he said that it was not to enrich the state the price of the lands may be raised it was thought by some by others that it would be reduced the conclusion in his mind was that the representatives in this legislature from the country in which the lands lie would be opposed to raising the price because it would operate against the settlement of the lands he referred to the lands in the military tract they had fallen into the hands of large speculators in consequence of the low price he was opposed to a low price of land he thought it was adverse to the interests of the poor settler because speculators buy them up he was opposed to a reduction of the price of public lands  mr lincoln referred to some official documents emanating from indiana and compared the progressive population of the two states illinois had gained upon that state under the public land system as it is his conclusion was that ten years from this time illinois would have no more public land unsold than indiana now has he referred also to ohio that state had sold nearly all her public lands she was but twenty years ahead of us and as our lands were equally salablemore so as he maintainedwe should have no more twenty years from now than she has at present  mr lincoln referred to the canal lands and supposed that the policy of the state would be different in regard to them if the representatives from that section of country could themselves choose the policy but the representatives from other parts of the state had a veto upon it and regulated the policy he thought that if the state had all the lands the policy of the legislature would be more liberal to all sections  he referred to the policy of the general government he thought that if the national debt had not been paid the expenses of the government would not have doubled as they had done since that debt was paid     to  row  springfield june 11 1839 dear row  mr redman informs me that you wish me to write you the particulars of a conversation between dr felix and myself relative to you the dr overtook me between rushville and beardstown  he after learning that i had lived at springfield asked if i was acquainted with you i told him i was he said you had lately been elected constable in adams but that you never would be again i asked him why he said the people there had found out that you had been sheriff or deputy sheriff in sangamon county and that you came off and left your securities to suffer he then asked me if i did not know such to be the fact i told him i did not think you had ever been sheriff or deputy sheriff in sangamon but that i thought you had been constable i further told him that if you had left your securities to suffer in that or any other case i had never heard of it and that if it had been so i thought i would have heard of it  if the dr is telling that i told him anything against you whatever i authorize you to contradict it flatly we have no news here  your friend as ever a lincoln     speech on national bank  in the hall of the house of representatives  springfield illinois december 20 1839  fellowcitizensit is peculiarly embarrassing to me to attempt a continuance of the discussion on this evening which has been conducted in this hall on several preceding ones it is so because on each of those evenings there was a much fuller attendance than now without any reason for its being so except the greater interest the community feel in the speakers who addressed them then than they do in him who is to do so now i am indeed apprehensive that the few who have attended have done so more to spare me mortification than in the hope of being interested in anything i may be able to say this circumstance casts a damp upon my spirits which i am sure i shall be unable to overcome during the evening but enough of preface  the subject heretofore and now to be discussed is the subtreasury scheme of the present administration as a means of collecting safekeeping transferring and disbursing the revenues of the nation as contrasted with a national bank for the same purposes mr douglas has said that we the whigs have not dared to meet them the locos in argument on this question i protest against this assertion i assert that we have again and again during this discussion urged facts and arguments against the subtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to answer but lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid the question i now propose in my humble way to urge those arguments again at the same time begging the audience to mark well the positions i shall take and the proof i shall offer to sustain them and that they will not again permit mr douglas or his friends to escape the force of them by a round and groundless assertion that we dare not meet them in argument  of the subtreasury then as contrasted with a national bank for the beforeenumerated purposes i lay down the following propositions to wit 1 it will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating medium 2 it will be a more expensive fiscal agent 3 it will be a less secure depository of the public money to show the truth of the first proposition let us take a short review of our condition under the operation of a national bank it was the depository of the public revenues between the collection of those revenues and the disbursement of them by the government the bank was permitted to and did actually loan them out to individuals and hence the large amount of money actually collected for revenue purposes which by any other plan would have been idle a great portion of the time was kept almost constantly in circulation any person who will reflect that money is only valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device which will keep the government revenues in constant circulation instead of being locked up in idleness is no inconsiderable advantage by the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until the government wants it for disbursement thus robbing the people of the use of it while the government does not itself need it and while the money is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes the natural effect of this change of policy every one will see is to reduce the quantity of money in circulation but again by the subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie i anticipate that this will be disputed i expect to hear it said that it is not the policy of the administration to collect the revenue in specie if it shall i reply that mr van buren in his message recommending the subtreasury expended nearly a column of that document in an attempt to persuade congress to provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively and he concludes with these words  it may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizens requires the reception of bank paper in addition to this mr silas wright senator from new york and the political personal and confidential friend of mr van buren drafted and introduced into the senate the first subtreasury bill and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the revenue in specie it is true i know that that clause was stricken from the bill but it was done by the votes of the whigs aided by a portion only of the van buren senators no subtreasury bill has yet become a law though two or three have been considered by congress some with and some without the specie clause so that i admit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the administration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not but i take it that the fact that the president at first urged the specie doctrine and that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it warrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head as publicly recants it as he at first espoused it i repeat then that by the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie now mark what the effect of this must be by all estimates ever made there are but between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the united states the expenditures of the government for the year 1838the last for which we have had the reportwere forty millions thus it is seen that if the whole revenue be collected in specie it will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it by this means more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the whole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public officeholders and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps not more than one quarter of a million leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along as they best can with less than one half of the specie of the country and whatever rags and shinplasters they may be able to put and keep in circulation by this means every officeholder and other public creditor may and most likely will set up shaver and a most glorious harvest will the speciemen have of iteach specieman upon a fair division having to his share the fleecing of about fiftynine ragmen in all candor let me ask was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised and was the sacred name of democracy ever before made to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people  i have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the quantity of money in circulation this position is strengthened by the recollection that the revenue is to be collected in specie so that the mere amount of revenue is not all that is withdrawn but the amount of paper circulation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to is withdrawn which would be in a sound state at least one hundred millions when one hundred millions or more of the circulation we now have shall be withdrawn who can contemplate without terror the distress ruin bankruptcy and beggary that must follow the man who has purchased any articlesay a horseon credit at one hundred dollars when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country if the quantity be reduced to one hundred millions by the arrival of payday will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt and the other half must either be paid out of his other means and thereby become a clear loss to him or go unpaid and thereby become a clear loss to his creditor what i have here said of a single case of the purchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs by whomsoever and for whatsoever it may have been contracted it may be said that what the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation but on examination this will be found true only to a very limited extent it is more generally true that all lose by itthe creditor by losing more of his debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects the debtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts than he received in contracting them or by entirely breaking up his business and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness  the general distress thus created will to be sure be temporary because whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any community time will adjust the derangement produced but while that adjustment is progressing all suffer more or less and very many lose everything that renders life desirable why then shall we suffer a severe difficulty even though it be but temporary unless we receive some equivalent for it  what i have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the quantity of money relates to the whole country i now propose to show that it would produce a peculiar and permanent hardship upon the citizens of those states and territories in which the public lands lie the landoffices in those states and territories as all know form the great gulf by which all or nearly all the money in them is swallowed up when the quantity of money shall be reduced and consequently everything under individual control brought down in proportion the price of those lands being fixed by law will remain as now of necessity it will follow that the produce or labor that now raises money sufficient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but sufficient to purchase forty or perhaps not that much and this difficulty and hardship will last as long in some degree as any portion of these lands shall remain undisposed of knowing as i well do the difficulty that poor people now encounter in procuring homes i hesitate not to say that when the price of the public lands shall be doubled or trebled or which is the same thing produce and labor cut down to one half or one third of their present prices it will be little less than impossible for them to procure those homes at all  well then what did become of him postmaster general barry why the president immediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost unequaled incapacity and corruption by appointing him to a foreign mission with a salary and outfit of 18000 a year the party now attempt to throw barry off and to avoid the responsibility of his sins did not the president indorse those sins when on the very heel of their commission he appointed their author to the very highest and most honorable office in his gift and which is but a single step behind the very goal of american political ambition  i return to another of mr douglass excuses for the expenditures of 1838 at the same time announcing the pleasing intelligence that this is the last one he says that ten millions of that years expenditure was a contingent appropriation to prosecute an anticipated war with great britain on the maine boundary question few words will settle this first that the ten millions appropriated was not made till 1839 and consequently could not have been expended in 1838 second although it was appropriated it has never been expended at all those who heard mr douglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me now hes got me thought i but when he went on to say that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the french indemnities which i knew to be untrue that five millions had been for the postoffice which i knew to be untrue that ten millions had been for the maine boundary war which i not only knew to be untrue but supremely ridiculous also and when i saw that he was stupid enough to hope that i would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to go unexposedi readily consented that on the score both of veracity and sagacity the audience should judge whether he or i were the more deserving of the worlds contempt  mr lamborn insists that the difference between the van buren party and the whigs is that although the former sometimes err in practice they are always correct in principle whereas the latter are wrong in principle and better to impress this proposition he uses a figurative expression in these words the democrats are vulnerable in the heel but they are sound in the head and the heart the first branch of the figurethat is that the democrats are vulnerable in the heeli admit is not merely figuratively but literally true who that looks but for a moment at their swartwouts their prices their harringtons and their hundreds of others scampering away with the public money to texas to europe and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of running itch it seems that this malady of their heels operates on these soundheaded and honesthearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song did on its owner which when he had once got started on it the more he tried to stop it the more it would run away at the hazard of wearing this point threadbare i will relate an anecdote which seems too strikingly in point to be omitted a witty irish soldier who was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near but who invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement being asked by his captain why he did so replied captain i have as brave a heart as julius caesar ever had but somehow or other whenever danger approaches my cowardly legs will run away with it so with mr lamborns party they take the public money into their hand for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate but before they can possibly get it out again their rascally vulnerable heels will run away with them  seriously this proposition of mr lamborn is nothing more or less than a request that his party may be tried by their professions instead of their practices perhaps no position that the party assumes is more liable to or more deserving of exposure than this very modest request and nothing but the unwarrantable length to which i have already extended these remarks forbids me now attempting to expose it for the reason given i pass it by  i shall advert to but one more point mr lamborn refers to the late elections in the states and from their results confidently predicts that every state in the union will vote for mr van buren at the next presidential election address that argument to cowards and to knaves with the free and the brave it will effect nothing it may be true if it must let it many free countries have lost their liberty and ours may lose hers but if she shall be it my proudest plume not that i was the last to desert but that i never deserted her i know that the great volcano at washington aroused and directed by the evil spirit that reigns there is belching forth the lava of political corruption in a current broad and deep which is sweeping with frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land bidding fair to leave unscathed no green spot or living thing while on its bosom are riding like demons on the waves of hell the imps of that evil spirit and fiendishly taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course with the hopelessness of their effort and knowing this i cannot deny that all may be swept away broken by it i too may be bow to it i never will the probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just it shall not deter me if ever i feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly unworthy of its almighty architect it is when i contemplate the cause of my country deserted by all the world beside and i standing up boldly and alone and hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors here without contemplating consequences before high heaven and in the face of the world i swear eternal fidelity to the just cause as i deem it of the land of my life my liberty and my love and who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath that i take let none falter who thinks he is right and we may succeed but if after all we shall fail be it so we still shall have the proud consolation of saying to our consciences and to the departed shade of our countrys freedom that the cause approved of our judgment and adored of our hearts in disaster in chains in torture in death we never faltered in defending     to john t stuart  springfield december 23 1839  dear stuart  dr henry will write you all the political news i write this about some little matters of business you recollect you told me you had drawn the chicago masark money and sent it to the claimants a hawkbilled yankee is here besetting me at every turn i take saying that robert kinzie never received the eighty dollars to which he was entitled can you tell me anything about the matter again old mr wright who lives up south fork somewhere is teasing me continually about some deeds which he says he left with you but which i can find nothing of can you tell me where they are the legislature is in session and has suffered the bank to forfeit its charter without benefit of clergy there seems to be little disposition to resuscitate it  whenever a letter comes from you to mrs i carry it to her and then i see betty she is a tolerable nice fellow now maybe i will write again when i get more time  your friend as ever a lincoln  p sthe democratic giant is here but he is not much worth talking about al     1840     circular from whig committee  confidential  january 1 1840  to messrs   gentlemenin obedience to a resolution of the whig state convention we have appointed you the central whig committee of your county the trust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor but we hope the glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers that now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the time and labor you will devote to it our whig brethren throughout the union have met in convention and after due deliberation and mutual concessions have elected candidates for the presidency and vicepresidency not only worthy of our cause but worthy of the support of every true patriot who would have our country redeemed and her institutions honestly and faithfully administered to overthrow the trained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever on the watch and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their smallest commands every whig must not only know his duty but must firmly resolve whatever of time and labor it may cost boldly and faithfully to do it our intention is to organize the whole state so that every whig can be brought to the polls in the coming presidential contest we cannot do this however without your cooperation and as we do our duty so we shall expect you to do yours after due deliberation the following is the plan of organization and the duties required of each county committee  1 to divide their county into small districts and to appoint in each a subcommittee whose duty it shall be to make a perfect list of all the voters in their respective districts and to ascertain with certainty for whom they will vote if they meet with men who are doubtful as to the man they will support such voters should be designated in separate lines with the name of the man they will probably support  2 it will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a constant watch on the doubtful voters and from time to time have them talked to by those in whom they have the most confidence and also to place in their hands such documents as will enlighten and influence them  3 it will also be their duty to report to you at least once a month the progress they are making and on election days see that every whig is brought to the polls  4 the subcommittees should be appointed immediately and by the last of april at least they should make their first report  5 on the first of each month hereafter we shall expect to hear from you after the first report of your subcommittees unless there should be found a great many doubtful voters you can tell pretty accurately the manner in which your county will vote in each of your letters to us you will state the number of certain votes both for and against us as well as the number of doubtful votes with your opinion of the manner in which they will be cast  6 when we have heard from all the counties we shall be able to tell with similar accuracy the political complexion of the state this information will be forwarded to you as soon as received  7 inclosed is a prospectus for a newspaper to be continued until after the presidential election it will be superintended by ourselves and every whig in the state must take it it will be published so low that every one can afford it you must raise a fund and forward us for extra copiesevery county ought to sendfifty or one hundred dollarsand the copies will be forwarded to you for distribution among our political opponents the paper will be devoted exclusively to the great cause in which we are engaged procure subscriptions and forward them to us immediately  8 immediately after any election in your county you must inform us of its results and as early as possible after any general election we will give you the like information  9 a senator in congress is to be elected by our next legislature let no local interests divide you but select candidates that can succeed  10 our plan of operations will of course be concealed from every one except our good friends who of right ought to know them  trusting much in our good cause the strength of our candidates and the determination of the whigs everywhere to do their duty we go to the work of organization in this state confident of success we have the numbers and if properly organized and exerted with the gallant harrison at our head we shall meet our foes and conquer them in all parts of the union  address your letters to dr a g henry r f barrett a lincoln e d baker j f speed     to john t stuart  springfield march 1 1840  dear stuart  i have never seen the prospects of our party so bright in these parts as they are now we shall carry this county by a larger majority than we did in 1836 when you ran against may i do not think my prospects individually are very flattering for i think it probable i shall not be permitted to be a candidate but the party ticket will succeed triumphantly subscriptions to the old soldier pour in without abatement this morning i took from the post office a letter from dubois enclosing the names of sixty subscribers and on carrying it to francis i found he had received one hundred and forty more from other quarters by the same days mail that is but an average specimen of every days receipts yesterday douglas having chosen to consider himself insulted by something in the journal undertook to cane francis in the street francis caught him by the hair and jammed him back against a market cart where the matter ended by francis being pulled away from him the whole affair was so ludicrous that francis and everybody else douglass excepted have been laughing about it ever since  i send you the names of some of the vb men who have come out for harrison about town and suggest that you send them some documents  moses coffman he let us appoint him a delegate yesterday aaron coffman george gregory h m briggs johnson at

for some time since  evan butler is jealous that you never send your compliments to him you must not neglect him next time  your friend as ever a lincoln     resolution in the illinois legislature  november 28 1840  in the illinois house of representatives november 28 1840 mr lincoln offered the following  resolved that so much of the governors message as relates to fraudulent voting and other fraudulent practices at elections be referred to the committee on elections with instructions to said committee to prepare and report to the house a bill for such an act as may in their judgment afford the greatest possible protection of the elective franchise against all frauds of all sorts whatever     resolution in the illinois legislature  december 2 1840  resolved that the committee on education be instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by law for the examination as to the qualification of persons offering themselves as school teachers that no teacher shall receive any part of the public school fund who shall not have successfully passed such examination and that they report by bill or otherwise     remarks in the illinois legislature  december 4 1840  in the house of representatives illinois december 4 1840 on presentation of a report respecting petition of h n purple claiming the seat of mr phelps from peoria mr lincoln moved that the house resolve itself into committee of the whole on the question and take it up immediately mr lincoln considered the question of the highest importance whether an individual had a right to sit in this house or not the course he should propose would be to take up the evidence and decide upon the facts seriatim  mr drummond wanted time they could not decide in the heat of debate etc  mr lincoln thought that the question had better be gone into now in courts of law jurors were required to decide on evidence without previous study or examination they were required to know nothing of the subject until the evidence was laid before them for their immediate decision he thought that the heat of party would be augmented by delay  the speaker called mr lincoln to order as being irrelevant no mention had been made of party heat  mr drummond said he had only spoken of debate mr lincoln asked what caused the heat if it was not party mr lincoln concluded by urging that the question would be decided now better than hereafter and he thought with less heat and excitement  further debate in which lincoln participated     remarks in the illinois legislature  december 4 1840  in the illinois house of representatives december 4 1840 house in committee of the whole on the bill providing for payment of interest on the state debtmr lincoln moved to strike out the body and amendments of the bill and insert in lieu thereof an amendment which in substance was that the governor be authorized to issue bonds for the payment of the interest that these be called interest bonds that the taxes accruing on congress lands as they become taxable be irrevocably set aside and devoted as a fund to the payment of the interest bonds mr lincoln went into the reasons which appeared to him to render this plan preferable to that of hypothecating the state bonds by this course we could get along till the next meeting of the legislature which was of great importance to the objection which might be urged that these interest bonds could not be cashed he replied that if our other bonds could much more could these which offered a perfect security a fund being irrevocably set aside to provide for their redemption to another objection that we should be paying compound interest he would reply that the rapid growth and increase of our resources was in so great a ratio as to outstrip the difficulty that his object was to do the best that could be done in the present emergency all agreed that the faith of the state must be preserved this plan appeared to him preferable to a hypothecation of bonds which would have to be redeemed and the interest paid how this was to be done he could not see therefore he had after turning the matter over in every way devised this measure which would carry us on till the next legislature  mr lincoln spoke at some length advocating his measure  lincoln advocated his measure december 11 1840  december 12 1840 he had thought some permanent provision ought to be made for the bonds to be hypothecated but was satisfied taxation and revenue could not be connected with it now     1841     to john t stuarton depression  springfield jan 23 1841  dear stuart i am now the most miserable man living if what i feel were equally distributed to the whole human family there would not be one cheerful face on earth whether i shall ever be better i cannot tell i awfully forbode i shall not to remain as i am is impossible i must die or be better as it appears to me i fear i shall be unable to attend any business here and a change of scene might help me if i could be myself i would rather remain at home with judge logan i can write no more     remarks in the illinois legislature  january 23 1841  in the house of representatives january 23 1841 while discussing the continuation of the illinois and michigan canal mr moore was afraid the holders of the scrip would lose  mr napier thought there was no danger of that and mr lincoln said he had not examined to see what amount of scrip would probably be needed the principal point in his mind was this that nobody was obliged to take these certificates it is altogether voluntary on their part and if they apprehend it will fall in their hands they will not take it further the loss if any there be will fall on the citizens of that section of the country  this scrip is not going to circulate over an extensive range of country but will be confined chiefly to the vicinity of the canal now we find the representatives of that section of the country are all in favor of the bill  when we propose to protect their interests they say to us leave us to take care of ourselves we are willing to run the risk and this is reasonable we must suppose they are competent to protect their own interests and it is only fair to let them do it     circular from whig committee  february 9 1841  appeal to the people of the state of illinois  fellowcitizenswhen the general assembly now about adjourning assembled in november last from the bankrupt state of the public treasury the pecuniary embarrassments prevailing in every department of society the dilapidated state of the public works and the impending danger of the degradation of the state you had a right to expect that your representatives would lose no time in devising and adopting measures to avert threatened calamities alleviate the distresses of the people and allay the fearful apprehensions in regard to the future prosperity of the state it was not expected by you that the spirit of party would take the lead in the councils of the state and make every interest bend to its demands nor was it expected that any party would assume to itself the entire control of legislation and convert the means and offices of the state and the substance of the people into aliment for party subsistence neither could it have been expected by you that party spirit however strong its desires and unreasonable its demands would have passed the sanctuary of the constitution and entered with its unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the judiciary system  at the early period of the session measures were adopted by the dominant party to take possession of the state to fill all public offices with party men and make every measure affecting the interests of the people and the credit of the state operate in furtherance of their party views the merits of men and measures therefore became the subject of discussion in caucus instead of the halls of legislation and decisions there made by a minority of the legislature have been executed and carried into effect by the force of party discipline without any regard whatever to the rights of the people or the interests of the state the supreme court of the state was organized and judges appointed according to the provisions of the constitution in 1824 the people have never complained of the organization of that court no attempt has ever before been made to change that department respect for public opinion and regard for the rights and liberties of the people have hitherto restrained the spirit of party from attacks upon the independence and integrity of the judiciary the same judges have continued in office since 1824 their decisions have not been the subject of complaint among the people the integrity and honesty of the court have not been questioned and it has never been supposed that the court has ever permitted party prejudice or party considerations to operate upon their decisions the court was made to consist of four judges and by the constitution two form a quorum for the transaction of business with this tribunal thus constituted the people have been satisfied for near sixteen years the same law which organized the supreme court in 1824 also established and organized circuit courts to be held in each county in the state and five circuit judges were appointed to hold those courts in 1826 the legislature abolished these circuit courts repealed the judges out of office and required the judges of the supreme court to hold the circuit courts the reasons assigned for this change were first that the business of the country could be better attended to by the four judges of the supreme court than by the two sets of judges and second the state of the public treasury forbade the employment of unnecessary officers in 1828 a circuit was established north of the illinois river in order to meet the wants of the people and a circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that circuit  in 1834 the circuitcourt system was again established throughout the state circuit judges appointed to hold the courts and the judges of the supreme court were relieved from the performance of circuit court duties the change was recommended by the then acting governor of the state general w l d ewing in the following terms  the augmented population of the state the multiplied number of organized counties as well as the increase of business in all has long since convinced every one conversant with this department of our government of the indispensable necessity of an alteration in our judiciary system and the subject is therefore recommended to the earnest patriotic consideration of the legislature the present system has never been exempt from serious and weighty objections the idea of appealing from the circuit court to the same judges in the supreme court is recommended by little hopes of redress to the injured party below the duties of the circuit too it may be added consume one half of the year leaving a small and inadequate portion of time when that required for domestic purposes is deducted to erect in the decisions of the supreme court a judicial monument of legal learning and research which the talent and ability of the court might otherwise be entirely competent to  with this organization of circuit courts the people have never complained the only complaints which we have heard have come from circuits which were so large that the judges could not dispose of the business and the circuits in which judges pearson and ralston lately presided  whilst the honor and credit of the state demanded legislation upon the subject of the public debt the canal the unfinished public works and the embarrassments of the people the judiciary stood upon a basis which required no changeno legislative action yet the party in power neglecting every interest requiring legislative action and wholly disregarding the rights wishes and interests of the people has for the unholy purpose of providing places for its partisans and supplying them with large salaries disorganized that department of the government provision is made for the election of five party judges of the supreme court the proscription of four circuit judges and the appointment of party clerks in more than half the counties of the state men professing respect for public opinion and acknowledged to be leaders of the party have avowed in the halls of legislation that the change in the judiciary was intended to produce political results favorable to their party and party friends the immutable principles of justice are to make way for party interests and the bonds of social order are to be rent in twain in order that a desperate faction may be sustained at the expense of the people the change proposed in the judiciary was supported upon grounds so destructive to the institutions of the country and so entirely at war with the rights and liberties of the people that the party could not secure entire unanimity in its support three democrats of the senate and five of the house voting against the measure they were unwilling to see the temples of justice and the seats of independent judges occupied by the tools of faction the declarations of the party leaders the selection of party men for judges and the total disregard for the public will in the adoption of the measure prove conclusively that the object has been not reform but destruction not the advancement of the highest interests of the state but the predominance of party  we cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the objections to this party measure we present you with those stated by the council of revision upon returning the bill and we ask for them a candid consideration  believing that the independence of the judiciary has been destroyed that hereafter our courts will be independent of the people and entirely dependent upon the legislature that our rights of property and liberty of conscience can no longer be regarded as safe from the encroachments of unconstitutional legislation and knowing of no other remedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace and good order of society we call upon you to avail yourselves of the opportunity afforded and at the next general election vote for a convention of the people     s h little    e d baker    j j hardin    e b webs    a lincoln    j gillespie     committee on behalf of the whig members of the legislature     against the reorganization of the judiciary  extract from a protest in the illinois legislature  february 26 1841  for the reasons thus presented and for others no less apparent the undersigned cannot assent to the passage of the bill or permit it to become a law without this evidence of their disapprobation and they now protest against the reorganization of the judiciary because1 it violates the great principles of free government by subjecting the judiciary to the legislature 2 it is a fatal blow at the independence of the judges and the constitutional term of their office 3 it is a measure not asked for or wished for by the people 4 it will greatly increase the expense of our courts or else greatly diminish their utility 5 it will give our courts a political and partisan character thereby impairing public confidence in their decisions 6 it will impair our standing with other states and the world 7it is a party measure for party purposes from which no practical good to the people can possibly arise but which may be the source of immeasurable evils  the undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether unavailing with the majority of this body the blow has already fallen and we are compelled to stand by the mournful spectators of the ruin it will cause  signed by 35 members among whom was abraham lincoln     to joshua f speedmurder case  springfield june 19 1841  dear speedwe have had the highest state of excitement here for a week past that our community has ever witnessed and although the public feeling is somewhat allayed the curious affair which aroused it is very far from being even yet cleared of mystery it would take a quire of paper to give you anything like a full account of it and i therefore only propose a brief outline the chief personages in the drama are archibald fisher supposed to be murdered and archibald trailor henry trailor and william trailor supposed to have murdered him the three trailors are brothers the first arch as you know lives in town the second henry in clarys grove and the third william in warren county and fisher the supposed murdered being without a family had made his home with william on saturday evening being the 29th of may fisher and william came to henrys in a onehorse dearborn and there stayed over sunday and on monday all three came to springfield henry on horseback and joined archibald at myerss the dutch carpenter that evening at supper fisher was missing and so next morning some ineffectual search was made for him and on tuesday at one oclock pm william and henry started home without him in a day or two henry and one or two of his clarygrove neighbors came back for him again and advertised his disappearance in the papers the knowledge of the matter thus far had not been general and here it dropped entirely till about the 10th instant when keys received a letter from the postmaster in warren county that william had arrived at home and was telling a very mysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of fisher which induced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly keys made this letter public which immediately set the whole town and adjoining county agog and so it has continued until yesterday the mass of the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body while wickersham was despatched to arrest henry trailor at the grove and jim maxcy to warren to arrest william on monday last henry was brought in and showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew fisher to be dead and that arch and william had killed him he said he guessed the body could be found in spring creek between the beardstown road and hickoxs mill away the people swept like a herd of buffalo and cut down hickoxs milldam nolens volens to draw the water out of the pond and then went up and down and down and up the creek fishing and raking and raking and ducking and diving for two days and after all no dead body found  in the meantime a sort of scufflingground had been found in the brush in the angle or point where the road leading into the woods past the brewery and the one leading in past the brickyard meet from the scuffleground was the sign of something about the size of a man having been dragged to the edge of the thicket where it joined the track of some smallwheeled carriage drawn by one horse as shown by the roadtracks the carriagetrack led off toward spring creek near this dragtrail dr merryman found two hairs which after a long scientific examination he pronounced to be triangular human hairs which term he says includes within it the whiskers the hair growing under the arms and on other parts of the body and he judged that these two were of the whiskers because the ends were cut showing that they had flourished in the neighborhood of the razors operations on thursday last jim maxcy brought in william trailor from warren on the same day arch was arrested and put in jail yesterday friday william was put upon his examining trial before may and lovely archibald and henry were both present lamborn prosecuted and logan baker and your humble servant defended a great many witnesses were introduced and examined but i shall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important the first of these was captain ransdell he swore that when william and henry left springfield for home on tuesday before mentioned they did not take the direct routewhich you know leads by the butcher shopbut that they followed the street north until they got opposite or nearly opposite mays new house after which he could not see them from where he stood and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they started they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the brickyard dr merryman and others swore to what is stated about the scuffleground dragtrail whiskers and carriage tracks henry was then introduced by the prosecution he swore that when they started for home they went out north as ransdell stated and turned down west by the brickyard into the woods and there met archibald that they proceeded a small distance farther when he was placed as a sentinel to watch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that way that william and arch took the dearborn out of the road a small distance to the edge of the thicket where they stopped and he saw them lift the body of a man into it that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of hickoxs mill and he loitered about for something like an hour when william returned with the carriage but without arch and said they had put him in a safe place that they went somehow he did not know exactly howinto the road close to the brewery and proceeded on to clarys grove he also stated that some time during the day william told him that he and arch had killed fisher the evening before that the way they did it was by him william knocking him down with a club and arch then choking him to death  an old man from warren called dr gilmore was then introduced on the part of the defense he swore that he had known fisher for several years that fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two different spellsonce while he built a barn for him and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease that two or three years ago fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun since which he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional aberration of mind he also stated that on last tuesday being the same day that maxcy arrested william trailor he the doctor was from home in the early part of the day and on his return about eleven oclock found fisher at his house in bed and apparently very unwell that he asked him how he came from springfield that fisher said he had come by peoria and also told of several other places he had been at more in the direction of peoria which showed that he at the time of speaking did not know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement he further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of trailors friends advising him of his arrest and requesting him to go on to springfield as a witness to testify as to the state of fishers health in former times that he immediately set off calling up two of his neighbors as company and riding all evening and all night overtook maxcy and william at lewiston in fulton county that maxcy refusing to discharge trailor upon his statement his two neighbors returned and he came on to springfield some question being made as to whether the doctors story was not a fabrication several acquaintances of his among whom was the same postmaster who wrote keys as before mentioned were introduced as sort of compurgators who swore that they knew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity and generally of good character in every way  here the testimony ended and the trailors were discharged arch and william expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that fisher would be found alive at the doctors by galloway mallory and myers who a day before had been despatched for that purpose which henry still protested that no power on earth could ever show fisher alive thus stands this curious affair when the doctors story was first made public it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances and hear the remarks of those who had been actively in search for the dead body some looked quizzical some melancholy and some furiously angry porter who had been very active swore he always knew the man was not dead and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt for him langford who had taken the lead in cutting down hickoxs milldam and wanted to hang hickox for objecting looked most awfully woebegone he seemed the victim of unrequited affection as represented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over and hart the little drayman that hauled molly home once said it was too damned bad to have so much trouble and no hanging after all  i commenced this letter on yesterday since which i received yours of the 13th i stick to my promise to come to louisville nothing new here except what i have written i have not seen  since my last trip and i am going out there as soon as i mail this letter  yours forever lincoln     statement about harry wilton  june 25 1841  it having been charged in some of the public prints that harry wilton late united states marshal for the district of illinois had used his office for political effect in the appointment of deputies for the taking of the census for the year 1840 we the undersigned were called upon by mr wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative to these appointments and to ascertain therefrom the correctness or incorrectness of such charge we accompanied mr wilton to a room and examined the matter as fully as we could with the means afforded us the only sources of information bearing on the subject which were submitted to us were the letters etc recommending and opposing the various appointments made and mr wiltons verbal statements concerning the same from these letters etc it appears that in some instances appointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leading whigs and in opposition to those of leading democrats among which instances the appointments at scott wayne madison and lawrence are the strongest according to mr wiltons statement of the seventysix appointments we examined fiftyfour were of democrats eleven of whigs and eleven of unknown politics  the chief ground of complaint against mr wilton as we had understood it was because of his appointment of so many democratic candidates for the legislature thus giving them a decided advantage over their whig opponents and consequently our attention was directed rather particularly to that point we found that there were many such appointments among which were those in tazewell mclean iroquois coles menard wayne washington fayette etc and we did not learn that there was one instance in which a whig candidate for the legislature had been appointed there was no written evidence before us showing us at what time those appointments were made but mr wilton stated that they all with one exception were made before those appointed became candidates for the legislature and the letters etc recommending them all bear date before and most of them long before those appointed were publicly announced candidates  we give the foregoing naked facts and draw no conclusions from them  bend s edwards a lincoln     to miss mary speedpractical slavery  bloomington ill september 27 1841  miss mary speed louisville ky  my friend by the way a fine example was presented on board the boat for contemplating the effect of condition upon human happiness a gentleman had purchased twelve negroes in different parts of kentucky and was taking them to a farm in the south they were chained six and six together a small iron clevis was around the left wrist of each and this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one at a convenient distance from the others so that the negroes were strung together precisely like so many fish upon a trotline in this condition they were being separated forever from the scenes of their childhood their friends their fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters and many of them from their wives and children and going into perpetual slavery where the lash of the master is proverbially more ruthless and unrelenting than any other and yet amid all these distressing circumstances as we would think them they were the most cheerful and apparently happy creatures on board one whose offence for which he had been sold was an overfondness for his wife played the fiddle almost continually and the others danced sang cracked jokes and played various games with cards from day to day how true it is that god tempers the wind to the shorn lamb or in other words that he renders the worst of human conditions tolerable while he permits the best to be nothing better than tolerable to return to the narrative when we reached springfield i stayed but one day when i started on this tedious circuit where i now am do you remember my going to the city while i was in kentucky to have a tooth extracted and making a failure of it well that same old tooth got to paining me so much that about a week since i had it torn out bringing with it a bit of the jawbone the consequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that i can neither talk nor eat  your sincere friend a lincoln     1842     to joshua f speedon marriage  january 30 1842  my dear speedfeeling as you know i do the deepest solicitude for the success of the enterprise you are engaged in i adopt this as the last method i can adopt to aid you in case which god forbid you shall need any aid i do not place what i am going to say on paper because i can say it better that way than i could by word of mouth but were i to say it orally before we part most likely you would forget it at the very time when it might do you some good as i think it reasonable that you will feel very badly some time between this and the final consummation of your purpose it is intended that you shall read this just at such a time why i say it is reasonable that you will feel very badly yet is because of three special causes added to the general one which i shall mention  the general cause is that you are naturally of a nervous temperament and this i say from what i have seen of you personally and what you have told me concerning your mother at various times and concerning your brother william at the time his wife died the first special cause is your exposure to bad weather on your journey which my experience clearly proves to be very severe on defective nerves the second is the absence of all business and conversation of friends which might divert your mind give it occasional rest from the intensity of thought which will sometimes wear the sweetest idea threadbare and turn it to the bitterness of death the third is the rapid and near approach of that crisis on which all your thoughts and feelings concentrate  if from all these causes you shall escape and go through triumphantly without another twinge of the soul i shall be most happily but most egregiously deceived if on the contrary you shall as i expect you will at sometime be agonized and distressed let me who have some reason to speak with judgment on such a subject beseech you to ascribe it to the causes i have mentioned and not to some false and ruinous suggestion of the devil  but you will say do not your causes apply to every one engaged in a like undertaking by no means the particular causes to a greater or less extent perhaps do apply in all cases but the general onenervous debility which is the key and conductor of all the particular ones and without which they would be utterly harmlessthough it does pertain to you does not pertain to one in a thousand it is out of this that the painful difference between you and the mass of the world springs  i know what the painful point with you is at all times when you are unhappy it is an apprehension that you do not love her as you should what nonsense how came you to court her was it because you thought she deserved it and that you had given her reason to expect it if it was for that why did not the same reason make you court ann todd and at least twenty others of whom you can think and to whom it would apply with greater force than to her did you court her for her wealth why you know she had none but you say you reasoned yourself into it what do you mean by that was it not that you found yourself unable to reason yourself out of it did you not think and partly form the purpose of courting her the first time you ever saw her or heard of her what had reason to do with it at that early stage there was nothing at that time for reason to work upon whether she was moral amiable sensible or even of good character you did not nor could then know except perhaps you might infer the last from the company you found her in  all you then did or could know of her was her personal appearance and deportment and these if they impress at all impress the heart and not the head  say candidly were not those heavenly black eyes the whole basis of all your early reasoning on the subject after you and i had once been at the residence did you not go and take me all the way to lexington and back for no other purpose but to get to see her again on our return on that evening to take a trip for that express object what earthly consideration would you take to find her scouting and despising you and giving herself up to another but of this you have no apprehension and therefore you cannot bring it home to your feelings  i shall be so anxious about you that i shall want you to write by every mail  your friend lincoln     to joshua f speed  springfield illinois february 3 1842  dear speedyour letter of the 25th january came to hand today you well know that i do not feel my own sorrows much more keenly than i do yours when i know of them and yet i assure you i was not much hurt by what you wrote me of your excessively bad feeling at the time you wrote not that i am less capable of sympathizing with you now than ever not that i am less your friend than ever but because i hope and believe that your present anxiety and distress about her health and her life must and will forever banish those horrid doubts which i know you sometimes felt as to the truth of your affection for her if they can once and forever be removed and i almost feel a presentiment that the almighty has sent your present affliction expressly for that object surely nothing can come in their stead to fill their immeasurable measure of misery the deathscenes of those we love are surely painful enough but these we are prepared for and expect to see they happen to all and all know they must happen painful as they are they are not an unlooked for sorrow should she as you fear be destined to an early grave it is indeed a great consolation to know that she is so well prepared to meet it her religion which you once disliked so much i will venture you now prize most highly but i hope your melancholy bodings as to her early death are not well founded i even hope that ere this reaches you she will have returned with improved and still improving health and that you will have met her and forgotten the sorrows of the past in the enjoyments of the present i would say more if i could but it seems that i have said enough it really appears to me that you yourself ought to rejoice and not sorrow at this indubitable evidence of your undying affection for her why speed if you did not love her although you might not wish her death you would most certainly be resigned to it perhaps this point is no longer a question with you and my pertinacious dwelling upon it is a rude intrusion upon your feelings if so you must pardon me you know the hell i have suffered on that point and how tender i am upon it you know i do not mean wrong i have been quite clear of hypo since you left even better than i was along in the fall i have seen  but once she seemed very cheerful and so i said nothing to her about what we spoke of  old uncle billy herndon is dead and it is said this evening that uncle ben ferguson will not live this i believe is all the news and enough at that unless it were better write me immediately on the receipt of this  your friend as ever lincoln     to joshua f speedon depression  springfield illinois february 13 1842  dear speedyours of the 1st instant came to hand three or four days ago when this shall reach you you will have been fannys husband several days you know my desire to befriend you is everlasting that i will never cease while i know how to do anything but you will always hereafter be on ground that i have never occupied and consequently if advice were needed i might advise wrong i do fondly hope however that you will never again need any comfort from abroad but should i be mistaken in this should excessive pleasure still be accompanied with a painful counterpart at times still let me urge you as i have ever done to remember in the depth and even agony of despondency that very shortly you are to feel well again i am now fully convinced that you love her as ardently as you are capable of loving your ever being happy in her presence and your intense anxiety about her health if there were nothing else would place this beyond all dispute in my mind i incline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally for a while but once you get them firmly guarded now that trouble is over forever i think if i were you in case my mind were not exactly right i would avoid being idle i would immediately engage in some business or go to making preparations for it which would be the same thing if you went through the ceremony calmly or even with sufficient composure not to excite alarm in any present you are safe beyond question and in two or three months to say the most will be the happiest of men  i would desire you to give my particular respects to fanny but perhaps you will not wish her to know you have received this lest she should desire to see it make her write me an answer to my last letter to her at any rate i would set great value upon a note or letter from her write me whenever you have leisure yours forever a lincoln p si have been quite a man since you left     to g b sheledy  springfield ill feb 16 1842  g b sheledy esq  yours of the 10th is duly received judge logan and myself are doing business together now and we are willing to attend to your cases as you propose as to the terms we are willing to attend each case you prepare and send us for 10 when there shall be no opposition to be sent in advance or you to know that it is safe it takes 575 of cost to start upon that is 175 to clerk and 2 to each of two publishers of papers judge logan thinks it will take the balance of 20 to carry a case through this must be advanced from time to time as the services are performed as the officers will not act without i do not know whether you can be admitted an attorney of the federal court in your absence or not nor is it material as the business can be done in our names  thinking it may aid you a little i send you one of our blank forms of petitions it you will see is framed to be sworn to before the federal court clerk and in your cases will have to be so far changed as to be sworn to before the clerk of your circuit court and his certificate must be accompanied with his official seal the schedules too must be attended to be sure that they contain the creditors names their residences the amounts due each the debtors names their residences and the amounts they owe also all property and where located  also be sure that the schedules are all signed by the applicants as well as the petition publication will have to be made here in one paper and in one nearest the residence of the applicant write us in each case where the last advertisement is to be sent whether to you or to what paper  i believe i have now said everything that can be of any advantage your friend as ever a lincoln     to george e pickettadvice to youth  february 22 1842  i never encourage deceit and falsehood especially if you have got a bad memory is the worst enemy a fellow can have the fact is truth is your truest friend no matter what the circumstances are notwithstanding this copybook preamble my boy i am inclined to suggest a little prudence on your part you see i have a congenital aversion to failure and the sudden announcement to your uncle andrew of the success of your lamp rubbing might possibly prevent your passing the severe physical examination to which you will be subjected in order to enter the military academy you see i should like to have a perfect soldier credited to dear old illinoisno broken bones scalp wounds etc so i think it might be wise to hand this letter from me in to your good uncle through his roomwindow after he has had a comfortable dinner and watch its effect from the top of the pigeonhouse  i have just told the folks here in springfield on this 111th anniversary of the birth of him whose name mightiest in the cause of civil liberty still mightiest in the cause of moral reformation we mention in solemn awe in naked deathless splendor that the one victory we can ever call complete will be that one which proclaims that there is not one slave or one drunkard on the face of gods green earth recruit for this victory  now boy on your march dont you go and forget the old maxim that one drop of honey catches more flies than a halfgallon of gall load your musket with this maxim and smoke it in your pipe     address before the springfield washingtonian temperance society  february 22 1842  although the temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty years it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a degree of success hitherto unparalleled  the list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties of hundreds and of thousands the cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract theory to a living breathing active and powerful chieftain going forth conquering and to conquer the citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled his temple and his altars where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made are daily desecrated and deserted the triumph of the conquerors fame is sounding from hill to hill from sea to sea and from land to land and calling millions to his standard at a blast  for this new and splendid success we heartily rejoice that that success is so much greater now than heretofore is doubtless owing to rational causes and if we would have it continue we shall do well to inquire what those causes are  the warfare heretofore waged against the demon intemperance has somehow or other been erroneous either the champions engaged or the tactics they adopted have not been the most proper these champions for the most part have been preachers lawyers and hired agents between these and the mass of mankind there is a want of approachability if the term be admissible partially at least fatal to their success they are supposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest with those very persons whom it is their object to convince and persuade  and again it is so common and so easy to ascribe motives to men of these classes other than those they profess to act upon the preacher it is said advocates temperance because he is a fanatic and desires a union of the church and state the lawyer from his pride and vanity of hearing himself speak and the hired agent for his salary but when one who has long been known as a victim of intemperance bursts the fetters that have bound him and appears before his neighbors clothed and in his right mind a redeemed specimen of longlost humanity and stands up with tears of joy trembling in his eyes to tell of the miseries once endured now to be endured no more forever of his once naked and starving children now clad and fed comfortably of a wife long weighed down with woe weeping and a broken heart now restored to health happiness and a renewed affection and how easily it is all done once it is resolved to be done how simple his language there is a logic and an eloquence in it that few with human feelings can resist they cannot say that he desires a union of church and state for he is not a church member they cannot say he is vain of hearing himself speak for his whole demeanor shows he would gladly avoid speaking at all they cannot say he speaks for pay for he receives none and asks for none nor can his sincerity in any way be doubted or his sympathy for those he would persuade to imitate his example be denied  in my judgment it is to the battles of this new class of champions that our late success is greatly perhaps chiefly owing but had the oldschool champions themselves been of the most wise selecting was their system of tactics the most judicious it seems to me it was not too much denunciation against dramsellers and dramdrinkers was indulged in this i think was both impolitic and unjust it was impolitic because it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to anything still less to be driven about that which is exclusively his own business and least of all where such driving is to be submitted to at the expense of pecuniary interest or burning appetite when the dramseller and drinker were incessantly told not in accents of entreaty and persuasion diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation with which the lordly judge often groups together all the crimes of the felons life and thrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him that they were the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land that they were the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers that infest the earth that their houses were the workshops of the devil and that their persons should be shunned by all the good and virtuous as moral pestilencesi say when they were told all this and in this way it is not wonderful that they were slow to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations and to join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against themselves  to have expected them to do otherwise than they did to have expected them not to meet denunciation with denunciation crimination with crimination and anathema with anathemawas to expect a reversal of human nature which is gods decree and can never be reversed  when the conduct of men is designed to be influenced persuasion kind unassuming persuasion should ever be adopted it is an old and a true maxim that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall so with men if you would win a man to your cause first convince him that you are his sincere friend therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart which say what he will is the great highroad to his reason and which when once gained you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause if indeed that cause really be a just one on the contrary assume to dictate to his judgment or to command his action or to mark him as one to be shunned and despised and he will retreat within himself close all the avenues to his head and his heart and though your cause be naked truth itself transformed to the heaviest lance harder than steel and sharper than steel can be made and though you throw it with more than herculean force and precision you shall be no more able to pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw such is man and so must he be understood by those who would lead him even to his own best interests  on this point the washingtonians greatly excel the temperance advocates of former times those whom they desire to convince and persuade are their old friends and companions they know they are not demons nor even the worst of men they know that generally they are kind generous and charitable even beyond the example of their more staid and sober neighbors they are practical philanthropists and they glow with a generous and brotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling benevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely and out of the abundance of their hearts their tongues give utterance love through all their actions runs and all their words are mild in this spirit they speak and act and in the same they are heard and regarded and when such is the temper of the advocate and such of the audience no good cause can be unsuccessful but i have said that denunciations against dramsellers and dramdrinkers are unjust as well as impolitic let us see i have not inquired at what period of time the use of intoxicating liquors commenced nor is it important to know it is sufficient that to all of us who now inhabit the world the practice of drinking them is just as old as the world itself that is we have seen the one just as long as we have seen the other when all such of us as have now reached the years of maturity first opened our eyes upon the stage of existence we found intoxicating liquor recognized by everybody used by everybody repudiated by nobody it commonly entered into the first draught of the infant and the last draught of the dying man from the sideboard of the parson down to the ragged pocket of the houseless loafer it was constantly found physicians proscribed it in this that and the other disease government provided it for soldiers and sailors and to have a rolling or raising a husking or hoedown anywhere about without it was positively insufferable so too it was everywhere a respectable article of manufacture and merchandise the making of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood and he who could make most was the most enterprising and respectable large and small manufactories of it were everywhere erected in which all the earthly goods of their owners were invested wagons drew it from town to town boats bore it from clime to clime and the winds wafted it from nation to nation and merchants bought and sold it by wholesale and retail with precisely the same feelings on the part of the seller buyer and bystander as are felt at the selling and buying of ploughs beef bacon or any other of the real necessaries of life universal public opinion not only tolerated but recognized and adopted its use  it is true that even then it was known and acknowledged that many were greatly injured by it but none seemed to think the injury arose from the use of a bad thing but from the abuse of a very good thing the victims of it were to be pitied and compassionated just as are the heirs of consumption and other hereditary diseases their failing was treated as a misfortune and not as a crime or even as a disgrace if then what i have been saying is true is it wonderful that some should think and act now as all thought and acted twenty years ago and is it just to assail condemn or despise them for doing so the universal sense of mankind on any subject is an argument or at least an influence not easily overcome the success of the argument in favor of the existence of an overruling providence mainly depends upon that sense and men ought not in justice to be denounced for yielding to it in any case or giving it up slowly especially when they are backed by interest fixed habits or burning appetites  another error as it seems to me into which the old reformers fell was the position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible and therefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that the grace of temperance might abound to the temperate then and to all mankind some hundreds of years thereafter there is in this some thing so repugnant to humanity so uncharitable so coldblooded and feelingless that it never did nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular cause we could not love the man who taught it we could not hear him with patience the heart could not throw open its portals to it the generous man could not adopt itit could not mix with his blood it looked so fiendishly selfish so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard to lighten the boat for our security that the nobleminded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing and besides this the benefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too remote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf few can be induced to labor exclusively for posterity and none will do it enthusiastically posterity has done nothing for us and theorize on it as we may practically we shall do very little for it unless we are made to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves  what an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit to ask or to expect a whole community to rise up and labor for the temporal happiness of others after themselves shall be consigned to the dust a majority of which community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal welfare at no more distant day great distance in either time or space has wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind pleasures to be enjoyed or pains to be endured after we shall be dead and gone are but little regarded even in our own cases and much less in the cases of others still in addition to this there is something so ludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to render the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned into ridicule better lay down that spade you are stealing paddy if you dont youll pay for it at the day of judgment be the powers if yell credit me so long ill take another jist  by the washingtonians this system of consigning the habitual drunkard to hopeless ruin is repudiated they adopt a more enlarged philanthropy they go for present as well as future good they labor for all now living as well as hereafter to live they teach hope to alldespair to none as applying to their cause they deny the doctrine of unpardonable sin as in christianity it is taught so in this they teachwhilewhile the lamp holds out to burn the vilest sinner may return and what is a matter of more profound congratulation they by experiment upon experiment and example upon example prove the maxim to be no less true in the one case than in the other on every hand we behold those who but yesterday were the chief of sinners now the chief apostles of the cause drunken devils are cast out by ones by sevens by legions and their unfortunate victims like the poor possessed who were redeemed from their long and lonely wanderings in the tombs are publishing to the ends of the earth how great things have been done for them  to these new champions and this new system of tactics our late success is mainly owing and to them we must mainly look for the final consummation the ball is now rolling gloriously on and none are so able as they to increase its speed and its bulk to add to its momentum and its magnitudeeven though unlearned in letters for this task none are so well educated to fit them for this work they have been taught in the true school they have been in that gulf from which they would teach others the means of escape they have passed that prison wall which others have long declared impassable and who that has not shall dare to weigh opinions with them as to the mode of passing  but if it be true as i have insisted that those who have suffered by intemperance personally and have reformed are the most powerful and efficient instruments to push the reformation to ultimate success it does not follow that those who have not suffered have no part left them to perform whether or not the world would be vastly benefited by a total and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks seems to me not now an open question three fourths of mankind confess the affirmative with their tongues and i believe all the rest acknowledge it in their hearts  ought any then to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the whole demands shall he who cannot do much be for that reason excused if he do nothing but says one what good can i do by signing the pledge i never drank even without signing this question has already been asked and answered more than a million of times let it be answered once more for the man suddenly or in any other way to break off from the use of drams who has indulged in them for a long course of years and until his appetite for them has grown ten or a hundredfold stronger and more craving than any natural appetite can be requires a most powerful moral effort in such an undertaking he needs every moral support and influence that can possibly be brought to his aid and thrown around him and not only so but every moral prop should be taken from whatever argument might rise in his mind to lure him to his backsliding when he casts his eyes around him he should be able to see all that he respects all that he admires all that he loves kindly and anxiously pointing him onward and none beckoning him back to his former miserable wallowing in the mire  but it is said by some that men will think and act for themselves that none will disuse spirits or anything else because his neighbors do and that moral influence is not that powerful engine contended for let us examine this let me ask the man who could maintain this position most stiffly what compensation he will accept to go to church some sunday and sit during the sermon with his wifes bonnet upon his head not a trifle ill venture and why not there would be nothing irreligious in it nothing immoral nothing uncomfortablethen why not is it not because there would be something egregiously unfashionable in it then it is the influence of fashion and what is the influence of fashion but the influence that other peoples actions have on our actionsthe strong inclination each of us feels to do as we see all our neighbors do nor is the influence of fashion confined to any particular thing or class of things it is just as strong on one subject as another let us make it as unfashionable to withhold our names from the temperance cause as for husbands to wear their wives bonnets to church and instances will be just as rare in the one case as the other  but say some we are no drunkards and we shall not acknowledge ourselves such by joining a reformed drunkards society whatever our influence might be surely no christian will adhere to this objection if they believe as they profess that omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man and as such to die an ignominious death for their sakes surely they will not refuse submission to the infinitely lesser condescension for the temporal and perhaps eternal salvation of a large erring and unfortunate class of their fellowcreatures nor is the condescension very great in my judgment such of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more by the absence of appetite than from any mental or moral superiority over those who have indeed i believe if we take habitual drunkards as a class their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class there seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant and warmblooded to fall into this vicethe demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius and of generosity what one of us but can call to mind some relative more promising in youth than all his fellows who has fallen a sacrifice to his rapacity he ever seems to have gone forth like the egyptian angel of death commissioned to slay if not the first the fairest born of every family shall he now be arrested in his desolating career in that arrest all can give aid that will and who shall be excused that can and will not far around as human breath has ever blown he keeps our fathers our brothers our sons and our friends prostrate in the chains of moral death to all the living everywhere we cry come sound the moral trump that these may rise and stand up an exceeding great army come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live if the relative grandeur of revolutions shall be estimated by the great amount of human misery they alleviate and the small amount they inflict then indeed will this be the grandest the world shall ever have seen  of our political revolution of 76 we are all justly proud it has given us a degree of political freedom far exceeding that of any other nation of the earth in it the world has found a solution of the longmooted problem as to the capability of man to govern himself in it was the germ which has vegetated and still is to grow and expand into the universal liberty of mankind but with all these glorious results past present and to come it had its evils too it breathed forth famine swam in blood and rode in fire and long long after the orphans cry and the widows wail continued to break the sad silence that ensued these were the price the inevitable price paid for the blessings it bought  turn now to the temperance revolution in it we shall find a stronger bondage broken a viler slavery manumitted a greater tyrant deposed in it more of want supplied more disease healed more sorrow assuaged by it no orphans starving no widows weeping by it none wounded in feeling none injured in interest even the drammaker and dramseller will have glided into other occupations so gradually as never to have felt the change and will stand ready to join all others in the universal song of gladness and what a noble ally this to the cause of political freedom with such an aid its march cannot fail to be on and on till every son of earth shall drink in rich fruition the sorrowquenching draughts of perfect liberty happy day whenall appetites controlled all poisons subdued all matter subjectedmind allconquering mind shall live and move the monarch of the world glorious consummation hail fall of fury reign of reason all hail  and when the victory shall be complete when there shall be neither a slave nor a drunkard on the earth how proud the title of that land which may truly claim to be the birthplace and the cradle of both those revolutions that shall have ended in that victory how nobly distinguished that people who shall have planted and nurtured to maturity both the political and moral freedom of their species  this is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birthday of washington we are met to celebrate this day washington is the mightiest name of earth long since mightiest in the cause of civil liberty still mightiest in moral reformation on that name no eulogy is expected it cannot be to add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of washington is alike impossible let none attempt it in solemn awe pronounce the name and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on     to joshua f speed  springfield february 25 1842  dear speedyours of the 16th instant announcing that miss fanny and you are no more twain but one flesh reached me this morning i have no way of telling you how much happiness i wish you both though i believe you both can conceive it i feel somewhat jealous of both of you now you will be so exclusively concerned for one another that i shall be forgotten entirely my acquaintance with miss fanny i call her this lest you should think i am speaking of your mother was too short for me to reasonably hope to long be remembered by her and still i am sure i shall not forget her soon try if you cannot remind her of that debt she owes meand be sure you do not interfere to prevent her paying it  i regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to illinois i shall be very lonesome without you how miserably things seem to be arranged in this world if we have no friends we have no pleasure and if we have them we are sure to lose them and be doubly pained by the loss i did hope she and you would make your home here but i own i have no right to insist you owe obligations to her ten thousand times more sacred than you can owe to others and in that light let them be respected and observed it is natural that she should desire to remain with her relatives and friends as to friends however she could not need them anywhere she would have them in abundance here  give my kind remembrance to mr williamson and his family particularly miss elizabeth also to your mother brother and sisters ask little eliza davis if she will ride to town with me if i come there again and finally give fanny a double reciprocation of all the love she sent me write me often and believe me  yours forever lincoln  p s poor easthouse is gone at last he died awhile before day this morning they say he was very loath to die  l     to joshua f speedon marriage concerns  springfield february 251842  dear speedi received yours of the 12th written the day you went down to williams place some days since but delayed answering it till i should receive the promised one of the 16th which came last night i opened the letter with intense anxiety and trepidation so much so that although it turned out better than i expected i have hardly yet at a distance of ten hours become calm  i tell you speed our forebodings for which you and i are peculiar are all the worst sort of nonsense i fancied from the time i received your letter of saturday that the one of wednesday was never to come and yet it did come and what is more it is perfectly clear both from its tone and handwriting that you were much happier or if you think the term preferable less miserable when you wrote it than when you wrote the last one before you had so obviously improved at the very time i so much fancied you would have grown worse you say that something indescribably horrible and alarming still haunts you you will not say that three months from now i will venture when your nerves once get steady now the whole trouble will be over forever nor should you become impatient at their being even very slow in becoming steady again you say you much fear that that elysium of which you have dreamed so much is never to be realized well if it shall not i dare swear it will not be the fault of her who is now your wife i now have no doubt that it is the peculiar misfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of elysium far exceeding all that anything earthly can realize far short of your dreams as you may be no woman could do more to realize them than that same blackeyed fanny if you could but contemplate her through my imagination it would appear ridiculous to you that any one should for a moment think of being unhappy with her my old father used to have a saying that if you make a bad bargain hug it all the tighter and it occurs to me that if the bargain you have just closed can possibly be called a bad one it is certainly the most pleasant one for applying that maxim to which my fancy can by any effort picture  i write another letter enclosing this which you can show her if she desires it i do this because she would think strangely perhaps should you tell her that you received no letters from me or telling her you do refuse to let her see them i close this entertaining the confident hope that every successive letter i shall have from you which i here pray may not be few nor far between may show you possessing a more steady hand and cheerful heart than the last preceding it as ever your friend lincoln     to joshua f speed  springfield march 27 1842  dear speedyours of the 10th instant was received three or four days since you know i am sincere when i tell you the pleasure its contents gave me was and is inexpressible as to your farm matter i have no sympathy with you i have no farm nor ever expect to have and consequently have not studied the subject enough to be much interested with it i can only say that i am glad you are satisfied and pleased with it but on that other subject to me of the most intense interest whether in joy or sorrow i never had the power to withhold my sympathy from you it cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you say you are far happier than you ever expected to be that much i know is enough i know you too well to suppose your expectations were not at least sometimes extravagant and if the reality exceeds them all i say enough dear lord i am not going beyond the truth when i tell you that the short space it took me to read your last letter gave me more pleasure than the total sum of all i have enjoyed since the fatal 1st of january 1841 since then it seems to me i should have been entirely happy but for the neverabsent idea that there is one still unhappy whom i have contributed to make so that still kills my soul i cannot but reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise she accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to jacksonville last monday and on her return spoke so that i heard of it of having enjoyed the trip exceedingly god be praised for that  you know with what sleepless vigilance i have watched you ever since the commencement of your affair and although i am almost confident it is useless i cannot forbear once more to say that i think it is even yet possible for your spirits to flag down and leave you miserable if they should dont fail to remember that they cannot long remain so one thing i can tell you which i know you will be glad to hear and that is that i have seenand scrutinized her feelings as well as i could and am fully convinced she is far happier now than she has been for the last fifteen months past  you will see by the last sangamon journal that i made a temperance speech on the 22d of february which i claim that fanny and you shall read as an act of charity to me for i cannot learn that anybody else has read it or is likely to fortunately it is not very long and i shall deem it a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you listens while the other reads it  as to your lockridge matter it is only necessary to say that there has been no court since you left and that the next commences tomorrow morning during which i suppose we cannot fail to get a judgment  i wish you would learn of everett what he would take over and above a discharge for all the trouble we have been at to take his business out of our hands and give it to somebody else it is impossible to collect money on that or any other claim here now and although you know i am not a very petulant man i declare i am almost out of patience with mr everetts importunity it seems like he not only writes all the letters he can himself but gets everybody else in louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to us about his claim i have always said that mr everett is a very clever fellow and i am very sorry he cannot be obliged but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to collect his claim and therefore would do it if we could  i am neither joking nor in a pet when i say we would thank him to transfer his business to some other without any compensation for what we have done provided he will see the court cost paid for which we are security  the sweet violet you inclosed came safely to hand but it was so dry and mashed so flat that it crumbled to dust at the first attempt to handle it the juice that mashed out of it stained a place in the letter which i mean to preserve and cherish for the sake of her who procured it to be sent my renewed good wishes to her in particular and generally to all such of your relations who know me  as ever  lincoln     to joshua f speed  springfield illinois july 4 1842  dear speedyours of the 16th june was received only a day or two since it was not mailed at louisville till the 25th you speak of the great time that has elapsed since i wrote you let me explain that your letter reached here a day or two after i started on the circuit i was gone five or six weeks so that i got the letters only a few weeks before butler started to your country i thought it scarcely worth while to write you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail on his return he told me you would write me soon and so i waited for your letter as to my having been displeased with your advice surely you know better than that i know you do and therefore will not labor to convince you true that subject is painful to me but it is not your silence or the silence of all the world that can make me forget it i acknowledge the correctness of your advice too but before i resolve to do the one thing or the other i must gain my confidence in my own ability to keep my resolves when they are made in that ability you know i once prided myself as the only or chief gem of my character that gem i losthow and where you know too well i have not yet regained it and until i do i cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance i believe now that had you understood my case at the time as well as i understand yours afterward by the aid you would have given me i should have sailed through clear but that does not now afford me sufficient confidence to begin that or the like of that again  you make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to me for your present happiness i am pleased with that acknowledgment but a thousand times more am i pleased to know that you enjoy a degree of happiness worthy of an acknowledgment the truth is i am not sure that there was any merit with me in the part i took in your difficulty i was drawn to it by a fate if i would i could not have done less than i did i always was superstitious i believe god made me one of the instruments of bringing your fanny and you together which union i have no doubt he had foreordained whatever he designs he will do for me yet stand still and see the salvation of the lord is my text just now if as you say you have told fanny all i should have no objection to her seeing this letter but for its reference to our friend here let her seeing it depend upon whether she has ever known anything of my affairs and if she has not do not let her  i do not think i can come to kentucky this season i am so poor and make so little headway in the world that i drop back in a month of idleness as much as i gain in a years sowing i should like to visit you again i should like to see that sis of yours that was absent when i was there though i suppose she would run away again if she were to hear i was coming  my respects and esteem to all your friends there and by your permission my love to your fanny  ever yours  lincoln     a letter from the lost townships  article written by lincoln for the sangamon journal in ridicule of james shields who as state auditor had declined to receive state bank notes in payment of taxes the above letter purported to come from a poor widow who though supplied with state bank paper could not obtain a receipt for her tax bill this and another subsequent letter by mary todd brought about the lincolnshields duel     lost townships  august 27 1842  dear mr printer  i see you printed that long letter i sent you a spell ago i m quite encouraged by it and cant keep from writing again i think the printing of my letters will be a good thing all roundit will give me the benefit of being known by the world and give the world the advantage of knowing whats going on in the lost townships and give your paper respectability besides so here comes another yesterday afternoon i hurried through cleaning up the dinner dishes and stepped over to neighbor s to see if his wife peggy was as well as mout be expected and hear what they called the baby well when i got there and just turned round the corner of his log cabin there he was setting on the doorstep reading a newspaper how are you jeff says i he sorter started when he heard me for he hadnt seen me before why says he i m mad as the devil aunt becca what about says i aint its hair the right color none of that nonsense jeff there aint an honester woman in the lost townships thanthan who says he what the mischief are you about i began to see i was running the wrong trail and so says i oh nothing i guess i was mistaken a little thats all but what is it you re mad about  why says he ive been tugging ever since harvest getting out wheat and hauling it to the river to raise state bank paper enough to pay my tax this year and a little school debt i owe and now just as i ve got it here i open this infernal extra register expecting to find it full of glorious democratic victories and high combd cocks when lo and behold i find a set of fellows calling themselves officers of the state have forbidden the tax collectors and school commissioners to receive state paper at all and so here it is dead on my hands i dont now believe all the plunder ive got will fetch ready cash enough to pay my taxes and that school debt  i was a good deal thunderstruck myself for that was the first i had heard of the proclamation and my old man was pretty much in the same fix with jeff we both stood a moment staring at one another without knowing what to say at last says i mr s let me look at that paper he handed it to me when i read the proclamation over  there now says he did you ever see such a piece of impudence and imposition as that i saw jeff was in a good tune for saying some illnatured things and so i thot i would just argue a little on the contrary side and make him rant a spell if i could why says i looking as dignified and thoughtful as i could it seems pretty tough to be sure to have to raise silver where theres none to be raised but then you see there will be danger of loss if it aint done  loss damnation says he i defy daniel webster i defy king solomon i defy the worldi defyi defyyes i defy even you aunt becca to show how the people can lose anything by paying their taxes in state paper  well says i you see what the officers of state say about it and they are a desarnin set of men but says i i guess you re mistaken about what the proclamation says it dont say the people will lose anything by the paper money being taken for taxes it only says there will be danger of loss and though it is tolerable plain that the people cant lose by paying their taxes in something they can get easier than silver instead of having to pay silver and though its just as plain that the state cant lose by taking state bank paper however low it may be while she owes the bank more than the whole revenue and can pay that paper over on her debt dollar for dollarstill there is danger of loss to the officers of state and you know jeff we cant get along without officers of state  damn officers of state says he thats what whigs are always hurrahing for  now dont swear so jeff says i you know i belong to the meetin and swearin hurts my feelings  beg pardon aunt becca says he but i do say its enough to make dr goddard swear to have tax to pay in silver for nothing only that ford may get his two thousand a year and shields his twentyfour hundred a year and carpenter his sixteen hundred a year and all without danger of loss by taking it in state paper yes yes its plain enough now what these officers of state mean by danger of loss wash i spose actually lost fifteen hundred dollars out of the three thousand that two of these officers of state let him steal from the treasury by being compelled to take it in state paper wonder if we dont have a proclamation before long commanding us to make up this loss to wash in silver  and so he went on till his breath run out and he had to stop i couldnt think of anything to say just then and so i begun to look over the paper again ay heres another proclamation or something like it  another says jeff and whose egg is it pray  i looked to the bottom of it and read aloud your obedient servant james shields auditor  aha says jeff one of them same three fellows again well read it and lets hear what of it  i read on till i came to where it says the object of this measure is to suspend the collection of the revenue for the current year  now stop now stop says he thats a lie aready and i dont want to hear of it  oh maybe not says i  i say itisalie suspend the collection indeed will the collectors that have taken their oaths to make the collection dare to end it is there anything in law requiring them to perjure themselves at the bidding of james shields  will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them if they should venture to obey him and would he not discover some danger of loss and be off about the time it came to taking their places  and suppose the people attempt to suspend by refusing to pay what then the collectors would just jerk up their horses and cows and the like and sell them to the highest bidder for silver in hand without valuation or redemption why shields didnt believe that story himself it was never meant for the truth if it was true why was it not writ till five days after the proclamation why did nt carlin and carpenter sign it as well as shields answer me that aunt becca i say its a lie and not a well told one at that it grins out like a copper dollar shields is a fool as well as a liar with him truth is out of the question and as for getting a good bright passable lie out of him you might as well try to strike fire from a cake of tallow i stick to it its all an infernal whig lie  a whig lie highty tighty  yes a whig lie and its just like everything the cursed british whigs do first theyll do some divilment and then theyll tell a lie to hide it and they dont care how plain a lie it is they think they can cram any sort of a one down the throats of the ignorant locofocos as they call the democrats  why jeff you re crazy you dont mean to say shields is a whig  yes i do  why look here the proclamation is in your own democratic paper as you call it  i know it and what of that they only printed it to let us democrats see the deviltry the whigs are at  well but shields is the auditor of this locoi mean this democratic state  so he is and tyler appointed him to office  tyler appointed him  yes if you must chaw it over tyler appointed him or if it was nt him it was old granny harrison and thats all one i tell you aunt becca theres no mistake about his being a whig why his very looks shows it everything about him shows it if i was deaf and blind i could tell him by the smell i seed him when i was down in springfield last winter they had a sort of a gatherin there one night among the grandees they called a fair all the gals about town was there and all the handsome widows and married women finickin about trying to look like gals tied as tight in the middle and puffed out at both ends like bundles of fodder that had nt been stacked yet but wanted stackin pretty bad and then they had tables all around the house kivered over with  caps and pincushions and ten thousand such little knickknacks tryin to sell em to the fellows that were bowin and scrapin and kungeerin about em they would nt let no democrats in for fear theyd disgust the ladies or scare the little gals or dirty the floor i looked in at the window and there was this same fellow shields floatin about on the air without heft or earthly substances just like a lock of cat fur where cats had been fighting  he was paying his money to this one and that one and t other one and sufferin great loss because it was nt silver instead of state paper and the sweet distress he seemed to be inhis very features in the ecstatic agony of his soul spoke audibly and distinctly dear girls it is distressing but i cannot marry you all too well i know how much you suffer but do do remember it is not my fault that i am so handsome and so interesting  as this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face he seized hold of one of their hands and squeezed and held on to it about a quarter of an hour oh my good fellow says i to myself if that was one of our democratic gals in the lost townships the way you d get a brass pin let into you would be about up to the head he a democrat fiddlesticks i tell you aunt becca hes a whig and no mistake nobody but a whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself  well says i maybe he is but if he is i m mistaken the worst sort maybe so maybe so but if i am ill suffer by it ill be a democrat if it turns out that shields is a whig considerin you shall be a whig if he turns out a democrat  a bargain by jingoes says he but how will we find out  why says i well just write and ax the printer  agreed again says he and by thunder if it does turn out that shields is a democrat i never will  jefferson jefferson  what do you want peggy  do get through your everlasting clatter some time and bring me a gourd of water the childs been crying for a drink this livelong hour  let it die then it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death to fatten officers of state  jeff run off to get the water though just like he hadnt been saying anything spiteful for hes a raal goodhearted fellow after all once you get at the foundation of him  i walked into the house and why peggy says i i declare we like to forgot you altogether  oh yes says she when a body cant help themselves everybody soon forgets em but thank god by day after tomorrow i shall be well enough to milk the cows and pen the calves and wring the contrary ones tails for em and no thanks to nobody  good evening peggy says i and so i sloped for i seed she was mad at me for making jeff neglect her so long  and now mr printer will you be sure to let us know in your next paper whether this shields is a whig or a democrat i dont care about it for myself for i know well enough how it is already but i want to convince jeff it may do some good to let him and others like him know who and what these officers of state are it may help to send the present hypocritical set to where they belong and to fill the places they now disgrace with men who will do more work for less pay and take fewer airs while they are doing it it aint sensible to think that the same men who get us in trouble will change their course and yet its pretty plain if some change for the better is not made its not long that either peggy or i or any of us will have a cow left to milk or a calfs tail to wring  yours truly  rebecca      invitation to henry clay  springfield ill aug 29 1842  hon henry clay lexington ky  dear sirwe hear you are to visit indianapolis indiana on the 5th of october next if our information in this is correct we hope you will not deny us the pleasure of seeing you in our state we are aware of the toil necessarily incident to a journey by one circumstanced as you are but once you have embarked as you have already determined to do the toil would not be greatly augmented by extending the journey to our capital the season of the year will be most favorable for good roads and pleasant weather and although we cannot but believe you would be highly gratified with such a visit to the prairieland the pleasure it would give us and thousands such as we is beyond all question you have never visited illinois or at least this portion of it and should you now yield to our request we promise you such a reception as shall be worthy of the man on whom are now turned the fondest hopes of a great and suffering nation

lincoln esqi regret that my absence on public business compelled me to postpone a matter of private consideration a little longer than i could have desired it will only be necessary however to account for it by informing you that i have been to quincy on business that would not admit of delay i will now state briefly the reasons of my troubling you with this communication the disagreeable nature of which i regret as i had hoped to avoid any difficulty with any one in springfield while residing there by endeavoring to conduct myself in such a way amongst both my political friends and opponents as to escape the necessity of any whilst thus abstaining from giving provocation i have become the object of slander vituperation and personal abuse which were i capable of submitting to i would prove myself worthy of the whole of it  in two or three of the last numbers of the sangamon journal articles of the most personal nature and calculated to degrade me have made their appearance on inquiring i was informed by the editor of that paper through the medium of my friend general whitesides that you are the author of those articles this information satisfies me that i have become by some means or other the object of your secret hostility i will not take the trouble of inquiring into the reason of all this but i will take the liberty of requiring a full positive and absolute retraction of all offensive allusions used by you in these communications in relation to my private character and standing as a man as an apology for the insults conveyed in them  this may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself  your obedient servant jas shields     to j shields  tremont september 17 1842  jas shields esqyour note of today was handed me by general whitesides in that note you say you have been informed through the medium of the editor of the journal that i am the author of certain articles in that paper which you deem personally abusive of you and without stopping to inquire whether i really am the author or to point out what is offensive in them you demand an unqualified retraction of all that is offensive and then proceed to hint at consequences  now sir there is in this so much assumption of facts and so much of menace as to consequences that i cannot submit to answer that note any further than i have and to add that the consequences to which i suppose you allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly could to you  respectfully  a lincoln     to a lincoln from jas shields  tremont september 17 1842  abra lincoln esqin reply to my note of this date you intimate that i assume facts and menace consequences and that you cannot submit to answer it further as now sir you desire it i will be a little more particular the editor of the sangamon journal gave me to understand that you are the author of an article which appeared i think in that paper of the 2d september instant headed the lost townships and signed rebecca or becca i would therefore take the liberty of asking whether you are the author of said article or any other over the same signature which has appeared in any of the late numbers of that paper if so i repeat my request of an absolute retraction of all offensive allusions contained therein in relation to my private character and standing if you are not the author of any of these articles your denial will be sufficient i will say further it is not my intention to menace but to do myself justice  your obedient servant jas shields     memorandum of instructions to e h merryman  lincolns second  september 19 1842  in case whitesides shall signify a wish to adjust this affair without further difficulty let him know that if the present papers be withdrawn and a note from mr shields asking to know if i am the author of the articles of which he complains and asking that i shall make him gentlemanly satisfaction if i am the author and this without menace or dictation as to what that satisfaction shall be a pledge is made that the following answer shall be given  i did write the lost townships letter which appeared in the journal of the 2d instant but had no participation in any form in any other article alluding to you i wrote that wholly for political effecti had no intention of injuring your personal or private character or standing as a man or a gentleman and i did not then think and do not now think that that article could produce or has produced that effect against you and had i anticipated such an effect i would have forborne to write it and i will add that your conduct toward me so far as i know had always been gentlemanly and that i had no personal pique against you and no cause for any  if this should be done i leave it with you to arrange what shall and what shall not be published if nothing like this is done the preliminaries of the fight are to be  first weapons cavalry broadswords of the largest size precisely equal in all respects and such as now

joshua f speed  springfield october 4 1842  dear speedyou have heard of my duel with shields and i have now to inform you that the dueling business still rages in this city day before yesterday shields challenged butler who accepted and proposed fighting next morning at sunrise in bob allens meadow one hundred yards distance with rifles to this whitesides shieldss second said no because of the law thus ended duel no 2 yesterday whitesides chose to consider himself insulted by dr merryman so sent him a kind of quasichallenge inviting him to meet him at the planters house in st louis on the next friday to settle their difficulty merryman made me his friend and sent whitesides a note inquiring to know if he meant his note as a challenge and if so that he would according to the law in such case made and provided prescribe the terms of the meeting whitesides returned for answer that if merryman would meet him at the planters house as desired he would challenge him merryman replied in a note that he denied whitesidess right to dictate time and place but that he merryman would waive the question of time and meet him at louisiana missouri upon my presenting this note to whitesides and stating verbally its contents he declined receiving it saying he had business in st louis and it was as near as louisiana merryman then directed me to notify whitesides that he should publish the correspondence between them with such comments as he thought fit this i did thus it stood at bedtime last night this morning whitesides by his friend shields is praying for a new trial on the ground that he was mistaken in merrymans proposition to meet him at louisiana missouri thinking it was the state of louisiana this merryman hoots at and is preparing his publication while the town is in a ferment and a street fight somewhat anticipated  but i began this letter not for what i have been writing but to say something on that subject which you know to be of such infinite solicitude to me the immense sufferings you endured from the first days of september till the middle of february you never tried to conceal from me and i well understood you have now been the husband of a lovely woman nearly eight months that you are happier now than the day you married her i well know for without you could not be living but i have your word for it too and the returning elasticity of spirits which is manifested in your letters but i want to ask a close question are you now in feeling as well as judgment glad that you are married as you are from anybody but me this would be an impudent question not to be tolerated but i know you will pardon it in me please answer it quickly as i am impatient to know i have sent my love to your fanny so often i fear she is getting tired of it however i venture to tender it again  yours forever  lincoln     to james s irwin  springfield november 2 1842  jas s irwin esq  owing to my absence yours of the 22nd ult was not received till this moment judge logan and myself are willing to attend to any business in the supreme court you may send us as to fees it is impossible to establish a rule that will apply in all or even a great many cases we believe we are never accused of being very unreasonable in this particular and we would always be easily satisfied provided we could see the moneybut whatever fees we earn at a distance if not paid before we have noticed we never hear of after the work is done we therefore are growing a little sensitive on that point  yours etc  a lincoln     1843     resolutions at a whig meeting at springfield illinois march 1 1843  the object of the meeting was stated by mr lincoln of springfield who offered the following resolutions which were unanimously adopted  resolved that a tariff of duties on imported goods producing sufficient revenue for the payment of the necessary expenditures of the national government and so adjusted as to protect american industry is indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the american people  resolved that we are opposed to direct taxation for the support of the national government  resolved that a national bank properly restricted is highly necessary and proper to the establishment and maintenance of a sound currency and for the cheap and safe collection keeping and disbursing of the public revenue  resolved that the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands upon the principles of mr clays bill accords with the best interests of the nation and particularly with those of the state of illinois  resolved that we recommend to the whigs of each congressional district of the state to nominate and support at the approaching election a candidate of their own principles regardless of the chances of success  resolved that we recommend to the whigs of all portions of the state to adopt and rigidly adhere to the convention system of nominating candidates  resolved that we recommend to the whigs of each congressional district to hold a district convention on or before the first monday of may next to be composed of a number of delegates from each county equal to double the number of its representatives in the general assembly provided each county shall have at least one delegate said delegates to be chosen by primary meetings of the whigs at such times and places as they in their respective counties may see fit said district conventions each to nominate one candidate for congress and one delegate to a national convention for the purpose of nominating candidates for president and vicepresident of the united states the seven delegates so nominated to a national convention to have power to add two delegates to their own number and to fill all vacancies  resolved that a t bledsoe s t logan and a lincoln be appointed a committee to prepare an address to the people of the state  resolved that n w edwards a g henry james h matheny john c doremus and james c conkling be appointed a whig central state committee with authority to fill any vacancy that may occur in the committee     circular from whig committee  address to the people of illinois  fellowcitizensby a resolution of a meeting of such of the whigs of the state as are now at springfield we the undersigned were appointed to prepare an address to you the performance of that task we now undertake  several resolutions were adopted by the meeting and the chief object of this address is to show briefly the reasons for their adoption  the first of those resolutions declares a tariff of duties upon foreign importations producing sufficient revenue for the support of the general government and so adjusted as to protect american industry to be indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the american people and the second declares direct taxation for a national revenue to be improper those two resolutions are kindred in their nature and therefore proper and convenient to be considered together the question of protection is a subject entirely too broad to be crowded into a few pages only together with several other subjects on that point we therefore content ourselves with giving the following extracts from the writings of mr jefferson general jackson and the speech of mr calhoun  to be independent for the comforts of life we must fabricate them ourselves we must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist the grand inquiry now is shall we make our own comforts or go without them at the will of a foreign nation he therefore who is now against domestic manufactures must be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation or to be clothed in skins and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns i am not one of those experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort letter of mr jefferson to benjamin austin  i ask what is the real situation of the agriculturalist where has the american farmer a market for his surplus produce except for cotton he has neither a foreign nor a home market does not this clearly prove when there is no market at home or abroad that there is too much labor employed in agriculture common sense at once points out the remedy take from agriculture six hundred thousand men women and children and you will at once give a market for more breadstuffs than all europe now furnishes in short we have been too long subject to the policy of british merchants it is time we should become a little more americanized and instead of feeding the paupers and laborers of england feed our own or else in a short time by continuing our present policy we shall all be rendered paupers ourselvesgeneral jacksons letter to dr coleman  when our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection as they soon will be under the fostering care of government the farmer will find a ready market for his surplus produce andwhat is of equal consequencea certain and cheap supply of all he wants his prosperity will diffuse itself to every class of the community speech of hon j c calhoun on the tariff  the question of revenue we will now briefly consider for several years past the revenues of the government have been unequal to its expenditures and consequently loan after loan sometimes direct and sometimes indirect in form has been resorted to by this means a new national debt has been created and is still growing on us with a rapidity fearful to contemplatea rapidity only reasonably to be expected in time of war this state of things has been produced by a prevailing unwillingness either to increase the tariff or resort to direct taxation but the one or the other must come coming expenditures must be met and the present debt must be paid and money cannot always be borrowed for these objects the system of loans is but temporary in its nature and must soon explode it is a system not only ruinous while it lasts but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute as an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his original means devoured by interest and next no one left to borrow from so must it be with a government  we repeat then that a tariff sufficient for revenue or a direct tax must soon be resorted to and indeed we believe this alternative is now denied by no one but which system shall be adopted some of our opponents in theory admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for a revenue but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff while others boldly advocate direct taxation inasmuch therefore as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation and all the restor so nearly all as to make exceptions needlessrefuse to adopt the tariff we think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation indeed we believe they are only delaying an open avowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people will tolerate it let us then briefly compare the two systems the tariff is the cheaper system because the duties being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points will require comparatively few officers in their collection while by the directtax system the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors going forth like swarms of egyptian locusts devouring every blade of grass and other green thing and again by the tariff system the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods and those chiefly the luxuries and not the necessaries of life by this system the man who contents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at all and surely that country is extensive enough and its products abundant and varied enough to answer all the real wants of its people in short by this system the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few while the substantial and laboring many who live at home and upon home products go entirely free by the directtax system none can escape however strictly the citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuriesfine cloths fine silks rich wines golden chains and diamond ringsstill for the possession of his house his barn and his homespun he is to be perpetually haunted and harassed by the taxgatherer with these views we leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are the more truly democratic on the subject  the third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a national bank during the last fifty years so much has been said and written both as to the constitutionality and expediency of such an institution that we could not hope to improve in the least on former discussions of the subject were we to undertake it we therefore upon the question of constitutionality content ourselves with remarking the facts that the first national bank was established chiefly by the same men who formed the constitution at a time when that instrument was but two years old and receiving the sanction as president of the immortal washington that the second received the sanction as president of mr madison to whom common consent has awarded the proud title of father of the constitution and subsequently the sanction of the supreme court the most enlightened judicial tribunal in the world upon the question of expediency we only ask you to examine the history of the times during the existence of the two banks and compare those times with the miserable present  the fourth resolution declares the expediency of mr clays land bill much incomprehensible jargon is often used against the constitutionality of this measure we forbear in this place attempting an answer to it simply because in our opinion those who urge it are through party zeal resolved not to see or acknowledge the truth the question of expediency at least so far as illinois is concerned seems to us the clearest imaginable by the bill we are to receive annually a large sum of money no part of which we otherwise receive the precise annual sum cannot be known in advance it doubtless will vary in different years still it is something to know that in the last yeara year of almost unparalleled pecuniary pressureit amounted to more than forty thousand dollars this annual income in the midst of our almost insupportable difficulties in the days of our severest necessity our political opponents are furiously resolving to take and keep from us and for what many silly reasons are given as is usual in cases where a single good one is not to be found one is that by giving us the proceeds of the lands we impoverish the national treasury and thereby render necessary an increase of the tariff this may be true but if so the amount of it only is that those whose pride whose abundance of means prompt them to spurn the manufactures of our country and to strut in british cloaks and coats and pantaloons may have to pay a few cents more on the yard for the cloth that makes them a terrible evil truly to the illinois farmer who never wore nor ever expects to wear a single yard of british goods in his whole life another of their reasons is that by the passage and continuance of mr clays bill we prevent the passage of a bill which would give us more this if it were sound in itself is waging destructive war with the former position for if mr clays bill impoverishes the treasury too much what shall be said of one that impoverishes it still more but it is not sound in itself it is not true that mr clays bill prevents the passage of one more favorable to us of the new states considering the strength and opposite interest of the old states the wonder is that they ever permitted one to pass so favorable as mr clays the last twentyodd years efforts to reduce the price of the lands and to pass graduation bills and cession bills prove the assertion to be true and if there were no experience in support of it the reason itself is plain the states in which none or few of the public lands lie and those consequently interested against parting with them except for the best price are the majority and a moments reflection will show that they must ever continue the majority because by the time one of the original new states ohio for example becomes populous and gets weight in congress the public lands in her limits are so nearly sold out that in every point material to this question she becomes an old state she does not wish the price reduced because there is none left for her citizens to buy she does not wish them ceded to the states in which they lie because they no longer lie in her limits and she will get nothing by the cession in the nature of things the states interested in the reduction of price in graduation in cession and in all similar projects never can be the majority nor is there reason to hope that any of them can ever succeed as a democratic party measure because we have heretofore seen that party in full power year after year with many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these projects and yet doing nothing what reason then is there to believe they will hereafter do better in every light in which we can view this question it amounts simply to this shall we accept our share of the proceeds under mr clays bill or shall we rather reject that and get nothing  the fifth resolution recommends that a whig candidate for congress be run in every district regardless of the chances of success we are aware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification when a friend cannot succeed to be able to choose between opponents but we believe that that gratification is the seedtime which never fails to be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness by this policy we entangle ourselves by voting for our opponents such of us as do it in some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts however glaringly wrong we may believe them to be by this policy no one portion of our friends can ever be certain as to what course another portion may adopt and by this want of mutual and perfect understanding our political identity is partially frittered away and lost and again those who are thus elected by our aid ever become our bitterest persecutors take a few prominent examples in 1830 reynolds was elected governor in 1835 we exerted our whole strength to elect judge young to the united states senate which effort though failing gave him the prominence that subsequently elected him in 1836 general ewing was so elected to the united states senate and yet let us ask what three men have been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults upon all our men and measures than they during the last summer the whole state was covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us methodized into chapters and verses written by two of these same menreynolds and young in which they did not stop at charging us with error merely but roundly denounced us as the designing enemies of human liberty itself if it be the will of heaven that such men shall politically live be it so but never never again permit them to draw a particle of their sustenance from us  the sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system for the nomination of candidates this we believe to be of the very first importance whether the system is right in itself we do not stop to inquire contenting ourselves with trying to show that while our opponents use it it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with it experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves without it for examples look at the elections of last year our candidate for governor with the approbation of a large portion of the party took the field without a nomination and in open opposition to the system wherever in the counties the whigs had held conventions and nominated candidates for the legislature the aspirants who were not nominated were induced to rebel against the nominations and to become candidates as is said on their own hook and go where you would into a large whig county you were sure to find the whigs not contending shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy but divided into factions and fighting furiously with one another the election came and what was the result the governor beaten the whig vote being decreased many thousands since 1840 although the democratic vote had not increased any beaten almost everywhere for members of the legislaturetazewell with her four hundred whig majority sending a delegation half democratic vermillion with her five hundred doing the same coles with her four hundred sending two out of three and morgan with her two hundred and fifty sending three out of fourand this to say nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples the whole winding up with the aggregate number of twentyseven democratic representatives sent from whig counties as to the senators too the result was of the same character and it is most worthy to be remembered that of all the whigs in the state who ran against the regular nominees a single one only was elected although they succeeded in defeating the nominees almost by scores they too were defeated and the spoils chucklingly borne off by the common enemy  we do not mention the fact of many of the whigs opposing the convention system heretofore for the purpose of censuring them far from it we expressly protest against such a conclusion we know they were generally perhaps universally as good and true whigs as we ourselves claim to be  we mention it merely to draw attention to the disastrous result it produced as an example forever hereafter to be avoided that union is strength is a truth that has been known illustrated and declared in various ways and forms in all ages of the world that great fabulist and philosopher aesop illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks and he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers has declared that a house divided against itself cannot stand it is to induce our friends to act upon this important and universally acknowledged truth that we urge the adoption of the convention system reflection will prove that there is no other way of practically applying it in its application we know there will be incidents temporarily painful but after all those incidents will be fewer and less intense with than without the system if two friends aspire to the same office it is certain that both cannot succeed would it not then be much less painful to have the question decided by mutual friends some time before than to snarl and quarrel until the day of election and then both be beaten by the common enemy  before leaving this subject we think proper to remark that we do not understand the resolution as intended to recommend the application of the convention system to the nomination of candidates for the small offices no way connected with politics though we must say we do not perceive that such an application of it would be wrong  the seventh resolution recommends the holding of district conventions in may next for the purpose of nominating candidates for congress the propriety of this rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth and therefore needs no further discussion  the eighth and ninth also relate merely to the practical application of the foregoing and therefore need no discussion  before closing permit us to add a few reflections on the present condition and future prospects of the whig party in almost all the states we have fallen into the minority and despondency seems to prevail universally among us is there just cause for this in 1840 we carried the nation by more than a hundred and forty thousand majority our opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent voting but whatever they may have believed we know the charge to be untrue where now is that mighty host have they gone over to the enemy let the results of the late elections answer every state which has fallen off from the whig cause since 1840 has done so not by giving more democratic votes than they did then but by giving fewer whig bouck who was elected democratic governor of new york last fall by more than 15000 majority had not then as many votes as he had in 1840 when he was beaten by seven or eight thousand and so has it been in all the other states which have fallen away from our cause from this it is evident that tens of thousands in the late elections have not voted at all who and what are they is an important question as respects the future they can come forward and give us the victory again that all or nearly all of them are whigs is most apparent our opponents stung to madness by the defeat of 1840 have ever since rallied with more than their usual unanimity it has not been they that have been kept from the polls these facts show what the result must be once the people again rally in their entire strength proclaim these facts and predict this result and although unthinking opponents may smile at us the sagacious ones will believe and tremble and why shall the whigs not all rally again are their principles less dear now than in 1840 have any of their doctrines since then been discovered to be untrue it is true the victory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated but it is equally true as we believe that the unfortunate death of general harrison was the cause of the failure it was not the election of general harrison that was expected to produce happy effects but the measures to be adopted by his administration by means of his death and the unexpected course of his successor those measures were never adopted how could the fruits follow the consequences we always predicted would follow the failure of those measures have followed and are now upon us in all their horrors by the course of mr tyler the policy of our opponents has continued in operation still leaving them with the advantage of charging all its evils upon us as the results of a whig administration let none be deceived by this somewhat plausible though entirely false charge if they ask us for the sufficient and sound currency we promised let them be answered that we only promised it through the medium of a national bank which they aided by mr tyler prevented our establishing and let them be reminded too that their own policy in relation to the currency has all the time been and still is in full operation let us then again come forth in our might and by a second victory accomplish that which death prevented in the first we can do it when did the whigs ever fail if they were fully aroused and united even in single states under such circumstances defeat seldom overtakes them call to mind the contested elections within the last few years and particularly those of moore and letcher from kentucky newland and graham from north carolina and the famous new jersey case in all these districts locofocoism had stalked omnipotent before but when the whole people were aroused by its enormities on those occasions they put it down never to rise again  we declare it to be our solemn conviction that the whigs are always a majority of this nation and that to make them always successful needs but to get them all to the polls and to vote unitedly this is the great desideratum let us make every effort to attain it at every election let every whig act as though he knew the result to depend upon his action in the great contest of 1840 some more than twenty one hundred thousand votes were cast and so surely as there shall be that many with the ordinary increase added cast in 1844 that surely will a whig be elected president of the united states  a lincoln s t logan a t bledsoe  march 4 1843     to john bennett  springfield march 7 1843  friend bennett  your letter of this day was handed me by mr miles it is too late now to effect the object you desire on yesterday morning the most of the whig members from this district got together and agreed to hold the convention at tremont in tazewell county i am sorry to hear that any of the whigs of your county or indeed of any county should longer be against conventions on last wednesday evening a meeting of all the whigs then here from all parts of the state was held and the question of the propriety of conventions was brought up and fully discussed and at the end of the discussion a resolution recommending the system of conventions to all the whigs of the state was unanimously adopted other resolutions were also passed all of which will appear in the next journal the meeting also appointed a committee to draft an address to the people of the state which address will also appear in the next journal  in it you will find a brief argument in favor of conventionsand although i wrote it myself i will say to you that it is conclusive upon the point and can not be reasonably answered the right way for you to do is hold your meeting and appoint delegates any how and if there be any who will not take part let it be so the matter will work so well this time that even they who now oppose will come in next time  the convention is to be held at tremont on the 5th of april and according to the rule we have adopted your county is to have delegatesbeing double your representation  if there be any good whig who is disposed to stick out against conventions get him at least to read the arguement in their favor in the address  yours as ever  a lincoln     joshua f speed  springfield march 24 1843  dear speedwe had a meeting of the whigs of the county here on last monday to appoint delegates to a district convention and baker beat me and got the delegation instructed to go for him the meeting in spite of my attempt to decline it appointed me one of the delegates so that in getting baker the nomination i shall be fixed a good deal like a fellow who is made a groomsman to a man that has cut him out and is marrying his own dear gal about the prospects of your having a namesake at our town cant say exactly yet  a lincoln     to martin m morris  springfield ill march 26 1843  friend morris  your letter of the a 3 d was received on yesterday morning and for which instead of an excuse which you thought proper to ask i tender you my sincere thanks it is truly gratifying to me to learn that while the people of sangamon have cast me off my old friends of menard who have known me longest and best stick to me it would astonish if not amuse the older citizens to learn that i a stranger friendless uneducated penniless boy working on a flatboat at ten dollars per month have been put down here as the candidate of pride wealth and aristocratic family distinction yet so chiefly it was there was too the strangest combination of church influence against me baker is a campbellite and therefore as i suppose with few exceptions got all that church my wife has some relations in the presbyterian churches and some with the episcopal churches and therefore wherever it would tell i was set down as either the one or the other while it was everywhere contended that no christian ought to go for me because i belonged to no church was suspected of being a deist and had talked about fighting a duel with all these things baker of course had nothing to do nor do i complain of them as to his own church going for him i think that was right enough and as to the influences i have spoken of in the other though they were very strong it would be grossly untrue and unjust to charge that they acted upon them in a body or were very near so i only mean that those influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent upon my strength throughout the religious controversy but enough of this  you say that in choosing a candidate for congress you have an equal right with sangamon and in this you are undoubtedly correct in agreeing to withdraw if the whigs of sangamon should go against me i did not mean that they alone were worth consulting but that if she with her heavy delegation should be against me it would be impossible for me to succeed and therefore i had as well decline and in relation to menard having rights permit me fully to recognize them and to express the opinion that if she and mason act circumspectly they will in the convention be able so far to enforce their rights as to decide absolutely which one of the candidates shall be successful let me show the reason of this hardin or some other morgan candidate will get putnam marshall woodford tazewell and loganmaking sixteen then you and mason having three can give the victory to either side  you say you shall instruct your delegates for me unless i object i certainly shall not object that would be too pleasant a compliment for me to tread in the dust and besides if anything should happen which however is not probable by which baker should be thrown out of the fight i would be at liberty to accept the nomination if i could get it i do however feel myself bound not to hinder him in any way from getting the nomination i should despise myself were i to attempt it i think then it would be proper for your meeting to appoint three delegates and to instruct them to go for some one as the first choice some one else as a second and perhaps some one as a third and if in those instructions i were named as the first choice it would gratify me very much if you wish to hold the balance of power it is important for you to attend to and secure the vote of mason also you should be sure to have men appointed delegates that you know you can safely confide in if yourself and james short were appointed from your county all would be safe but whether jims woman affair a year ago might not be in the way of his appointment is a question i dont know whether you know it but i know him to be as honorable a man as there is in the world you have my permission and even request to show this letter to short but to no one else unless it be a very particular friend who you know will not speak of it  yours as ever a lincoln  p s will you write me again     to martin m morris  april 14 1843  friend morris  i have heard it intimated that baker has been attempting to get you or miles or both of you to violate the instructions of the meeting that appointed you and to go for him i have insisted and still insist that this cannot be true surely baker would not do the like as well might hardin ask me to vote for him in the convention again it is said there will be an attempt to get up instructions in your county requiring you to go for baker this is all wrong upon the same rule why might not i fly from the decision against me in sangamon and get up instructions to their delegates to go for me there are at least twelve hundred whigs in the county that took no part and yet i would as soon put my head in the fire as to attempt it besides if any one should get the nomination by such extraordinary means all harmony in the district would inevitably be lost honest whigs and very nearly all of them are honest would not quietly abide such enormities i repeat such an attempt on bakers part cannot be true write me at springfield how the matter is dont show or speak of this letter  a lincoln     to gen j j hardin  springfield may 11 1843  friend hardin  butler informs me that he received a letter from you in which you expressed some doubt whether the whigs of sangamon will support you cordially you may at once dismiss all fears on that subject we have already resolved to make a particular effort to give you the very largest majority possible in our county from this no whig of the county dissents we have many objects for doing it we make it a matter of honor and pride to do it we do it because we love the whig cause we do it because we like you personally and last we wish to convince you that we do not bear that hatred to morgan county that you people have so long seemed to imagine you will see by the journals of this week that we propose upon pain of losing a barbecue to give you twice as great a majority in this county as you shall receive in your own i got up the proposal  who of the five appointed is to write the district address i did the labor of writing one address this year and got thunder for my reward nothing new here  yours as ever a lincoln  p si wish you would measure one of the largest of those swords we took to alton and write me the length of it from tip of the point to tip of the hilt in feet and inches i have a dispute about the length  a l a l
