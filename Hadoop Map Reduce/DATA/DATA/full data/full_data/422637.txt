one of the most difficult and at the same time the most successful enterprises ever undertaken the task of carrying an army hundreds of miles across a waterless desert conveying it up a great river bristling with obstacles defeating an enormously superior force unsurpassed in the world for courage and finally killing the leader of the enemy and crushing out the last spark of opposition was a stupendous one  after the death of gordon and the retirement of the british troops there was no force in existence that could have barred the advance of the fanatical hordes of the mahdi had they poured down into egypt the native egyptian army was as yet in the earliest stage of organization and could not be relied upon to stand firm against the wild rush of the dervishes fortunately time was given for that organization to be completed and when at last the dervish forces marched north they were repulsed assouan was saved and wady halfa became the egyptian outpost  gradually preparations were made for taking the offensive a railway was constructed along the banks of the nile and a mixed force of british and egyptians drove the enemy beyond dongola then by splendidly organized labour a railroad was made from wady halfa across the desert towards the elbow of the great bend from dongola to abu hamed the latter place was captured by an egyptian brigade moving up from the former place and from that moment the movement was carried on with irresistible energy  the railway was pushed forward to abu hamed and then southward past berber up to the atbara river an army of twenty thousand men under one of the khalifas sons was attacked in a strong position and defeated with immense loss fresh british troops were then brought up and escorted by gunboats and steamers carrying provisions the army marched up the nile crushed the khalifas great host before omdurman and recovered possession of khartoum  then the moving spirit of this enterprise the man whose marvellous power of organization had secured its success was called to other work fortunately he had a worthy successor in colonel wingate who with a native force encountered that which the khalifa had again gathered near el obeid the scene of the total destruction of the army under hicks pasha routed it with ease killing the khalifa and all his principal emirs thus a land that had been turned into a desert by the terrible tyranny of the mahdi and his successor was wrested from barbarism and restored to civilization and the stain upon british honour caused by the desertion of gordon by the british ministry of the day was wiped out  it was a marvellous campaignmarvellous in the perfection of its organization marvellous in the completeness of its success  g a henty    chapter 1 disinherited   wanted an active and intelligent young man for general work in a commercial house having a branch at alexandria it is desirable that he should be able to write a good hand and if necessary to assist in office work wages 2 pounds per week personal application to be made at messieurs partridge and company 453 leadenhall street  this advertisement was read by a man of five or six and twenty in a small room in the upper story of a house in lupus street pimlico he was not the only inmate of the room for a young woman apparently not more than eighteen was sitting there sewing her work interrupted occasionally by a short hacking cough her husband for this was the relation in which he stood to her put down the paper carelessly and then got up  i am going out dear on my usual search you know we have agreed that it is of no use my trying to live by my pen i get an article accepted occasionally but its not enough to provide more than bread and cheese i must look for something else  but you must succeed presently gregory  yes dear but while the grass grows the horse starves at any rate i will try for something else if i get anything it wont prevent my writing and when my genius is recognized i can drop the other thing and take to literature regularly again  well i wont be away longer than i can help anyhow i will be back to our midday banquet i will bring a couple of rashers of bacon in with me we have potatoes enough i think  so saying he kissed his wife tenderly and went out  gregory hartley belonged to a good family he was the second son of the honorable james hartley brother of the marquis of langdale he had been educated at harrow and cambridge and after leaving the university had gone out to egypt with a friend of his fathers who was an enthusiast in the exploration of the antiquities of that country gregory had originally intended to stay there a few months at most but he was infected by the enthusiasm of his companion and remained in egypt for two years when the professor was taken ill and died and he returned home  a year later he fell in love with the governess in a neighbouring family his feeling was reciprocated and they became engaged his father was furious when his son told him what had taken place  it is monstrous he said after the education that you have had and the place that i if i survive him or if not your brother will take at the death of your uncle that you should dream of throwing yourself away in this manner i have looked to your making a good marriage for as you know i am not what may be called a rich man your brothers tastes are expensive and what with his education and yours and the allowances i have made you both it is as much as i have been able to do to keep up our position and there are your sisters to be provided for the idea of your falling in love with this young woman is monstrous  young lady father she is a clergymans daughter  i wont hear of such a thingi will not hear of it for a moment and if you persist in this mad folly i tell you fairly that from this moment i shall have nothing more to say to you you have to choose between me and this penniless beggar  i am sorry you put it in that way sir my choice is made i am engaged to this young lady and shall certainly marry her i trust that when your present anger has subsided you will recognize that my honour was involved in the matter and that even if i wished it i could not without showing myself to be a downright cad draw back  and so gregory hartley married the girl of his choice she had for some time refused to allow him to sacrifice himself but when she found that he was as determined as his father and absolutely refused to release her from the engagement she had given way and had after a quiet marriage accompanied him to london  there he had endeavoured to get literary work but had found it much harder than he had expected the market was overcrowded and they had moved from comfortable lodgings into small rooms and so step by step had come to the attic in lupus street he was doing a little better now and had hopes that ere long he would begin to make his way steadily up  but the anxiety had told on his wife never very strong she had developed a short hard cough and he had drawn upon his scanty reserves to consult a specialist  there is undoubtedly lung trouble the latter said if you can manage it i should say that she ought certainly to be taken to a warm climate the damage is not extensive as yet and it is probable that under favourable circumstances she might shake it off but i fear that if she continues to live in london her chances are not great  this gregory felt was almost equivalent to a death sentence and he had begun to consult the advertisements in the papers for some post abroad he had unknown to her applied for several situations but without success  when he first read the advertisement that morning he had hardly thought of applying for the situation his pride revolted at the idea of becoming a mere messenger but his wifes cough had decided him what did it matter so that he could save her life  i may not get it he said to himself as he went out but my knowledge of arabic and the native dialect is all in my favour and at least in a year or two she may have thoroughly shaken off the cough and that is everything  at any rate i have a better chance of getting this than i had of the other places that i applied for there can hardly be a rush of applicants when i am out there i may hear of something better  however i will take another name fortunately i have a second one which will do very well hilliard will do as well as hartley and as i never write it in full as my signature no one would recognize it as my name there is nothing to be ashamed of in accepting such a post  as for the marquis as he has never been friendly with us it does not matter he is i have heard a very tough sort of man and my father is not likely to survive him but i do not think it would be fair to geoffrey when he comes into his peerage that anyone should be able to say that he has a brother who is porter in a mercantile house at alexandria we have never got on very well together the fact that he was heir to a title spoilt him i think he would have been a very good fellow if it hadnt been for that  on arriving at the office in leadenhall street he was on saying he wished to speak to mr partridge at once shown in a good many of his personal belongings had been long since pledged but he had retained one or two suits so that he could make as good an appearance as possible when he went out the clerk had merely said a gentleman wishes to speak to you sir and the merchant looked up enquiringly at him as he entered  i have come to see you sir with reference to that advertisement for a man at your establishment at alexandria  a look of surprise came over the merchants face and he said  have you called on your own account  yes i am anxious to go abroad for the sake of my wifes health and i am not particular as to what i do so that i can take her to a warm climate i may say that i have been two years in egypt and speak arabic and koptic fluently i am strong and active and am ready to make myself useful in any way  mr partridge did not answer for a minute certainly this applicant was not at all the sort of man he had expected to apply for the place in answer to his advertisement that he was evidently a gentleman was far from an advantage but the fact that he could speak the languages would add much to his value  can you give me references he said at last  i cannot sir i should not like to apply to any of my friends in such a matter i must ask you to take me on trust frankly i have quarrelled with my family and have to strike out for myself were it not for my wifes health i could earn my living but i am told it is essential that she should go to a warm climate and as i see no other way of accomplishing this i have applied for this situation hoping that my knowledge of the language and my readiness to perform whatever duties i may be required to do might induce you to give me a trial  and you would if necessarysay in the case of illness of one of my clerksbe ready to help in the office  certainly sir  will you call again in half an hour i will give you an answer then  by the time gregory returned the merchants mind was made up he had come to the conclusion that the story he had heard was a true one the way it had been told was convincing the man was undoubtedly a gentleman there was no mistake in his manner and talk he had quarrelled with his family probably over his marriage and as so many had done found it difficult to keep his head above water his wife had been ordered to a warm climate and he was ready to do anything that would enable him to keep her there  it would assuredly be a great advantage to have one who could act in an emergency as a clerk of course his knowledge of language would greatly add to his utility it certainly was not business to take a man without a reference but the advantages more than counterbalanced the disadvantages it was not likely that he would stay with him long but at any rate the fact that he was taking his wife with him would ensure his staying until he saw something a great deal better elsewhere  when gregory returned therefore he said  i have been thinking this matter over what is your name  gregory hilliard sir  well i have been thinking it over and i have decided to engage you i quite believe the story that you have told me and your appearance fully carries it out you may consider the matter settled i am willing to pay for a secondclass passage for your wife as well as yourself and will give such instructions to my agents there as will render your position as easy for you as possible in the natural course of things your duties would have included the sweeping out of the offices and work of that description but i will instruct him to engage a native to do this under your supervision you will be in charge of the warehouse under the chief storekeeper and as you say you will in case of pressure of work in the office take a desk there  in consideration of your knowledge of the language which will render you at once more useful than a green hand would be i shall add ten shillings a week to the wages named in the advertisement which will enable you to obtain comfortable lodgings  i am heartily obliged to you sir gregory said and will do my best to show that your confidence in me has not been misplaced when do you wish me to sail i shall only require a few hours to make my preparations  then in that case i will take a passage for you and your wife in the p and o that sails next thursday from southampton i may say that it is our custom to allow fifteen pounds for outfit if you will call again in half an hour i will hand you the ticket and a cheque for that amount and you can call the day before you go for a letter to our agents there  gregory ascended the stairs to his lodging with a far more elastic step than usual his wife saw at once as he entered that he had good news of some sort  what is it gregory  thank god darling that i have good news to give you at last i have obtained a situation at about a hundred and thirty pounds a year in alexandria  alexandria she repeated in surprise  yes it is the place of all others that i wanted to go to you see i understand the language that is one thing and what is of infinitely more consequence it is a place that will suit your health and you will i hope very soon get rid of that nasty cough i did not tell you at the time but the doctor i took you to said that this london air did not suit you but that a warm climate would soon set you up again  you are going out there for my sake gregory as if i hadnt brought trouble enough on you already  i would bear a good deal more trouble for your sake dear you need not worry about that  and what are you going to do she asked  i am going to be a sort of useful manextra clerk assistant storekeeper et cetera et cetera i like egypt very much it will suit me to a t at any rate it will be a vast improvement upon this  talking of that i have forgotten the rashers i will go and get them at once we shant have to depend upon them as our main staple in future for fruit is dirt cheap out there and one does not want much meat we shall be able to live like princes on two pounds ten a week and besides this appointment may lead to something better and we may consider that there is a future before us  we are to sail on thursday look here are fifteen golden sovereigns that is for my outfit and we can begin with luxuries at once we shall not want much outfit half a dozen suits of white drill for myself and some gowns for you  nonsense gregory i shant want anything you would not let me sell any of my dresses and i have half a dozen light ones i shall not want a penny spent on me  very well then i will begin to be extravagant at once in the first place i will go down to that confectioners round the corner and we will celebrate my appointment with a cold chicken and a bottle of port i shall be back in five minutes  will it be very hot gregory she asked as they ate their meal not that i am afraid of heat you know i always like summer  no at any rate not at present we are going out at the best time of the year and it will be a comfort indeed to change these november fogs for the sunshine of egypt you will have four or five months to get strong again before it begins to be hot even in summer there are cool breezes morning and evening and of course no one thinks of going out in the middle of the day i feel as happy as a schoolboy at the thought of getting out of this den and this miserable climate and of basking in the sunshine we have had a bad beginning dear but we have better days before us  thank god gregory i have not cared about myself but it has been a trial when your manuscripts have come back to see you sitting here slaving away and to know that it is i who have brought you to this  i brought myself to it you obstinate girl i have pleased myself havent i if a man chooses a path for himself he must not grumble because he finds it rather rougher than he expected i have never for a single moment regretted what i have done at any rate as far as i myself am concerned  nor i for my own sake dear the life of a governess is not so cheerful as to cause one regret at leaving it  and so gregory hartley and his wife went out to alexandria and established themselves in three bright rooms in the upper part of a house that commanded a view of the port and the sea beyond it the outlay required for furniture was small indeed some matting for the floors a few cushions for the divans which ran round the rooms a bed a few simple cooking utensils and a small stock of crockery sufficed  mr ferguson the manager of the branch had at first read the letter that gregory had brought him with some doubt in his mind as to the wisdom of his principal in sending out a man who was evidently a gentleman this feeling however soon wore away and he found him perfectly ready to undertake any work to which he was set  there was indeed nothing absolutely unpleasant about this he was at the office early and saw that the native swept and dusted the offices the rest of the day he was either in the warehouse or carried messages and generally did such odd jobs as were required a fortnight after his arrival one of the clerks was kept away by a sharp attack of fever and as work was pressing the agent asked gregory to take his place  i will do my best sir but i know nothing of mercantile accounts  the work will be in no way difficult mr hardman will take mr parrots ledgers and as you will only have to copy the storekeepers issues into the books five minutes will show you the form in which they are entered  gregory gave such satisfaction that he was afterwards employed at office work whenever there was any pressure  a year and a half passed comfortably at the end of twelve months his pay was raised another ten shillings a week  he had before leaving england signed a contract to remain with the firm for two years he regretted having to do this as it prevented his accepting any better position should an opening occur but he recognized that the condition was a fair one after the firm paying for his outfit and for two passages at the end of eighteen months gregory began to look about for something better  i dont mind my work a bit he said to his wife but if only for the sake of the boy a son had been born a few months after their arrival i must try to raise myself in the scale a bit i have nothing to complain about at the office far from it from what the manager said to me the other day if a vacancy occurred in the office i should have the offer of the berth of course it would be a step for i know from the books that hardman gets two hundred a year which is forty more than i do  i should like you to get something else gregory it troubles me to think that half your time is spent packing up goods in the warehouse and work of that sort and even if we got less i would much rather even if we had to stint ourselves that your work was more suitable to your past and such that you could associate again with gentlemen on even terms  that does not trouble me dear except that i wish you had some society among ladies however both for your sake and the boys and i own i should like it myself i will certainly keep on the lookout for some better position i have often regretted now that i did not go in for a commission in the army i did want to but my father would not hear of it by this time with luck i might have got my company and though the pay would not have been more than i get here it would with quarters and so on have been as much and we should be in a very different social position  however it is of no use talking about that now and indeed it is difficult to make plans at all things are in such an unsettled condition here that there is no saying what will happen  you see arabi and the military party are practically masters here tewfik has been obliged to make concession after concession to them to dismiss ministers at their orders and to submit to a series of humiliations at any moment arabi could dethrone him as he has the whole army at his back and certainly the larger portion of the population the revolution could be completed without trouble or bloodshed but you see it is complicated by the fact that tewfik has the support of the english and french governments and there can be little doubt that the populace regard the movement as a national one and directed as much against foreign control and interference as against tewfik against whom they have no ground of complaint whatever on the part of the army and its generals the trouble has arisen solely on account of the favouritism shown to circassian officers  but once a revolution has commenced it is certain to widen out the peasantry are everywhere fanatically hostile to foreigners attacks have been made upon these in various country districts and should arabi be triumphant the position of christians will become very precarious matters are evidently seen in that light in england for i heard today at the office that the british and french squadrons are expected here in a day or two  if there should be a row our position here will be very unpleasant but i should hardly think that arabi would venture to try his strength against that of the fleets and i fancy that trouble will in the first place begin in cairo both as being the capital of the country and beyond the reach of armed interference by the powers arabis natural course would be to consolidate his power throughout the whole of egypt leaving alexandria severely alone until he had obtained absolute authority elsewhere  anyhow it will be a satisfaction to have the fleet up as at the first rumour of an outbreak i can get you and baby on board one of the ships lying in harbour as a simple measure of precaution i would suggest that you should go out with me this evening and buy one of the costumes worn by the native women it is only a long blue robe enveloping you from head to foot and one of those hideous white cotton veils falling from below the eyes i will get a bottle of iodine and you will then only have to darken your forehead and eyelids and you could pass unsuspected through any crowd  but what are you going to do gregory  i will get a native dress too but you must remember that though if possible i will come to you i may not be able to do so and in case you hear of any tumult going on you must take baby and go down at once to the port you know enough of the language now to be able to tell a boatman to take you off to one of the steamers in the port as soon as i get away i shall go round the port and shall find you without difficulty still i do not anticipate any trouble arising without our having sufficient warning to allow me to come and see you settled on board ship and i can then keep on in the office until it closes when i can join you again  of course all this is very remote and i trust that the occasion will never arise still there is no doubt that the situation is critical and there is no harm in making our preparations for the worst  at any rate dear i beg that you will not go out alone till matters have settled down we will do the shopping together when i come back from the office  there is one thing that i have reason to be grateful for even if the worst comes to the worst and all christians have to leave the country the object for which i came out here has been attained i have not heard you cough for months we have laid by fifty pounds and i have written some forty stories long and short and if we go back i have a fair hope of making my way for i am sure that i write better than i used to do and as a good many of the stories are laid in egypt the local colouring will give them a distinctive character and they are more likely to be accepted than those i wrote before editors of magazines like a succession of tales of that kind  for the present there is no doubt that the arrival of the fleet will render our position here more comfortable than it is at present the mere mob of the town would hesitate to attack europeans when they know that three or four thousand sailors could land in half an hour but on the other hand arabi and his generals might see that alexandria was after all the most important position and that it was here foreign interference must be arrested  i should not be surprised if on the arrival of the ships tewfik arabi and all the leaders of the movement come here at once tewfik will come to get the support of the fleet arabi will come to oppose a landing of troops the war in the beginning of the century was decided at alexandria and it may be so again if i were sure that you would come to no harm and i think the chances of that are very small i own that all this would be immensely interesting and a break to the monotony of ones life here  one thing is fairly certain if there is anything like a regular row all commercial work will come to an end until matters are settled in which case even if the offices are not altogether closed and the whole staff recalled to england they would be glad enough to allow me to leave instead of keeping me to the two years agreement that i signed before starting  i should hardly think that there would be a tumult here gregory the natives all seem very gentle and peaceable and the army is composed of the same sort of men  they have been kept down for centuries annie but there is a deep fanatical feeling in every mussulmans nature and at any rate the great proportion of the officers of the army are mussulmans as for the kopts there would be no danger of trouble from them but the cry of death to the christians would excite every mahomedan in the land almost to madness  unfortunately too there is a general belief whether truly founded or not that although the french representative here is apparently acting in concert with ours he and all the french officials are secretly encouraging arabi and will take no active steps whatever in that case it is doubtful whether england would act alone the jealousy between the two peoples here is intense for years the french have been thwarting us at every turn and they may very well think that however matters might finally go our interference would make us so unpopular in egypt that their influence would become completely paramount  supremacy in egypt has always been the dream of the french had it not been for our command of the sea they would have obtained possession of the country in napoleons time their intrigues here have for years been incessant their newspapers in egypt have continually maligned us and they believe that the time has come when they will be the real if not the nominal rulers of egypt the making of the suez canal was quite as much a political as a commercial move and it has certainly added largely to their influence here though in this respect a check was given to them by the purchase of the khedives shares in the canal by lord beaconsfield a stroke which however greatly increased the enmity of the french here and heightened their efforts to excite the animosity of the people against us  well i hope that whatever comes of all this the question as to whose influence is to be paramount in egypt will be finally settled even french domination would be better than the constant intrigues and trouble that keep the land in a state of agitation however i fancy that it will be the other way if an english fleet comes here and there is trouble i dont think we shall back down and if we begin in earnest we are sure to win in the long run france must see that and if she refuses to act at the last moment it can only be because arabi has it in his power to produce documents showing that he was all along acting in accordance with her secret advice  a week later on the 20th of may the squadrons of england and france anchored off alexandria the british fleet consisted of eight ironclads and five gunboats carrying three thousand five hundred and thirtynine men and one hundred and two guns commanded by sir frederick seymour two days before the approach of the fleet was known at cairo the french and english consuls proposed that the khedive should issue a decree declaring a general amnesty and that the president of the council the minister of war and the three military pashas should quit the country for a year this request was complied with  the ministry resigned in a body on the day the fleet arrived on the ground that the khedive acquiesced in foreign interference a great meeting was held of the chief personages of state and the officers and the representatives of the army at once told the khedive that they refused to obey his orders and only recognized the authority of the porte  at alexandria all trade ceased at once when it became known that the troops were busy strengthening the forts mounting cannon and preparing for a resistance that this was done by the orders of arabi who was now practically dictator there could be no question the native population became more and more excited being firmly of belief that no vessels could resist the fire of the heavy guns and that any attempt on the part of the menofwar to reduce the place would end in their being sunk as soon as fighting began  the office and stores were still kept open but gregorys duties were almost nominal and he and mr parrot who was also married were told by the manager that they could spend the greater portion of their time at their homes part of gregorys duties consisted in going off to vessels that came into the port with goods for the firm and seeing to their being brought on shore and he had no difficulty in making arrangements with the captain of one of these ships for his wife and child to go on board at once should there be any trouble in the town  if you hear any sounds of tumult annie you must disguise yourself at once and go down to the wharf i have arranged with our boatman allen whom you know well as we have often gone out with him for a sail in the evening that if he hears of an outbreak he shall bring the boat to the steps at the end of this street and take you off to the simoon of course i shall come if i can but our house is one of those which have been marked off as being most suitable for defence the men from half a dozen other establishments are to gather there and as belonging to the house i must aid in the defence of course if i get sufficient warning i shall slip on my disguise and hurry here and see you down to the boat and then make my way back to our place but do not wait for me if i come here and find that you have gone i shall know that you have taken the alarm in time and shall return at once to the office  of course if the outbreak commences near here and you find that your way down to the water is blocked you will simply put on your disguise stain your face and wait till i come to you or till you see that the way to the water is clear do not attempt to go out into a mob there are not likely to be any women among them however i do not anticipate a serious riot they may attack europeans in the street but with some fourteen or fifteen menofwar in the port they are not likely to make any organized assault arabis agents will hardly precipitate matters in that way hard as they may work it will take a month to get the defences into proper order and any rising will be merely a spasmodic outbreak of fanaticism i dont think the danger is likely to be pressing until finding that all remonstrances are vain the admiral begins to bombard the port  i will do exactly as you tell me gregory if i were alone i could not bring myself to leave without you but i must think of the child  quite so dear that is the first consideration certainly if it comes to a fight i should be much more comfortable with the knowledge that you and baby were in safety  the egyptian soldiers were quartered for the most part outside the town and for some days there was danger that they would enter and attack the european inhabitants but arabis orders were strict that until he gave the command they were to remain quiet  the british admiral sent messages to tewfik insisting that the work upon the fortifications should cease and the latter again issued orders to that effect but these were wholly disobeyed he had indeed no shadow of authority remaining and the work continued night and day it was however as much as possible concealed from observation but search lights being suddenly turned upon the forts at night showed them to be swarming with men  things went on with comparative quiet till the 10th of june although the attitude of the natives was so threatening that no europeans left their houses except on urgent business on that day a sudden uproar was heard pistols were fired and the merchants closed their stores and barricaded their doors  gregory was in the harbour at the time and jumping into his boat rowed to the stairs and hurried home he found that his wife had already disguised herself and was in readiness to leave  the street was full of excited people he slipped on his own disguise darkened his face and then seizing a moment when the crowd had rushed up the street at the sound of firearms at the other end hurried down to the boat and rowed off to the simoon  i must return now dear he said i can get in at the back gatei have the key as the stores are brought in through that way i do not think that you need feel any uneasiness the row is evidently still going on but only a few guns are being fired now certainly the rascals cannot be attacking the stores or you would hear a steady musketry fire by the sound the riot is principally in the foreign quarter where the maltese greeks and italians congregate no doubt the police will soon put it down  the police however made no attempt to do so and permitted the work of massacre to take place under their eyes nearly two hundred europeans were killed the majority of these dwelt in the foreign quarter but several merchants and others were set upon while making their way to their offices and some seamen from the fleet were also among the victims the british consul was dragged out of his carriage and severely injured the consulate was attacked and several frenchmen were killed in the streets  the khedive hurried from cairo on hearing the news arabi was now sending some of his best regiments to alexandria while pretending to be preparing for a raid upon the suez canal he was receiving the assistance of dervish pasha the sultans representative and had been recognized by the sultan who conferred upon him the highest order of medjidie  in the meantime a conference had been held by the powers and it was decided that the sultan should be entrusted with the work of putting down the insurrection he being nominally lord paramount of egypt but conditions were laid down as to his army leaving the country afterwards  the sultan sent an evasive reply the khedive was too overwhelmed at the situation to take any decisive course france hesitated and england determined that with or without allies she would take the matter in hand    chapter 2 the rising in alexandria   the harbour was full of merchant ships as there were at present no means of getting their cargoes unloaded the native boatmen had for the most part struck work and had they been willing to man their boats they must have remained idle as in view of the situation the merchants felt that their goods were much safer on board ship than they would be in their magazines it was settled therefore that for the present annie and the child should remain on board the simoon while gregory should take up his residence at the office  the fleet in the harbour was now an imposing one not only were the english and french squadrons there but some italian ships of war had arrived and a united states cruiser and on the 7th of july sir beauchamp seymour sent in a decisive message that he should commence a bombardment of the fort unless the strengthening of the fortifications was at once abandoned no heed was taken of the intimation and three days later he sent an ultimatum demanding the cessation of work and the immediate surrender of the forts nearest to the entrance to the harbour stating that if these terms were not complied with in twentyfour hours the bombardment would commence  already the greater part of the european inhabitants had left the town and taken up their quarters in the merchant ships that had been engaged for the purpose a few however of the bankers and merchants determined to remain these gathered in the bank and in mr fergusons house to which the most valuable goods in other establishments were removed they had an ample supply of firearms and believed that they could hold out for a considerable time they were convinced that the egyptian troops would not for an hour resist the fire that would be opened upon them but would speedily evacuate the town and that therefore there would only be the mob to be encountered and this but for a short time as the sailors would land as soon as the egyptian troops fled  the egyptians on the other hand believed absolutely in their ability to destroy the fleet  both parties were wrong the europeans greatly undervalued the fighting powers of the egyptians animated as they were by confidence in the strength of the defences by their number and by their fanaticism while the egyptians similarly undervalued the tremendous power of our ships  that evening and the next morning the port presented an animated appearance boats were putting off with those inhabitants who had waited on hoping that the egyptians would at the last moment give in many of the merchantmen had already cleared out others were getting up sail smoke was rising from the funnels of all the men of war  an express boat had brought from france orders that the french fleet were to take no part in the proceedings but were to proceed at once to port said this order excited the bitterest feeling of anger and humiliation among the french officers and sailors who had relied confidently in taking their part in the bombardment and silently their ships one by one left the port the italian and american vessels remained for a time and as the british ships followed in stately order their crews manned the rigging and vociferously cheered our sailors who replied as heartily  all save the british men of war took up their stations well out at sea in a direction where they would be out of the fire of the egyptian batteries it was not until nine oclock in the evening that the two last british ships the invincible and monarch steamed out of port at halfpast four in the morning the ships got under weigh again and moved to the positions marked out for them  fort mex and the batteries on the sand hills were faced by the penelope the monarch and the invincible the alexandra the superb and the sultan faced the harbour forts ada pharos and raselteen the temeraire and inflexible prepared to aid the invincible in her attack on fort mex or to support the three battleships engaged off the port as might be required and the five gunboats moved away towards fort marabout which lay some distance to the west of the town  at seven oclock the alexandra began the engagement by firing a single gun then the whole fleet opened fire the egyptian artillerymen replying with great steadiness and resolution there was scarcely a breath of wind and the ships were in a few instants shrouded in their own smoke and were frequently obliged to cease firing until this drifted slowly away to enable them to aim their guns the rattle of the machine guns added to the din midshipmen were sent aloft and these signalled down to the deck the result of each shot so that the gunners were enabled to direct their fire even when they could not see ten yards beyond the muzzle of the guns  in a short time the forts and batteries showed how terrible was the effect of the great shells the embrasures were torn and widened there were great gaps in the masonry of the buildings and the hail of missiles from the machine guns swept every spot near the egyptian guns and yet arabis soldiers did not flinch but in spite of the number that fell worked their guns as fast as ever  had they been accustomed to the huge krupp guns in their batteries the combat would have been more equal and although the end would have been the same the ships must have suffered terribly fortunately the egyptian artillerymen had little experience in the working of these heavy pieces and their shot in almost every case flew highsometimes above the masts sometimes between them but in only a few instances striking the hull with their smaller guns they made good practice but though the shot from these pieces frequently struck they dropped harmlessly from the iron sides and only those that entered through the portholes effected any damage  the condor under lord charles beresford was the first to engage fort marabout and for a time the little gunboat was the mark of all the guns of the fort but the other four gunboats speedily came to her assistance and effectually diverted the fire of the fort from the ships that were engaging fort mex  at eight oclock the monarch having silenced the fort opposite to her and dismounted the guns joined the inflexible and penelope in their duel with fort mex and by nine oclock all the guns were silenced except four two of which were heavy rifled guns well sheltered in spite of the heavy fire from the three great ships the egyptian soldiers maintained their fire the officers frequently exposing themselves to the bullets of the machine guns by leaping upon the parapet to ascertain the effect of their own shot  the harbour forts were by this time crumbling under the shot of four warships opposed to them the pharos suffered most heavily and its guns were absolutely silenced while the fire from the other two forts slackened considerably at halfpast ten it was seen that the raselteen palace which lay behind the fort was on fire and half an hour later the fire from that fort and fort ada almost died out  the british admiral now gave the signal to cease firing and as the smoke cleared away the effects of the five hours bombardment were visible the forts and batteries were mere heaps of ruins the guns could be made out lying dismounted or standing with their muzzles pointing upwards  the ships had not come out scatheless but their injuries were for the most part immaterial although rigging had been cut away bulwarks smashed and sides dinted one gun of the penelope had been disabled and two of the alexandra only five men had been killed altogether and twentyseven wounded  no sign was made of surrender and an occasional fire was kept up on the forts to prevent the egyptians from repairing damages at one oclock twelve volunteers from the invincible started to destroy the guns of fort mex their fire had ceased and no men were to be seen in the fort but they might have been lying in wait to attack any landing party  on nearing the shore the surf was found to be too heavy for the boat to pass through it and major tulloch and six men swam ashore and entered the fort it was found to be deserted and all the guns but two teninch pieces dismounted the charges of gun cotton that the swimmers brought ashore with them were placed in the cannon and their muzzles blown off after performing this very gallant service the little party swam back to their boat  the british admirals position was now a difficult one there were no signs of surrender for aught he could tell fifteen thousand egyptian troops might be lying round the ruined forts or in the town hard by in readiness to oppose a landing that these troops were not to be despised was evident by the gallantry with which they had fought their guns this force would be aided by the mass of the population and it would be hazardous indeed to risk the loss of fifteen hundred men and the reversal of the success already gained  at the same time it was painful to think that the europeans on shore might be massacred and the whole city destroyed by the exasperated troops and fanatical population it was known that the number of englishmen there was not large two or three hundred at most but there was a much larger number of the lower class of europeansport labourers fishermen petty shopkeepers and otherswho had preferred taking their chance to the certainty of losing all their little possessions if they left them  anxiously the glasses of those on board the ships were directed towards the shore in hopes of seeing the white flag hoisted or a boat come out with it flying but there were no signs of the intentions of the defenders and the fleet prepared to resume the action in the morning fort marabout and several of the batteries on the shore were still unsilenced and two heavy guns mounted on the moncrieff system by which the gun rose to a level of the parapet fired and instantly sank again had continued to fire all day in spite of the efforts of the fleet to silence them  next morning however there was a long heavy swell and the ironclads were rolling too heavily for anything like accuracy of aim but as parties of men could be seen at work in the moncrieff battery fire was opened upon them and they speedily evacuated it  all night the palace of raselteen burned fiercely another great fire was raging in the heart of the town and anxiety for those on shore for the time overpowered the feeling of exultation at the victory that had been gained  at halfpast ten a white flag was hoisted at the pharos battery and all on board watched with deep anxiety what was to follow lieutenant lambton at once steamed into the fort in the bittern to enquire if the government were ready to surrender it was three oclock before he steamed out again with the news that his mission was fruitless and that the white flag had only been hoisted by the officer in command of the fort to enable himself and his men to get away unmolested lieutenant lambton had obtained an interview with the military governor on behalf of the government and told him that we were not at war with egypt and had simply destroyed the forts because they threatened the fleet that we had no conditions to impose upon the government but were ready to discuss any proposal and that the troops would be allowed to evacuate the forts with the honour of war  it was most unfortunate that the fleet had not brought with them two or three thousand troops had they done so they could have landed at once and saved a great portion of the town from destruction but as he had no soldiers the admiral could not land a portion of the sailors as the large egyptian force in the town which was still protected by a number of land batteries might fall upon them  at five oclock the helicon was sent in to say that white flags would not be noticed unless hoisted by authority and if they were again shown the british admiral would consider them the signs of a general surrender it was a long time before the helicon returned with news that no communication had been received from the enemy that the barracks and arsenals seemed to be deserted and as far as could be seen the whole town was evacuated  as evening wore on fresh fires broke out in all parts of the town and a steam pinnace was sent ashore to ascertain if possible the state of affairs mr ross a contractor for the supply of meat to the fleet volunteered to accompany it  the harbour was dark and deserted not a light was to be seen in the houses near the water the crackling of the flames could be heard with an occasional crash of falling walls and roofs on nearing the landing place the pinnace paused for two or three minutes for those on board to listen and as all was quiet steamed alongside mr ross jumped ashore and the boat backed off a few yards  a quarter of an hour later he returned that quarter of the town was entirely deserted and he had pushed on until arrested by a barrier of flames the great square was on fire from end to end the european quarter generally was in flames and he could see by the litter that strewed the streets that the houses had been plundered before being fired  when daylight broke a number of europeans could be seen at the edge of the water in the harbour boats were at once lowered and the crews armed to the teeth rowed ashore here they found about a hundred europeans many of them wounded when rioting had broken out they had as arranged assembled at the angloegyptian bank they were taken off to the merchant steamers lying behind the fleet and their information confirmed the worst forebodings of the fugitives there  when the first gun of the bombardment was fired gregory had gone up with the other employees to the top of the house where they commanded a view over the whole scene of action after the first few minutes firing they could see but little for batteries and ships were alike shrouded in smoke at first there had been some feeling of insecurity and a doubt whether a shot too highly aimed might not come into the town but the orders to abstain carefully from injuring the city had been well observed and except to the palace and a few houses close to the waters edge no damage was done  towards evening all those who had resolved to remain behind gathered at the angloegyptian bank or at mr fergusons but a consultation was held later and it was agreed that next morning all should go to the bank which was a far more massive building with fewer entrances and greater facilities for defence when the town was quiet therefore all were employed in transferring valuable goods there and the house was then locked up and left to its fate against a mere rising of the rabble the latter might have been successfully defended but there was little doubt that before leaving the town the troops would join the fanatics and in that case a house not built with a special eye for defence could hardly hope to hold out against persistent attack  the bank however might hope to make a stout defence it was built of massive stone the lower windows were barred and a strong barricade was built against the massive doors a hundred and twenty resolute men all well armed could hold it against even a persistent attack if unsupported by artillery  early in the afternoon all felt that the critical moment had approached throughout the night a fire had raged from the opposite side of the great square where several deserted houses had been broken into and plundered by the mob but the soldiers stationed in the square had prevented any further disorder  now however parties of troops from the forts began to pour in it was already known that their losses had been very heavy and that many of the forts had been destroyed soon they broke up and joining the mob commenced the work of pillage doors were blown in shutters torn off and with wild yells and shouts the native population poured in the work of destruction had begun  the garrison of the bank saw many europeans hurrying too late to reach that shelter murdered before their eyes in the levantine quarter the cracking of pistols and the shouts of men showed that the work of massacre was proceeding there soon every door of the houses in the great square was forced in and ere long great numbers of men loaded with spoil of all kinds staggered out  so far the bank had been left alone but it was now its turn and the mob poured down upon it as they came up a sharp fire broke out from every window answered by a discharge of muskets and pistols from the crowd here men fell fast but they had been worked up to such a pitch of excitement and fanaticism that the gaps were more than filled by fresh comers  all the afternoon and evening the fight continued in vain the mob endeavoured to break down the massive iron bars of the windows and batter in the doors although many of the defenders were wounded and several killed by the fire from the windows of the neighbouring houses and from the road their steady fire at the points most hotly attacked drove their assailants back again and again  at twelve oclock the assault slackened the soldiers had long left and so far as could be seen from the roof of the house had entirely evacuated the town and as this fact became known to the mob the thought of the consequences of their action cooled their fury for they knew that probably the troops would land from the british ships next day each man had his plunder to secure and gradually the crowd melted away  by two oclock all was quiet and although occasionally fresh fires burst out in various quarters of the town there could be little doubt that the great bulk of the population had followed the example of the army and had left the city  then the besieged gathered in the great office on the ground floor and as it was agreed that there would be probably no renewal of the attack they quietly left the house locking the doors after them and made their way down to the shore they believed that they were the only survivors but when they reached the end of the town they found that the building of the credit lyonnais had also been successfully defended though the ottoman bank had been overpowered and all within it upwards of a hundred in number killed  gregory had done his full share in the defence and received a musket ball in the shoulder his wife had passed a terrible time while the conflagration was raging and it was evident that the populace had risen and were undoubtedly murdering as well as burning and plundering and her delight was indeed great when she saw her husband with others approaching in a manofwars boat the fact that one arm was in a sling was scarcely noticed in her joy at his return alive  thank god you are safe she said as he came up the gangway it has been an awful time and i had almost given up hope of ever seeing you alive again  i told you dear that i felt confident we could beat off the scum of the town of course it was a sharp fight but there was never any real danger of their breaking in we only lost about half a dozen out of nearly a hundred and twenty and some twenty of us were wounded my injury is not at all serious and i shall soon be all right again it is only a broken collarbone  however it has been a terrible time the great square and almost all the european quarter have been entirely destroyed the destruction of property is something frightful and most of the merchants will be absolutely ruined fortunately our firm were insured pretty well up to the full value  but i thought that they could not break in there  we all moved out the evening before to the angloegyptian bank the town was full of troops and we doubted whether we could hold the place as the bank was much stronger we agreed that it was better to join the two garrisons and fight it out there and i am very glad we did so for i doubt whether we could have defended our place successfully  mr ferguson and the clerks had all come off with gregory to the simoon on board which there was plenty of accommodation for them as it was not one of the ships that had been taken up for the accommodation of the fugitives among the party who came on board was a doctor who had taken part in the defence of the bank and had attended to the wounded as the fight went on he did so again that evening and told gregory that in a month he would if he took care of himself be able to use his arm again  the next morning there was a consultation in the cabin mr ferguson had gone on shore late the previous afternoon as five hundred sailors had been landed and had returned in the evening  it is certain he said that nothing can be done until the place is rebuilt the sailors are busy at work fighting the fire but there are continued fresh outbreaks the bulk of the natives have left but arabi before marching out opened the prisons and released the convicts and these and the scum of the town are still there and continue the destruction whenever they get a chance a score or two have been caught red handed and shot down and a number of others have been flogged  another batch of sailors will land this morning and order will soon be restored unless arabi who is encamped with some ten thousand men two miles outside the town makes an effort to recover the place i dont think he is likely to do so for now that the european houses have all been destroyed there would be no longer any reluctance to bombard the town itself and even if arabi did recover it he would very soon be shelled out  by the way a larger number of people have been saved than was imagined several of the streets in the poor european quarters have escaped the people barricaded the ends and fought so desperately that their assailants drew off finding it easier to plunder the better quarters even if the mob had overcome the resistance of the defenders of the lanes they would have found little worth taking there so some five hundred europeans have escaped and these will be very useful  charley beresford has charge of the police arrangements on shore and he has gangs of them at work fighting the fire and all the natives are forced to assist the wires will be restored in a day or two when i shall of course telegraph for instructions and have no doubt that mr partridge will send out orders to rebuild as soon as order is completely restored  i imagine that most of us will be recalled home until that is done even if the place were intact no business would be done as our goods would be of little use to the navy or army for no doubt an army will be sent arabi is as powerful as ever but now that we have taken the matter in hand it must be carried through  at any rate there will be no clerks work to be done here the plans for a new building will naturally be prepared at home and a foreman of works sent out it is a bad job for us all but as it is we must not complain for we have escaped with our lives and i hope that in six months we may open again however we can form no plans until i receive instructions from home  gregory did not go ashore for the next week by which time order had been completely restored the fires extinguished and the streets made at least passable the sailors had been aided by a battalion of marines which had been telegraphed for from malta by the admiral before the bombardment began the khedive had returned to haselteen which had only been partly destroyed as soon as the bluejackets entered his arrival put an end to all difficulties as henceforward our operations were carried on nominally by his orders  the american ships entered the harbour the next day and the naval officer in command landed one hundred and twentyfive men to assist our bluejackets and two days later the 38th regiment and a battalion of the 60th rifles arrived  the shops in the streets that escaped destruction gradually reopened and country people began to bring in supplies many of the refugees on board the ships sailed for home while those who found their houses still standing although everything in them was smashed and destroyed set to work to make them habitable soon temporary sheds were erected and such portions of the cargoes on board the merchantmen as would be likely to find a sale were landed  before the end of the week mr ferguson had received an answer to his telegram three days previously he had received a wire have written fully the letter came via marseilles after congratulations at the escape of himself and the staff mr partridge wrote  as you say that the house and warehouse are entirely destroyed with all contents there can be nothing for you and the clerks to do and you had best return at once to england i will make the best arrangements that i can for you all  as i have a plan of the ground i have already instructed an architect to prepare a sketch for rebuilding on a larger scale than before the insurance companies are sending out agents to verify claims looking at your last report it seems to me that the loss of goods as well as that of buildings will be fully covered should any of the staff determine to remain in alexandria and to take their chance of finding something to do you are authorized to pay them three months salary and to promise to reinstate them as soon as we reopen  i anticipate no further disturbances whatever a strong force is being sent out and there can be no doubt that arabi will be crushed as soon as it is ready to take the field  other directions followed but these were only amplifications of those mentioned  what do you think annie gregory said when ferguson had read to his staff that portion of the letter that concerned them shall we take the three months pay and remain here or shall we go back to england  what do you think yourself  there are two lights in which to look at it annie first which would be best for us and secondly which shall we like best of course the first is the more difficult point to decide you see partridge doesnt say that we shall be kept on he only says that he will do his best for us i dont think that there is any chance of his keeping us on at full pay if he intended to do so it would have been cheaper for him to give us our pay here in which case he would save our passages back to england and out again i think we could not reckon on getting anything like full pay while we were in england and you know i have lost faith in my literary powers i think i have improved but i certainly should not like after our last experience to trust to that for keeping us in england  the question is what should i do here there will be plenty of openings for men who can speak the native language as labour overseers the contractors for food for the army will want men of that sort and as i know several of them through my work in the port and being in partridges house i have no doubt i could get employment that way and carry on very well till trade is open again and obtain then a good deal better berth than they would offer me no doubt one could get employment in the transport or commissariat of the army when it comes out that will be a thing to think seriously of  my objections to that are personal ones in the first place it would lead to nothing when the affair is over in the second place i should be certain to meet men i knew at harrow or at the university or since then and i own that i should shrink from that as gregory hilliard i dont mind carrying a parcel or helping to load a dray but i should not like as gregory hartley to be known to be doing that sort of thing personally i feel not the smallest humiliation in doing so but i dont think it would be fair to geoffrey i should not like it myself if i were an earl for fellows who knew him to be able to say that my brother was knocking about in egypt as an interpreter or mule driver or something of that sort that certainly has to be taken into consideration  it is not likely that i should get any sort of berth that an officer would be appointed to for every officer in the army whose regiment is not coming out here will be rushing to the war office to apply for any sort of appointment that would enable him to come out to the war  again it is almost certain that when this business is overand i dont suppose it will last long after we get an army out herea fresh egyptian force will be raised you may be sure that the greater portion of our troops will be hurried back as soon as it is over and that as the present egyptian army will be altogether smashed up it will be absolutely necessary that there should be a force of some kind or other that can put a stop to this mahdi fellows doings he has overrun half the soudan and inflicted serious defeats on the egyptian troops there he has captured a considerable portion of kordofan and of course it is owing to his insurrection that those rows have occurred down at the red sea where our men have been fighting  it is likely enough that they may appoint some british officers to the new force and i might get a fair position on it they will want interpreters there promotion will be sure to be rapid and i might have opportunities of distinguishing myself and get an appointment where i could without discrediting it take my own name again  these are only among the things that might be but at the worst i am certain to get some sort of post at alexandria which would enable us to live without trenching upon the three months pay that is offered me and then if i could see nothing better i could return to partridges employment when they reopen here and i have no doubt that they would improve my position  i dont think that parrott is likely to come back again the climate did not suit him and he is always having attacks of fever ferguson has i know for he told me so reported very favourably about my work to headquarters and as i have been wounded in defence of the house i have an additional claim the others will of course be moved up and i should get the junior clerkshipno advance in the way of remuneration but a great improvement in position  so i think we had better accept the three months pay and take our chances at any rate there will be no fear of another disturbance at alexandria the mob have had a lesson here that they are not likely to forget and i should fancy that although we may withdraw the army two or three regiments will be left here and at cairo for a long time to come we should be fools indeed if we threw away the money that this business will cost before it is over and let egypt slip altogether out of our fingers again france has forfeited her right to have anything to say in the matter in our hands it will be a very valuable possession and certainly our stay here would be of inestimable advantage to the natives as we should govern egypt as we govern india and do away with the tyranny oppression and extortion of the native officials  mrs hilliard quite agreed with her husband and accordingly the next day gregory informed mr ferguson that he would accept the three months pay and his discharge and should at any rate for a time remain in alexandria  i think you are right hilliard there will be lots of opportunities here for a man who knows the language as you do if you like i will speak to mr ross i saw him yesterday in the town and he said that two of his assistants had been killed he has already obtained a fresh contract and a very heavy one for the supply of meat for the troops as they arrive and i have no doubt he would be very glad to engage you on good terms though the engagement could only be made during the stay of the army here  thank you sir i shall be much obliged to you if you will do so and i would rather that the engagement should be a temporary one on both sides so that i should be free to leave at a few days notice  the contractor after a chat with gregory hilliard was glad to secure his services he saw the advantage that it would be to have a gentleman to represent him with the army instead of an agent of a very different kind other men would do to purchase animals from the arabs or to receive them at the ports when they were brought over from spain and italy but it required a variety of qualities difficult to obtain in the same person to act as agent with the army gregory was exactly the man required and he was soon on excellent terms both with the officers of the quartermasters department and the contractors who brought in the cargoes of cattle  as soon as the bulk of the army sailed from alexandria to ismailia he made the latter town his headquarters and by his power of work his tact and good temper he smoothed away all the difficulties that so often arise between contractors and army officials and won the goodwill of all with whom he came in contact when the army removed to cairo after the defeat and dispersal of arabis force at telelkebir gregory established himself there and was joined by his wife and child  as soon as matters settled down and a considerable portion of the troops had left egypt mr ross said to him  of course our operations in the future will be comparatively small mr hilliard and i must reduce my staff  i quite understand that gregory replied and i knew that i should have to look out for something else  i shall be very sorry to lose your services which have indeed been invaluable and i am sure have been appreciated by the army men as much as by myself i certainly should not think of your leaving me until you get another berth and it is only because i see an opening if you like to take it that might lead to something better in the future than anything i can offer you  you know that colonel hicks arrived here a fortnight since and is to take command of the egyptian army and to have the rank of pasha several officers have received appointments on his staff he will shortly be going up to khartoum i was speaking to him yesterday and as i was doing so two of the officers of wolseleys staff came in a question of supplies came up and i mentioned your name and said that i thought that you were the very man for him that you were master of arabic and an excellent organizer and a very important matter where there were so few english officers together a gentleman  one of the officers who knew the work that you had done at once confirmed what i had said and declared that wolseleys quartermaster general would speak as warmly in your favour hicks told me that until he got up to khartoum he could not say what arrangements would be made for the supplies but that he would at any rate be very glad to have you with him in the capacity of a firstclass interpreter and for general service with the staff with the temporary rank of captain with the special view of your services in organizing a supply train when he moved forward i said that i should speak to you and ascertain your views  i am very much obliged to you indeed i must take twentyfour hours to think it over of course i shall be guided to some extent by the question whether the appointment would be likely to be a permanent one  that i have no doubt indeed hicks said as much i asked him the question and he replied i can hardly make a permanent appointment now as i am not quite in the saddle but i have no doubt from what you say that mr hilliard will make a valuable officer and after our first campaign i shall without difficulty be able to obtain him a permanent appointment in the egyptian army  i thank you most heartily mr ross it seems to me a grand opening there is no doubt that as our troops leave the egyptian army will be thoroughly reorganized and there will be many openings for a man who knows the language and is ready to work hard and no doubt the regiments will be largely officered by englishmen  that evening gregory had a long talk with his wife  i dont like the thought of leaving you even for a time but no doubt when the mahdi is settled with you will be able to join me at khartoum which i believe is by no means an unpleasant place to live in of course i shall come down and take you up it is a splendid chance and will really be my reinstatement once holding a commission in the egyptian army i should resume my own name and have the future to look forward to entering the service as the army is being reorganized i should have a great pull and should be sure to get on and be able to write to my father and brother without its appearing that i wanted help of any kind  there were tears in mrs hilliards eyes but she said bravely  i quite agree with you gregory of course i shall be sorry that you should leave me even for a time but it seems to me too that it is a grand opportunity you know what a pain it was to me all the time that we were at alexandria that you should be working in such a subordinate position now there is an opening by which you will be in a position ere long more worthy of your birth and education i have no doubt i shall get on very well here i believe that hicks pasha has brought his wife out with him here and some of his officers will no doubt be married men also and as the wife of one of his officers i shall of course get to know them i should be selfish indeed to say a word to keep you back and shall be delighted to think of you associating with other english gentlemen as one of themselves  and so it was settled the next day gregory called on hicks pasha the latter had made some more enquiries respecting him and was well pleased with his appearance  i have already a gentleman named as staff interpreter mr hilliard but i can appoint you at once interpreter to the quartermasters department attached to my personal staff for the present i can tell you that the egyptian army will be largely increased and i shall be able after a time to procure you a better appointment when we have once defeated the mahdi and restored order there will be many appointments open for the reorganization of the soudan there are a good many preparations to be made before i leave which i expect to do in the course of three or four weeks and i shall be glad of your assistance as soon as you can join us  i shall be glad to do so at once mr ross has kindly told me that i am at liberty to resign my post under him as soon as i like  very well then you may consider yourself appointed today my intention is to go first to suakim and thence up to berber and so by water to khartoum  the next three weeks passed rapidly gregory was on the following day introduced to the various officers of hicks pashas staff and on learning that he was married the general asked him and his wife to dinner to make the acquaintance of lady hicks and the wives of three of his fellow officers  at last the time came for parting annie bore up well and although when alone she had many a cry she was always cheerful and went with her husband and saw him off at the station of the railway for ismailia without breaking down badly    chapter 3 a terrible disaster   it was an anxious time for his wife after gregory started he and those with him had left with a feeling of confidence that the insurrection would speedily be put down the garrison of khartoum had inflicted several severe defeats upon the mahdi but had also suffered some reverses this however was only to be expected when the troops under him were scarcely more disciplined than those of the dervishes who had always been greatly superior in numbers and inspired with a fanatical belief in their prophet but with british officers to command and british officers to drill and discipline the troops there could be no fear of a recurrence of these disasters  before they started mrs hilliard had become intimate with the wife of hicks pasha and those of the other married officers and had paid visits with them to the harems of high turkish officials visits were frequently exchanged and what with these and the care of the boy her time was constantly occupied she received letters from gregory as frequently as possible after his arrival at omdurman and until he set out with the main body under the general on the way to el obeid  before starting he said he hoped that in another two months the campaign would be over el obeid recovered and the mahdi smashed up and that as soon as they returned to khartoum hicks pasha would send for his wife and daughters and the other married officers for their wives and of course she would accompany them  i cannot say much for omdurman he wrote but khartoum is a nice place many of the houses there have shady gardens hicks has promised to recommend me for a majority in one of the turkish regiments in the intervals of my own work i have got up drill i shall of course tell him then what my real name is so that i can be gazetted in it it is likely enough that even after we defeat the mahdi this war may go on for some time before it is stamped out and in another year i may be a fullblown colonel if only an egyptian one and as the pay of the english officers is good i shall be able to have a very comfortable home for you  i need not repeat my instructions darling as to what you must do in the event improbable as it is of disaster when absolutely assured of my death but not until then you will go back to england with the boy and see my father he is not a man to change his mind unless i were to humble myself before him but i think he would do the right thing for you if he will not there is the letter for geoffrey he has no settled income at present but when he comes into the title he will i feel quite certain make you an allowance i know that you would for yourself shrink from doing this but for the boys sake you will not hesitate to carry out my instructions i should say you had better write to my father for the interview might be an unpleasant one but if you have to appeal to geoffrey you had better call upon him and show him this letter i feel sure that he will do what he can  gregory  a month later a messenger came up from suakim with a despatch dated october 3rd the force was then within a few days march of el obeid the news was not altogether cheering hordes of the enemy hovered about their rear communication was already difficult and they had to depend upon the stores they carried and cut themselves off altogether from the base he brought some private letters from the officers and among them one for mrs hilliard it was short and written in pencil  in a few days dear the decisive battle will take place and although it will be a tough fight none of us have any fear of the result in the very improbable event of a defeat i shall if i have time slip on the arab dress i have with me and may hope to escape however i have little fear that it will come to that god bless and protect you and the boy  gregory  a month passed away no news came from hicks pasha or any of his officers then there were rumours current in the bazaars of disaster and one morning when annie called upon lady hicks she found several of the ladies there with pale and anxious faces she paused at the door  do not be alarmed mrs hilliard lady hicks said nizim pasha has been here this morning he thought that i might have heard the rumours that are current in the bazaar that there has been a disaster but he says there is no confirmation whatever of these reports he does not deny however that they have caused anxiety among the authorities for sometimes these rumours whose origin no one knows do turn out to be correct he said that enquiries have been made but no foundation for the stories can be got at i questioned him closely and he says that he can only account for them on the ground that if a victory had been won an official account from government should have been here before this and that it is solely on this account that these rumours have got about he said there was no reason for supposing that this silence meant disaster a complete victory might have been won and yet the messenger with the despatches might have been captured and killed by the parties of tribesmen hanging behind the army or wandering about the country between the army and khartoum still of course this is making us all very anxious  the party soon broke up none having any reassuring suggestions to offer and annie returned to her lodging to weep over her boy and pray for the safety of his father days and weeks passed and still no word came to cairo at khartoum there was a ferment among the native population no secret was made of the fact that the tribesmen who came and went all declared that hicks pashas army was utterly destroyed at length the egyptian government announced to the wives of the officers that pensions would be given to them according to the rank of their husbands as captain and interpreter gregorys wife had but a small one but it was sufficient for her to live upon  one by one the other ladies gave up hope and returned to england but annie stayed on misfortune might have befallen the army but gregory might have escaped in disguise she had like the other ladies put on mourning for him for had she declared her belief that he might still be alive she could not have applied for the pension and this was necessary for the childs sake of one thing she was determined she would not go with him as beggars to the father who had cast gregory off until as he had said she received absolute news of his death she was not in want but as her pension was a small one and she felt that it would be well for her to be employed she asked lady hicks before she left to mention at the houses of the egyptian ladies to whom she went to say goodbye that mrs hilliard would be glad to give lessons in english french or music  the idea pleased them and she obtained several pupils some of these were the ladies themselves and the lessons generally consisted in sitting for an hour with them two or three times a week and talking to them the conversation being in short sentences of which she gave them the english translation which they repeated over and over again until they knew them by heart this caused great amusement and was accompanied by much laughter on the part of the ladies and their attendants  several of her pupils however were young boys and girls and the teaching here was of a more serious kind the lessons to the boys were given the first thing in the morning and the pupils were brought to her house by attendants at eleven oclock she taught the girls and returned at one and had two hours more teaching in the afternoon she could have obtained more pupils had she wished to but the pay she received added to her income enabled her to live very comfortably and to save up money she had a negro servant who was very fond of the boy and she could leave him in her charge with perfect confidence while she was teaching  in the latter part of 1884 she ventured to hope that some news might yet come to her for a british expedition had started for the relief of general gordon who had gone up early in the year to khartoum where it was hoped that the influence he had gained among the natives at the time he was in command of the egyptian forces in the soudan would enable him to make head against the insurrection his arrival had been hailed by the population but it was soon evident to him that unless aided by england with something more than words khartoum must finally fall  but his requests for aid were slighted he had asked that two regiments should be sent from suakim to keep open the route to berber but mr gladstones government refused even this slight assistance to the man they had sent out and it was not until may that public indignation at this base desertion of one of the noblest spirits that britain ever produced caused preparations for his rescue to be made and it was december before the leading regiment arrived at korti far up the nile  after fighting two hard battles a force that had marched across the loop of the nile came down upon it above metemmeh a party started up the river at once in two steamers which gordon had sent down to meet them but only arrived near the town to hear that they were too late that khartoum had fallen and that gordon had been murdered the army was at once hurried back to the coast leaving it to the mahdistsmore triumphant than everto occupy dongola and to push down and possibly as they were confident they should do to capture egypt itself  the news of the failure was a terrible blow to mrs hilliard she had hoped that when khartoum was relieved some information at least might be obtained from prisoners as to the fate of the british officers at el obeid that most of them had been killed was certain but she still clung to the hope that her husband might have escaped from the general massacre thanks to his knowledge of the language and the disguise he had with him and even that if captured later on he might be a prisoner or that he might have escaped detection altogether and be still living among friendly tribesmen it was a heavy blow to her therefore when she heard that the troops were being hurried down to the coast and that the mahdi would be uncontested master of egypt as far as assouan  she did however receive news when the force returned to cairo which although depressing did not extinguish all hope lieutenant colonel colborne by good luck had ascertained that a native boy in the service of general buller claimed to have been at el obeid upon questioning him closely he found out that he had unquestionably been there for he described accurately the position colonel colbornewho had started with hicks pasha but had been forced by illness to returnhad occupied in one of the engagements the boy was then the slave of an egyptian officer of the expedition  the army had suffered much from want of water but they had obtained plenty from a lake within three days march from el obeid from this point they were incessantly fired at by the enemy on the second day they were attacked but beat off the enemy though with heavy loss to themselves the next day they pressed forward as it was necessary to get to water but they were misled by their guide and at noon the arabs burst down upon them the square in which the force was marching was broken and a terrible slaughter took place then hicks pasha with his officers seeing that all was lost gathered together and kept the enemy at bay with their revolvers till their ammunition was exhausted after that they fought with their swords till all were killed hicks pasha being the last to fall the lad himself hid among the dead and was not discovered until the next morning when he was made a slave by the man who found him  this was terrible but there was still hope if this boy had concealed himself among the dead her husband might have done the same not being a combatant officer he might not have been near the others when the affair took place and moreover the lad had said that the black regiment in the rear of the square had kept together and marched away he believed all had been afterwards killed but this he did not know if gregory had been there when the square was broken he might well have kept with them and at nightfall slipped on his disguise and made his escape it was at least possibleshe would not give up all hope  so years went on things were quiet in egypt a native army had been raised there under the command of british officers and these had checked the northern progress of the mahdists and restored confidence in egypt gregoryfor the boy had been named after his fathergrew up strong and hearty his mother devoted her evenings to his education from the negress who was his nurse and the general servant of the house he had learnt to talk her native language she had been carried off when ten years old by a slaveraiding party and sold to an egyptian trader at khartoum been given by him to an atbara chief with whom he had dealings and five years later had been captured in a tribal war by the jaalin two or three times she had changed masters and finally had been purchased by an egyptian officer and brought down by him to cairo at his death four years afterwards she had been given her freedom being now past fifty and had taken service with gregory hilliard and his wife her vocabulary was a large one and she was acquainted with most of the dialects of the soudan tribes  from the time when her husband was first missing mrs hilliard cherished the idea that some day the child might grow up and search for his father and perhaps ascertain his fate beyond all doubt she was a very conscientious woman and was resolved that at whatever pain to herself she would when once certain of her husbands death go to england and obtain recognition of his boy by his family but it was pleasant to think that the day was far distant when she could give up hope she saw too that if the soudan was ever reconquered the knowledge of the tribal languages must be of immense benefit to her son and she therefore insisted from the first that the woman should always talk to him in one or other of the languages that she knew  thus gregory almost unconsciously acquired several of the dialects used in the soudan arabic formed the basis of them all except the negro tongue at first he mixed them up but as he grew mrs hilliard insisted that his nurse should speak one for a month and then use another so that by the time he was twelve years old the boy could speak in the negro tongue and half a dozen dialects with equal facility  his mother had years before engaged a teacher of arabic for him this he learned readily as it was the root of the egyptian and the other languages he had picked up of a morning he sat in the school and learned pure arabic and turkish while the boys learned english and therefore without an effort when he was twelve years old he talked these languages as well as english and had moreover a smattering of italian and french picked up from boys of his own age for his mother had now many acquaintances among the european community  while she was occupied in the afternoon with her pupils the boy had liberty to go about as he pleased and indeed she encouraged him to take long walks to swim and to join in all games and exercises  english boys at home she said have many games and it is owing to these that they grow up so strong and active they have more opportunities than you but you must make the most of those that you have we may go back to england some day and i should not at all like you to be less strong than others  as however such opportunities were very small she had an apparatus of poles horizontal bars and ropes set up such as those she had seen in england in use by the boys of one of the families where she had taught before her marriage and insisted upon gregorys exercising himself upon it for an hour every morning soon after sunrise as she had heard her husband once say that fencing was a splendid exercise not only for developing the figure but for giving a good carriage as well as activity and alertness she arranged with a frenchman who had served in the army and had gained a prize as a swordsman in the regiment to give the boy lessons two mornings in the week  thus at fifteen gregory was well grown and athletic and had much of the bearing and appearance of an english publicschool boy his mother had been very particular in seeing that his manners were those of an englishman  i hope the time will come when you will associate with english gentlemen and i should wish you in all respects to be like them you belong to a good family and should you by any chance some day go home you must do credit to your dear father  the boy had for some years been acquainted with the family story except that he did not know the name he bore was his fathers christian name and not that of his family  my grandfather must have been a very bad man mother to have quarreled with my father for marrying you  well my boy you hardly understand the extent of the exclusiveness of some englishmen of course it is not always so but to some people the idea of their sons or daughters marrying into a family of less rank than themselves appears to be an almost terrible thing as i have told you although the daughter of a clergyman i was when i became an orphan obliged to go out as a governess  but there was no harm in that mother  no harm dear but a certain loss of position had my father been alive and had i been living with him in a country rectory your grandfather might not have been pleased at your fathers falling in love with me because he would probably have considered that being as you know by his photograph a fine tall handsome man and having the best education money could give him he might have married very much better that is to say the heiress of a property or into a family of influence through which he might have been pushed on but he would not have thought of opposing the marriage on the ground of my family but a governess is a different thing she is in many cases a lady in every respect but her position is a doubtful one  in some families she is treated as one of themselves in others her position is very little different from that of an upper servant your grandfather was a passionate man and a very proud man your fathers elder brother was well provided for but there were two sisters and these and your father he hoped would make good marriages he lived in very good style but your uncle was extravagant and your grandfather was over indulgent and crippled himself a good deal in paying the debts that he incurred it was natural therefore that he should have objected to your fathers engagement to what he called a penniless governess it was only what was to be expected if he had stated his objections to the marriage calmly there need have been no quarrel your father would assuredly have married me in any case and your grandfather might have refused to assist him if he did so but there need have been no breakup in the family such as took place  however as it was your father resented his tone and what had been merely a difference of opinion became a serious quarrel and they never saw each other afterwards it was a great grief to me and it was owing to that and his being unable to earn his living in england that your father brought me out here i believe he would have done well at home though it would have been a hard struggle at that time i was very delicate and was ordered by the doctors to go to a warm climate and therefore your father accepted a position of a kind which at least enabled us to live and obtained for me the benefit of a warm climate  then the chance came of his going up to the soudan and there was a certainty that if the expedition succeeded as everyone believed it would he would have obtained permanent rank in the egyptian army and so recovered the position in life that he had voluntarily given up for my sake  and what was the illness you had mother  it was an affection of the lungs dear it was a constant cough that threatened to turn to consumption which is one of the most fatal diseases we have in england  but it hasnt cured you mother for i often hear you coughing at night  yes my cough has been a little troublesome of late gregory  indeed from the time of the disaster to the expedition of hicks pasha annie hilliard had lost ground she herself was conscious of it but except for the sake of the boy she had not troubled over it she had not altogether given up hope but the hope grew fainter and fainter as the years went on had it not been for the promise to her husband not to mention his real name or to make any application to his father unless absolutely assured of his death she would for gregorys sake have written to mr hartley and asked for help that would have enabled her to take the boy home to england and have him properly educated there but she had an implicit faith in the binding of a promise so made and as long as she was not driven by absolute want to apply to mr hartley was determined to keep to it  a year after this conversation gregory was sixteen now tall and strong he had for some time past been anxious to obtain some employment that would enable his mother to give up her teaching some of this indeed she had been obliged to relinquish during the past few months her cheeks had become hollow and her cough was now frequent by day as well as by night she had consulted an english doctor who she saw by the paper was staying at shepherds hotel he had hesitated before giving a direct opinion but on her imploring him to tell her the exact state of her health said gently  i am afraid madam that i can give you no hope of recovery one lung has already gone the other is very seriously diseased were you living in england i should say that your life might be prolonged by taking you to a warm climate but as it is no change could be made for the better  thank you doctor i wanted to know the exact truth and be able to make my arrangements accordingly i was quite convinced that my condition was hopeless but i thought it right to consult a physician and to know how much time i could reckon on can you tell me that  that is always difficult mrs hilliard it may be three months hence it might be more speedilya vessel might give way in the lungs suddenly on the other hand you might live six months of course i cannot say how rapid the progress of the disease has been  it may not be a week doctor i am not at all afraid of hearing your sentenceindeed i can see it in your eyes  it may be within a weekthe doctor bowed his head gravelyit may be at any time  thank you she said quietly i was sure it could not be long i have been teaching but three weeks ago i had to give up my last pupil my breath is so short that the slightest exertion brings on a fit of coughing  on her return home she said to gregory  my dear boy you must have seenyou cannot have helped seeingthat my time is not long here i have seen an english doctor today and he says the end may come at any moment  oh mother mother the lad cried throwing himself on his knees and burying his face in her lap dont say so  the news indeed did not come as a surprise to him he had for months noticed the steady change in her how her face had fallen away how her hands seemed nerveless her flesh transparent and her eyes grew larger and larger many times he had walked far up among the hills and when beyond the reach of human eye thrown himself down and cried unrestrainedly until his strength seemed utterly exhausted and yet the verdict now given seemed to come as a sudden blow  you must not break down dear she said quietly for months i have felt that it was so and but for your sake i did not care to live i thank god that i have been spared to see you growing up all that i could wish and though i should have liked to see you fairly started in life i feel that you may now make your way unaided  now i want before it is too late to give you instructions in my desk you will find a sealed envelope it contains a copy of the registers of my marriage and of your birth these will prove that your father married and had a son you can get plenty of witnesses who can prove that you were the child mentioned i promised your father that i would not mention our real name to anyone until it was necessary for me to write to your grandfather i have kept that promise his name was gregory hilliard so we have not taken false names they were his christian names the third name his family name you will find when you open that envelope  i have been thinking for months past what you had best do and this is my advice but do not look upon it as an order you are old enough to think for yourself you know that sir herbert kitchener the sirdar is pushing his way up the nile i have no doubt that with your knowledge of arabic and of the language used by the black race in the soudan you will be able to obtain some sort of post in the army perhaps as an interpreter to one of the officers commanding a brigadethe same position in fact as your father had except that the army is now virtually british whereas that he went with was egyptian  i have two reasons for desiring this i do not wish you to go home until you are in a position to dispense with all aid from your family i have done without it and i trust that you will be able to do the same i should like you to be able to go home at oneandtwenty and to say to your grandfather i have not come home to ask for money or assistance of any kind i am earning my living honourably i only ask recognition by my family as my fathers son  it is probable that this expedition will last fully two years it must be a gradual advance and even then if the khalifa is beaten it must be a considerable time before matters are thoroughly settled there will be many civil posts open to those who like yourself are well acquainted with the language of the country and if you can obtain one of these you may well remain there until you come of age you can then obtain a few months leave of absence and go to england  my second reason is that although my hope that your father is still alive has almost died out it is just possible that he is like neufeld and some others a prisoner in the khalifas hands or possibly living as an arab cultivator near el obeid many prisoners will be taken and from some of these we may learn such details of the battle as may clear us of the darkness that hangs over your fathers fate  when you do go home gregory you had best go first to your fathers brother his address is on a paper in the envelope he was heir to a peerage and has perhaps now come into it i have no reasons for supposing that he sided with his father against yours the brothers were not bad friends although they saw little of each other for your father after he left oxford was for the most part away from england until a year before his marriage and at that time your uncle was in america having gone out with two or three others on a hunting expedition among the rocky mountains there is therefore no reason for supposing that he will receive you otherwise than kindly when once he is sure that you are his nephew he may indeed for aught i know have made efforts to discover your father after he returned from abroad  i would rather leave them alone altogether mother gregory said passionately  that you cannot do my boy your father was anxious that you should be at least recognized and afterwards bear your proper name you will not be going as a beggar and there will be nothing humiliating as to your grandfather he may not even be alive it is seldom that i see an english newspaper and even had his death been advertised in one of the papers i should hardly have noticed it as i never did more than just glance at the principal items of news  in my desk you will also see my bank book it is in your name i have thought it better that it should stand so as it will save a great deal of trouble should anything happen to me happily i have never had any reasons to draw upon it and there are now about five hundred and fifty pounds standing to your credit of late you have generally paid in the money and you are personally known to the manager should there be any difficulty i have made a will leaving everything to you that sum will keep you if you cannot obtain the employment we speak of until you come of age and will at any rate facilitate your getting employment with the army as you will not be obliged to demand much pay and can take anything that offers  another reason for your going to england is that your grandfather may if he is dead have relented at last towards your father and may have left him some share in his fortune and although you might well refuse to accept any help from him if he is alive you can have no hesitation in taking that which should be yours by right i think sometimes now my boy that i have been wrong in not accepting the fact of your fathers death as proved and taking you home to england but you will believe that i acted for the best and i shrank from the thought of going home as a beggar while i could maintain you and myself comfortably here  you were quite right mother dear we have been very happy and i have been looking forward to the time when i might work for you as you have worked for me it has been a thousand times better so than living on the charity of a man who looked down upon you and who cast off my father  well you will believe at least that i acted for the best dear and i am not sure that it has not been for the best at any rate i too have been far happier than i could have been if living in england on an allowance begrudged to me  a week later gregory was awakened by the cries of the negro servant and running to mrs hilliards bedroom found that his mother had passed away during the night burial speedily follows death in egypt and on the following day gregory returned heartbroken to his lonely house after seeing her laid in her grave  for a week he did nothing but wander about the house listlessly then with a great effort he roused himself he had his work before himhad his mothers wishes to carry out his first step was to go to the bank and ask to see the manager  you may have heard of my mothers death mr murray he said  yes my lad and sorry indeed i was to hear of it she was greatly liked and respected by all who knew her  she told me gregory went on trying to steady his voice a week before her death that she had money here deposited in my name  that is so  is there anything to be done about it sir  not unless you wish to draw it out she told me some time ago why she placed it in your name and i told her that there would be no difficulty  i do not want to draw any of it out sir as there were fifty pounds in the house she was aware that she had not long to live and no doubt kept it by her on purpose  then all you have to do is to write your signature on this piece of paper i will hand you a cheque book and you will only have to fill up a cheque and sign it and draw out any amount you please  i have never seen a cheque book sir will you kindly tell me what i should have to do  mr murray took out a cheque book and explained its use then he asked what gregory thought of doing  i wish to go up with the nile expedition sir it was my mothers wish also that i should do so my main object is to endeavour to obtain particulars of my fathers death and to assure myself that he was one of those who fell at el obeid i do not care in what capacity i go up but as i speak arabic and soudanese as well as english my mother thought that i might get employment as interpreter either under an officer engaged on making the railway or in some capacity under an officer in one of the egyptian regiments  i have no doubt that i can help you there lad i know the sirdar and a good many of the british officers for whom i act as agent of course i dont know in what capacity they could employ you but surely some post or other could be found for you where your knowledge of the language would render you very useful naturally the officers in the egyptian service all understand enough of the language to get on with but few of the officers in the british regiments do  it is fortunate that you came today i have an appointment with lord cromer tomorrow morning so i will take the opportunity of speaking to him as it is an army affair and as your father was in the egyptian service and your mother had a pension from it i may get him to interest himself in the matter kitchener is down here at present and if cromer would speak to him i should think you would certainly be able to get up though i cannot say in what position the fact that you are familiar with the negro language which differs very widely from that of the arab soudan tribes who all speak arabic is strongly in your favour and may give you an advantage over applicants who can only speak arabic  i shall see lord cromer at ten and shall probably be with him for an hour you may as well be outside his house at halfpast ten possibly he may like to see you at any rate when i come down i can tell you what he says  with grateful thanks gregory returned home    chapter 4 an appointment   soon after ten next morning gregory took up his place near the entrance to lord cromers house it was just eleven when mr murray came down  come in with me he said lord cromer will see you he acknowledged at once when i told him your story that you had a strong claim for employment the only point was as to your age i told him that you were past sixteen and a strong active fellow and that you had had a good physical training  they had now entered the house  dont be nervous hilliard just talk to him as you would to me many a good man has lost an appointment from being nervous and embarrassed when he applied for it  you want to go up to the soudan lord cromer said mr murray has told me your reasons for wanting to go though i fear it is hardly likely that any new light can be thrown upon the fate of hicks pasha and his officers i feel that it is a natural desire on your part  it was my mothers last wish sir and she took particular pains in my training and education to fit me for the work  you speak arabic and the tongue of the negro blacks almost as well as english  yes sir arabic quite as well and the other nearly as well i think  what sort of post did you hope to get mr hilliard  any post for which i may be thought fit sir i do not care at all about pay my mother saved sufficient to keep me for two or three years i would rather enlist than not go up at all though i fear i am too young to be accepted but i am quite ready to turn my hand to anything  if it concerned the egyptian government or a civil appointment i would certainly exert my influence in your favour but this expedition is in the hands of the military however if you will take a seat in the anteroom and do not mind waiting there for an hour or two i will see what can be done  thank you very much indeed sir  mr murray as they went out together said  i think that you have made a good impression he told me before that it was a matter for sir herbert kitchener and that he was expecting him in a quarter of an hour come and tell me the result when you leave  ten minutes later a tall man whom gregory recognized at once as sir herbert kitchener whose figure was well known in cairo passed through the room all who were sitting there rising to their feet as he did so he acknowledged the salute mechanically as if scarcely conscious of it an hour later a bell was rung and an attendant went into the room he returned directly  mr hilliard he said  gregory rose and passed through the door held open kitchener was sitting at the table with lord cromer his keen glance seemed to gregory to take him in from head to foot and then to look at something far beyond him  this is mr hilliard lord cromer said the young gentleman i have spoken of  you want to go up the general said shortly in arabic  yes sir  you do not mind in what capacity you go  no sir i am ready to do anything  to work on the railway or in the transport  yes sir though i would rather not be on the railway for the railway cannot get on as fast as the troops but i would enlist in one of the english regiments if they would take me  and you speak the language of the nubian blacks  the question was put in that language  yes i do not think i speak it quite as well as arabic but i speak it fairly  do you think that you could stand the fatigueno childs play you know  i can only say that i hope i can sir i have been accustomed to take long walks and spend an hour a day in gymnastic exercises and i have had lessons in fencing  can you use a pistol  yes fairly i have practised a good deal with it  you are most fitted for an interpreter the general said speaking this time in english now the north staffordshire have come down there are no british regiments up there and of course the british officers in the egyptian army all speak arabic to some extent however i will send you up to dongola either general hunter or colonel wingate of the intelligence department may be able to find some use for you and when the british troops go up you can be attached to one of their regiments as their interpreter you will have temporary rank of lieutenant with of course the pay of that rank  captain ewart came with me lord cromer i left him in the anteroom if you will allow me i will call him in  captain ewart he said as that officer entered mr hilliard here has just received the temporary rank of lieutenant in the egyptian army and is going up to join general hunter at dongola you are starting in three days are you not  i shall be glad if you will take him under your wing as far as you go he speaks the languages negro as well as arabic you can tell him what kit he had better take and generally mother him  that is all mr hilliard call at my quarters the day after tomorrow for the letters for general hunter and colonel wingate  i thank you most deeply sir gregory began but the sirdar gave a little impatient wave with his hand  thank you most deeply also lord cromer gregory said with a bow and then left the room  captain ewart remained there for another ten minutes when he came out he nodded to gregory  will you come with me he said i am going to the bank i shall not be there many minutes and we can then have a talk together  thank you sir i am going to the bank too it was mr murray who first spoke to lord cromer about me  you could not have had a better introduction well you wont have very long to get ready for the startthat is if you have not begun to prepare for it however there is no rush at present therefore i have no doubt you will be able to get your khaki uniforms in time as for other things there will be no difficulty about them  you have been up at the front before sir  yes my work is on the railway i had a touch of fever and got leave to come down and recruit before the hot weather came in i dare say you think it hot here sometimes but this is an ice house in comparison with the desert  they talked until they arrived at the bank  you may as well go in first and see murray i suppose you wont be above two or three minutes i shall be longer perhaps a quarter of an hour so if you wait for me we will go to shepherds and talk your business over in some sort of comfort  i am pleased indeed mr murray said when gregory told him of his appointment it is better than i even hoped it is bad enough there in the position of an officer but it would be infinitely worse in any other capacity do you want to draw any money  no sir i have fifty pounds by me and that will be enough i should think for everything  more than ample of course you have plenty of light underclothing of all sorts and a couple of suits of khaki will not cost you anything like so much as they would if you got them at a military tailors in london however if you want more you will be able to draw it  thank you very much sir i will not detain you any longer now but will if you will allow me come in to say goodbye before i start captain ewart is waiting to speak to you he came with me from lord cromers  captain ewart then went in and after settling the business on which he had come asked mr murray questions about gregory and received a sketch of his story  he seems to be a fine young fellow he said well grown and active not at all what one would expect from a product of cairo  no indeed of course you have not seen him to advantage in that black suit but in his ordinary clothes i should certainly take him if i had not seen him before to be a young lieutenant freshly come out to join  did you know the father  no i was not here at that time but the mother was a lady every inch it is strange that neither of them should have friends in england it may be that she preferred to earn her living here and be altogether independent  she had a pension hadnt she  a small one but she really earned her living by teaching she gave lessons to the ladies in english french and music and had classes for young boys and girls i once asked her if she did not intend to go back and settle in england and she said possibly some day  i fancy that there must have been some mystery about the affairwhat i cant say but at any rate we may take it that such a woman would not have married a man who was not a gentleman  certainly the boy looks a wellbred one captain ewart said and i am sure that the sirdar must have been taken with him you dont know any more about his father than you have told me  very little once in talking with his wife she told me that her husband had been in a commercial house in alexandria for a year but the place was burned down at the time of the bombardment being thus out of harness he became an assistant to one of the army contractors and when things settled down at cairo obtained a berth as interpreter with the temporary rank of captain on hicks pashas staff as he also spoke arabic fluently i can tell you no more about him than that as i never saw him though no doubt he came here with his wife when her account was opened  i was interested in her i looked up the old books and found that two hundred pounds was paid into her account before he left i may say that she steadily increased that amount ever since but a few years ago she had the sum then standing transferred to the boys name telling me frankly at the time that she did so to save trouble in case anything happened to her i fancy from what she said that for the last year or two she had been going downhill i had a chat with her the last time she came in she told me that she had been consumptive and that it was for the sake of her health they came out here  that accounts for it murray by the date they were probably only married a year or so before they came out and a man who loved a young wife and saw no other way of saving her would throw up any berth at home in order to give her the benefit of a warm climate still it is a little curious that if he had only been out here a year or so before hicks started he should have learned arabic sufficiently well to get a post as interpreter i have been in the country about three years and can get on fairly well with the natives in matters concerning my own work but i certainly could not act as general interpreter  well i am glad to have heard this for you know the sort of men interpreters generally are from the lads appearance and manner there is no shadow of doubt that his mother was a lady i thought it more than probable that she had married beneath her and that her husband was of the ordinary interpreter class now from what you have said i see that it is probable he came of a much better family well you may be sure that i shall do what i can for the lad  gregory joined him as he left the bank  i think hilliard we had best go to the tailor first his shop is not far from here as you want to get your things in three days it is as well to have that matter settled at once  the two suits each consisting of khaki tunic breeches and putties were ordered  you had better have breeches he said it is likely you will have to ride and knickerbockers look baggy  this done they went to shepherds hotel  sit down in the verandah captain ewart said until i get rid of my regimentals even a khaki tunic is not an admirable garment when one wants to be cool and comfortable  in a few minutes he came down again in a light tweed suit and seating himself in another lounging chair two cooling drinks were brought in then he said  now we will talk about your outfit and what you had best take up of course you have got light underclothing so you need not bother about that you want ankle bootsand high onesto keep out the sand you had better take a couple of pairs of slippers they are of immense comfort at the end of the day also a light cap to slip on when you are going from one tent to another after dark a helmet is a good thing in many ways but it is cumbrous and if there are four or five men in a tent and they all take off their helmets it is difficult to know where to stow them away  most likely you will get a tent at dongola but you cant always reckon upon that and you may find it very useful to have a light tente dabri made it should have a fly which is useful in two ways in the first place it adds to the height and so enlarges the space inside and in the next place you can tie it up in the daytime and allow whatever air there is to pass through then with a blanket thrown over the top you will find it cooler than a regimental tent  of course you will want a sword and a revolver with a case and belt get the regulation size and a hundred rounds of cartridges you are not likely ever to use a quarter of that number but they will come in for practice  now as to food of course you get beef biscuit or bread and there is a certain amount of tea but nothing like enough for a thirsty climate especially whenwhich is sometimes the casethe water is so bad that it is not safe to drink unless it has been boiled so you had better take up four or five pounds of tea  i dont take sugar sir  all the better there is no better drink than tea poured out and left to cool and drunk without sugar you might take a dozen tins of preserved milk as many of condensed cocoa and milk and a couple of dozen pots of jam of course you could not take all these things on if you were likely to move but you may be at dongola some time before there is another advance and you may as well make yourself as comfortable as you can and if as is probable you cannot take the pots up with you you can hand them over to those who are left behind you will have no trouble in getting a fairsized case taken up as there will be water carriage nearly all the way  a good many fellows have aerated waters sent up but hot soda water is by no means a desirable drinknot to be compared with tea kept in porous jars so i should not advise you to bother about it you will want a water bottle get the largest you can find it is astonishing how much water a fellow can get down in a long days march  oh as to your boots get the uppers as light as you canthe lighter the better but you must have strong solesthere are rocks in some places and they cut the soles to pieces in no time the sand is bad enough your foot sinks in it and it seems to have a sort of sucking action and very often takes the sole right off in a very short time  i suppose you smoke  cigarettes sir  i should advise you to get a pipe in addition or rather two or three of them if they get broken or lost in the sand there is no replacing them and if you dont take to them yourself you will find them the most welcome present you can give to a man who has lost his  i should advise you to get a lens you dont want a valuable one but the larger the better and the cheapest that you can buy it will be quite as good as the best to use as a burning glass matches are precious things out there and with a burning glass you will only have to draw upon your stock in the evening  now do you ride because all the white officers with the egyptian troops do so  i am sorry to say that i dont sir i have ridden donkeys but anyone can sit upon a donkey  yes that wont help you much then i should advise you to use all the time that you can spare after ordering your outfit in riding no doubt you could hire a horse  yes there is no difficulty about that  well if you will hire one and come round here at six oclock tomorrow morning i will ride out for a couple of hours with you and give you your first lesson i can borrow a horse from one of the staff if you once get to sit your horse in a workmanlike fashion and to carry yourself well you will soon pick up the rest and if you go out morning and evening for three hours each time you wont be quite abroad when you start to keep up with a column of men on foot  as to a horse it would be hardly worth your while to bother about taking one with you you will be able to pick one up at dongola i hear that fugitives are constantly coming in there and some of them are sure to be mounted however you had better take up a saddle and bridle with you you might as well get an egyptian one in the first place because it is a good deal cheaper and in the second because our english saddles are made for bigger horses you need not mind much about the appearance of your animal anything will do for riding about at dongola and learning to keep your seat in the first fight you have with dervish horsemen there are sure to be some riderless horses and you may then get a good one for a pound or two from some tommy who has captured one  i am sure i am immensely obliged to you captain ewart that will indeed be an advantage to me  on leaving the hotel gregory at once made all his purchases so as to get them off his mind and then arranged for the horse in the morning then he went home and told the old servant the change that had taken place in his position  and now what about yourself what would you like to do  i am too old to go up with you and cook for you  yes indeed he laughed we shall be doing long marches but it is not your age so much as an officer it would be impossible for me to have a female servant besides you want quiet and rest i have been round to the landlord to tell him that i am going away and to pay him a months rent instead of notice i should think the best way would be for you to take a large room for yourself or two rooms not so largeone of them for you to live in and the other to store everything there is here i know that you will look after them and keep them well of course you will pick out all the things that you can use in your room it will be very lonely for you living all by yourself but you know numbers of people here and you might engage a girl to stay with you for some small wages and her food now you must think over what your food and hers will cost and the rent of course i want you to live comfortably you have always been a friend rather than a servant and my mother had the greatest trust in you  you are very good master gregory while you have been away today i have been thinking over what i should do when you went away i have a friend who comes in once a week with fruit and vegetables last year you know i went out with her and stayed a day she has two boys who work in the garden and a girl she came in today and i said to her  my young master is going away to the soudan what do you say to my coming and living with you when he has gone i can cook and do all about the house and help a little in the garden and i have saved enough money to pay for my share of food  she said i should like that very well you could help the boys in the field  so we agreed that if you were willing i should go i thought of the furniture but if you do not come back here to live it would be no use to keep the chairs and tables and beds and things we can put all missys things and everything you like to keep into a great box and i could take them with me or you could have them placed with some honest man who would only charge very little for storage  well i do think that would be a good plan if you like these people it would be far better than living by yourself however of course i shall pay for your board and i shall leave money with you so that if you are not comfortable there you can do as i said take a room here  i think you are right about the furniture how would you sell it  there are plenty of greek shops they would buy it all they would not give as much as you gave for it most of them are great rascals  we cannot help that he said i should have to sell them when i come back and at any rate we save the rent for housing them they are not worth much you may take anything you like a comfortable chair and a bed some cooking things and so on and sell the rest for anything you can get after i have gone i will pack my dear mothers things this evening  for the next two days gregory almost lived on horseback arranging with the man from whom he hired the animals that he should change them three times a day he laid aside his black clothes and took to a white flannel suit with a black ribbon round his straw hat as deep mourning would be terribly hot and altogether unsuited for riding  you will do lad captain ewart said to him after giving him his first lesson your fencing has done much for you and has given you an easy poise of body and head always remember that it is upon balancing the body that you should depend for your seat although of course the grip of the knees does a good deal also remember always to keep your feet straight nothing is so awkward as turnedout toes besides in that position if the horse starts you are very likely to dig your spurs into him  hold the reins firmly but dont pull at his head give him enough scope to toss his head if he wants to but be in readiness to tighten the reins in an instant if necessary  each day gregory returned home so stiff and tired that he could scarcely crawl along still he felt that he had made a good deal of progress and that when he got up to dongola he would be able to mount and ride out without exciting derision on the morning of the day on which he was to start he went to say goodbye to mr murray  have you everything ready hilliard the banker asked  yes sir the uniform and the tent are both ready i have a cork bed and waterproof sheet to lay under it and i think everything that i can possibly require i am to meet captain ewart at the railway this afternoon at five oclock the train starts at half past  i will draw another twentyfive pounds sir i have not spent more than half what i had but i must leave some money with our old servant i shall have to buy a horse too when i get up to dongola and i may have other expenses that i cannot foresee  i think that is a wise plan the banker said it is always well to have money with you for no one can say what may happen your horse may get shot or founder and you may have to buy another well i wish you every luck lad and a safe return  thank you very much mr murray all this good fortune has come to me entirely through your kindness i cannot say how grateful i feel to you    chapter 5 southward   at the hour named gregory met captain ewart at the station he was now dressed in uniform and carried a revolver in his waist belt and a sword in its case his luggage was not extensive he had one large bundle it contained a rollup cork bed in a waterproof casing at one end was a loose bag which contained a spare suit of clothes three flannel shirts and his underclothing this formed the pillow a blanket and a waterproof sheet were rolled up with it in a small sack was the tente dabri made of waterproof sheeting with its two little poles it only weighed some fifteen pounds his only other luggage consisted of a large case with six bottles of brandy and the provisions he had been recommended to take  is that all your kit captain ewart said as he joined him  yes sir i hope you dont think it is too much  no i think it is very moderate though if you move forward you will not be able to take the case with you the others are light enough and you can always get a native boy to carry them of course you have your pass  yes sir i received it yesterday when i went to headquarters for the letter to general hunter  then we may as well take our places at once we have nearly an hour before the train starts but it is worth waiting in order to get two seats next the window on the river side we need not sit there till the train starts if we put our traps in to keep our places i know four or five other officers coming up so we will spread our things about and keep the whole carriage to ourselves if we can  in an hour the train started every place was occupied ewart had spoken to his friends as they arrived and they had all taken places in the same compartment the journey lasted forty hours and gregory admitted that the description captain ewart had given him of the dust was by no means exaggerated he had brought as had been suggested a water skin and a porous earthenware bottle together with a roll of cottonwool to serve as a stopper to the latter to keep out the dust in a tightly fitting handbag he had an ample supply of food for three days along the opening of this he had pasted a strip of paper  that will do very well for your first meal hilliard but it will be of no good afterwards  i have prepared for that gregory said i have bought a gum bottle and as i have a newspaper in my pocket i can seal it up after each meal  by jove that is a good idea one i never thought of  the gum will be quite sufficient for us all up to assouan i have two more bottles in my box that should be sufficient to last me for a long time when i am in the desert and as it wont take half a minute to put a fresh paper on after each meal i shall have the satisfaction of eating my food without its being mixed with the dust  there was a general chorus of approval and all declared that they would search every shop in assouan and endeavour to find gum  paste will do as well ewart said and as we can always get flour we shall be able to defy the dust fiend as far as our food goes  i certainly did not expect that old campaigners would learn a lesson from you hilliard as soon as you started  it was just an idea that occurred to me gregory said  the gum bottle was handed round and although nothing could be done for those who had brought their provisions in hampers three of them who had like gregory put their food in bags were able to seal them up tightly  it was now may and the heat was becoming intolerable especially as the windows were closed to keep out the dust in spite of this however it found its way in it settled everywhere clothes and hair became white with it it worked its way down the neck where the perspiration changed it into mud it covered the face as if with a cake of flour  at first gregory attempted to brush it off his clothes as it settled upon them but he soon found that there was no advantage in this so he sat quietly in his corner and like the rest looked like a dirty white statue there were occasional stops when they all got out shook themselves and took a few mouthfuls of fresh air  gregorys plan for keeping out the dust from the food turned out a great success and the meals were eaten in the open air during the stoppages  on arriving at assouan they all went to the transport department to get their passes for the journey up the nile as far as wady halfa the next step was to go down to the river for a swim and by dint of shaking and beating to get rid of the accumulated dust  assouan was not a pleasant place to linger in and as soon as they had completed their purchases captain ewart and gregory climbed on to the loaded railway train and were carried by the short line to the spot where above the cataract the steamer that was to carry them was lying she was to tow up a large barge and two native craft they took their places in the steamer with a number of other officerssome newcomers from england others men who had been down to cairo to recruit they belonged to all branches of the service and included half a dozen of the medical staff three of the transport corps gunners engineers cavalry and infantry the barges were deep in the water with their cargoes of stores of all kinds and rails and sleepers for the railway and the steamer was also deeply loaded  the passage was a delightful one to gregory everything was new to him the cheery talk and jokes of the officers the graver discussion of the work before them the calculations as to time and distance the stories told of what had taken place during the previous campaign by those who shared in it were all so different from anything he had ever before experienced that the hours passed almost unnoticed it was glorious to think that in whatever humble capacity he was yet one of the band who were on their way up to meet the hordes of the khalifa to rescue the soudan from the tyranny under which it had groaned to avenge gordon and hicks and the gallant men who had died with them  occasionally captain ewart came up and talked to him but he was well content to sit on one of the bales and listen to the conversation without joining in it in another couple of years he too would have had his experiences and would be able to take his part at present he preferred to be a listener  the distance to wady halfa was some three hundred miles but the current was strong and the steamer could not tow the boats more than five miles an hour against it it was sixty hours from the start before they arrived  gregory was astonished at the stir and life in the place great numbers of native labourers were at work unloading barges and native craft and a line of railway ran down to the wharves where the work of loading the trucks went on briskly smoke pouring out from many chimneys and the clang of hammers told that the railway engineering work was in full swing vast piles of boxes cases and bales were accumulated on the wharf and showed that there would be no loss of time in pushing forward supplies to abu hamed as soon as the railway was completed to that point  wady halfa had been the starting point of a railway commenced years before a few miles have been constructed and several buildings erected for the functionaries military and civil but gordon when governor of the soudan had refused to allow the province to be saddled with the expenses of the construction or to undertake the responsibility of carrying it out  in 1884 there was some renewal of work and had gordon been rescued and khartoum permanently occupied the line would no doubt have been carried on but with the retirement of the british troops work ceased and the great stores of material that had been gathered there remained for years half covered with the sand in any other climate this would have been destructive but in the dry air of upper egypt they remained almost uninjured and proved very useful when the work was again taken up  it was a wonderful undertaking for along the two hundred and thirtyfour miles of desert food water and every necessary had to be carried together with all materials for its construction not only had an army of workmen to be fed but a body of troops to guard them for abu hamed at the other end of the line for which they were making was occupied by a large body of dervishes who might at any moment swoop down across the plain  had the sirdar had the resources of england at his back the work would have been easier for he could have ordered from home new engines and plant of every description but it was an egyptian work and had to be done in the cheapest possible way old engines had to be patched up and makeshifts of all kinds employed fortunately he had in the chief engineer of the line a man whose energy determination and resource were equal to his own major girouard was a young officer of the royal engineers and like all white officers in the egyptian service held the rank of major he was a canadian by birth and proved in every respect equal to the onerous and responsible work to which he was appointed  however labour was cheap and railway battalions were raised among the egyptian peasants their pay being the same as that of the soldiers strong hearty and accustomed to labour and a scanty diet no men could have been more fitted for the work they preferred it to soldiering for although as they had already shown and were still further to prove the egyptian can fight and fight bravely he is by nature peaceable and prefers work however hard in addition to these battalions natives of the country and of the soudan fugitives from ruined villages and desolated plains were largely employed  the line had now been carried threequarters of the distance to abu hamed which was still in the hands of the dervishes it had been constructed with extraordinary rapidity for the ground was so level that only occasional cuttings were needed the organization of labour was perfect the men were divided into gangs each under a head man and each having its own special work to do there were the men who unloaded the trucks the labourers who did the earth work and the more skilled hands who levelled it as fast as the trucks were emptied gangs of men carried the sleepers forward and laid them down roughly in position others followed and corrected the distance between each the rails were then brought along and laid down with the fish plates in the proper places men put these on and boys screwed up the nuts then plate layers followed and lined the rails accurately and when this was done sand was thrown in and packed down between the sleepers  by this division of labour the line was pushed on from one to two miles a day the camp moving forward with the line six tank trucks brought up the water for the use of the labourers daily and everything worked with as much regularity as in a great factory at home troops of friendly tribesmen in our pay scoured the country and watched the wells along the road farther to the east so as to prevent any bands of dervishes from dashing suddenly down upon the workers  at wady halfa captain ewart and two or three other officers left the steamer to proceed up the line gregory was very sorry to lose him  i cannot tell you captain ewart he said how deeply grateful i feel to you for the immense kindness you have shown me i dont know what i should have done had i been left without your advice and assistance in getting my outfit and making my arrangements to come up here  my dear lad the latter said dont say anything more in any case i should naturally be glad to do what i could for the son of a man who died fighting in the same cause as we are now engaged in but in your case it has been a pleasure for i am sure you will do credit to yourself and to the mother who has taken such pains in preparing you for the work you are going to do and in fitting you for the position that you now occupy  as the officers who had come up with them in the train from cairo were all going on and had been told by ewart something of gregorys story they had aided that officer in making gregory feel at home in his new circumstances and in the two days they had been on board the boat he had made the acquaintance of several others  the river railway had now been carried from wady halfa to kerma above the third cataract the heavy stores were towed up by steamers and native craft most of the engines and trucks had been transferred to the desert line but a few were still retained to carry up troops if necessary and aid the craft in accumulating stores  one of these trains started a few hours after the arrival of the steamer at wady halfa gregory with the officers going up occupied two horse boxes several of them had been engaged in the last campaign and pointed out the places of interest  at sarras some thirty miles up the road there had been a fight on the 29th of april 1887 when the dervish host advancing strong in the belief that they could carry all before them down to the sea were defeated by the egyptian force under the sirdar and general chermside  the next stop of the train was at akasheh this had been a very important station before the last advance as all the stores had been accumulated here when the army advanced here had been a strongly entrenched camp for the dervishes were in force fifteen miles away at ferket  it was a busy time we had here said one of the officers who had taken a part in the expedition a fortnight before we had no idea that an early move was contemplated and indeed it was only on the 14th of march that the excitement began that day kitchener received a telegram ordering an immediate advance on dongola we had expected it would take place soon but there is no doubt that the sudden order was the result of an arrangement on the part of our government with italy that we should relieve her from the pressure of the dervishes round kassala by effecting a diversion and obliging the enemy to send a large force down to dongola to resist our advance  it was a busy time the sirdar came up to wady halfa and the egyptian troops were divided between that place sarras and akasheh the 9th soudanese were marched up from suakim and they did the distance to the nile one hundred and twenty miles in four days that was something like marching  well you saw wady halfa for a month this place was quite as busy now its glories are gone two or three huts for the railway men and the shelters for a company of egyptians represent the whole camp  as they neared ferket the officer said  there was a sharp fight out there on the desert a large body of dervishes advanced from ferket they were seen to leave by a cavalry patrol as soon as the patrol reached camp all the available horse two hundred and forty in number started under major murdoch four miles out they came in sight of three hundred mounted dervishes with a thousand spearmen on foot  the ground was rough and unfavourable for a cavalry charge so the cavalry retired to a valley between two hills in order to get better ground while they were doing so however the dervishes charged down upon them murdoch rode at them at once and there was a handtohand fight that lasted for twenty minutes then the enemy turned and galloped off to the shelter of the spearmen the troopers dismounted and opened fire and on a regiment of soudanese coming up the enemy drew off  eighteen of the dervishes were killed and eighty wounded our loss was very slight but the fight was a most satisfactory one for it showed that the egyptian cavalry had now sufficient confidence in themselves to face the baggara  headquarters came up to akasheh on the 1st of june the spies had kept the intelligence department well informed as to the state of things at ferket it was known that three thousand troops were there led by fiftyseven emirs the ground was carefully reconnoitred and all preparation made for an attack it was certain that the dervishes also had spies among the camel drivers and camp followers but the sirdar kept his intentions secret and on the evening of june 5th it was not known to any save three or four of the principal officers that he intended to attack on the following morning it was because he was anxious to effect a complete surprise that he did not even bring up the north staffordshires  there were two roads to ferketone by the river the other through the desert the river column was the strongest and consisted of an infantry division with two field batteries and two maxims the total strength of the desert column consisting of the cavalry brigade camel corps a regiment of infantry a battery of horse artillery and two maximsin all two thousand one hundred menwere to make a detour and come down upon the nile to the south of ferket thereby cutting off the retreat of the enemy  carrying two days rations the troops started late in the afternoon of the 6th and halted at nine in the evening three miles from ferket at halfpast two they moved forward again marching quietly and silently and at halfpast four deployed into line close to the enemys position a few minutes later the alarm was given and the dervishes leaping to arms discovered this formidable force in front of them and at the same time found that their retreat was cut off by another large body of troops in their rear while on the opposite bank of the river was a force of our arab allies  though they must have seen that their position was hopeless the dervishes showed no signs of fear they fought with the desperation of rats in a trap the egyptians advanced with steady volleys the baggara horsemen attacked them furiously but were repulsed with heavy loss there was handtohand fighting among their huts and the second brigade carried with the bayonet that rough hill that you see over there  it was all over by seven oclock our loss was only twenty killed and eighty wounded about one thousand of the dervishes were killed including their chief emir and some forty of the others while five hundred were taken prisoners it was a great victory and a very important one but it can hardly be said that it was glorious as we outnumbered them by three to one still it was a heavy blow to the dervishes and the fact that the khalifa was obliged to send troops down to the nile to check an advance that had proved so formidable must have greatly relieved the pressure on the italians at kassala  there was a pause here it was certain that we should have to meet a much stronger force before we got to dongola well as the egyptian troops had fought it was thought advisable to give them a stronger backing  the heat was now tremendous and cholera had broken out we moved to koshyeh and there encamped the only change we had was a terrific storm which almost washed us away in the middle of august we managed to get the gunboats up through the cataract and were in hopes of advancing when another storm carried away twenty miles of the railway which by this time had come up as far as the cataract  at ginnis twenty miles from ferket they passed the ground where on the 31st of december 1885 on the retirement of general wolseleys expedition generals grenfel and stevenson with a force of egyptian troops and three british regiments encountered the dervish army which the khalifa had despatched under the emir nejumi and defeated it it was notable as being the first battle in which the newly raised egyptian army met the mahdists and showed that trained and disciplined by british officers the egyptian fellah was capable of standing against the dervish of the desert  from this point the railway left the nile and for thirty miles crossed the desert another twenty miles and they reached fareeg  it was here the officer said that the north staffordshires came up and joined the egyptians the dervishes had fallen back before we advanced after a halt at sadeah which we shant see as the railway cuts across to abu fetmeh we bivouacked five miles from their camp and turned out at three next morning the orders were passed by mouth and we got off as silently as an army of ghosts  i shall never forget our disgust when a small cavalry force sent on ahead to reconnoitre reported that the dervishes had abandoned the place during the night and had crossed the river in native boats it was a very clever move at any rate on the part of fellows who did not want to fight there were we facing them with our whole infantry and cavalry useless and we had nothing available to damage the enemy except our artillery and the gunboats  these opened fire and the dervishes replied heavily they had earthworks but the boats kept on pluckily till they got to a narrow point in the stream when a couple of guns which had hitherto been hidden opened upon them at close range while a strong force of dervish infantry poured in such a hot fire that the boats had to fall back  after our field guns had peppered the enemy for a bit the gunboats tried again but the fire was too hot for them and the leading boat had to retire  things did not look very bright till nine oclock when we found that at one point the river was fordable to a small island opposite the enemys lines four batteries and the maxims at once moved over with two companies of soudanese and opened fire the distance across was but six hundred yards and the fire was tremendousshell shrapnel and rocketswhile the soudanese fired volleys and the maxims maintained a shower of bullets  it seemed that nothing could stand against it but the dervishes stuck to their guns with great pluck however their fire was so far kept down that the three gunboats succeeded in forcing their way up and passing the dervish works sank a steamer and a number of native boats  the dervishes now began to give way and the gunboats steamed up the river making for dongola the dervishes as soon as they had gone reopened fire and the duel continued all day but the great mass of the enemy soon left and also made their way towards dongola  it was awfully annoying being obliged to remain inactive on our side and it was especially hard for the cavalry who if they could have got over would have been able to cut up and disperse the enemy  the next morning the dervishes were all gone and that was practically the end of the fighting the gunboats went up and shelled dongola and when we got there two days later the dervishes had had enough of it of course there was a little fighting but it was the effort of a party of fanatics rather than of an enemy who considered resistance possible  we were greeted with enthusiasm by the unfortunate inhabitants who had been subject to the dervish tyranny as a whole however they had not been badly treated here and had been allowed to continue to cultivate their land subject only to about the same taxation as they had paid to egypt of course from what they have done elsewhere the comparative mildness of the conduct of the dervishes was not due to any feeling of mercy but to policy as the most advanced position with the exception of scattered and temporary posts lower down the river it was necessary that there should be food for the considerable body of tribesmen encamped at dongola especially as an army invading egypt would provide itself there with stores for the journey it was therefore good policy to encourage the cultivators of land to stay there  thank you very much gregory said when the officer had concluded his sketch of the previous campaign of course i heard that we had beaten the khalifas men and had taken dongola but the papers at cairo gave no details the staffordshire regiment went down directly the place was taken did they not  yes they had suffered heavily from cholera and as there was now no fear that the egyptians and soudanese would prove unequal to withstanding a dervish rush there was no necessity for keeping them here  at abu fetmeh they left the train and embarked in a steamer of the party that had left assouan only four or five remained the rest had been dropped at other stations on the road  the boat stopped but a few hours at dongola which had for a time been the headquarters of the advanced force great changes had been made since the place was captured from the dervishes at that time the population had been reduced to a handful and the natives who remained tilled but enough ground for their own necessities for they knew that at any time a dervish force might come along and sweep everything clear but with the advent of the british the fugitives who had scattered among the villages along the river soon poured in  numbers of greek traders arrived with camels and goods and the town assumed an aspect of life and business the general established a court of justice and appointed authorities for the proper regulation of affairs and by the time gregory came up the town was showing signs of renewed prosperity  but the steamer stopped at dongola only to land stores needed for the regiment stationed there the headquarters had months before been moved to merawi some eighty miles higher up situated at the foot of the fourth cataract  although he had enjoyed the journey gregory was glad when the steamer drew up against a newly constructed wharf at merawi now he was to begin his duties whatever they might be  at the wharf were a large number of soudanese soldiers a telegram from the last station they touched at had given notice of the hour at which the boat would arrive and a battalion of native troops had marched down to assist in unloading the stores a white officer had come down with them to superintend the operation and the other officers at once went on shore to speak to him  gregory had got all his traps together and as the soudanese poured on board he thought it better to remain with them as if his belongings once got scattered there would be little chance of his being able to collect them again after a short time he went up to one of the native officers  this is my first visit here he said in arabic and as i have not brought up a servant with me i do not like to leave my baggage here while i go and report myself to general hunter will you kindly tell me what i had better do  certainly i will place one of my corporals in charge of your things it would be as well to get them ashore at once as we shall want the decks clear in order that the men may work freely in getting the stores up from below the corporal will see that your baggage is carried to the bank to a spot where it will be out of the way and will remain with it until you know where it is to be taken  thanking him for his civility gregory went on shore the officer who had told him the story of the campaign was still talking to the major who had come down with the blacks as gregory came up he said  i wondered what had become of you hilliard i have been telling major sidney that a young lieutenant had come up to report himself to the general for service  i am glad to see you sir the major said holding out his hand every additional white officer is a material gain and i have no doubt that general hunter will find plenty for you to do i hear you can speak the negro language as well as arabic that will be specially useful here for the natives are principally negro and speak very little arabic  how about your baggage  one of the native officers has undertaken to get it ashore and to put a corporal in charge of it until i know where it is to go  well fladgate as you are going to the generals perhaps you will take mr hilliard with you and introduce him  with pleasure  now mr hilliard let us be off at once the sun is getting hot and the sooner we are under shelter the better  ten minutes walk took them to the house formerly occupied by the egyptian governor of the town where general hunter now had his headquarters the general who was a brevet colonel in the british army had joined the egyptian army in 1888 he had as a captain in the lancashire regiment taken part in the nile expedition 188485 had been severely wounded at the battle of ginnis and again at toski where he commanded a brigade he was still a comparatively young man he had a broad forehead and an intellectual face that might have betokened a student rather than a soldier but he was celebrated in the army for his personal courage and disregard of danger and was adored by his black soldiers  he rose from the table at which he was sitting as captain fladgate came in  i am glad to see you back again he said i hope you have quite shaken off the fever  quite general i feel thoroughly fit for work again allow me to present to you mr hilliard who has just received a commission as lieutenant in the egyptian army he has a letter from the sirdar to you  well i will not detain you now captain fladgate you will find your former quarters in readiness for you dinner at the usual time then you shall tell me the news of cairo  now mr hilliard and he turned to gregory pray take a seat this is your first experience in soldiering i suppose  yes sir  i think you are the first white officer who has been appointed who has not had experience in our own army first you have not been appointed to any particular battalion have you  no sir i think i have come out to make myself generally useful these are the letters that i was to hand to youone is from the sirdar himself the other is from his chief of the staff and this letter is from captain ewart  the general read the sirdars letter first he then opened that from the chief of the staff this was the more bulky of the two and contained several enclosures  ah this relates to you the general said as after glancing over the two official despatches he read through the letter of captain ewart who was a personal friend of his  the latter had given a full account of gregorys history and said that the sirdar had especially asked him to put him in the way of things that he had seen a great deal of him on the journey up and was very greatly pleased with him  the lad is a perfect gentleman he said which is certainly astonishing he being a product of cairo i consider him in all respectsexcept of course a classical educationfully equal to the average young officer on first joining he is very modest and unassuming and will i feel sure perform with credit any work that you may give him to do  i see he said laying it down you have only joined the army temporarily and with a special purpose and i am told to utilize your services as i think best you have a perfect knowledge of arabic and of the negro dialect that will be very useful for though we all speak arabic few speak the negro language which is more commonly used here  your father fell with hicks pasha i am told and you have joined us with the object of obtaining news as to the manner in which he met his death  that is so sir it was always my mothers wish that i should when i was old enough come up to the soudan to make enquiries as my father was a good arabic scholar my mother always entertained a faint hope that he might have escaped especially as we know that a good many of the egyptian soldiers were not killed but were taken prisoners and made to serve in the mahdis army  yes there are several of them among the khalifas artillerymen but i am very much afraid that none of the officers were spared you see they kept together in a body and died fighting to the last  i have hardly any hopes myself sir still as my father was interpreter he might not have been with the others but in some other part of the square that was attacked  that is possible but he was a white man and in the heat of the battle i dont think that the dervishes would have made any exception you see there were two correspondents with hicks and neither of them has ever been heard of and they must i should think have joined in that last desperate charge of his  well for the present i must make you a sort of extra aidedecamp and what with one thing and another i have no doubt that i shall find plenty for you to do as such you will of course be a member of headquarters mess and therefore escape the trouble of providing for yourself you have not brought a servant up with you i suppose  no sir captain ewart who most kindly advised me as to my outfit said that if i could find an intelligent native here it would be better than taking a man from cairo  quite right and the fellows one picks up at cairo are generally lazy and almost always dishonest the men you get here may not know much but are ready enough to learn and if well treated will go through fire and water for their master  go down to the stores and tell the officer in charge there that i shall be glad if he will pick out two or three fellows from whom you may choose a servant  when gregory had given his message the officer said  you had better pick out one for yourself mr hilliard strength and willingness to work are the points i keep my eye upon and except for the foremen of the gangs their intelligence does not interest me you had better take a turn among the parties at work and pick out a man for yourself  gregory was not long in making his choice he selected a young fellow who although evidently exerting himself to the utmost was clearly incapable of doing his share in carrying the heavy bales and boxes that were easily handled by older men he had a pleasant face and looked more intelligent than most of the others  to what tribe do you belong gregory asked him  the jaalin i come from near metemmeh  i want a servant you do not seem to be strong enough for this work but if you will be faithful and do what i tell you i will try you  the young fellows face lit up  i will be faithful bey it would be kind of you to take me i am not at my full strength yet and although i try my hardest i cannot do as much as strong men and then i am abused i will be very faithful and if you do not find me willing to do all that you tell me you can send me back to work here  well come along with me then  he took him to the officer  i have chosen this man sir can i take him away at once  certainly he has been paid up to last night  thank you very much i will settle with him for today  and followed by the young tribesman he went to the headquarters camp near which an empty hut was assigned to him    chapter 6 gregory volunteers   the hut of which gregory took possession was constructed of dry mud the roof was of poles on which were thickly laid boughs and palm leaves and on these a layer of clay a foot thick an opening in the wall eighteen inches square served as a window near the door the floor was littered with rubbish of all kinds  what is your name  zaki  well zaki the first thing is to clear out all this rubbish and sweep the floor as clean as you can i am going down to the river to get my baggage up can you borrow a shovel or something of that sort from one of the natives here or if he will sell it buy one i will pay when i return it will always come in useful if you cannot get a shovel a hoe will do ah i had better give you a dollar the man might not trust you  he then walked down to the river and found the black corporal sitting tranquilly by the side of his baggage the man stood up and saluted and on gregory saying that he had now a house at once told off two soldiers to carry the things  arriving at the hut he found zaki hard at work shovelling the rubbish through the doorway just as he came up the boy brought down his tool with a crash upon a little brown creature that was scuttling away  what is that zaki  that is a scorpion bey i have killed four of them  that is not at all pleasant gregory said there may be plenty of them up among the boughs overhead  zaki nodded  plenty of creatures he said some snakes  then we will smoke them out before i go in when you have got the rubbish out make a fire in the middle wet some leaves and things and put them on and we will hang a blanket over the window and shut the door i will moisten some powder and scatter it among the leaves and the sulphur will help the smoke to bring them down  this was done the door closed and as it did not fit at all tightly the cracks were filled with some damp earth from the watercourse  what did you pay for the shovel zaki  half a dollar bey here is the other half  well you had better go and buy some things for yourself tomorrow i will make other arrangements get a fire going out here there is a sauce pan and a kettle so you can boil some rice or fry some meat  gregory then went again to the officer who was acting as quartermaster  i have been speaking to the general the latter said you will mess with the staff the dinner hour is seven oclock i am sure you will soon feel at home  gregory now strolled through the camp the troops were in little mud huts of their own construction as these in the heat of the day were much cooler than tents the sun was getting low and the soudanese troops were all occupied in cooking mending their clothes sweeping the streets between the rows of huts and other light duties they seemed to gregory as full of fun and life as a party of schoolboyslaughing joking and playing practical tricks on each other  the physique of some of the regiments was splendid the men averaging over six feet in height and being splendidly built other regiments recruited among different tribes were not so tall but their sturdy figures showed them to be capable of any effort they might be called upon to make  one of the officers came out of his tent as he passed  you are a new arrival i think sir he said we have so few white officers here that one spots a fresh face at once  yes i only arrived two or three hours ago my name is hilliard i am not attached to any regiment but as i speak the languages well general hunter is going so he said to make me generally useful i only received my commission a few days before leaving cairo  well come in and have a soda and whisky the heat out here is frightful you can tell me the last news from cairo and when we are going to move  i shall be happy to come in and have a chat gregory said but i do not drink anything i have been brought up in cairo and am accustomed to heat and i find that drinking only makes one more thirsty  i believe it does the other said especially when the liquid is almost as hot as one is ones self will you sit down on that box chairs are luxuries that we do not indulge in here well have you heard anything about a move  nothing but the officers i have spoken to all seem to think that it will soon begin a good many came up with me to wady halfa and the stations on the river and i heard that all who had sufficiently recovered were under orders to rejoin very shortly  yes i suppose it wont be long of course we know nothing here and i dont expect we shall till the order comes for us to start this is not the time of year when one expects to be on the move and if we do go it is pretty certain that it is because kitchener has made up his mind for a dash forward you see if we take abu hamed and drive the dervishes away we can at once push the railway on to that place and as soon as it is done the troops can be brought up and an advance made to berber if not farther during the cool seasonif you can ever call it a cool season here  is there any great force at abu hamed  no nothing that could stand against this for a moment their chief force outside omdurman is at metemmeh under mahmud the khalifas favourite son you see the jaalin made fools of themselves instead of waiting until we could lend them a hand they revolted as soon as we took dongola and the result was that mahmud came down and pretty well wiped them out they defended themselves stoutly at metemmeh but had no chance against such a host as he brought with him the town was taken and its defenders between two and three thousand fighting men were all massacred together with most of the women and children  by the accounts brought down to us by men who got away it must have been an even more horrible business than usual and the dervishes are past masters in the art of massacre however i think that their course is nearly up of late a good many fugitives from kordofan have arrived here and they say that there will be a general revolt there when they hear that we have given the dervishes a heavy thrashing  and where do you think the great fight is likely to take place gregory asked  not this side of metemmeh except at abu hamed we hear of no other strong dervish force between this and omdurman if mahmud thinks himself strong enough no doubt he will fight but if he and the khalifa know their business he will fall back and with the forces at omdurman fight one big battle the two armies together will from what we hear amount to sixty or seventy thousand and there is no doubt whatever that with all their faults the beggars can fight it will be a tough affair but i believe we shall have some british troops here to help before the final advance we can depend now on both the soudanese and the egyptians to fight hard but there are not enough of them the odds would be too heavy and the sirdar is not a man to risk failure but with a couple of brigades of british infantry there can be no doubt what the result will be and i fancy that if we beat them in one big fight it will be all up with mahdism  it is only because the poor beggars of tribesmen regard the dervishes as invincible that they have put up so long with their tyranny but the rising of the jaalin and the news we get from kordofan show that the moment they hear the dervishes are beaten and khartoum is in our hands there will be a general rising and the dervishes will be pretty well exterminated we all hope that mahmud wont fight for if he does and we beat him the khalifa and his lot may lose heart and retire before we get to omdurman and once away the tremendous business of trying to follow him will confront us here we have got the river and the railway but we have no land carriage for an army and he might keep on falling back to the great lakes for anything that we could do to overtake him so we all hope that mahmud will retire to omdurman without fighting and with such a host as the khalifa would then have he would be certain to give battle before abandoning his capital  they are finelooking fellows these blacks gregory said  they are splendid fellowsthey love fighting for fightings sake it is in their opinion the only worthy occupation for a man and they have shown themselves worthy to fight by the side of our men they have a perfect confidence in us and would i believe go anywhere we led them they say themselves we are never afraidjust like english  there seem to be a good many women about the camps  yes their women follow them wherever they go they cook for them and generally look after them they are as warlike as their husbands and encourage them when they go out to battle with their applause and curious quavering cries the men get very little pay but as they are provided with rations and draw a certain amount for the women it costs next to nothing and i fancy that having the wives with them pays well i believe they would rather be killed than come back and face their reproaches  i could not wish to have more cheery or better fellows with me they never grumble they are always merry and really they seem to be tireless they practically give no trouble whatever and it is good to see how they brighten up when there is a chance of a fight  i hope i shall see them at it before long gregory said now i must be going for i have to change and put on my mess uniform before dinner i am rather nervous about that for i am not accustomed to dine with generals  you will find it all very pleasant the other said hunter is a splendid fellow and is adored by his men his staff are all comparatively young men with none of the stiffness of the british staff officer about them we are all youngthere is scarcely a man with the rank of captain in the british army out here we are all majors or colonels in the egyptian army but most of us are subalterns in our own regiments it is good training for us at home a subaltern is merely a machine to carry out orders he is told to do this and he does it for him to think for himself would be a heinous offence he is altogether without responsibility and without initiative and by the time he becomes a field officer he is hidebound he has never thought for himself and he cant be expected to begin to do so after working for twenty years like a machine  you will see if we ever have a big war that will be our weak point if it wasnt for wars like this and our little wars in india where men do learn to think and take responsibility i dont know where our general officers would get their training  well you must be going goodbye we shall often meet there are so few of us here that we are always running against each other i wont ask you to dine with us for a few days no doubt you would like to get accustomed to headquarters mess first of course hunter and the brigade staff dine together while we have little regimental messes among ourselves which i prefer when there are only three or four of us one can sit down in ones shirt sleeves whereas at the brigade mess one must of course turn up in uniform which in this climate is stifling  the meal was a more pleasant one than gregory had anticipated on board the steamer he had of course dined with the other officers and he found little difference here ten sat down including the principal medical officer and a captainthe head of the station intelligence department major wingate being at present at wady halfa except for the roughness of the surroundings it was like a regimental mess and the presence of the general commanding in no way acted as a damper to the conversation  general hunter had before sitting down introduced him to all the members with a few pleasant words which had put him at his ease gregory had on his way up learned a good deal as to the officers who were down at cairo for their health and he was able to say who were convalescent and who had sailed or were on the point of sailing for england  the table was formed of two long benches and had been constructed by the engineers it was laid under a large tent of which the walls had been removed to give a free passage of air  although scarcely up to the standard of a mess dinner at home it was by no means a bad one consisting of soup fish from the river a joint of beef at one end and of mutton at the other curried kidneys sweet omelettes and cheese whisky with water or soda to drink at dinner and after the meal four bottles of claret were placed on the table and cigars or pipes lit half an hour later four of the party sat down to whist and the rest going outside the tent sat or threw themselves down on the sand and smoked or chatted till it was time to turn in  gregorys first step next morning was to buy a horse this he purchased from some fugitives who had come down from kordofan it was a good animal though in poor condition and would soon pick up flesh when well attended and fed to accustom himself to riding gregory went out on it for a couple of hours every morning getting up before daybreak so as to take exercise before the work of the day began he also followed the example of the officers of the egyptian regiments and purchased a camel for the conveyance of his own baggage  you will find it a great advantage one of them said to him of course times may arrive when you will have to leave it behind but as a rule there is no trouble about it at all you hire a native driver who costs practically nothing and he keeps with the baggage no one asks any questions and when you halt for a day or two you have comforts of course with a british regiment you are cut down to the last ounce but with us it is altogether different there being only three or four white officers to each regiment the few extra camels in the train make no appreciable difference besides these black fellows consider it quite natural and proper that their white officers should fare in a very different way from themselves whereas a british tommy would be inclined to grumble if he saw his officers enjoying luxuries while he himself had to rough it  as the horse only cost three pounds and the camel only five gregorys store of money was not seriously affected by the purchases for both animals although in poor condition from their journey from kordofan a fortnights rest and good feeding did wonders  zaki had not much to do but gregory was well satisfied with the selection he had made he looked after and groomed the horse saw that the native with the camel took care of it and went down regularly to the river to water it every evening while he himself did the same with the horse he always had a jug of cold tea ready for gregory whenever he came in and the floor of the tent was kept scrupulously clean zakis only regret was that he could not do more for his master but he was consoled by being told that the time would soon come when he would be more actively engaged  from the first day of his arrival gregory was kept fully employed sometimes he assisted the officer of the intelligence department in interviewing fugitives who had arrived from berber and other points on the river from kordofan or from villages on the white nile sometimes he carried messages from the general to the officers in command of the two egyptian brigades he had to listen to disputes between natives returning to their homes from which they had been driven by the dervishes and those they found in possession of their land he took notes of the arguments on both sides and submitted them to the general for his decision  the work would have been trifling in any other climate but was exhausting in the sweltering heat of the day and he was not sorry when the sun sank and he could take off his khaki tunic and go down to the river for a swim  one evening as they were sitting after dinner general hunter said  it is very annoying that while these natives making their way down the country are able to tell us a good deal of what is taking place on the nile from omdurman down to metemmeh and while we also get news of the state of things at berber and abu hamed we know nothing whatever of mahmuds intentions nor indeed anything of what is doing at metemmeh itself since it was captured by the dervishes and as we heard the whole population destroyed  of course mahmud has the choice of three courses he can stay where he is he can march his whole force to berber or he can advance against us here i dont suppose that he has any idea of the progress the railway is making from wady halfa he may have heard and no doubt he has heard that we are making a road of some sort across the desert in the direction of abu hamed but of the capabilities of the railway he can form no idea and may well believe that the march of an army across what is practically a waterless desert is a matter of impossibility  on the other hand he knows that we are gathering a considerable force here and with his limited knowledge doubtless supposes that we are going to cross the bayuda desert to metemmeh as the gordon relief column did or that if we are not coming that way we intend to follow the river bank up to berber unquestionably his best course if he considers as we may be sure he does that the force under his command is strong enough to crush us here would be to push across the desert and fall upon us before reinforcements arrive but it is reported and i believe truly that the khalifa his father has positively refused to let him do so still sons have disobeyed their fathers before now  there is it is true the difficulty of water but that is not so serious in the case of a dervish force as it is with us in the first place they can march twice as far as we can in the second place they are accustomed to go a long time without water and are but little affected by the heat lastly they have nothing to carry except their weapons a few handfuls of dates and their water gourds still we know that the forces that have one after another arrived here have been greatly weakened by the journey however mahmud may attempt it for he must know from his spies here that we have at present no such land transport as would be required were we intending to advance across the desert he may therefore move at least a portion of his force to berber trusting to the fact that even did we make an advance south from here with the intention of cutting off his retreat to khartoum he would be able to reach metemmeh before we could get there  undoubtedly a british general if commanding a force constituted as mahmuds is would make a dash across the desert and fall upon us unless indeed he felt certain that after the difficulties we encountered last time we attempted to take the desert route we should be certain to advance by the river step by step continuing the policy that we have followed since we began to push forward from assouan  mahmud is in a very difficult position he is controlled by his father at khartoum among those with him are many important emirs men of almost equal rank with himself and he could hardly hope that whatever decision he might personally arrive at would be generally accepted by all and those who opposed him would do so with all the more force as they could declare that in making any movement he was acting in opposition to his fathers orders  however our total ignorance as to mahmuds plans and intentions is most unfortunate but it can hardly be helped for naturally the natives coming down from kordofan give metemmeh a very wide berth as to sending up any of the natives here to find out what is going on it is out of the question for they would be detected at once as their language is so different from that of the baggara  later on the general retired to his quarters gregory went there  can i speak to you for a few minutes sir he asked  certainly mr hilliard what can i do for you  i have been thinking over what you were saying regarding information as to mahmuds intentions with your permission i am ready to undertake to go into his camp and to find out what the general opinion is as to his plans  impossible mr hilliard i admire your courage in making the offer but it would be going to certain death  i do not think so sir i talk baggara better than the negro dialect that passes here it is among the baggara that i am likely to learn something of my fathers fate and as the old nurse from whom i learnt these languages had been for a long time among that tribe she devoted at my mothers request more time to teaching me their arab dialect than any other and i am convinced that i could pass unsuspected among them as far as language is concerned there is no great difference between arab features and european and i think that when i am stained brown and have my head partly shaved according to their fashion there will be little fear of my being detected  as to costume that is easy enough i have not seen any of the dervishes yet but the natives who have come in from el obeid or any other neighbourhood where they are masters could give me an account of their dress and the way in which they wear the patches on their clothes which are the distinguishing mark of the mahdists  i could tell you that so could any of the officers their dress differs very little from the ordinary arab costume nearly all wear loose white trousers coming down to the ankles in some cases these are the usual baggy eastern articles in others the legs are separate they almost all wear the white garment coming down to the knee with of course a sash round the waist and sleeves reaching down to the elbow or an inch or two below it some wear turbans but the majority simply skullcaps i could get the dress made up in three or four hours but the risk is altogether too great and i do not think that i should be justified in allowing you to undertake it  i really do not think that there will be any great danger sir if there were no great object to be gained it would be different but in view of the great importance as you said this evening of learning mahmuds intentions the risk of one life being lost even were it great is nothing as you say the sirdars plans might be greatly affected by the course mahmud adopts and in such a case the life of a subaltern like myself is a matter scarcely to be considered  from childhood i have been preparing to go among the dervishes and this is what i propose doing as soon as khartoum is recaptured therefore sir if by anticipating my work by a few months or possibly a year i can render a service to the army i would gladly undertake it if you will give me permission to do so  the general was for a minute or two silent  well hilliard he said at last on thinking it over as you put it i do not know that i should be justified in refusing your offer it is a very gallant one and may possibly meet with success  thank you sir i shall be really glad to enter upon the work i have looked forward to although it may have no direct bearing upon the discovery of my fathers fate it will be a start in that direction do you think that i had better go mounted or on foot  i should say certainly on horseback but there is no occasion for any hasty determination every step should be carefully considered and we should as far as possible foresee and provide for every emergency that may arise think it over well yourself some time tomorrow i will discuss it again with you  gregory went straight back to his hut  come in zaki i want to speak to you  light the lamp and shut the door now sit down there do you know the country between this and metemmeh  yes master i travelled there with my father six years ago  is it difficult to find the way  it is not difficult there are many signs of the passage of caravans there are skeletons of the camels of the english expedition there are very many of them it would not be difficult even for one who has never passed them to find the way  and there are wells  there are wells at howeyat and abu halfa at gakdul and abu klea also at gubat  that is to say water will be found nearly every day  quite every day to one on horseback the longest distance is from gakdul to abu klea but that would not be too long for mounted men and could even be done by a native on foot in a long days march  do you know whether mahmuds army is in metemmeh or outside the town  from what i have heard most of the dervish force is on the hills behind the town they say metemmeh is full of dead and that even the dervishes do not care to live there  the baggara are mostly mounted are they not  most of them are so though there are some on foot the leaders of the tribesmen who fight for the khalifa are all on horseback but most of the army are on foot  you do not speak the baggara language i suppose  zaki shook his head  i know a little arabic but not much  i suppose most of the arab tribes in the soudan speak a dialect very much like the baggara  yes it is everywhere arabic and there is but little difference they can all understand each other and talk together may your servant ask why you put these questions  yes zaki but you must not mention what i tell you to a soul  zaki will be as silent as the grave  well i am going up dressed as a mahdist i can speak the baggara tongue well i am going to try and find out what they are going to do whether they will march to berber or come here or remain at metemmeh  zaki stared at his master in speechless amazement gregory could not help smiling at the expression of his face  there does not seem much difficulty in it he said i can speak with you in the dialect of dongola but the baggara language is much easier to me because i have been accustomed to speak arabic since i was a child of course my skin will be dyed and i shall wear the dervish dress there is no difficulty in this matter  but they would cut you in pieces my lord if they found out that you were a white  no doubt they would but there is no reason why they should find that out it would be much more dangerous for you to go into their camp than it would be for me in the first place you can scarcely speak any arabic and in the second they would see by your features that you are one of the jaalin whereas my features when stained would be much more like those of the arabs than yours would  where should i be most likely to meet the dervishes first  i do not think any of them are much this side of metemmeh at present sometimes parties ride down to gakdul and they have even passed on till they are within sight of this camp but when they have found out that the wells are still unoccupied and the army here quiet they go back again  if i go on horseback zaki i shall want someone with me who will act as a guide and who will look after his horse and mine at some place near the river where he can find a hiding place while i am away in the dervish camp  would you take me my lord zaki said quickly  i would much rather take you than anyone else if you are willing to go zaki  surely i will go with my lord the native said no one has ever been so good to me as he has if my lord is killed i am ready to die with him he may count on me to do anything that he requires even to go with him into the dervish camp i might go as a slave my lord  that would not do zaki i do not wish to travel as a person who could ride attended by a slave people might say who is this man where does he come from how is it that no one knows a man who rides with a slave  my great object will be to enter the camp quietly as one who has but left half an hour before when i have once entered it and they ask whence i came i must tell them some likely story that i have made up as for example that i have come from el obeid and that i am an officer of the governor there that finding he could not get away himself he yielded to my request that i might come and help to drive the infidels into the sea  zaki nodded  that would be a good tale my lord for men who have escaped from el obeid and have come here have said that the khalifas troops there have not been called to join him at omdurman for it is necessary to keep a strong force there as many of the tribes of the province would rise in rebellion if they had the chance therefore you would not be likely to meet anyone from el obeid in mahmuds camp  how is it zaki that when so many in the soudan have suffered at the hands of the dervishes they not only remain quiet but supply the largest part of the khalifas army  because my lord none of them can trust the others it is madness for one tribe to rise as the jaalin did at metemmeh the dervishes wiped them out from the face of the earth many follow him because they see that allah has always given victory to the mahdists therefore the mahdi must be his prophet others join his army because their villages have been destroyed and their fields wasted and they see no other way of saving themselves from starvation  there are many who fight because they are fond of fighting you see how gladly they take service with you and fight against their own countrymen although you are christians suppose you were to conquer the khalifa tomorrow half his army would enlist in your service if you would take them a man who would be contented to till his fields if he could do so in peace and quiet fears that he may see his produce eaten by others and his house set on fire and would rather leave his home and fighthe cares not against whom  the mahdist army are badly fed and badly paid they can scarce keep life together but in the egyptian army the men are well taken care of they have their rations and their pay they say that if they are wounded or lose a limb and are no more able to fight they receive a pension is it wonderful that they should come to you and be faithful  well zaki we wont talk any longer now it is agreed then that if i go on this expedition you will accompany me  certainly master wherever you go i am ready to go whatever happens to you will i hope happen to me  on the following afternoon gregory was sent for  i have given the matter a good deal of thought mr hilliard the general said and have decided to accept your offer i suppose that you have been thinking the matter over do you decide to go on foot or mounted  on horseback sir my boy is perfectly willing to go with me he knows the way and the position of the wells on the road my plan is that when we get near metemmeh he shall remain with the horses somewhere near the river and i shall enter the camp on foot i am less likely to be noticed that way if questioned my story will be that my father was at el obeid and that the governor there is by the khalifas orders holding his force in hand to put down any outbreaks there may be in the province and that wishing to fight against the infidel i have come on my own account if i am asked why i had not come on horseback i shall say that i had ridden to within the last two or three miles and that the horse had then died  but i do not expect to be questioned at all as one man on foot is as nothing in an army of twenty or thirty thousand gathered from all over the soudan  you quite understand mr hilliard that you are taking your life in your hands and that there is no possibility whatever of our doing anything for you if you get into trouble  quite sir if i am detected i shall probably be killed at once i do not think that there is more risk in it than in going into battle as i have told you i have so far as i know no relatives in the world and there will be no one to grieve if i never come back again  as to the clothes i can easily buy them from one of the natives here many of them are dressed in the garments of the dervishes who were killed when we came up here except of course that the patches were taken off i will get my man to buy a suit for himself and one for me it would be better than having new clothes made for even if these were dirtied they would not look old when he has bought the clothes he can give them a good washing and then get a piece of stuff to sew on as patches  i am afraid sir that there will be little chance of my being able to obtain any absolute news of mahmuds intentions but only to glean general opinion in the camp it is not likely that the news of any intended departure would be kept a secret up till the last moment among the dervishes as it would be here  quite so the general agreed we may take it as certain that the matter would be one of common talk of course mahmud and his principal advisers might change their minds at any moment still i think that were it intended to make a move against us or to berber it would be generally known  i may tell you that we do not intend to cross the bayuda desert we shall go up the river but this is a secret that will be kept till the last moment and before we start we shall do all in our power to spread a belief that we are going to advance to metemmeh we know that they are well informed by their spies here of our movements we shall send a strong force to make a reconnaissance as far as gakdul this will appear to be a preliminary step to our advance and should keep mahmud inactive till too late he will not dare advance to berber because he will be afraid of our cutting him off from omdurman  you are satisfied with your horse it is advisable that you should have a good one and yet not so good as to attract attention  yes i could not want a better horse general he is not handsome but i have ridden him a great deal and he is certainly fast and being desert bred i have no doubt has plenty of endurance i shall of course get one for my boy  there are plenty in the transport yard they have been bought up from fugitives who have come in here i will write you an order to select any one you choose and if you see one you think better than your own you can take it also and hand yours over to the transport to keep until you return  you should take a martinihenri with you i will give you an order for one on one of the native regiments they are as you know armed with them and have of course a few cases of spare rifles a good many have fallen into the hands of the dervishes at one time or another so that your carrying such a weapon will not excite any remark it would not do to take a revolver but no doubt you will be able to buy pistols that have been brought down by the fugitives you will certainly be able to get them at some of those greek shops they buy up all that kind of thing of course you will carry one of the dervish long knives  is there anything else that you can think of  nothing sir  when will you be ready do you suppose  by the day after tomorrow sir i shall start after dark so that no one will notice my going with your permission i will come round before i set off so that you can see whether the disguise is good enough to pass    chapter 7 to metemmeh   zaki at once set to work to collect the articles needed for the journey and gregory obtained from the transport another horse and two native saddles he was well satisfied with his own animal and even had he found in the transport yard a better horse he would still have preferred his own as they were accustomed to each other he bought pistols for himself and zaki and a matchlock for the latter  everything was ready by the time gregory went to the mess to lunch on the day fixed for his departure nothing whatever had been said as to his leaving as it was possible that some of the native servants who waited upon them might have picked up sufficient english to gather that something important was about to take place when however the meal was over and he said carelessly i shall not be at mess this evening he saw by the expression of the officers faces that they all were aware of the reason for his absence one after another they either shook hands with him or gave him a quiet pat on the shoulder with the words take care of yourself lad or a safe journey and a speedy return or some other kind wish  going to his hut he was shaved by zaki at the back of the neck up to his ears so that the white closelyfitting cap would completely cover the hair outside the tent a sauce pan was boiling with herbs and berries which the lad had procured from an old woman who was considered to have a great knowledge of simples at four in the afternoon gregory was stained from head to foot two coats of the dye being applied this used but a small quantity of the liquor and the rest was poured into a gourd for future use the dresses were ready with the exception of the mahdi patches which were to be sewn on at their first halting place  before it was dark gregory went across to the generals quarters the black sentry stopped him  the general wants to speak to me gregory said in arabic  the man called up the native sergeant from the guard tent who asked what he wanted  i am here by the orders of the general  the sergeant looked doubtful but went in he returned in a minute and motioned to gregory to follow him in the general looked at him from head to foot  i suppose it is you hilliard he said but i certainly should not have recognized you with that yellowishbrown skin you could pass anywhere as a soudan arab will the colour last  i am assured that it will last for some days but i am taking enough with me to renew it four or five times  well unless some unexpected obstacle occurs i think you are safe from detection mind you avoid men from el obeid if you do not fall in with them you should be safe of course when you have sewn on those patches your disguise will be complete  i suppose you have no idea how long you will be away  it will take me five days to go there and five days to come back i should think that if i am three days in the camp i ought to get all the information required in a fortnight i should be here though of course i may be longer if i am not back within a few days of that time you will know that it is because i have stayed there in the hopes of getting more certain news if i dont return in three weeks it will be because something has gone wrong  i hope it will not be so lad as regards appearance and language i have no fear of your being detected but you must always bear in mind that there are other points you have had the advantage of seeing the camps of the native regiments when the men are out of uniformhow they walk laugh uproariously play tricks with each other and generally behave these are all natives of the soudan and no small proportion of them have been followers of the mahdi and have fought against us so they may be taken as typical of the men you are going among it is in all these little matters that you will have to be careful  now i will not detain you longer i suppose your horses are on board  it had been arranged that gregory should be taken down to korti in a native craft that was carrying some stores required at that camp  yes sir my boy put them on board two hours ago  here is the pass by which you can enter or leave the british lines at any time the boat will be there before daylight but the landing of the stores will not of course take place until later show this pass to the first officer who comes down it contains an order for you to be allowed to start on your journey at once  this other pass is for your return you had better at your first halt sew it under one of your patches it is as you see written on a piece of linen so that however closely you may be examined there will be no stiffness or crackling as would be the case with paper  now goodbye hilliard it is a satisfaction to me that you have undertaken this journey on your own initiative and on your own request i believe that you have a fair chance of carrying it throughmore so than men with wider shoulders and bigger limbs would have if you come to grief i shall blame myself for having accepted your offer but i shall at least know that i thought it over seriously and that seeing the importance of the object in view i did not feel myself justified in refusing  with a cordial shake of the hand he said goodbye to gregory the latter went off to his hut he did not leave it until dusk and then went down to the boat where zaki had remained with the horses  as soon as it started they lay down alongside some bales on the deck of the native craft and were soon asleep they did not wake until a slight bump told them they were alongside the wharf at korti  day was just breaking so no move was made until an hour later an officer came down with the fatigue party to unload the stores that she had brought down when the horses were ashore gregory handed the pass to the officer who was standing on the bank he looked at it with some surprise  going to do some scouting he muttered and then called to a native officer pass these two men beyond the outposts they have an order from general hunter  will you be away long he asked gregory in arabic  a week or more my lord the latter replied  ah i suppose you are going to gakdul as far as we have heard there are no dervishes there well you must keep a sharp lookout they may be in hiding anywhere about there and your heads wont be worth much if they lay hands on you  we intend to do so sir and then mounting they rode on the native officer walking beside them  you know the country i suppose he said the dervishes are bad but i would rather fall into their hands than lose my way in the desert the one is a musket ball or a quick chop with a knife the other an agony for two or three days  i have been along the road before zaki said there is no fear of my losing my way and even if i did so i could travel by the stars  i wish we were all moving the native said it is dull work staying here month after month  as soon as they were beyond the lines they thanked the officer and went off at a pace native horses are capable of keeping up for hours  korti is a much pleasanter camp to stay in than merawi gregory said it really looks a delightful place it is quite evident that the mahdists have never made a raid here  the camp stood on a high bank above the river there were spreading groves of trees and the broad avenues that had been constructed when the gordon relief expedition was encamped there could still be seen beyond it was a stretch of land which had been partly cultivated sevas grass grew plentifully and acacia and mimosa shrubs in patches  they rode to the wells of hambok a distance of some fiveandthirty miles which they covered in five hours there they halted watered their horses and after giving them a good feed turned them out to munch the shrubs or graze on the grass as they chose they then had a meal from the food they had brought with them made a shelter of bushes for the heat was intense and afterwards sewed the mahdi patches upon their clothes  when the sun went down they fetched the horses in gave them a small feed and then fastened them to some bushes near as there was plenty of water in the wells they took an empty gourd down and stripping poured water over their heads and bodies then feeling greatly refreshed dressed and lay down to sleep  the moon rose between twelve and one and after giving the horses a drink they mounted and rode to gakdul which they reached soon after daybreak they had stopped a mile away and zaki went forward on foot hiding himself as much as possible from observation on his return he reported that no one was at the wells and they therefore rode on taking every precaution against surprise  the character of the scenery had completely changed and they had for some miles been winding along at the foot of the jebeleljilif hills these were steep and precipitous with spurs and intermediate valleys the wells differed entirely from those at hambok which were merely holes dug in the sand the water being brought up in one of the skin bags they had brought with them and poured into shallow cisterns made in the surface at gakdul the wells were large pools in the rock at the foot of one of the spurs of the hill two miles from the line of the caravan route here the water was beautifully clear and abundant enough for the wants of a large force  it is lucky i had you with me zaki for i should certainly have gone straight on past the wells without knowing where they were and as there are no others this side of abu klea i should have had rather a bad day  the three forts which the guards had built when they came on in advance of general stewarts column were still standing as well as a number of smaller ones which had been afterwards added  it is rather a bad place for being caught zaki for the ground is so broken and rocky that the dervishes might creep up without being seen  yes sir it is a bad place zaki agreed i am glad that none of the dervishes were here for we should not have seen them until we were quite close  zaki had on the road cut a large faggot of dried sticks and a fire was soon lighted  you must give the horses a good allowance of grain gregory said for they will be able to pick up nothing here and it is a long ride to abu klea  we shall have to be very careful there my lord it is not so very far from metemmeh and we are very likely to find baggaras at the wells it was there they met the english force that went through to metemmeh  i think it would be better for us to halt early this evening and camp at the foot of jebel sergain the english halted there before advancing to abu klea we can take plenty of water in the two skins to give the horses a drink and leave enough for tomorrow there is grass in abundance there  when the moon rises we can make our way round to avoid abu klea and halt in the middle of the day for some hours we could then ride on as soon as the sun is low halt when it becomes too dark to ride and then start again when the moon rises in that way we shall reach the river before it is light  i think that would be a very good plan zaki we should find it very difficult to explain who we were if we met any dervishes at abu klea i will have a look at my sketch map we have found it very good and accurate so far and with that and the compass the general gave me before starting we ought to have no difficulty in striking the river as the direction is only a little to the east of south  he opened a tin of preserved meat of which he had four with him and placed it to warm near the fire  we should have had to throw the other tins away if we had gone on to abu klea he said it would never have done for them to be found upon us if we were searched  when the meat was hot they ate it using some biscuits as plates afterwards they feasted on a melon they had brought with them and were glad to hear their horses munching the leaves of some shrubs near  when the moon rose they started it was slow work at first as they had some difficulty in passing the rough country lying behind the hill once past it they came upon a level plain and rode fast for some hours at ten oclock they halted and lay down under the shelter of the shrubs mounting again at four and riding for another three hours  how far do you think we are from the river now by the map i should think we cannot be much more than twenty miles from it  i dont know my lord i have never been along here before but it certainly ought not to be farther than that  we have ridden nine hours we travelled slowly for the first four or five but we have come fast since then we must give the horses a good rest so we will not move on till the moon rises which will be about a quarter to two it does not give a great deal of light now and we shall have to make our way through the scrub but at any rate we ought to be close to the river before morning  when the sun was low they again lit a fire and had another good meal giving the greater portion of their stock of biscuits to the horses and a good drink of water  we must use up all we can eat before tomorrow zaki and betake ourselves to a diet of dried dates there is enough water left to give the horses a drink before we start then we shall start as genuine dervishes  they found that the calculation they had made as to distance was correct and before daybreak arrived on the bank of the nile and at once encamped in a grove in the morning they could see the houses of metemmeh rising from the line of sandy soil some five miles away  there seems to be plenty of bush and cover all along the bank zaki we will stay here till the evening and then move three miles farther down so that you may be handy if i have to leave the dervishes in a hurry  could we not go into the camp my lord  it would be much better in some respects if we could but you see you do not speak arabic  no master but you could say i was carried off as a slave when i was a boy you see i do speak a little arabic and could understand simple orders just as any slave boy would if he had been eight or ten years among the arabs  it would certainly be a great advantage to have you and the horses handy however at first i will go in and join the dervishes and see how they encamp they are no doubt a good deal scattered and if we could find a quiet spot where a few mounted men have taken up their station we would join them but before we did that it would be necessary to find out whether they came from kordofan or from some of the villages on the white nile it would never do to stumble into a party from el obeid  they remained quiet all day the wood extended a hundred and fifty yards back from the river and there was little fear that anyone coming down from omdurman would enter it when within sight of metemmeh at dusk they rode on again until they judged that they were within two miles of the town and then entering a clump of high bushes by the river halted for the night    chapter 8 among the dervishes   in the morning gregory started alone as soon as it was light as he neared the town he saw that there were several native craft on the river and that boats were passing to and fro between the town and shendy on the opposite bank from the water side a number of men were carrying what appeared to be bags of grain towards the hills behind the town while others were straggling down towards the river  without being questioned gregory entered metemmeh but stopped there for a very few minutes everywhere were the bodies of men women and children of donkeys and other animals all were now shrivelled and dried by the sun but the stench was almost unbearable and he was glad to hurry away  once beyond the walls he made for the hill many tents could be seen there and great numbers of men moving about he felt sure that among so many no one would notice that he was a newcomer and after moving among the throng he soon sat down among a number of dervishes who were eating their morning meal taking some dates out of his bag he munched them quietly  from the talk going on he soon perceived that there was a considerable amount of discontent at the long delay some of the men were in favour of moving to berber on the ground that they would at least fare better there but the majority were eager to march north to drive the infidels from merawi and dongola  mahmud would do that i am sure one of them said if he had but his will but how could we march without provisions it is said that mahmud has asked for a sufficient supply to cross the bayuda and has promised to drive the infidels before him to assouan but the khalifa says no it would be better to wait till they come in a strong body and then to exterminate them if we are not to fight why were we sent here it would have been better to stay at omdurman because there we had plenty of food or if it ran short could march to the villages and take what we wanted of course the khalifa knows best but to us it seems strange indeed  there was a general chorus of assent after listening for some time gregory rose and passing over the ridge came upon the main camp here were a number of emirs and sheiks with their banners flying before the entrance of their tents the whole ground was thickly dotted with little shelters formed of bushes over which dark blankets were thrown to keep out the rays of the sun everywhere women were seated or standingsome talking to each other others engaged in cooking children played about boys came in loaded with faggots which they had gone long distances to cut in some places numbers of horses were picketed showing where the baggara cavalry were stationed  in the neighbourhood of the emirs tents there was some sort of attempt at order in the arrangement of the little shelters showing where the men of their tribes were encamped beyond straggling out for some distance were small encampments in some of which the men were still erecting shelters with the bushes the women and boys brought in most of these were evidently fresh arrivals who had squatted down as soon as they came up either from ignorance as to where their friends had encamped or from a preference for a quiet situation this fringe of new arrivals extended along the whole semicircle of the camp and as several small parties came up while gregory wandered about and he saw that no notice was taken of them by those already established he thought that he could bring zaki and the horses up without any fear of close questioning he therefore walked down again to the spot where he had left them and mounting they rode to the camp making a wide sweep so as to avoid the front facing metemmeh  we could camp equally well anywhere here zaki but we may as well go round to the extreme left as if we have to ride off suddenly we shall at least start from the nearest point to the line by which we came  there was a small clump of bushes a hundred yards or so from the nearest of the little shelters here they dismounted and at once began with their knives to cut down some of the bushes to form a screen from the sun they had watered the horses before they left the river and had also filled their water skins  i dont think we could find a better place zaki gregory said when having completed their shelter and thrown their blankets over it they lay down in the shade no doubt we shall soon be joined by others but as we are the first comers on this spot it will be for us to ask questions of them and after for them to make enquiries of us  i shall go into the camp as soon as the heat abates and people begin to move about again remember our storyyou were carried off from a jaalin village in a raid your master was a small sheik and is now with the force at el obeid you had been the companion of his son and when the latter made up his mind to come and fight here your master gave you your freedom so that you might fight by his sons side you might say that i have not yet settled under whose banner i shall fight all i wish is to be in the front of the battle when we meet the infidels that will be quite sufficient there are men here from almost every village in the soudan and no one will care much where his neighbours come from  mention that we intend to fight as matchlock men not on horseback as the animals are greatly fatigued from their long journey and will require rest for some time and being so far from home i fear that we might lose them if we went into the fight with them and in that case might have to journey on foot for a long time before we could get others  i dont at all suppose that it will be necessary for you to say all this people will be too much occupied with their own affairs to care much about others still it is well not to hesitate if questioned  talk and laughter in the great camp ceased now and it was not until the sun lost its power that it again began gregory did not move till it began to get dusk  i shall be away some time he said so dont be at all uneasy about me i shall take my black blanket so that i can cover myself with it and lie down as if asleep close to any of the emirs tents where i hear talk going on and so may be able to gather some idea as to their views i have already learned that the tribesmen have not heard of any immediate move and are discontented at being kept inactive so long the leaders however may have their plans but will not make them known to the men until it is time for action  the camp was thoroughly alive when he entered it men were sitting about in groups the women as before keeping near their little shelters laughing and chatting together and sometimes quarrelling from the manner of the men who either sat or walked about it was not difficult for gregory to distinguish between the villagers who had been dragged away from their homes and forced to enter the service of the khalifa and the baggara and kindred tribes who had so long held the soudan in subjection the former were quiet in their demeanour and sometimes sullen in their looks he had no doubt that when the fighting came these would face death at the hands of the infidels as bravely as their oppressors for the belief in mahdism was now universal his followers had proved themselves invincible they had no doubt that they would destroy the armies of egypt but they resented being dragged away from their quiet homes their families and their fields  among these the baggara strode haughtily splendid men for the most part tall lithe and muscular men with the supreme belief in themselves and in their cause carrying themselves as the norman barons might have done among a crowd of saxons the conquerors of the land the most trusted followers of the successor of the mahdi men who felt themselves invincible it was true that they had so far failed to overrun egypt and had even suffered reverses but these the khalifa had taught them to consider were due to disobedience of his orders or the result of their fighting upon unlucky days all this was soon to be reversed the prophecies had told that the infidels were about to be annihilated and that then they would sweep down without opposition and possess themselves of the plunder of egypt  gregory passed wholly unnoticed among the crowd there was nothing to distinguish him from others and the thought that an egyptian spy still less one of the infidels should venture into their camp had never occurred to one of that multitude occasionally he sat down near a group of the baggara listening to their talk they were impatient too but they were convinced that all was for the best and that when it was the will of allah they would destroy their enemy still there were expressions of impatience that mahmud was not allowed to advance  we know one said that it is at kirkeban that the last great destruction of the infidel is to take place and that these madmen are coming to their fate still we might move down and destroy those at dongola and along the river and possess ourselves of their arms and stores why should we come thus far from omdurman if we are to go no farther  why ask questions another said contemptuously enough that it is the command of the khalifa to whom power and knowledge has been given by the mahdi until he himself returns to earth to the khalifa will be revealed the day and the hour on which we are to smite the infidel if mahmud and the great emirs are all content to wait why should we be impatient  everywhere gregory went he heard the same feelings expressed the men were impatient to be up and doing but they must wait the appointed hour  it was late before he ventured to approach the tents of the leaders he knew that it was impossible to get near mahmud himself for he had his own bodyguard of picked men the night however was dark and enveloping himself from head to foot in his black blanket he crawled out until well beyond the line of tents and then very cautiously made his way towards them again he knew that he should see the white figures of the dervishes before they could make him out and he managed unnoticed to crawl up to one of the largest tents and lie down against it he heard the chatter of the women in an adjoining tent but there was no sound in that against which he lay  for an hour all was quiet then he saw two white figures coming from mahmuds camp which lay some fifty yards away to his delight they stopped at the entrance of the tent by which he was concealed and one said  i can well understand ibrahim khalim that your brother mahmud is sorely vexed that your father will not let him advance against the egyptians at merawi i fully share his feelings for could i not with my cavalry sweep them before me into the river even though no footmen came with me according to accounts they are but two or three thousand strong and i have as many horsemen under my command  that is so osman azrakyet but methinks my father is right if we were to march across the desert we would lose very many men and great numbers of animals and we should arrive weakened and dispirited if we remain here it is the egyptians who will have to bear the hardships of the march across the desert great numbers of the animals that carry the baggage and food without which the poor infidels are unable to march would die and the weakened force would be an easy prey for us  that is true the other said but they may come now as they came to dongola in their boats  they have the cataracts to ascend and the rapid currents of the nile at its full to struggle against there is a strong force at abu hamed and our governor at berber will move down there with all his force when he hears that the egyptians are coming up the cataracts should it be the will of allah that they should pass them and reach berber we shall know how to meet them mahmud has settled this evening that many strong forts are to be built on the river bank here and if the infidels try to advance farther by water they will be all sunk  i agree with you and mahmud and wish that it had been otherwise and that we could hurl ourselves at once upon the egyptians and prevent their coming fartherbut that would be but a partial success if we wait they will gather all their forces before they come and we shall destroy them at one blow then we shall seize all their stores and animals cross the desert to dongola march forward to assouan and there wait till the khalifa brings his own army and then who is to oppose us we will conquer the land of the infidel i am as eager for the day of battle as you are but it seems to me that it is best to wait here until the infidels come and i feel that it is wise of the khalifa thus to order now i will to my tent  as soon as ibrahim khalim had entered his tent gregory crawled away well satisfied that he had gained exactly the information he had come to gather he had gone but a few paces when he saw a white figure striding along in front of the tents he stopped and threw himself down  unfortunately the path taken by the sheik was directly towards him he heard the footsteps advancing in hopes that the man would pass either in front or behind him then he felt a sudden kick an exclamation and a heavy fall he leapt to his feet but the arab sheik was as quick and springing up also seized him at the same time drawing his knife and uttering a loud shout  gregory grasped the arabs wrist and without hesitation snatched his own knife from the sash and drove it deep into his assailants body the latter uttered another loud cry for help and a score of men rushed from behind the tents  gregory set off at the top of his speed dashed over the brow of the bridge and then without entering the camp there he kept along close to the crest running at the top of his speed and wrapping his blanket as much as possible round him he heard an outburst of yells behind and felt sure that the sheik he had wounded had told those who had rushed up which way he had fled with loud shouts they poured over the crest and there were joined by others running up from the camp  when gregory paused for a moment after running for three or four hundred yards he could hear no sound of footsteps behind him glancing round he could not see white dresses in the darkness turning sharply off he recrossed the crest of the hill and keeping close to it continued his flight until well past the end of the camp  the alarm had by this time spread everywhere and a wild medley of shouts rose throughout the whole area of the encampment he turned now and made for the spot where he had left zaki and the horses in five minutes he reached it  is that you my lord zaki asked as he came up  yes we must fly at once i was discovered and had to killor at least badly wounda sheik and they are searching for me everywhere  i have saddled the horses and put the water skins on them  that is well done zaki let us mount and be off at once we will lead the horses it is too dark to gallop among these bushes and the sound of the hoofs might be heard we will go quietly till we are well away  not another word was spoken till they had gone half a mile  we will mount now zaki the horses can see better than we we will go at a walk i dare not strike a light to look at the compass but there are the stars i do not see the north star it must be hidden by the mist lower down but the others give us the direction quite near enough to go by  it is most unfortunate that the fellow who rushed against me was a sheik i could see that by the outline of his robe if it had been a common man there would not have been any fuss over it as it is they will search for us high and low i know he wasnt killed on the spot for he shouted after i had left him and they are likely to guess from his account that i had been down at one of the emirs tents and was probably a spy  i know that i ought to have paused a moment and given him another stab but i could not bring myself to do it it is one thing to stab a man who is trying to take ones life but it is quite another when he has fallen and is helpless  zaki had made no reply he could scarcely understand his masters repugnance to making matters safe when another blow would have done so but it was not for him to blame  they travelled all night and when the moon rose were able to get along somewhat faster but its light was now feeble and uncertain as soon as day broke they rode fast and at ten oclock had left behind the range of hills stretching between the wells of abu klea and jebel sergain  we ought to be safe now gregory said as they dismounted at any rate the horses must have a rest we have done over forty miles  we are safe for the present my lord it all depends whether or not they think you are a spy if they come to that conclusion they will send at once to abu klea and if a strong body is stationed there they may have sent a party on to gakdul or even to el howeyat for they will feel sure that we shall make for one of the wells  how much water have you got in the bags  zaki examined them  enough for ourselves for five or six days but only enough for two drinks each for the horses and for ourselves for a couple of days  that is bad if we had had any idea of coming away so soon we would have filled the large bags yesterday i had intended to send down the horses in the morning therefore left them only half full and they must have leaked a good deal to get so low see if one leaks more than the other  it was found that one held the water well but from the other there was a steady drip they transferred the water from this to the sound bag  we must drink as little as we can zaki and give the horses only a mouthful now and then and let them munch the shrubs and get a little moisture from them do you think there is any fear of the dervishes following our tracks  no my lord in the first place they do not know that there are two of us or that we are mounted when those who camped near us notice when they get up this morning that we have moved they will only think that we have shifted our camp as there was no talk of horsemen being concerned in this affair no i do not think they will attempt to follow us except along the caravan road but i feel sure they will pursue us on that line  they rested for some hours in the shade of a high rock leaving the horses to pick what herbage they could find at four oclock they started again they had ridden two hours when zaki said  see my lord there are two men on the top of jebel sergain  gregory gazed in that direction  yes i can notice them now but i should not have done so if you had not seen them  they are on watch my lord  well they can hardly see us at this distance  you may be sure that they see us zaki said the eyes of an arab are very keen and could not fail to catch two moving objectsespecially horsemen  if they are looking for us and have seen us zaki they would not be standing stationary there  not if they were alone but others may have been with them when they first caught sight of us which may have been half an hour ago the others may have gone down to abu klea while those two remained to watch which course we took the arabs can signal with their lances or with their horses and from there they would be able to direct any party in pursuit of us  well we must keep on as hard as we can till dark after that we can take it quietly you see the difficulty with us will be water now that they have once made out two horsemen riding north they must know that we have some special object in avoiding them and will no doubt send a party to gakdul if not farther  they crossed the rough country as quickly as they could and then again broke into a canter an hour later as they crossed a slight rise zaki looked back  there are some horsemen in pursuit my lord they have evidently come from abu klea  gregory looked round  there are about fifteen of them he said however they are a good three miles behind and it will be dark in another half hour as soon as it is so we will turn off to the right or left and so throw them off our track dont hurry your horse the animals have made a very long journey since we started and we shall want them badly tomorrow  in another half hour the sun went down darkness comes on quickly in the soudan and in another quarter of an hour they had lost sight of their pursuers who had gained about a mile upon them  another five minutes zaki to allow for their eyes being better than ours which way do you think we had better turn  i should say to the left my lord there is another caravan route from metemmeh to ambukol it cannot be more than fifteen miles to the west  do you know anything about it  i have never been along there it is a shorter route than the one to korti but not so much used i believe because the wells cannot be relied upon  well i feel sure we shall not be able to get at the wells on the other line so we had better take that as we shall be fairly safe from pursuit we may as well bear towards the northwest by doing so we shall be longer in striking the track but the journey will be a good bit shorter than if we were to ride due west  now we can safely dismount it is getting pitch dark and we will lead our horses i can feel that mine is nearly dead beat in a few minutes we will halt and give them half a gourd full of water each after that we had better go on for another six or seven miles so as to be well out of sight of anyone on the hills  ten minutes later they heard the dull sound of horses hoofs on the sand they waited five minutes until it died away in the distance and then continued their course it was slow work as they had to avoid every bush carefully lest if their pursuers halted they should hear the crackling of a dry stick in the still air zaki who could see much better in the dark than his master went on ahead while gregory led the two horses  a good hour passed before they stopped they gave the horses a scanty drink and took a mouthful or two each and then throwing themselves down allowed the horses to crop the scanty herbage  after four hours halt they pursued their way on foot for three hours laying their course by the stars they calculated that they must have gone a good fifteen miles from the point where they turned off and feared that they might miss the caravan track if they went on before daybreak    chapter 9 safely back   as soon as the sun was up they pursued their journey gregorys compass being now available  in half an hour zaki said there is a sign of the track my lord and he pointed to the skeleton of a camel  how many more miles do you think we have to go zaki  we must be a good half way my lord  yes quite that i should think looking at the map i should say that we must be about abreast of the line of gakdul this route is only just indicated and there are no halting places marked upon it still there must be water otherwise caravans could not use it we have about sixty miles farther to go so that if the horses were fresh we might be there this evening but as it is we have still two if not three days journey before us  well we must hope that we shall find some water just let the horses wet their mouths we can keep on for a bit before we have a drink  how much more is there left he asked after the lad had given a little water to each horse  not above two gourdfuls  well we must ride as far as we can and at any rate must keep one gourdful for tomorrow if we cover twentyfive miles todayand i dont think the horses can do morewe can manage if they are entirely done up to walk the other thirtyfive miles however as i said there must be wells and even if they are dry we may be able to scratch the sand out and find a little water what food have we got  only about two pounds of dates  that is a poor supply for two days zaki but we must make the best of them we will only eat a few today so as to have a fair meal in the morning we shall want it if we have to walk thirtyfive miles over the sand  it will not be all sand zaki said there is grass for the last fifteen miles near the river and there were cultivated fields about ten miles out before the dervishes came  that is better now we will be moving  the herbage the horses had cropped during the halt had served to a certain degree to supply the place of water and they proceeded at a brisker pace than gregory had expected  keep a sharp lookout for water even if the wells are dry you will see a difference in the growth of the bushes round them and as it is certain that this route has not been used for some time there may even be grass  they rode on at an easy canter and avoided pressing the horses in the slightest degree allowing them to walk whenever they chose the heat was very great and after four hours riding gregory called a halt  we must have done twenty miles he said the bushes look green about here and the horses have got something of a feed  i think this must be one of the old halting places zaki said looking round as they dismounted see my lord there are some broken gourds and some rags scattered about  so there are gregory said we will take the bridles out of the horses mouths so that they can chew the leaves up better and then we will see if we can find where the wells were  twenty yards farther away they found a deep hole  this was one of them the lad said but it is quite dry see there is an old bucket lying at the bottom i will look about there may be some more of them  two others were discovered and the sand at the bottom of one of them looked a somewhat darker colour than the others  well we will dig here gregory said bring down those two half gourds they will help us to shovel the sand aside  the bottom of the hole was some six feet across and they set to work in the middle of it by the time they had got down two feet the sand was soft and clammy  we will get to water zaki if we have to stay here all day said gregory  it was hard work and it was not until after four hours toil that to their delight they found the sand wet under their feet they had taken it by turns to use the scoop for the labour of making the hole large enough for them both to work at once would have been excessive  in another hour there was half an inch of water in the hole gregory took a gourd and buried it in the soft soil until the water flowed in over the brim  give me the other one down zaki i will fill that too and then we will both start drinking together  five minutes later the two took a long draught the scoops were then refilled and carried to the horses who drank with an eagerness that showed how great was their thirst three times the gourds were filled and emptied  now hand me down that water bag  this was half filled and then exhausted with their work they threw themselves down and slept for some hours when they awoke the sun was setting  bring up the horses zaki let them drink as much as they like  the gourds had each to be filled six times before the animals were satisfied the riders then took another deep drink ate a handful of dates and mounted  we are safe now and only have to fear a band of marauding arabs and it would be hard luck were we to fall in with them we had better ride slowly for the first hour or so we must not press the horses after they have had such a drink  very well master  there is no particular reason for hurry and even if we miss the trail we know that by keeping straight on we shall strike the river somewhere near korti or ambukol  for an hour they went at a walk and then the horses broke into their usual pace of their own accord it was getting dark now and soon even zaki could not make out the track  the horses will keep to it my lord he said their sight is a great deal better than ours and i dare say their smell may have something to do with it besides the track is clear of bushes so we should know at once if they strayed from it  they rode for five hours and then felt that the horses were beginning to fag  we will halt here gregory said we certainly cannot be more than fiveandtwenty miles from the river and if we start at dawn shall be there before the heat of the day begins we can have another handful of dates and give the horses a handful each and that will leave us a few for the morning  the horses after being given the dates were again turned loose and it was not long before they were heard pulling the leaves off bushes  our case is a good deal better this evening than it was yesterday gregory said then it looked as if it would be rather a close thing for i am sure the horses could not have gone much farther if we had not found the water i wish we had a good feed to give them  they will do very well on the bushes my lord they get little else when they are with the arabs a handful of durra occasionally when they are at work but at other times they only get what they can pick up if their master is a good one they may get a few dates they will carry us briskly enough to the river tomorrow  they did not talk long and were soon sound asleep zaki was the first to wake  day is just breaking master  you dont say so gregory grumbled sleepily it seems to me that we have only just lain down  they ate the remainder of their dates took a drink of water and gave two gourdfuls to the horses and in a quarter of an hour were on their way again they had ridden but two or three miles when zaki exclaimed  there are some horsemen  eight of them zaki and they are evidently riding to cut us off as far as i can see only four of them have guns the others have spears  i think we can manage them with my breechloader i can fire two shots to their one and we have pistols as well  the arabs drew up ahead of them and remained quiet there until the others came to within fifty yards and checked their horses a man who appeared to be the leader of the party shouted the usual salutation to which gregory replied  the leader said where are my friends going and why do they halt  we are on a mission we wish to see if the infidels are still at ambukol  for that you will not want guns the man said and we need them badly i beg of you to give them to us  they may be of use to us we may come upon infidel scouts  nevertheless my friends you must hand them over to us we are as you see eight and you are only two the law of the desert is that the stronger take and the weaker lose  it may be so sometimes gregory said quietly but not in this case i advise you to ride your way and we will ride ours  then he said to zaki dismount and stand behind your horse and fire over the saddle but dont fire the first shot now  he threw himself from his saddle scarcely had he done so when four shots were fired and gregory took a steady aim at the chief the latter threw up his arms and fell with a yell of fury the others dashed forward zaki did not fire until they were within twenty yards and directly afterwards gregory fired again there were now but five assailants  now for your pistols zaki he cried glancing round for the first time  he then saw why zaki had not fired when he first did sohis horse was lying dead in front of him shot through the head  stand by me dont throw away a shot you take the man on the other side of the horse i will take the others  steadily the four pistols were fired as the arabs rode up two of them fell and another was wounded dismayed at the loss of so many of their number the three survivors rode off at full speed  are you hurt zaki  a spear grazed my cheek my lord that is all it was my own fault i kept my last barrel too long however it tumbled him over  are you hurt master  i have got a ball in the shoulder that fellow without a spear has got pistols and fired just as i did or rather an instant before that shook my aim but he has a ball in him somewhere  just see if they have got some dates on their saddles for the horses of the fallen men had remained by the side of their masters bodies  yes my lord zaki said examining them two bags nearly full  that is satisfactory pick out the best horse for yourself and then we will ride on but before we go we will break the stocks of these four guns and carry the barrels off and throw them into the bushes a mile or two away  as soon as this was done they mounted and rode on they halted in a quarter of an hour and after gregorys arm had been bound tightly to his side with his sash both they and their horses had a good meal of dates then they rode on again and in three hours saw some white tents ahead  there was a slight stir as they were seen coming and a dozen black soldiers sprang up and ran forward fixing bayonets as they did so  we are friends gregory shouted in arabic and zaki repeated the shout in his own language  the soldiers looked doubtful and stood together in a group they knew that the dervishes were sometimes ready to throw away their own lives if they could but kill some of their enemy  one of them shouted back stay where you are until i call an officer  he went back to the tents and returned with a white officer whom gregory at once recognized as one of those who had come up with him from wady halfa  leslie he shouted in english will you kindly call off your soldiers one of their muskets might go off accidentally i suppose you dont remember me i am hilliard who came up with you in the steamer  the officer had stopped in astonishment at hearing this seeming dervish address him by name in english he then advanced giving an order to his men to fall back  is it really you hilliard he said as he approached the horsemen who were coming forward at a walk which of you is it for i dont see any resemblance in either of you  it is i leslie i am not surprised that you dont know me  but what are you masquerading for in this dress and where have you come from  perhaps i had better not say leslie i have been doing some scouting across the desert with my boy here we have had a long ride in the first place my arm wants attending to i have a bullet in the shoulder the next thing we need is something to eat for the last three days we have had nothing but dates and not too many of them  is there any chance of getting taken up to merawi we came down from there to korti in a native vessel  yes a gunboat with some native craft will be going up this afternoon i will give orders at once that your horses shall be put on board  when the ball had been extracted from his shoulder and the wound dressed and bandaged by the surgeon in charge gregory went up to the tents again where he was warmly received by the three white officers of the negro regiment breakfast already had been prepared zaki being handed over to the native officers after having made a hearty meal gregory related the adventure with the arabs in the desert merely saying that they had found there were no dervishes at gakdul  but why didnt you go straight back instead of coming down here  i wanted to see whether this line was open and whether there were any wells on it we only found one and it took us four or five hours hard work to get at the water it is lucky indeed that we did so for our horses were getting very done up and i had begun to think that they would not reach our destination alive  in the afternoon the adventurers started with the boats going up to merawi and the next morning arrived at the camp the dervish patches had been removed from their clothes as soon as they arrived at ambukol gregory could have borrowed a white suit there but as the stain on his skin although somewhat lighter than when first put on was too dark he declined the offer  no one may notice me as i land now he said but everyone would stare at a man with a brown face and white uniform  leaving zaki to get the horses on shore gregory went straight to the generals quarters he told the sentry that he wished to see the general on business  you cannot go in the man said the general is engaged  if you send in word to him that his messenger has returned i am sure he will see me  you can sit down here then the sentry said when the officer with him comes out i will give your message to his orderly  gregory however was in no humour to be stopped and in an authoritative voice called orderly  a soldier came down directly from the guard room  tell the general at once that mr hilliard has returned  with a look of wonder the orderly went into the tent half a minute later he returned  you are to come in he said  as the general had seen gregory in his disguise before starting he of course recognized him  my dear hilliard he said getting up and shaking him cordially by the hand i am heartily glad to see you back you have been frequently in my thoughts and though i had every confidence in your sharpness i have regretted more than once that i allowed you to go  i suppose you failed to get there it is hardly possible that you should have done so in the time i suppose when you got to gakdul you learned that the dervishes were at abu klea  they were at abu klea general but i made a detour and got into their camp at metemmeh  you did and have returned safely i congratulate you most warmly  i told you macdonald he said turning to the officer with whom he had been engaged that i had the greatest hope that mr hilliard would get through he felt so confident in himself that i could scarce help feeling confidence in him too  he has done well indeed colonel macdonald said i should not have liked to send any of my officers on such an adventure though they have been here for years  well will you sit down mr hilliard the general said and give us a full account in the first place what you have learned and in the second how you have learned it  gregory related the conversations he had heard among the soldiers and then that of mahmuds brother and the commander of the dervish cavalry then he described the events of his journey there his narrow escape from capture and the pursuit by the dervishes at abu klea how he gave them the slip struck the ambukol caravan road had a fight with a band of robber arabs and finally reached the egyptian camp  an excellently managed business the general said warmly you have certainly had some narrow escapes and seem to have adopted the only course by which you could have got off safely the information you have brought is of the highest importance i shall telegraph at once to the sirdar that there will assuredly be no advance on the part of mahmud from metemmeh which will leave him free to carry out the plans he has formed i shall of course in my written despatch give him full particulars of the manner in which i have obtained that information  it was a very fine action macdonald agreed the lad has shown that he has a good head as well as great courage  you will make your way mr hilliardthat is if you dont try this sort of thing again a man may get through it once but it would be just tempting providence to try it a second time  now mr hilliard the general said you had best go to your quarters i will ask the surgeon to attend to you at once you must keep quiet and do no more duty until you are discharged from the sick list  ten days later orders were issued that the brigade under macdonald consisting of the 3rd egyptians and the 9th 10th and 11th soudanese together with a mule battery were to move forward the next day to kassinger the advanced post some ten miles higher up the river this seemed only a preliminary step and the general opinion was that another fortnight would elapse before there would be a general movement  a reconnaissance with friendly arabs had however been made ahead towards abu hamed and had obtained certain information that the garrison at that place was by no means a strong one the information gregory had gathered had shown that mahmud had no intention of advancing against merawi and that no reinforcements had as yet started to join the force at abu hamed the dervish leader being convinced that the nile was not yet high enough to admit of boats going up the cataract  thus everything favoured the sirdars plan to capture abu hamed and enable the railway to be constructed to that place before mahmud could receive the news that the troops were in motion he therefore directed general hunter to push forward with only one brigade leaving the rest to hold merawi and ordered the camel corps and the friendly arabs to advance across the desert as far as the gakdul wells where their appearance would lead mahmud to believe that they were the advance guard of the coming army  two days later gregory on going to the headquarters tent was told that general hunter and his staff would start in an hours time to inspect the camp at kassinger  do you think you are fit to ride the chief of the staff asked him  perfectly sir the doctor discharged me yesterday as fit for duty but advised me to keep my arm in a sling for a time  in that case you may accompany us  it is a little uncertain when we shall return the officer said with a smile therefore i advise you to take all your belongings with you have them packed up quietly we do not wish any suspicions to arise that we are not returning this evening  thank you sir gregory said gratefully i shall be ready to start in an hour  he returned in high glee to his hut for he felt certain that an immediate advance was about to take place  zaki he said i am going to ride with the general and as it is possible i may be stationed at kassinger for a short time you had better get the camel brought up and start as soon as you have packed the things on it i am going to ride over with the staff in an hour and shall overtake you by the way how long will you be  half an hour bey  i will be there by that time and will take my horse then you can go on with the camel  behind the headquarter camp the work of packing up was also going on the camels being sent off in threes and fours as they were laden so as to attract no attention half an hour later the general came out and without delay started with the staff captain fitton remaining behind to see that the rest of the stores were sent off and a small tent for the use of the general all heavy packages were to be taken up by water  the arrival of the general at kassinger excited no surprise as he had ridden over the day before but when in the afternoon orders were issued that the camels should all be laden in preparation for a march that evening the soudanese could with difficulty be restrained from giving vent to their exuberant joy that at length their long halt was at an end and they were to have another chance of getting at the enemy  a large train of camels had been quietly collected at kassinger sufficient to carry the necessary supplies for the use of the column for some three weeks time and it was hoped that before long the gunboats and many of the native craft with stores would join them at abu hamed  the force started at sunset the distance to be travelled was a hundred and eighteen miles and the road was a very difficult one the ground rose steeply almost from the edge of the river and at times had to be traversed in single file  as night came on the scene was a weird one on one side the rocky ascent rose black and threatening on the other the river rushed foaming only broken by the rocks and little islands of the cataract  gregory had been ordered to remain with the camel train to keep them as much as possible together and prevent wide gaps from occurring in the ranks it was tedious work and the end of the train did not arrive until broad daylight at the spot where the infantry halted he at once told zaki to pitch his little tent which he had already shown him how to do while he went to see if there were any orders at headquarters  he found the staff were just sitting down to a rough breakfast being told after the meal that he would not be wanted during the day but that at night he was to continue his work with the camels he went back to his tent and threw himself on his bed but in spite of the fly being fastened up and a blanket thrown over the tent the heat was so great that he was only able to doze off occasionally  he observed that even the black troops suffered from the heat they had erected screens with their blankets placed end to end supported by their guns and lay there getting what air there was and sheltered from the direct rays of the sun few slept most of them talked or smoked  there was some argument among the officers as to the relative advantages of night and day marches all agreed that if only one march had to be done it was better to do it at night but when as in the present case it would last for seven or eight days many thought that terrible as would be the heat it would be better to march in the day and permit the troops to sleep at night this opinion certainly seemed to be justified for at the end of the third day the men were so completely worn out from want of sleep that they stumbled as they marched and were with difficulty restrained from throwing themselves down to get the muchneeded rest  gregory always went down as soon as the column arrived at its halting place as he did before starting in the evening to bathe in some quiet pool or backwater and much as he had set himself against taking spirits he found that he was unable to eat his meals unless he took a spoonful or two with his water or cold tea  on the evening of the third day they passed the battlefield of kirkeban where general earle fell when the river expedition was attacked by the dervishes next day they halted at hebbeh where colonel stewart on his way down with a number of refugees from khartoum was treacherously murdered a portion of the steamer was still visible in the river  day after day the column plodded on for the most part strung out in single file the line extending over many miles and late on the evening of the 6th of august they reached a spot within a mile and a half of abu hamed the hundred and eighteen miles having been accomplished in seven days and a half  so far as they knew the enemy had as yet received no news of their approach three hours rest was given the troops and then they marched out in order of battle  a fair idea of the position had been obtained from the friendly natives abu hamed lay on the river the desert sloped gradually down to it on all sides with a sharp deep descent within two hundred yards of the town the houses were all loopholed for defence  when within a mile of the town they must have been sighted by the dervish sentries on a lofty watchtower no movement however was visible and there was a general feeling of disappointment as the impression gained ground that the enemy had retreated the 9th and 10th soudanese made a sweep round to attack from the desert side the 11th and half of the egyptian battalionthe other half having been left to guard the baggagefollowed the course of the river  major kincaid rode forward to the edge of the steep slope that looked down to the town he could see no one moving about the dervish trenches about eighty yards away appeared empty and he was about to write a message to the general saying that the place was deserted when a sharp fire suddenly opened upon him he turned to ride back to warn the general but he was too late for at the same moment hunter with his staff galloped up to the edge of the slope and was immediately saluted by a heavy volley which however was fired so wildly that none of the party was hit  the artillery were now ordered to bombard the place at first they could only fire at the tops of the houses but changing their position they found a spot where they could command the town for half an hour this continued the infantry were drawn up just beyond the brow where they could not be seen by the defenders the dervishes gave no signs of life and as the artillery could not depress their guns sufficiently to enable them to rake the trenches the infantry were ordered to charge  as soon as they reached the edge of the dip a storm of musketry broke out from the dervish trenches but fortunately the greater portion of the bullets flew overhead macdonald had intended to carry the place at the point of the bayonet without firing but the troops suddenly exposed to such a storm of musketry halted and opened fire without orders the result being that they suffered a great deal more than they would have done had they crossed the eighty yards which divided them from the trench by a rush standing as they did against the skyline the dervishes were able to pick them off they themselves showing only their heads above the trenches two of the mounted officers of the 10th were killed and two had their horses shot under them  macdonald and his officers rushed along in front of the line knocking up the mens muskets and abusing them in the strongest terms for their disobedience to orders the moment the fire ceased the troops rushed forward and the dervishes at once abandoned their trenches and ran back to the line of houses these were crowded together divided by narrow winding lanes and here a desperate struggle took place  the dervishes defended themselves with the greatest tenacity sometimes rushing out and hurling themselves upon their assailants and defending the houses to the last making a stand when the doors were burst open until the last of the inmates were either shot or bayoneted so determined was the defense of some of the larger houses that it was necessary to bring up the guns and batter an entrance many of the houses were found when the troops burst in to be tenanted only by dead for the soudanese always heralded their attack by firing several volleys and the bullets made their way through and through the mud walls as if they had been paper  about seventy or eighty horsemen and a hundred dervish infantry escaped but the rest were either killed or made prisoners together with mahomed zein the governor a quantity of arms camels and horses were also captured the loss on our side was two british officers killed and twentyone of the black troops and three egyptian officers and sixtyone men wounded  when the convoy halted previous to the troops marching to the attack gregory whose duties with the baggage had now ended joined the generals staff and rode forward with them hunter had glanced round as he rode up and answered with a nod when he saluted and asked if he could come  he felt rather scared on the dervishes opening fire so suddenly when the generals impatience had led him to ride forward without waiting for major kincaids report after the troops rushed into the town the general maintained his position at the edge of the dip for the narrow streets were so crowded with men that a group of horsemen could hardly have forced their way in and it would be impossible to see what was going on and to issue orders  mahomed zein had not followed the example of some of his followers and died fighting to the last he was found hiding under a bed and was brought before general hunter who asked him why he fought when he must have known that it was useless to which he replied  i knew that you had only three times as many as i had and every one of my men is worth four of yours you could not fire till you were quite close up and at that range our rifles are as good as yours  the general asked what he thought mahmud would do to which he replied  he will be down here in five days and wipe you out  it was necessary to halt at abu hamed until stores came up captain keppel royal navy and the officers commanding the gunboats were toiling at the cataracts to bring them up nevertheless one of these was capsized and only three got through safely major pink with a large number of troops from merawi succeeded in hauling the sailing boats through  a large column of laden camels was at the same time being pushed forward by the caravan route from korosko it was a time of much anxiety till stores began to arrive for had mahmud advanced at once the passage up the river would have been arrested and the land column cut off in which case the little force would have been reduced to sore straits as they must have stood on the defensive until reinforcements reached them  there was too some anxiety as to the safety of the forces at ambukol and korti for mahmud on learning that the garrisons had been weakened by the despatch of troops to abu hamed might have crossed the desert with all his force and fallen upon them mahmud had indeed as it turned out believed that the expedition to abu hamed was only undertaken to cover the flank of the egyptian army from attack from that quarter and still believed that it was from merawi that the main british force would advance against him  before the supplies had all arrived the position changed as news came that berber was being evacuated by the dervishes the information was telegraphed to the sirdar who at once ordered that a force of the friendly arabs escorted by a gunboat should go up to berber to find if the news was true one gunboat had already arrived and general hunter decided on going up in her himself two hundred of the arabs under ahmed bey were to ride along the bank they were to be mounted on the fastest camels that could be picked out so that if they encountered the dervishes they would have a fair chance of escaping and getting under cover of the gunboats fire  mr hilliard the general said i shall be obliged if you will accompany ahmed bey the arabs are always more steady if they have an english officer with them they will be ready to start in an hour a signaller from the 11th soudanese shall go with you and you can notify to us the approach of any strong party of the enemy and their direction so that the gunboat can send a shell or two among them as a hint that they had better keep out of range  as his baggage camel was by no means a fast one gregory at first decided to leave it behind in charge of zaki but on going across to the arab camp ahmed bey at once offered to place a fast one at his disposal he accordingly sent his own animal into the transport yard committed the heavy wooden case with the greater portion of his remaining stores to the charge of the sergeant of the mess retaining only three or four tins of preserved milk some tea four or five tins of meat a bottle of brandy and a few other necessaries to these were added half a sheep and a few pounds of rice these with his tent and other belongings were packed on the arab camel and zaki rode beside it with great satisfaction for he had been greatly cast down when his master first told him that he would have to remain behind all the preparations were made in great haste but they were completed just as ahmed bey moved out of his camp with his two hundred picked men and camels  five minutes later a whistle from the steamer told them that general hunter and the party with him were also on the point of starting the distance to be traversed to berber was a hundred and thirty miles and the expedition was undoubtedly a hazardous one even if the news was true that the five thousand dervishes who had been holding berber had evacuated the town it was quite possible that a part of the force had been sent down the river to oppose any advance that might be made or if unable to do this to carry the news of the advance to mahmud the arabs were to keep abreast of the gunboat and would where the shores were flat be covered by its guns but at spots where the ground was high and precipitous this assistance could scarcely avail them in case of an attack unless the hundred soldiers on board the steamer could be landed  as they rode along ahmed bey explained to gregory the plan that he should adopt if they were attacked in such a position and found their retreat cut off  the camels will all be made to lie down and we shall fight behind them as in an entrenchment my men are all armed with rifles the government has given them and we could beat off an attack by a great number while if we were on our camels and pursued we should soon lose all order and our shooting would be bad  i think that would be by far the best plan sheik your two hundred men and the hundred the gunboat could land ought to be able to make a tough fight of it against any number of the enemy  how long do you think we shall be on the way  about four days the camels can easily travel thirtyfive miles a day we have six days provisions with us in case the gunboat cannot make its way up fortunately we have not to carry water so that each camel only takes twenty pounds of food for its rider and forty pounds of grain for itself if we were pursued we could throw that away as we should only have to ride to some point where the gunboat could protect us we could not hope to escape by speed for the dervishes could ride and run quite as fast as the camels could go    chapter 10 afloat   the first three days journey passed without any adventure from the natives who still remained in the little villages they passed they learned that the report that the dervishes had left berber was generally believed but whether they had marched for metemmeh or for some other point was unknown the people were delighted to see the gunboat as until its arrival they had been in hourly fear of raiding parties they had heard of the capture of abu hamed by the british from horsemen who had escaped but all these had said confidently that mahmud would speedily drive them out again and they had been in hourly fear that the dervishes would swoop down upon them and carry off the few possessions still remaining to them  when within thirty miles of berber the arabs had halted on the bank watching the gunboat as with great difficulty it made its way up a cataract suddenly it was seen to stop and a great bustle was observed on board an exclamation of grief burst from the arabs  she has struck on a rock ahmed bey exclaimed  i am afraid she has said gregory who had all along ridden by his side at the head of the party i am afraid so i hope she is not injured  unfortunately the damage was serious a hole had been knocked through her side under water and the water poured in in volumes a rush was made by those on board and beds pillows and blankets were stuffed into the hole this succeeded to some extent and she was brought alongside the bank  the sheik and gregory went down to meet her general hunter came to the side  a large hole has been knocked in her he said to the sheik we shall have to get the guns and stores on shore to lighten her and then heel her over to get at the hole it will certainly take two or three days by that time i hope the other gunboat will be up  in the meantime you must go on to berber i think there can be no doubt that the dervishes have all left but it is most important that we should know it for certain you must push straight on and as soon as you arrive there send word on to me by the fastest camel you have if you are attacked you will of course defend yourselves take up a position close to the river and hold it until you are relieved if you can send off news to me by a camel do so if not seize a boatthere are some at every villageand send the news down by water i will come on at once with everyone here to assist you  i will do as you order the sheik said and if you see us no more you will know that we died as brave men  i hope there is no fear of that the general said cheerfully you will defend yourselves as brave men if you are attacked i am sure but as i am convinced that the dervishes have left berber i think there is little fear of your falling in with them  then he went on in english to gregory  keep them moving mr hilliard let them go as fast as they can they are less likely to get nervous if they are riding hard than they would be if they dawdled along if they press their camels they will be in berber this afternoon see that a man starts at once to bring me the news  very well sir i will keep them at it if i can  the sheik rejoined his band which gathered round to hear the result of his interview with the white general  the steamer is injured he said but she will soon be made right and will follow us we are to have the honour of going on and occupying berber and will show ourselves worthy of it there is little chance of our meeting the dervishes had they been in berber we should have heard of them before this if we meet them we will fight and you abu who have the fastest camel among us will ride back here at all speed and the general and his soldiers will come up to help us  now let us not waste a moment but push forward in five hours we shall be at berber and throughout your lives you will be proud to say that you were the first to enter the town that the dervishes have so long held  a few of the men waved their guns and shouted the rest looked grave however they obeyed their chiefs orders and the cavalcade at once started as they did so gregory drew his horse up alongside zaki  look here he said if we see the dervishes coming in force i shall come to you at once you shall take my horse it is faster than yours i shall give you a note for the general and you will ride back at full gallop and give it to him the horse is fast and there will be no fear of their catching you even if they chase which they will not be likely to do as they will be thinking of attacking us  very well master i will do as you order me but i would rather stop and fight by your side  that you may be able to do some other time zaki this time you have got to fetch aid  then he rode on to join the chief there was no talking along the line every man had his rifle unslung and in his hand every eye scanned the country hitherto they had had unlimited faith in the power of the gunboat to protect them now that they might have to face the dervishes unaided they felt the danger a serious one they had come to fight the dervishes and were ready to do so in anything like equal numbers but the force they might meet would possibly be greatly stronger than their ownso strong that although they might sell their lives dearly they would in the end be overpowered  for the first three hours the camels were kept going at the top of their speed but as they neared berber there was a perceptible slackness ahmed bey and gregory rode backwards and forwards along the line keeping them together and encouraging them  we shall get in without fighting the bey said we should have heard before this had they been there do you think that they would have remained so long in the town if they had learned that there are but two hundred of us and one steamer mahmud would never have forgiven them had they not fallen upon us and annihilated us i only hope that two hundred will have been left there it will add to our glory to have won a battle as well as taken the town your children will talk of it in their tents your women will be proud of you and the men of the black regiments will say that we have shown ourselves to be as brave as they are  we will halt for half an hour rest the camels and then push on at full speed again but mind you have my orders if you should see the enemy coming in force you are to ride at once to the river bank dismount and make the camels lie down in a semicircle then we have but to keep calm and shoot straight and we need not fear the dervishes however many of them there may be  after the halt they again pushed forward gregory saw with pleasure that the arabs were now thoroughly wound up to fighting point the same vigilant watch was kept up as before but the air of gloom that had hung over them when they first started had now disappeared each man was ready to fight to the last as the town was seen the tension was at its highest but the pace quickened rather than relaxed  now is the moment the bey shouted if they are there they will come out to fight us if in five minutes they do not appear it will be because they have all gone  but there were no signs of the enemy no clouds of dust rising in the town that would tell of a hasty gathering at last they entered a straggling street the women looked timidly from the windows and then on seeing that their robes did not bear the black patches worn by the dervishes they broke into loud cries of welcome  are the dervishes all gone ahmed bey asked reining in his camel  they are all gone the last left four days ago  the sheik waved his rifle over his head and his followers burst into loud shouts of triumph and pressed on firing their muskets in the air as they proceeded the natives poured out from their houses in wild delight the arabs kept on till they reached the house formerly occupied by the egyptian governor  i should say that you had better take possession of this bey there seems to be a large courtyard where you can put your camels it is not likely that the dervishes will return but it is as well to be prepared the house is strong and we could hold out here against a host unless they were provided with cannon  i have money and you had better buy up as much food as possible so that we could stand a siege for some time i shall give my horse a good feed and an hours rest and then send my man down to the general telling him that the dervishes have deserted the town and that we have taken possession of the place and can defend it for a long time should they return  an hour later zaki started with gregorys report the inhabitants finding that they would be paid brought out their hidden stores and by evening enough was collected to last the garrison ten days  zaki returned at noon next day with a letter from general hunter to the sheik praising him highly for the energy and courage of his men and himself he also brought a note for gregory saying that he hoped to get the repairs finished the next day and that he expected by that time the other two steamers would be up when he should at once advance to berber  on the third day the smoke of the steamers was seen in the distance and an hour later the gunboats arrived and were greeted with cries of welcome by the natives who thronged the bank the three boats carried between three and four hundred men these were disembarked on an island opposite the town and the gunboats moored alongside  general hunter at once landed with those of his staff who had accompanied him he shook hands very cordially with the sheik  you have done well indeed he said it was a dangerous enterprise and had i not known your courage and that of your men i should not have ventured to send you forward you have fully justified my confidence in you  in the first place i will go and see the house you have occupied i shall leave you still in possession of it but i do not intend that you should hold it in case mahmud comes down upon you at once embark in boats and cross to the islands it will be some time before i can gather here a force strong enough to hold the town against attack indeed it will probably be some weeks for until the railway is finished to abu hamed i can only get up stores sufficient for the men here certainly we have no transport that could keep up the supply for the whole force however all this will be settled by the sirdar who will very shortly be with us  it was now the 6th of september and the same afternoon two gunboats were sent up to ed damer an important position lying a mile or two beyond the junction of atbara river with the nile on the opposite bank of the nile they found encamped the dervishes who had retired from berber the guns opened fire upon them and they retired inland leaving behind them fourteen large boats laden with grain these were at once sent down to berber where they were most welcome and a portion of the grain was distributed among the almost starving population nearly five thousand in number principally women and children  supplies soon began to arrive from below being brought up in native craft from abu hamed as far as the cataract then unloaded and carried up past the rapids on camels then again placed in boats and so brought to berber macdonalds brigade started a fortnight after the occupation their place at abu hamed having been taken by a brigade from kassinger each battalion having towed up boats carrying two months supply of provisions  a fort was now erected at the junction of the two rivers and occupied by a small force under an english officer two small steamers were employed in towing the native craft from abu hamed to berber still it was evident that it would be impossible to accumulate the necessary stores for the whole force that would take the field accordingly as soon as the railway reached abu hamed the sirdar ordered it to be carried on as far as berber he himself came up with colonel wingate the head of the intelligence department and diligently as all had worked before their exertions were now redoubled  on the morning after the sirdars arrival an orderly came across to general hunters quarters with a request that mr hilliard should at once be sent to headquarters gregory had to wait nearly half an hour until the officers who had been there before him had had their audience and received their orders he was then shown in  you have done very valuable service mr hilliard the sirdar said exceptionally valuable and obtained at extraordinary risk i certainly did not expect when i saw you a few months ago in cairo that you would so speedily distinguish yourself i was then struck with your manner and thought that you would do well and you have much more than fulfilled my expectations i shall keep my eye upon you and shall see that you have every opportunity of continuing as you have begun  that evening general hunter suggested to colonel wingate that gregory should be handed over to him  there will be nothing for him to do with me at present he said and i am sure that you will find him very useful putting aside the expedition he undertook to metemmeh he is a most zealous young officer although his wound was scarcely healed he took charge of the baggage animals on the way up from merawi to abu hamed and came forward here with ahmed bey and his followers and in both cases he was most useful but at the present i cannot find any employment for him  i will have a talk with him colonel wingate said i think i can make good use of him captain keppel asked me this morning if i could furnish him with a good interpreter he is going up the river in a day or two and as neither he nor the other naval officers know much arabic mr hilliard would be of considerable service to them in questioning any prisoners who may be captured as to hidden guns or other matters i should think from what you tell me mr hilliard will be very suitable for the post  the very man for it he is a very pleasant ladfor he is not more than thatquiet and gentlemanly and yet full of life and go and will be certain to get on well with a naval man  on returning to his quarters general hunter sent for gregory  you will please go to colonel wingate mr hilliard i have been speaking to him about you and as it may be months before things are ready for the final advance and i am sure you would prefer to be actively employed i proposed to him that he should utilize your services and it happens fortunately that he is able to do so the gunboats will be running up and down the river stirring up the dervishes at metemmeh and other places and as neither keppel nor the commanders of the other two boats can speak arabic with anything like fluency it is important that he should have an interpreter  i think you will find the berth a pleasant one of course i dont know what arrangements will be made or whether you would permanently live on board one of the boats if so i think you would be envied by all of us as you would get away from the dust and all the discomforts of the encampment  thank you very much sir it would indeed be pleasant and i was beginning to feel that i was very useless here  you have not been useless at all mr hilliard the sirdar asked me about you and i was able to give him a very favourable report of your readiness to be of service for whatever work i have found for you to do i have told him that i had great doubts whether ahmed bey would have pushed forward to this place after he had lost the protection of the gunboats if you had not been with him  gregory at once went to the quarters of colonel wingate and sent in his name in two or three minutes he was shown in a naval officer was in the room with the colonel  you have come at the right time mr hilliard i was just speaking of you to captain keppel i suppose general hunter has told you how i proposed utilizing your services  yes sir he was good enough to tell me  you speak both arabic and the negro dialect perfectly i am told  i speak them very fluently almost as well as english  just at present you could not be of much use to me mr hilliard of course i get all my intelligence from natives and have no occasion to send white officers out as scouts otherwise from the very favourable report that i have received from general hunter i should have been glad to have you with me but i have no doubt that you would prefer to be in one of the gunboats they are certain to have a more stirring time of it for the next few weeks than we shall have here  i should like it greatly sir if captain keppel thinks i shall do  i have no doubt about that the officer said with a smile i shall rate you as a first lieutenant and midshipman all in one and i may say that i shall be very glad to have a white officer with me there are one or two spare cabins aft and you had better have your traps moved in at once i may be starting tomorrow  shall i take my servant with me sir  yes you may take him if you like i suppose you have a horse  yes sir a horse and a camel but i shall have no difficulty in managing about them excuse my asking sir but i have a few stores shall i bring them on board  no there is no occasion for that you will mess with me thank goodness we left naval etiquette behind us when we came up the nile and it is not imperative that i should dine in solitary state besides you have been on hunters staff have you not  yes  i know his staff all mess together i shall be very glad to have you with me it is lonely work always messing alone  my boat is the zafir you know you had better come on board before eight oclock tomorrow morning that is my breakfast hour  gregory needed but little time to make his arrangements the transport department took over zakis horse and camel and gave him a receipt for them so that when he returned those or others could be handed over to him one of the staff who wanted a second horse was glad to take charge of his mount the tent and the big case and his other belongings were handed over to the stores  zaki was delighted when he heard that he was going up in a gunboat that would probably shell metemmeh and knock some of the dervish fortifications to pieces  what shall i have to do master he asked  not much zaki you will brush my clothes and make my bed and do anything that i want done but beyond that i cannot tell you i am really taking you not because i think you will be of much use but because i like to have you with me besides i shant have much to do and the english officer who commands will have plenty to look after so that i shall be glad to talk occasionally with you  however as i know the gunboats carry maxim guns and each have two sergeants of the marine artillery i will hand you over to them and ask them to put you in the maxim crew then you will have the satisfaction of helping to fire at your old enemies  zakis eyes glistened at the prospect  they killed my mother he said and carried off my sisters and burned our house it will be good to fire at them much better this bey than to load stores at merawi  gregory was much gratified that evening after mess at the kindly manner in which the members of the staff all shook hands with him and said that they were sorry that he was going to leave them general hunter was dining with the sirdar the next morning when gregory went to say goodbye to him he said  i was telling sir herbert kitchener yesterday evening that you were transferred to the naval branch he said  the gunboats will all take up troops and there will be native officers on board it is a rule in our army you know that all white officers have the honorary rank of major so as to make them senior to all egyptian officers will you tell mr hilliard that i authorize him to call himself bimbashi there is no occasion to put it in orders my authorization is sufficient as long as he was on your staff it did not matter but as presently he may be attached to an egyptian regiment it is as well that he should bear the usual rank and it may save misunderstanding in communicating with the natives he will be much more respected as bimbashi than he would be as lieutenant a title that they would not understand  a good many lieutenants in the british army are bimbashis here so that there is nothing unusual in your holding that honorary rank  i would just as soon be lieutenant sir so far as i am concerned myself but of course i feel honoured at receiving the title no doubt it would be much more pleasant if i were attached to an egyptian regiment i do not know whether it is the proper thing to thank the sirdar if it is i shall be greatly obliged if you will convey my thanks to him  i will tell him that you are greatly gratified hilliard i have no doubt you owe it not only to your ride to metemmeh but to my report that i did not think ahmed bey would have ventured to ride on into berber had you not been with him and that you advised him as to the defensive position he took up here and prepared for a stout defence until the boats could come up to his assistance he said as much to me  at the hour named gregory went on board the zafir zaki accompanying him with his small portmanteau and blanket  i see you are punctual mr hilliard the commander said cheerily a great virtue everywhere but especially on board ship where everything goes by clockwork eight bells will sound in two minutes and as they do so my black fellow will come up and announce the meal it is your breakfast as much as mine for i have shipped you on the books this morning and of course you will be rationed happily we are not confined to that fare i knew what it was going to be and laid in a good stock of stores fortunately we have the advantage over the military that we are not limited as to baggage  the breakfast was an excellent one after it was over commander keppel asked gregory how it was that he hadwhile still so youngobtained a commission and expressed much interest when he had heard his story  then you do not intend to remain in the egyptian army he said if you have not any fixed career before you i should have thought that you could not do better the sirdar and general hunter have both taken a great interest in you it might be necessary perhaps for you to enter the british army and serve for two or three years so as to get a knowledge of drill and discipline then from your acquaintance with the languages here you could of course get transferred to the egyptian army where you would rank as a major at once  i have hardly thought of the future yet sir but of course i shall have to do so as soon as i am absolutely convinced of my fathers death really i have no hope now but i promised my mother to do everything in my power to ascertain it for a certainty she placed a packet in my hands which was not to be opened until i had so satisfied myself i do not know what it contains but i believe it relates to my fathers family  i do not see that that can make any difference to me for i certainly should not care to go home to see relations to whom my coming might be unwelcome i should greatly prefer to stay out here for a few years until i had obtained such a position as would make me absolutely independent of them  i can quite understand that captain keppel said poor relations seldom get a warm welcome and as you were born in alexandria they may be altogether unaware of your existence you have certainly been extremely fortunate so far and if you preferred a civil appointment you would be pretty certain of getting one when the war is over  there will be a big job in organizing this country after the dervishes are smashed up and a biggish staff of officials will be wanted no doubt most of these will be egyptians but egyptian officials want looking after so that a good many berths must be filled by englishmen and englishmen with a knowledge of arabic and the negro dialect are not very easily found i should say that there will be excellent openings for young men of capacity  i have no doubt there will gregory said i have really never thought much about the future my attention from childhood has been fixed upon this journey to the soudan and i never looked beyond it nor did my mother discuss the future with me doubtless she would have done so had she lived and these papers i have may give me her advice and opinion about it  well i must be going on deck captain keppel said we shall start in half an hour  the three gunboats were all of the same design they were flat bottomed so as to draw as little water as possible and had been built and sent out in sections from england they were constructed entirely of steel and had three decks the lower one having loophole shutters for infantry fire on the upper deck which was extended over the whole length of the boat was a conning tower in the after portion of the boat and beneath the upper deck were cabins for officers each boat carried a twelvepounder quickfiring gun forward a howitzer and four maxims the craft were a hundred and thirtyfive feet long with a beam of twentyfour feet and drew only three feet and a half of water they were propelled by a stern wheel  at halfpast nine the zafirs whistle gave the signal and she and her consortsthe nazie and fattehcast off their warps and steamed out into the river each boat had on board two european engineers fifty men of the 9th soudanese two sergeants of royal marine artillery and a small native crew  i expect that we shall not make many more trips down to berber the commander said when they were once fairly off the camp at atbara will be our headquarters unless indeed mahmud advances in which case of course we shall be recalled until then we shall be patrolling the river up to metemmeh and making i hope an occasional rush as far as the next cataract  when evening came on the steamer tied up to an island a few miles north of shendy so far they had seen no hostile partiesindeed the country was wholly deserted  next morning they started before daybreak shendy seemed to be in ruins two arabs only were seen on the bank a few shots were fired into the town but there was no reply  half an hour later metemmeh was seen it stood half a mile from the river along the bank were seven mud forts with extremely thick and solid walls keeping near the opposite bank the gunboats led by the zafir made their way up the river dervish horsemen could be seen riding from fort to fort doubtless carrying orders  the river was some four thousand yards wide and at this distance the gunboats opened fire at the two nearest forts the range was soon obtained to a nicety and the white sergeants and native gunners made splendid practice every shell bursting upon the forts while the maxims speedily sent the dervish horsemen galloping off to the distant hills on which could be made out a large camp  the dervish gunners replied promptly but the range was too great for their old brass guns most of the shot fell short though a few fired at a great elevation fell beyond the boats one shell however struck the zafir passing through the deck and killing a soudanese and a shrapnel shell burst over the fatteh  after an hours fire at this range the gunboats moved up opposite the position and again opened fire with shell and shrapnel committing terrible havoc on the forts whose fire presently slackened suddenly this was explained by the fact that as the gunboats passed up they saw that the embrasures of the forts only commanded the approach from the north and that once past them the enemy were unable to bring a gun to bear upon the boats doubtless the dervishes had considered it was impossible for any steamer to pass up under their fire and that it was therefore unnecessary to widen the embrasures so that the guns could fire upon them when facing the forts or going beyond them  suddenly as all on board were watching the effect of their fire an outburst of musketry broke out from the bushes that lined the eastern bank a hundred yards away fortunately the greater part of the bullets flew overhead but many rattled against the side the maxims were instantly turned upon the unseen enemy the soudanese fired volleys and their rash assailants went at once into the thicker bush many dropping before they gained it  the gunboats now steamed slowly up the river and then turning retired downstream again shelling the enemys position as they passed as they were going down they came upon a number of dervishes who were busy unloading half a dozen native craft the maxim soon sent them flying and the boats which contained horses donkeys grain and other goods were taken in tow by the gunboats which anchored at the same island as on the previous night  well bimbashi captain keppel said when the work for the day was over so you have had your first brush with the enemy what do you think of it  i would rather that you did not call me bimbashi captain keppel the title is ridiculous for me and it was only given me that it might be useful when with egyptian or soudanese soldiers i should feel really obliged if you would simply call me hilliard  i felt all right sir during the fight except that i envied the gunners who were doing something while i had nothing to do but look on it certainly made me jump when that shell struck the boat because i had quite made up my mind that their guns would not carry so far and so it was a complete surprise to me  yes it was a very harmless affair still it was good as a preparation for something more severe you have got accustomed to the noise now and that is always as great a trial to the nerves as actual danger  i wish i could be doing something sir everyone else had some duty from yourself down to the black firemeneven my servant made himself useful in carrying up shot  i tell you what i will do mr hilliard i will get those marine sergeants to instruct you in the working of the maxim and in the duties of the men attending on it then next time we come up i will put you in command of one of them your duties will not be severe as you would simply direct the men as to the object at which they are to aim watch the effect and direction of the bullets and see that they change their aim as circumstances may direct the black gunners are well trained and know their work still if by any chance the gun jams it will be useful for you to be able to show them what to do even though they know it as well as or better than you do yourself the blacks like being commanded by a white officer and will feel pleased rather than otherwise at your being appointed to command their gun your lessons cannot begin for a day or two for i have not done with metemmeh yet  i am very much obliged to you indeed gregory said warmly i will take care not to interfere with the mens working of the gun  no you will not have to do that but a word or two of commendation when they make good practice pleases them immensely and they will work all the better and faster for your standing by them  at daybreak next morning the gunboats went up again and engaged the forts as before the dervishes had placed more guns in position but again the shells fell short while those of the boats played havoc with the enemys defences some ten thousand of the dervish horse and foot came down near the town in readiness to repel any attempt at a landing  after some hours bombardment the gunboats retired as they steamed away the dervish host were shouting and waving their banners evidently considering that they had won a great victory  having fulfilled their object which was to retain mahmud at metemmeh by showing him that if he advanced against merawi and dongola we had it in our power to occupy the town and so cut off his retreat and prevent reinforcements or stores from reaching him from omdurman the gunboats returned to berber  so far gregory had had no duties to perform in his capacity of interpreter for no prisoners had been taken on the way down the river one of the artillery sergeants explained the working of the maxim to him taking the weapon to pieces and explaining to him how each part acted and then showing him how to put it together again the sergeant having done this several times gregory was then told to perform the operation himself and the lessons continued after their arrival at berber  in the course of a week he was able to do this smartly and had learned in case of a breakdown which parts of the mechanism would most probably have given way and how to replace broken parts by spare ones carried up for the purpose  there was no long rest at berber and on the 1st of november the gunboats again went up the river reinforced by the metemmeh which had now arrived each boat as before carried fifty soldiers and major stuartwortley went up as staff officer the evening before starting they received the welcome news that the railway line had that day reached abu hamed  this time there was but a short pause made opposite metemmeh and after shelling the forts which had been added to since the last visit they proceeded up the river shortly after passing the town a large dervish camp was seen in a valley and this they afterwards found was occupied by the force that had returned from berber a heavy fire of shell and shrapnel was opened upon it and it was speedily destroyed  the gunboats then went up as high as the sixth cataract the country was found to be absolutely deserted neither a peasant nor a dervish being visible having thus accomplished the object of their reconnaissance the flotilla returned exchanged fire with the metemmeh batteries and then kept on their way down to berber    chapter 11 a prisoner   rather than remain unoccupied on board the gunboat gregory went to colonel wingates headquarters and said that he should be very glad if he would allow him while the flotilla remained at berber to assist in interrogating the fugitives who arrived from the south and the spies employed to gain early information of the intentions and movements of the enemy the position of the dervishes at metemmeh was becoming critical the khalifa was desirous that mahmud should return with his force to omdurman there to take part in the battle in which as he was convinced the invaders would be annihilated mahmud who was of an eager and impetuous disposition was anxious to take the offensive at once and either to march upon merawi and dongola or to drive the british out of berber  there could be no doubt that his view was a more sagacious one than that of his father and that the best tactics to be adopted were to harass the british advance fall upon their convoys cut their communications and so oblige them to fall back for want of supplies the khalifas mistake was similar to that made by theodore in abyssinia and koffee kalkalli in ashanti had either of these leaders adopted the system of harassing the invaders from the moment they left the coast it would have been next to impossible for the latter to arrive at their destination but each allowed them to march on unmolested until within striking distance then hazarded everything on the fortune of a single battle and lost  mahmud made no movement in obedience to the khalifas orders to retire to omdurman and the latter thereupon refused to send any further supplies to him and mahmuds army was therefore obliged to rely upon raids and plunder for subsistence these raids were carried out with great boldness and villages situated within a few miles of berber were attacked the dervishes however met with a much warmer reception than they had expected for rifles and ammunition had been served out freely to the villagers and these knowing the fate that awaited them were the dervishes victorious offered so obstinate a resistance that the latter fell back discomfited  early in january the sirdar learned that the khalifa had changed his mind and had sent peremptory orders to mahmud to advance and drive the british out of berber and destroy the railway mahmud had now been joined by osman digna with five thousand men and as the egyptian troops well as they had fought had never yet been opposed to so formidable a force as that which mahmud commanded the sirdar telegraphed to england for white troops  his request was at once complied with the warwickshires lincolnshires and cameron highlanders were ordered to proceed from cairo and alexandria to the front and the seaforth highlanders at malta and the northumberland fusiliers at gibraltar were also despatched without delay major general gatacre was appointed to the command of the brigade  at the end of the third week in january the three regiments from lower egypt had arrived at wady halfa and the seaforths at assouan at the beginning of february the british brigade was carried by railway to abu dis here they remained until the 26th when they marched to berber and then to a camp ten miles north of the atbara where they arrived on the 4th of march having covered a hundred and fortyfour miles in six days and a half a great feat in such a climate  mahmud had made no movement until the 10th of february when he began to cross the nile to shendy this movement had not been expected by the sirdar and was hailed by him with satisfaction had mahmud remained at metemmeh he could aided by the forts his artillery and the walled town have offered a very formidable resistance had he marched along the banks of the nile he would have been exposed to the fire of the gunboats but these could not have arrested his course the country round berber was favourable to the action of his cavalry and if defeated he could have fallen back unmolested through metemmeh on omdurman but by crossing the river he practically cut himself off from the dervish base and now had only a desert behind him for we had taken over kassala from the italians and the egyptian battalion there and a large force of friendly arabs would prevent him from retiring up the banks of the atbara  mahmuds plan was to march along the nile to ahab then to cross the desert to hudi at an angle of the river whence a direct march of twentyfive miles would take him to berber and in this way he would avoid our strong position at the junction of the atbara and the nile it would have been easy for the gunboats to prevent mahmud from crossing the nile but the sirdar was glad to allow him to do so the movement afforded him time to concentrate his force and to get up large supplies for each day the distance that these could be transported by the railway had increased and he saw that when the time for fighting came the victory would be a decisive one and that few indeed of mahmuds men would ever be able to make their way to omdurman and swell the khalifas force there  on one occasion however the gunboats went up to watch what was going on and take advantage of any opportunity that might offer to destroy some of mahmuds boats and thus render the work of his getting his force over slower and more difficult an entrenchment had been thrown up at the point where the dervishes crossed and this had been manned by two hundred and fifty riflemen the zafir steamed up close to the bank and opened fire with her maxims another gunboat sank one large craft and captured two others and the troops landed and covered by the fire of the guns captured a fourth which had grounded in shallow water  a smaller boat was halfway across the river when the gunboats arrived it was seen that there were several women on board and as the capture would have been of no value no regard was paid to it as it would have been as dangerous to return as to keep on the boatmen plied their hardest to get across but the stream carried them down near the zafir the boat was quite unnoticed all eyes being intent upon the shore she was passing about thirty yards astern of the gunboat when a badly aimed shell from a dervish battery struck her and she sank almost instantly  gregory who was superintending the working of the maxim nearest the stern looked round at the sound of the explosion several of the occupants had evidently been killed but two or three of the boatmen started to swim to shore only two of the women came to the surface struggling wildly and screaming for help with scarcely a thought of what he was doing gregory unclasped his sword belt dropped his pistol and sprang overboard  one of the women had sunk before he reached them the other was on the point of doing so when he caught her by the arm she at once clung to him and he had hard work to disengage her arm from his neck then after turning her so that her face was above water he looked round the gunboat was already a hundred yards away her wheel was revolving so as to keep her in her place facing the redoubt and the stream was driving him fast away from her  within ten yards of him was a black head and a moment later zaki was beside him he had been working at gregorys maxim and had suddenly missed his master looking round he had seen him struggling with the woman in the stream and without hesitation had leapt overboard  i am sorry you came gregory said for it is only throwing away your life it is of no use shouting for they could not hear us in that din and if they happened to catch sight of us would take us for two of the black boatmen i see the stream is taking us nearer to the bank  zaki had taken hold of the woman while he was speaking  we might swim a long way down master if we let go of her  i wont do that zaki i know now that i was a fool to jump overboard but now that i have done so i will save her life besides i could not swim very far even without her i am feeling the weight of my boots and clothes  will you swim with us till i can touch the ground and then leave us strike right into the river againi know that you are a good swimmerand drop down the stream until you reach one of the islands and then you can land and hail the gunboats as they come down tell captain keppel why i jumped over  i am not going to leave you master no doubt the dervishes will shoot me but my life is of no consequence and i shall be glad to die by the side of so good a master  the woman who had ceased to struggle when gregory shook off her grasp was now conscious as with one of them supporting her on each side her head was above water  they will not kill you she said you have saved me and they will be grateful  gregory had no faith whatever in dervish gratitude  well zaki he said if you will not leave us we will strike at once for the shore the gunboats are nearly half a mile away now there is just a chance that we may not have been noticed by the dervishes and may be able to hide in the bushes till the gunboats return when they see me they will at once send a boat ashore under cover of their fire and take us off  there is a good chance of that master zaki said cheerfully and the dervishes are busy up there fighting and will not think much of a little boat  three or four minutes later they were in shallow water as soon as they landed gregory threw himself down utterly exhausted and the woman sank down beside him but not before hastily rearranging her veil in a couple of minutes gregory roused himself  i can climb the bank now he said and the sooner we are hidden among the bushes the better  but as he spoke he heard the sound of galloping horsemen and almost immediately an emir on a magnificent animal followed by a dozen dervishes dashed up  mahmud the woman cried as she rose to her feet it is i fatma  mahmud gave a cry of joy and waved his hand to his followers who had already pointed their rifles at gregory  these have saved me my lord the woman went on they jumped from their boat and reached me just as i was sinking and have borne me up for my sake you must spare their lives  mahmud frowned he dismounted and went up to his wife  have i not sworn fatma he said that i would slay every unbeliever who falls into my hands how then can i spare even one who has saved your life  others have been spared who have been of service my lord she said there are greeks and egyptians who work your guns and they were spared because they were useful there is neufeld who lives under the protection of the khalifa surely these men have done far more to deserve not only life but honour at your hands they risked their lives to save mine what follower of the prophet could do more they could not have known who i was a woman they saw drowning are there any among the bravest of the tribes who would have done the same  i have sworn an oath mahmud said gloomily  but you have not sworn to slay instantly you can keep them at least until you can take them before the khalifa and say to him  father i have sworn to kill unbelievers but these men have saved fatmas life and i pray you to absolve me from the oath or order them to be taken from me and then do you yourself pardon them and set them free for the service that they have rendered me  if he refuses if these men are killed i also swear that as my life is due to them i myself will perish by my own hands if they die for saving it  it needs not that fatma you think that i am ungrateful that i do not feel that these men have acted nobly thus to risk their lives to save a strange woman whose face they have never seen it is my oath that lies heavily upon me i have never been false to an oath  nor need you be now fatma said earnestly you swore to slay any unbeliever that fell into your hands this man has not fallen into your hands i have a previous claim to him he is under my protection i cover him with my robeand she swept a portion of her garment round gregoryand as long as he is under it he is according to tribal laws safe even from the vengeance of my husband  as to the other he is not an unbeliever your oath concerns him not him you can honour and reward according to the value you place upon my life  the arabs face cleared  truly you have discovered a way out of it fatma at any rate for the present  he turned to gregory for the first time  do you speak our tongue he asked  yes emir as well as my own  then you understand what we have said had i not been bound by my oath i would have embraced you as a brother we arabs can appreciate a brave deed even when it is done by an enemy when one of the boatmen ran into the battery where i was directing the guns against your boat and said that the boat in which my wife with other women were crossing had been sunk by a shell from our batteries on the other side i felt that my blood was turned to water he said he believed that all had been killed or drowned but that he looked back as he swam and saw a white man jump overboard and a short time after another followed him and that when he reached the shore they were supporting a woman in the water  i rode hither having but small hope indeed that it was my wife but marvelling much that a white officer should thus risk his life to save a drowning woman my oath pressed heavily upon me as i rode even had it been but a slave girl whom you rescued i should no less have admired your courage i myself am said to be brave but it would never have entered my mind thus to risk my life for a stranger when i found that it was my wife who was saved i still more bitterly regretted the oath that stood between me and her preserver and truly glad am i that she has herself shown me how i can escape from its consequences  now i see you i wonder even more than before at what you have done for indeed in years you are little more than a boy  what i did emir i believe any white officer who was a good swimmer would have done no englishman would see a woman drowning without making an effort to save her if he had it in his power as to the fact that she was not of the same race or religion he would never give it a thought it would be quite enough for him that she was a woman  and you mahmud said turning to zaki you are a jaalin are you not  i am  jaalin or baggara you are my friend mahmud said placing his hand on zakis shoulders and so you too leapt overboard to save a woman  no emir he replied i jumped over because my master jumped over i had not thought about the woman i jumped over to aid him and it was to give him my help that i took my share in supporting the woman the bimbashi is a good master and i would die for him  mahmud smiled at this frank answer  nevertheless whatever may have been your motive you were enabled to save the life of my wife and henceforth you are my friend  then he turned to the horsemen who were still grouped on the bank above  you have heard what has been said the white man is under the protection of my harem the jaalin is henceforth my friend  mahmud was a fine specimen of the tribesmen of the soudantall well built and with pure arab features he was the khalifas favourite son and was generous with kindly impulses but impatient of control of late he had given way to outbursts of passion feeling acutely the position in which he was placed he had advanced from omdurman confident that he should be able to drive the infidels before him and carry his arms far into egypt his aspirations had been thwarted by the khalifa his requests for stores and camels that would have enabled him to advance had been refused and he had been ordered to fall back his troops had been rendered almost mutinous from the want of supplies  he had seen the invaders growing stronger and stronger and accomplishing what had seemed an impossibilitythe bringing up of stores sufficient for their sustenanceby pushing the railroad forward towards berber now that their forces had been very greatly increased and the issue of the struggle had become doubtful he had received the order for which he had been craving for months and had been directed to march down and attack the egyptian army drive them across the nile and destroy the railway  by means of spies he had heard that ere long a large force of british soldiers would come up to reinforce the egyptians so that what might have been easy work two months before had now become a difficult and dangerous enterprise the manner in which the dervishes had been defeated in their attacks upon wolseleys desert column and in the engagements that had since taken place showed how formidable was the fighting power not only of the british troops but of the native army they had organized and his confidence in the power of the tribesmen to sweep all before them had been shaken  the dervishes scowled when they heard that they were not to have the satisfaction of massacring this englishman whose countrymen were still keeping up a terrible fire on their redoubt it was not one of their wives who had been rescued and gregorys act of jumping overboard seemed to them to savour of madness and if that plea had been advanced they would have recognized it as rendering the person of the man who had performed it inviolable however as he was under the protection of their leaders harem there was nothing more to be said and at an order from mahmud all but four of them rode off while the others fell in behind him  mahmud did not mount again but walked with his wife to a deserted mud hut two hundred yards away there he left her telling gregory and zaki to sit down outside and placing the four men on guard  i must rejoin my men he said as he mounted when your vessels have gone i will return  half an hour later the fire ceased soon afterwards mahmud rode up with a score of men followed by some dozen women and a slave leading a donkey on this fatma took her seat and the women surrounded her gregory and zaki walked close behind them mahmud with his horsemen rode in front  after proceeding for a mile they came upon a group of tents mahmuds banner was flying on a pole in front of the largest of these behind and touching it was another almost as large this was the abode of the ladies of mahmuds harem the other tents were occupied by his principal emirs a hundred yards away was the encampment of the army which was sheltered in hastily constructed huts or arbours made of bushes  by mahmuds order a small tent was erected with blankets close to the after entrance into the harem tent for gregorys use so that should he be attacked by fanatics he could at once take refuge in the harem whose sanctity not even the most daring would dare to violate  a handsome robe was brought for zaki and as mahmud presented it to him he said  you are my friend but you must now go back to your vessels or to berber my orders were to kill all the jaalin and we have spared none who fell into our hands at metemmeh or since i cannot keep you here as long as you stay by my side you will be safe but you could not leave me for a moment it is as much as i can do to save the life of this infidel officer and it is to him that i owe most for it was he who first leapt into the river  the white mens boats have already fastened up behind the island where they before stationed themselves make your way down there at daybreak and wave a white cloth doubtless they will send a boat ashore thinking that you bear a message from me or if you see they do not do this you can swim out to them  i would rather stay with my master cannot you let him go too  that is impossible mahmud said shortly it is known throughout the camp that i have a white man here the news will travel fast to the khalifa my actions have already been misrepresented to him and were i to let this officer go my father might recall me to omdurman and send another to command here  he must stay but you may go without harm you can scarcely have been noticed yet and i can well declare should the khalifa hear of you that you have escaped  may i speak with my master zaki said if he says stay i shall stay though it might cost me my life if he says go i must go  you may speak to him mahmud said  zaki went round to gregorys tent and told him what mahmud had said  go certainly zaki you can do me no good by remaining here and might even do me harm for if you were killed i also might be murdered moreover i wish to send the news of my capture and how it occurred i do not think any save yourself noticed that i was missing and when the fight was over and they found that i was absent they might suppose that i had been shot and had fallen overboard  i will write a note for you to carry it is in all respects better that you should go were we to be seen talking together it might be supposed that we were planning some way of escape and i should be more closely watched as it is i see that mahmud will have difficulty in protecting me were you to ride about with him as he says your presence would remind his followers that he has a white man a captive here whereas if i remain almost in concealment near the harem the fact that there is a white man here will pass out of the minds of those who know it and will not become the common talk of the camp  mahmud is running some risk in having spared my life and i do not wish to make it harder for him go therefore and tell him that you will leave tonight i cannot write now my pocketbook is soaked through but i will tear out some leaves and dry them in the sun and write what i have to say before you start i shall speak highly of you in my letter and recommend you to colonel wingate who will i have no doubt give you employment  i hope i shall see you again before long i am very sorry that we must part but it is best for us both  very reluctantly zaki returned to mahmud  my master says i must go emir and i must obey his orders though i would rather stay with him tonight i will leave  it is well i would that i could let him go also but my oath prevents me from giving him his freedom i trust however that when the khalifa hears of his noble action and how he has made me his debtor he will say that allah himself would not blame me for that gratitude is even more binding than an oath  still until i hear from him i can do nothing we have not seen matters in the same light for some time when i wanted to strike he was unwilling that i should do so now when it seems to me that the time for that has passed and that i had best retire on omdurman he says go forward and fight it is not for me to question his commands or his wisdom but i may not give him cause for anger  my advice to you is when you get to berber do not stay there we shall assuredly be there before long and as none would know that you were under my protection you would be slain go straight to abu hamed and when you hear that we have defeated the infidels and have entered berber leave by this road they have made upon which as they tell me carriages run without horses and stay not until you reach cairo  there you can live quietly until you hear that the khalifas army is approaching after that fly i cannot say whither but seek a shelter until the black flag waves over the whole of the land when there is no more fighting then come to me and i will give you a post of honour  i will do so emir when the time comes i will remind you of your promise  i have neither silver nor gold with which i can reward you now but we shall gather these things in egypt and i will make you wealthy  zaki thought that it would be unwise to wander from mahmuds encampment and he accordingly sat down by his tent presently one of the slaves came out with a large dish of food that mahmud had sent him as evening approached he went round to gregorys little tent with the intention of trying to persuade him to attempt to escape with him but two of the tribesmen with rifles in their hands were stationed there they offered no opposition to his entry but their presence showed that mahmud was determined that his master should appear to be a close prisoner as indeed his escape might well jeopardize the emirs position even among his followers  gregory had a letter ready for him to carry to captain keppel it ran as follows  dear captain keppel  i am a prisoner in mahmuds hands this is the result of my own impetuosityi will not say folly for i cannot regret that i yielded to the sudden impulse that seized me a boat containing some women was sunk by a shell when but a few yards astern of the gunboat most of its occupants were killed but i saw a woman struggling in the water and without thinking of the consequences jumped overboard to save her my servant following me when we reached her we found that the current was too strong to regain the gunboat and so landed about half a mile down hoping to find shelter in the bushes until the boat came down the stream what i did however had been observed by the dervishes and as soon as i landed a party rode up headed by mahmud himself who was aware that his favourite wife was in the boat that had sunk  most fortunately it turned out that she was the woman i had saved upon her appeal mahmud spared our lives he has released my man who will carry this to you but having sworn that he would spare no white man he retains me in his hands as a prisoner until he can lay the facts before the khalifa and obtain his permission to let me go i trust that all will be well and that some day i may rejoin the army however there is no saying how matters may turn out  i am happy in knowing that there is no one who if the worst comes to the worst will grieve over my loss i recommend my faithful servant to you i should wish the balance of pay coming to me to be handed to him as well as my camel and horse and all other belongings by the sale of these he would be able at the end of the war to buy a piece of land and settle down among his own people  will you kindly report my capture to colonel wingate or general hunter thanking you for your kindness to me i remain  yours faithfully  gregory hilliard  p s in my cabin is a tin box containing documents of importance to me i shall be greatly obliged if you will take charge of these untilas i hope will be the casei rejoin you  he handed the paper to zaki who took his hand and raised it to his forehead with tears in his eyes  i go because you order me master he said in a broken voice but i would a thousand times rather remain and share your fate whatever it might be  then he turned and abruptly left the tent  twice that day gregory had received food from a female slave of the harem although he knew that he should miss zaki greatly he was very glad that he had been sent away for he felt that although for the time he had been reprieved his position was very precarious and that his servants would have been still more so a white prisoner was a personage of some consequence but the death of a jaalin was a matter that would disturb no one thousands of them had been massacred and one more or less could not matter at all but however much the dervishes might hate a white infidel it would be a serious matter for even the most powerful emir to harm a prisoner under the protection of the harem of the khalifas son  mahmud had been very popular among them but his position had been gravely shaken by the events of the last six months having unlimited confidence in themselves the baggara had seen with increasing fury the unopposed advance of the egyptians they could not understand why they should not have been allowed after the capture of metemmeh to march across the desert to merawi and annihilate the infidels assembled there it was true that these had repulsed the force defending dongola but this was a comparatively small body and it was the gunboats and not the egyptian troops who had forced them to evacuate the town  the fall of abu hamed had added to their discontent and they were eager to march with all speed to berber to join the five thousand men comprising its garrison and to drive the invaders back across the nile  but they had been kept inactive by the orders of the khalifa and by the want of stores they had for months been suffering great privations and while remaining in enforced inactivity they had known that their enemys strength was daily increasing and that what could have been accomplished with the greatest of ease in august had now become a very serious business  mahmud had chafed at the situation in which he found himself placed by his fathers refusal to support him or to allow him to take any action this had soured his temper and he had taken to drinking heavily he had become more harsh with his men more severe in the punishment inflicted for any trifling disobedience of orders although no thought that the rule of the khalifa could be seriously threatened entered their minds fanatical as they were they could not but feel some uneasiness at the prospect  a great army was gathering at berber kassala was in the hands of the british and the forces that had been beleaguering it had been defeated with heavy loss abyssinia had leagued itself against them the insurrection of the jaalin had been crushed but there were signs of unrest in kordofan and other parts  of course all this would be put right an army of sixty thousand men was at omdurman and this with mahmuds command would suffice to sweep away all their enemies their enthusiasm would never have wavered had they been called upon for action but these months of weary waiting and of semistarvation without the acquisition of any booty or plunderfor little indeed had been obtained at the capture of metemmehsapped their energy and the force that crossed the nile for an advance upon berber was far less formidable than it would have been had it been led forward against merawi and dongola directly after the capture of metemmeh still it needed only the prospect of a battle to restore its spirits  a fortnight after gregorys capture the dervish army was set in motion a few thousand men had already been sent forward along the banks of the river to check any advance that might be made from fort atbara had it not been for this gregory might have attempted to escape it would not have been very difficult for him to creep out at the back of his little tent unperceived by his guards but the dangers to be encountered in making his way to the british fort would have been immense  it would have been necessary for him to keep by the river for from this source alone could water be obtained the country had been stripped of its crops of all kinds by the dervishes the villages had been razed to the ground and the last head of maize and other grain gleaned by the starving people who had taken refuge in the bush and jungle  therefore although by keeping near the river he could quench his thirst at will he would assuredly have to face starvation moreover he would have no chance of searching for any ears of corn which might have escaped the eyes of the searchers for he must travel only by night and lie up by day to avoid capture by one or other of the bands that had gone on in which case he would at once be killed being beyond the influence of mahmud and the protection of the harem  on the other hand he had nothing to complain of except the monotony and uncertainty of his position fatma kept him well supplied with food and from the gossip of the slaves who brought this to him he learnt how matters were progressing he was longing for the dervish army to make a move for he felt that when they neared the british position the greater would be the chance of escape and none among the followers of mahmud rejoiced more than he did when he knew that the longexpected advance was about to take place  once in motion the spirits of the dervishes revived at last they were going to meet these insolent invaders and none doubted that they would easily defeat them the greater portion of the harem and attendants were left behind at shendy for but few camels were available fatma and another of mahmuds wives rode on one a tent was carried by another half a dozen slaves followed and gregory walked with these  he could not help admiring the attitude of the tribesmentall powerful men inured to hardship and walking or riding with an air of fierce independence which showed their pride in themselves and their confidence in their prowess  the party always started early in the morning so as to get the tents erected at the halting place before the main body of the dervishes came up on the march they kept some distance from the river and being but a small group the gunboats did not waste their shot upon them but each day there was a sharp exchange of fire between them and mahmuds force  gregory supposed that mahmuds plan was to cross the atbara which was fordable at several points and to attack the fort there in which case he had no doubt the arabs would be driven off with much loss the sirdar was of the same opinion and in order to tempt them to do so he maintained only one egyptian brigade in the fort the remainder of the force being concentrated at kennur four miles away from this point they would be able to advance and take the dervishes in flank while they were engaged in the attack of the fort  mahmud however was kept well informed of the movements of the troops and instead of continuing his course down the river bank when he reached gabati he struck across the desert and after two days march crossed the atbara at nakheila from this point owing to the bend in the river he would be able to march direct to berber avoiding the atbara fort and the force gathered round it  altogether the desert march although only lasting two days was a trying one the heat was overpowering and even the ladies of the harem had the scantiest supply of water they had at starting given gregory a gourd of water for his own use this he had taken sparingly and it lasted him until they reached the atbara  it was now dead low water and the river offered no obstacle to crossing as the bed was for the most part dry with pools here and there the arab encampment was formed in a thick grove of trees which afforded some shelter from the sun  day after day passed mahmud was now informed as to the strength of the force he should have to encounter and for the first time felt some doubt as to the issue of the fight he determined therefore to stand on the defensive this decision however he kept to himself the dervishes were burning to be led to the assault and became almost mutinous on account of the delay mahmud was obliged to take the strongest measures and several of those who were loudest in their dissatisfaction were summarily executed the rest were pacified with the assurance that he was only waiting for a fortunate day  in the meantime the men were employed in fortifying the position deep holes were dug along the edge of the wood and behind these were trenches and pitfalls mahmuds own temper grew daily more sullen and fierce his own fighting instinct was in favour of the attack his followers longed to deliver but in his heart he was afraid that the result might be fatal it was not the rifles of the infantry that he fearedof these he had no experiencebut the artillery which he had learned already could be used with terrible effect  as mahmud was drinking heavily and as the fact that the white soldiers were near at hand added to the fanatical hatred of the emirs and tribesmen fatma sent a message by a slave to gregory warning him not to show himself outside the little shelter tent composed of a single blanket in which he now lived  at length it became known that the english host was approaching as soon as the gunboats brought down news that the dervishes were no longer following the river bank but were disappearing into the desert the sirdar guessed their intentions nothing could have suited him better a battle now must be a decisive one there was no way of retreat open to the dervishes except to cross the waterless desert or to fly south keeping to the course of the atbara which would take them farther and farther from the nile with every mile they marched  bringing up all his force therefore from kennur and the atbara fort which one battalion was left to guard the sirdar took up his post at hudi the position was well chosen it lay halfway between mahmuds camp at nakheila and the atbara fort and left mahmud only the option of attacking him or of making a long detour through the desert to the east in order to reach berber the british on the other hand could receive their supplies by camels from the atbara fort  the cavalry went out to reconnoitre and had constant skirmishes with the enemys horse but when day after day passed and mahmud did not come as the sirdar had expected to attack him it was determined to take the offensive general hunter was ordered to move forward with the whole of the cavalry and a maximgun battery to discover the exact position of the enemy  the camp had been well chosen for like abu hamed it lay in a depression and could not be seen until an enemy came within six hundred yards of it thus the superiority of range of the british rifles was neutralized and their guns could not be brought into play until within reach of the dervish muskets the wood was surrounded by a high zareba behind which a crowd of dervishes were assembled they had anticipated an attack and held their fire until the cavalry should come nearer this however general hunter had no intention of doing and he retired with the information he had gained his account of the strength of the position showed the difficulty of taking it by assault  next day he again went out with the same force but this time the dervishes were prepared their mounted men dashed out from the wood and galloped round to cut off the cavalry while the footmen crowded out to attack them in front the cavalry fell back in perfect order and one squadron charged forty of the dervish cavalry who barred the line of retreat these they drove off but the main body still pressed forward and the maxims opened upon them the hail of bullets was too much for the horsemen and they drew off several times they gathered again for a charge but on each occasion the maxims dispersed them the unmounted dervishes were soon left behind but the horsemen in spite of the lesson they had received followed almost to the camp  on the afternoon of the 7th of april the angloegyptian force marched out they started at five in the afternoon and halted at seven the horses were first taken down to water the infantry by half battalions all then lay down to sleep at one oclock the word to advance was passed round quietly the moon was full and high overhead so there was no difficulty in avoiding obstacles each brigade marched in square accompanied by the guns and the maxims and the camels with provisions and spare ammunition  at four oclock they halted again they had been well guided and were now but a short distance from the enemys position at sunrise the men were again on their feet and advanced to within two hundred yards of the position from which they were to deliver their attack the british brigadethe camerons warwicks seaforths and lincolnswere on the left next to them came macdonalds brigadethe three soudanese regiments in front the 2nd egyptian in support farther still to the right and touching the river was maxwells brigade comprising also three soudanese regiments and an egyptian one two of the three egyptian battalions of lewiss brigade were placed on the left rear of the british brigade the third battalion was in square round the camels two field batteries were in front of the infantry and two to the right of maxwells brigade  half a mile from the zareba the infantry halted and the artillery and maxims opened fire for an hour a tremendous fire was poured into the enemys position but not a shot was fired in reply although the dervishes could be seen moving among the trees apparently unconcerned at the storm of shell and bullets  gregorys position had been growing more critical every day food was extremely short the scanty supplies that the force had brought with them had been long since exhausted and they were now subsisting upon palm nuts of these two were served out daily to each man a quantity barely sufficient to keep life together in spite of the vigilant watch kept by the more fanatical of mahmuds followers desertions had become frequent notwithstanding the certain death that awaited those who were overtaken  the evening after the cavalry made their first reconnaissance the slave who brought gregorys food told him that fatma wished to speak to him it was but three paces to the entrance of the tent and his guards made no objection the entrance was closed as the slave entered but half a minute later it was opened an inch or two and without showing herself fatma said  listen to me  i am listening gregory replied  i am in great fear for you you are in much danger the emirs say to mahmud that you ought to be killed their followers are wellnigh starvingwhy should an infidel prisoner be eating his friends are now close to us and there will be a battle none will be spared on either sidewhy should this man be spared  mahmud has many cares the men are furious because he will not lead them out to fight even the emirs are sullen and osman digna who was on bad terms with him a short time ago and who mahmud suspects is intriguing with them against him is foremost in urging that an attack should take place though everyone knows he is a coward and never shows himself in battle always running away directly he sees that things are going against him still he has five thousand followers of his own  mahmud told me today that he had done all in his power but placed as he was he could not withstand the words of the emirs and the complaints of the tribesmen when the battle comesas it must come in a day or twoit will need all his influence and the faith of the men with him to win and with so much at stake how can he risk everything for the sake of a single life and that the life of an infidel if you would agree to aid in working his guns as the greeks and egyptians do it would content the emirs  that i cannot do gregory said if i am to be killed it is the will of god but better that a thousand times than turn traitor  i knew that it would be so fatma said sorrowfully what can we do at other times the protection of the harem would cover even one who had slain a chief but now that the baggara are half starving and mad with anger and disappointment even that no longer avails if they would brave the anger of the son of the khalifa they would not regard the sanctity of the harem i wish now that i had advised you to try and escape when we left shendy or even when we first came here it would have been difficult but not impossible but now i can see no chance there is the thorn hedge round the wood with few openings and with men on watch all round to prevent desertion several tried to escape last nightall were caught and killed this morning even if it were possible to pass through there are bands of horsemen everywhere out on the plain keeping watch alike against the approach of the enemy and the desertion of cowards  i have been in despair all day that i cannot save the life of one who saved mine i have told mahmud that my honour is concerned and that i would give my life for yours months ago he would have braved the anger of all his army for me but he has changed much of late it is not that he loves me less but that he has been worried beyond bearing and in his troubles he drinks until he forgets them  my only hope is that your people will attack tomorrow mahmud says that they will assuredly be beaten they will be shot down as they approach and none will ever be able to get through the hedge then when they fall back the baggara will pour out horse and foot and destroy them they will then see how right he has been in not letting them go out into the plain to fight his influence will be restored and your life will be safe  we are to be removed to the farther side of the wood when the fighting begins and there all the women are to be gathered and wait till the infidels are utterly destroyed  if your people come tomorrow morning you may be saved otherwise i fear the worst  i thank you for what you have done for me replied gregory and whatever comes of it be sure that i shall feel grateful to you and shall not blame you for not having been able to do what was impossible i hope my friends may come tomorrow for whatever my fate may be anything is better than uncertainty  may allah protect you the woman said with a sob and go now i hear mahmud calling me    chapter 12 the battle of atbara   gregory had little sleep that night it was clear to him that there was absolutely no chance of making his escape even were his two guards withdrawn it would not improve his position he had no means of disguise and even if he had an arab dress and could stain his face he could not hope to make his way through the crowds of sleeping men the pitfalls and trenches and pass out through the jealously guarded zareba there was nothing for him but to wait till the end  he could not blame mahmud a leader on the eve of a great battle could not for the sake of a single captive risk his influence and oppose the wishes of his followers it was much that he had for his wifes sake postponed the fulfilment of his oath and had so long withstood the wishes of his most influential emirs more could not be expected at any rate he was better off than others who had been in the same position he had not so far as he knew a relation in the worldno one who would be anywise affected by his death and at least he would have the satisfaction of knowing that it was a kind action which had brought him to his end he prayed earnestly not that his life might be spared but that his death might be a painless one and that he might meet it as an english officer should without showing signs of fear  the next day he heard orders given and a great stir in camp and he gathered from those who passed near the tent that the enemys cavalry were again approaching and that the mounted men were to ride out and cut them off from retreating while the dismounted men were to pour out and annihilate them then for a time all was silence in the camp  suddenly an outburst of shouts and cries broke out and almost simultaneously he heard the rattle of maxim gunsthe fight had begun would the egyptian horsemen stand firm or would they give way to panic if they broke and fled none whatever would return to their camp through the host of baggara horsemen  for a time the roll of the fire from the machine guns was incessant then there was a pause two or three minutes later it broke out again but it was evidently somewhat farther off and so it went on with intervals of silence but ever getting farther away it was clear that the horsemen had not been able to bring the cavalry to a standstill and that these were steadily falling back covered by the fire of the maxims at last the sound grew faint in the distance and soon afterwards the noise in the camp showed that the infantry were returning  it was not till two hours later that he heard the mounted men ride in and gathered from the talk outside that they had lost nearly two hundred men and had been unable to prevent the egyptian cavalry from returning to camp towards evening he heard angry talking and could distinguish mahmuds voice then the blanket was pulled off its supports and two men ordered him to follow them  this was doubtless the end and he nerved himself for what was to come and with head erect and a steady face he accompanied the men to the front of mahmuds tent the chief was standing with frowning face and several emirs were gathered in front of him while a number of tribesmen stood a short distance away  now mahmud said let one of you speak  one of the emirs stepped forward  i osman digna demand that this infidel be put to death his countrymen have slain many of my men and yours  feeling now that mahmud after doing his best had ceased to struggle for him and that his death was certain gregory took a step forward towards the speaker and said scornfully  so you are osman digna i am one of the first of my countrymen to see your face though many have seen your back at a distance  instead of provoking a pistol shot as he had intended his remark was followed by a roar of laughter from the emirs for osmans cowardice was a byword among them and his nickname was one who always runs  osman indeed had put his hand on the stock of one of the pistols in his belt but mahmud said imperiously  the mans life is mine not yours osman digna if you shoot him i shoot you  the fearlessness of the lad had pleased the other emirs for recklessly brave themselves the baggara appreciated and esteemed courage and honour one of the others said  this is a brave young fellow and infidels as his people are we admit that they are brave were it for ourselves only we would say let him live until we see what comes of it but our people complain they say his folk with whom we had no quarrel come here and aid the egyptians against us they slew many yesterday it is not right that this man should be living among us when his countrymen are fighting against us  there was a murmur of assent among the others then mahmud spoke  i have promised that he should not be killed unless by order of the khalifa but this i will do he shall be placed in the front rank if allah wills it he will be killed by the bullets of his countrymen if when the fight is over he is unharmed you shall all agree that the matter be left for the khalifa to decide but mind i wash my hands of his death on the eve of a battle it is not for me to set my wishes above those of my emirs and my tribesmen and i yield to your demands because it is necessary that all be of one mind if he is killed which surely he will be unless allah protects him his blood be upon your heads  he waved his hand and the men came forward and again took gregory to his tent  the latter was well contented with the decision that he should be killed he had no doubt that at least his death would be swift and sudden he would not be speared or cut to pieces with knives he would see his countrymen advancing he would know that he would be speedily avenged  two days passed when the news came that the egyptians had advanced to umdabieh seven miles nearer and on the following morning the dervish camp was disturbed early there was joy in every face and renewed vigour in the bearing of the men scouting dervishes had brought in word that the infidels had marched during the night and were now halting but a mile and a half away  the hour had come at last they were confident in themselves and their trust in their leader was renewed the fight two days before had shown them that the guns of the white men were terrible on the plain and that it was after all wise to await them in the position which had been made impregnable and against which the foe would hurl themselves in vain then they were to pour out and annihilate them  the slave came to gregorys tent at daybreak  fatma is praying to allah for your safety he said  there was no time for more for already the tents were being pulled down and soon the women were hurried away to the rear four men surrounded gregory and led him to the edge of the camp and there fastened him to the stump of a tree that had been cut off six feet from the ground the upper portion being used in the construction of the zareba ten or twelve men were similarly fastened in a line with him these had been detected in trying to sneak away  gregory had not seen anything of the camp before and as he was taken along he was astounded at the amount of work that had been done everywhere the ground was pitted with deep holes capable of sheltering from fifteen to twenty men the hedge was a high one and was formed for the most part of prickly bushes the position was indeed a formidable one manned as it was by nearly twenty thousand desperate fighters  at six oclock the first gun was fired and for an hour and a half the camp was swept with shell shrapnel and maxim bullets most of the baggara were lying in the pits many however walked about calmly as if in contempt of the fire more than half of the wretched men bound to the trees were killed  at last the fire of the guns slackened and on the crest of the position in a semicircle round the wood a long line of steadily marching men appeared the assault was about to begin  the dervishes sprang from their hiding places and lined the trenches behind the zareba the troops halted and waited the maxims moved in front of the british brigade and then opened fire a bugle sounded and the whole line black and white advanced like a wall when within three hundred yards the men knelt down and opened fire in volleys of sections at the same instant the dervishes with difficulty restrained until now opened fire in return  the maxims and the storm of british bullets swept the wood filling the air with a shower of falling leaves gregory murmured a prayer shut his eyes and awaited death  suddenly he felt his ropes slacken and fall from him and a voice said drop on your face master  almost mechanically he obeyed too astonished even to think what was happening then a body fell across him  lie still and dont move master they must think you are dead  is it you zaki gregory said scarcely able even now to believe that it was his faithful follower  it is i master i have been in the camp three days and have never had a chance of getting near you before  brave fellow good friend gregory said and then was silent  speech was almost inaudible amid the roar of battle the pipes of the camerons could however be heard above the din the men advanced steadily in line maintaining their excellent volley firing the three other regiments in close order followed bearing away farther to the right so as to be able to open fire and advance on that side the black regiments were advancing no less steadily and the half brigade of egyptians were as eager as any steadily and well under control all pushed forward at a run firing occasionally but thirsting to get hand to hand with those who had desolated their land destroyed their villages and slain their friends  the british were suffering but the blacks suffered more for the volleys of the camerons kept down the fire of those opposed to them better than the irregular fire of the soudanese the latter however first reached the zareba and regardless of thorns or of fire dashed through it with triumphant shouts and fell upon the defenders  it was but a minute or two later that the camerons reached the hedge formidable as it looked it took them but a short time to tear down gaps through which they rushed while close behind them the seaforths the lincolns and the warwicks were all in bursting through the low stockade and trenches behind it and cheering madly  now from their holes and shelters the dervishes started up brave though they were the storm that had burst upon them with such suddenness scared them and none attempted to arrest the course of the highlanders and red coats firing as they ran the dervishes made for the river many remained in their pits till the last firing at the soldiers as they rushed past and meeting their death at the point of the bayonet  hotly the troops pursued often falling into the pits which were half hidden by thorns and long grass there was no attempt at regularity in these holesnothing to show where they were it was a wild and confused combat the officers kept their men as well together as it was possible on such ground but it was sharp work for from flank and rear as well as in front the shots rang out from their hidden foes and these had to be despatched as they pushed forward  as the troops burst through gregory sprang to his feet seized a rifle that had dropped from the hands of a dervish who had fallen close by andshouting to zaki lie still as if deadjoined the first line of troops no questions were asked every mans attention was fixed on the work before him and no thought was given to this white officer who sprang from they knew not where he had no cartridges and the dervishes did not carry bayonets but holding the rifle clubwise he kept in the front line falling into pits and climbing out again engaged more than once with desperate foemen  striking and shouting he fought on until the troops reached the river bank and having cleared all before them poured volleys into the mass of fugitives crossing its dry bed other hordes were seen away to the left similarly driven out by lewiss egyptians by whom a terrible fire was kept up until the last of the fugitives disappeared in the scrub on the opposite bank leaving the river bed thickly dotted with dead bodies while on the right macdonalds and maxwells blacks similarly cleared the wood  then the soudanese and whites alike burst into cheers men shook each other by the hand while they waved their helmets over their heads the soudanese leapt and danced like delighted children presently an officer left a group of others who had been congratulating each other on their glorious victory and came up to gregory  may i ask who you are sir he said courteously but coldly  certainly sir my name is hilliard i have been a captive in the hands of the dervishes who when you attacked tied me to the stump of a tree as a target for your bullets and i should certainly have been killed had not a faithful servant of mine a black taken the opportunity when the dervishes rushed into the trenches and opened fire upon you to cut my ropes  i have no doubt sir he went on as he saw the officer look somewhat doubtful that general hunter is here i am known personally to him and served for a time on his staff  that is quite sufficient the officer said more cordially i congratulate you on your escape i confess it astonished us all when a strange white officer whom none of us knew suddenly joined us you will find general hunter somewhere over on the left he is certain to have led the charge of the soudanese  thank you i will go and find him but first i must return to where i left my man he had of course the mahdists patch on his clothes and i told him to lie still as if dead till i came for him as in the melee it would have been impossible for me to have protected him  gregory found zaki still lying where he left him head downward and arms thrown forward in so good an imitation of death that he feared for a moment the lad had been shot after he left him at the sound of his masters voice however the native sprang to his feet  you have saved my life zaki gregory said taking his hand i must have fallenevery man tied to a tree is as you see dead but before we say anything else cut that patch off your clothes or you might be shot as a dervish by the first man you come across  keep close to me i am going to general hunter at present i know none of the officers of the white regiments when i get among the soudanese i shall be more at home  in ten minutes he came to where general hunter was speaking to the sirdar gregory stopped at a short distance before the generals eyes fell upon him and he gave an exclamation of pleasure  that is hilliard general the young fellow who jumped from one of the gunboats off metemmeh to rescue the woman the act was unnoticed at the time but a black he had with him was released and brought word that his master was a prisoner in their camp  i heard of it at the time the sirdar said and motioned to gregory to come up i am glad to find that you have escaped the fate we feared had befallen you but your action was altogether wrong an officers life is no longer his own but belongs to the country he serves and you had no right whatever to risk it when on duty even in an action which at any other time would do you great credit  he spoke sharply and sternly gregory again saluted  i knew afterwards that i had done wrong sir but i did not stop to think and acted on the impulse of the moment  that may be the sirdar said but officers should think and not act on the impulse of the moment  gregory again saluted and fell back three or four minutes later the two generals separated general hunter came up to him and shook him warmly by the hand  you must not mind what the sirdar said hilliard it was a very noble action and did you credit and i can assure you that that was the opinion of all who knew you but to the sirdar you know duty is everything and i think you are lucky in not being sent down at once to the base however he said to me after you had left him  i shall be too busy this evening but bring the young fellow with you tomorrow evening i must hear how it was that mahmud spared him  i told him that i understood from your black that the woman was mahmuds favourite wife and that she took you under her care  by the way have you heard that mahmud is captured yes he is caught which is a great satisfaction to us for his being sent down a prisoner will convince the tribesmen that we have gained a victory as to which they would otherwise be incredulous i hear that the egyptian brigade which was to the extreme left has captured mahmuds wife and a great number of women  with your permission sir i will go over there at once and ask colonel lewis that she may receive specially good treatment she has been extremely kind to me and it is to her influence over mahmud that i owe my life up to this morning mahmud would have spared me but osman digna insisted that i should be killed and he was obliged to give way they fastened me to a tree behind the trench just inside the zareba and i should certainly have been killed by our own musketry fire had not my boy who had come into the camp in disguise cut my cords i fell as if shot and he threw himself down on me until the camerons burst in when i at once joined them and did what little i could in the fight  i will give you a line to colonel lewis to tell him that mahmuds wife whom you will point out is to be treated with respect and that her people may be allowed to make her an arbour of some sort until the sirdar decides what is to be done with her probably she will be sent down to berber no doubt we shall all fall back  then you will not pursue sir  no the cavalry have already gone off in pursuit of their horsemen but they are not likely to catch them for we hear that osman digna is with them and he seems to enjoy a special immunity from capture as for the other poor beggars we could not do it if we wanted to i expect the campaign is over for the present certainly nothing can be done till the railway is completed then the gunboats can tow the native craft abreast of us as we march along the river bank  shendy has been captured and we found twelve thousand jaalin prisoners there women and children and a large quantity of stores that is what makes the position of the dervish fugitives so hopeless there is nothing before them but to find their way across the desert to omdurman and i fancy that few of them will get there alive  no doubt some will keep along by the atbara and others by the nile the latter will have the best chance for the friendlies at kassala will be on the lookout for fugitives i am sorry for the poor wretches though they richly deserve the worst that can befall them they have never shown mercy for twenty years they have murdered plundered and desolated the whole land and have shown themselves more ferocious and merciless than wild beasts  he took out his pocketbook wrote the order to colonel lewis and then tearing the leaf out handed it to gregory who at once made his way followed closely by zaki to the spot where two egyptian battalions had halted they had no difficulty in finding colonel lewis who was receiving a report from the officers of the two battalions of the casualties they had sustained gregory had met the colonel several times at berber and the latter recognized him at once  ah major hilliard that officer said as he came up i am glad to see you i heard that you had been captured by the dervishes and killed but i suppose as i see you here that it was only the usual canard  no sir i was captured but as you see not killed though it has been a pretty close thing this is a note sir that general hunter requested me to give you  colonel lewis read the order  the women are down over there a couple of hundred yards away he said i will send a sergeant and four men with you if you will point out mahmuds wife i will see that she is made as comfortable as possible  thank you sir it is to her i owe my life and i am most anxious to do all i can to repay the debt  you came along through the other brigades do you know what their losses have been  the british losses are not heavy sir considering the fire they have been exposed to macdonalds brigade suffered most i believe  yes i saw one of the officers just now it seems they came down upon mahmuds picked bodyguard and these fought desperately they found mahmud in the usual attitude in which the dervish emirs await death when they are conquered he was sitting quietly on his mat with his arms laid down beside him and was i should imagine somewhat surprised at finding that he was not cut to pieces at once  i am glad he was not sir for he certainly behaved well to me it was through the influence of his wife i admit but in sparing me he really risked serious disaffection among his followers and at last gave way only to coercion  the sergeant and men had now come up and gregory went off with them three or four hundred women were seated on the ground together with half a dozen egyptian soldiers standing as sentry over them more or less closely veiled as they were gregory could not distinguish fatma among them and indeed except when he first reached her in the water he had not got a glimpse of her features the question however was speedily settled when a woman rose in the middle of the group with a cry of gladness  so you are saved she exclaimed i have feared so that you were killed have you news of mahmud  yes lady he is a prisoner but well and unharmed i have obtained an order from the general that you are to be treated with honours as his wife we cannot do much for you at present but all that is possible will be done i have represented your kindness to me and these soldiers will at once erect an arbour for you and food will be brought for you all as soon as matters have settled down a little  the egyptian soldiers had already begun to cut down saplings accustomed as they were to the work in half an hour they had erected an arbour fatma was then assisted into it with the other women of the harem the sergeant gave orders to the sentries that no one was to be allowed to interfere in any way with them and then gregory took his leave saying that he would return later on  he again joined general hunter who seemed to be his natural chief now that his service in the gunboat was over  the list of casualties was now being brought in the camerons who had led the attack in line had lost most heavily they had fifteen killed and fortysix wounded among them being two officers killed and one mortally wounded the seaforths had one officer killed and one mortally wounded and four others less severely in all six killed and twentyseven wounded the lincolns had one killed and eighteen wounded the warwicks two killed and eighteen wounded many of the wounded afterwards died  the egyptians had lost more heavily the casualties among them were fiftyseven killed and four british and sixteen native officers and three hundred and sixtyseven noncommissioned officers and men wounded  the dervish loss was terrible three thousand men were killed among whom were nearly all the emirs and two thousand were taken prisoners the rest were hopeless fugitives and a vast number of these must have been wounded  there was but a short rest for the troops when the wounded had been collected and carried to a neighbouring palm grove where the surgeons did all that could then be done for them and the trophies of the fightbanners and spears guns of all sorts swords and kniveshad been gathered principally by the exultant soudanese and egyptians the force prepared for a start  may i ask general what is to be done with the women gregory said  i have been speaking to the sirdar about them and i was just going to ask you to go with me to them they are of course not to be considered as prisoners they cannot stay here for they would die of hunger therefore they had best follow the troops at any rate as far as the atbara camp they will have food given them and must then decide for themselves what they are to do it is a difficult question altogether the only thing that can at present be settled is that they mustnt be allowed to die of hunger and they must be protected against molestation  the troops will march at four oclock the egyptian brigade have volunteered to carry the wounded they will start later the women had better follow them no doubt some of them will find their husbands among the prisoners so that there will be no trouble about them  what will be done with the men sir  the general smiled  tomorrow they will probably enlist in our service to a man and will fight just as sturdily as the other soudanese battalions against their brethren in khartoum all the prisoners we have hitherto taken who are fit for the work have done so and as has been shown today are just as ready to fight on our side as they were against us they are a fighting people and it is curious how they become attached to their white officers whom formerly they hated as infidels  when the matter was explained to them the women accepted the situation with the resignation that is natural to the mahometan woman gregory was able to assure fatma that in a short time she would undoubtedly be allowed to join mahmud and accompany him wherever he was sent  but will they not kill him she said  we never kill prisoners even the bitterest enemy that may fall into our hands is well treated mahmud will doubtless be sent down to cairo and it will then be settled where he is to be taken to but you may be sure that wherever it may be he will be well treated and cared for  in that case i shall be happy she said when you saved me i saw that the ways of you christians were better than our ways now i see it still more to be always raiding and plundering and killing cannot be good it used to seem to me natural and right but i have come to think differently  at four oclock the troops marched at gregorys request he was allowed to remain behind and accompany the egyptians he had bought for a few shillings from the soldiers a dozen donkeys that had been found alive in some of the pits these he handed over to fatma for her conveyance and that of the wives of some of the emirs who were of the party  the egyptians started at halfpast eight carrying their own wounded and those of the british by the route by which the army had marched the night before the distance was but nine miles but there had been some rough places to pass and to avoid these where the wounded might have suffered from jolting they made a circuit thereby adding three miles to the length of the march and did not reach umdabieh camp until two oclock in the morning general hunter who never spared himself rode with them and acted as guide  during the fight he colonel macdonald and colonel maxwell had ridden at the head of their brigades the white regimental officers being on foot with the men as was their custom and it was surprising that the three conspicuous figures had all come through the storm of fire unscathed  the next morning was a quiet one and in the afternoon all marched off to the old camp at abadar on sunday they rested and on monday the british brigade marched to hudi and then across the desert to hermali where they were to spend the summer the sirdar rode with the egyptian brigades to fort atbara macdonalds brigade was to go on to garrison berber maxwells to assillem and that of lewis to remain at atbara  the question of the prisoners was already half solved almost all of them willingly embraced the offer to enlist in the egyptian army many of the women found their husbands among the prisoners others agreed at once to marry men of the soudanese battalion the rest pending such offers as they might receive in the future decided to remain at atbara at berber their lot would have been a hard one for they would have been exposed to the hatred and spite of the jaalin women there whose husbands had been massacred at metemmeh  fatma with two attendants only accompanied macdonalds brigade to berber on arriving outside the town the force encamped next day the sirdar with his staff and general hunter came up and on the following morning made a triumphant entry into the town followed by the soudanese brigade  berber was prepared to do honour to the occasion flags waved coloured cloths and womens garments hung from the windows and the whole population lined the streets and received the conquerors with cries of welcome and triumph they had anticipated a very different result and had fully expected that the army would have been wellnigh annihilated and that again the triumphant dervishes would become their masters but the sight of mahmud walking a prisoner with two guards on each side of him convinced them that the reports that had reached them were true that the dervishes had been signally defeated and that there was no fear of their ever again becoming lords of berber  the sirdar by whose side general hunter rode headed the procession followed by his staff then leading his brigade came macdonaldstern and hard of face burnt almost black with years of campaigning in the desertand his staff followed by the black battalions erect and proud maintaining their soldierly bearing amid the loud quavering cries of welcome from the women  gregory had on his arrival with the brigade the day before gone into the town and engaged a small house in its outskirts as the abode of fatma and her two attendants purchased suitable provisions and made what arrangements he could for her comfort late in the evening he had escorted her there and left zaki to sleep in an outhouse attached to it to secure them from all intrusion  then he went down to the river and finding the zafir lying there went on board he was received as one returned from the dead by captain keppel lieutenant beatty and lieutenant hoodthe commanders of the other gunboatswho had been dining on board he had become a general favourite during the time he had spent with them and their congratulations on his safe return were warm and hearty  you may imagine our surprise when after the fight was over said captain keppel it was discovered that you were missing no one could imagine what had become of you one of the blacks who had been working your maxim said they had not noticed your leaving them and that when they found you were not there they supposed you had come to confer with me then i sent for your man but he too was missing we searched everywhere but no signs of you dead or alive and no marks of blood were to be found so it seemed that the matter must remain a mystery early the next morning however we saw a white rag waving on the bank and then a black entered the water and swam out towards us i sent the boat to meet him and when he came on board i found that he was your man and the mystery was explained i fancy i used some strong language for i never before heard of a man being so harebrained as to spring overboard in the middle of a battle and pick up a woman without saying a word to anyone of what he was doing and that with the boat still steaming ahead of course your man told us that it was mahmuds wife you had saved and that she had taken you under her protection but i did not expect that among those fanatics your life would be spared  now tell us all about your adventures and how you got down here just in time to see our fellows enter in triumph i suppose you managed to give them the slip somehow  gregory then told his story when he had concluded captain keppel said  well you have the luck of the old one first you have got hold of as faithful a fellow as is to be found in all egypt or anywhere else and in the second place you have been in the battle of atbara while we have been kicking our heels here and fuming at being out of it altogether except for our bloodless capture of shendy  so you say the sirdar blew you up i am not surprised at that you know the story of the man who fell overboard in the old flogging days and the captain sentenced him to two dozen lashes for leaving the ship without orders  i dont think he was really angry for when i went to him the next evening he was a good deal milder of course he did say again that i had done wrong but not in the same tone as before and he seemed a good deal interested in what i told him about mahmud and how my boy had risked his life to rescue me and had succeeded almost by a miracle he said there is a lot of good in these black fellows if one could but get at it they have never had a chance yet but given good administration and the suppression of all tribal feuds with a stern hand they might be moulded into anything  and are you coming back to us now mr hilliard  i have no idea i dont suppose anything will be settled for a time there is not likely to be much doing anyway except on the railway and even your gunboats will have an easy time of it as there is not an enemy left on this side of the sixth cataract  the dervishes who escaped are pretty sure to cross the atbara there are enough of them still when they rally to beat off any attacks that might be made by our tribesmen from kassala    chapter 13 the final advance   a few days after the return of headquarters to berber mahmud was sent down country and fatma was permitted to accompany him she expressed to gregory in touching terms her gratitude for what he had done for her  we have been of mutual assistance said gregory i have the same reason to be grateful to you as you have to thank me i saved your life and you saved mine you were very kind to me when i was a captivei have done as much as i could for you since you have been with us so we are quits i hope you will be happy with mahmud we do not treat our prisoners badly and except that he will be away from the soudan he will probably be more comfortable than he has ever been in his life  gregory was now employed in the transport department and journeyed backwards and forwards with large convoys of camels to the head of the railway the line was completed to berber but the officers charged with its construction were indefatigable and as fast as the materials came up it was pushed on towards the atbara complete as had been the victory on that river the sirdar saw that the force which had been sufficient to defeat the twenty thousand men under mahmud was not sufficiently strong for the more onerous task of coping with three times that number fighting under the eye of the khalifa and certain to consist of his best and bravest troops he therefore telegraphed home for another british brigade and additional artillery with at least one regiment of cavalryan arm in which the egyptian army was weak  preparations were at once made for complying with the request the 21st lancers 1st battalion of grenadier guards 2nd battalion of the rifle brigade 2nd battalion of the 5th lancashire fusiliers a field battery a howitzer battery and two fortypounders to batter the defences of omdurman should the khalifa take his stand were sent a strong detachment of the army service corps and the royal army medical corps was to accompany them but they had yet some months to wait for the advance would not be made until the nile was full and the gunboats could ascend the cataract  however there was much to be done and the troops did not pass the time in idleness atbara fort was to be the base and here the egyptian battalions built huts and storehouses the soudanese brigades returned to berber and the transport of provisions and stores for them was thus saved the british at darmali were made as comfortable as possible and no effort was spared to keep them in good health during the ensuing hot weather a small theatre was constructed and here smoking concerts were held there was also a race meeting and one of the steamers took parties of the men who were most affected by the heat for a trip down the nile they were practised in long marches early in the morning and although of course there was some illness the troops on the whole bore the heat well  had there been a prospect of an indefinitely long stay the result might have been otherwise but they knew that in a few months they would be engaged in even sterner work than the last battle that khartoum was their goal and with its capture the power of the khalifa would be broken for ever and gordon avenged  early in april the railway reached abadia a few miles from berber and in a short time a wonderful transformation took place here from a sandy desert with scarce a human being in sight it became the scene of a busy industry stores were sorted and piled as they came up by rail  three gunboats arrived in sections and these were put together they were stronger and much better defended by steel plates than the first gunboats and each of them carried two sixpounder quickfiring guns a small howitzer four maxims and a searchlight they were however much slower than the old boats and could do very little in the way of towing  besides these eight steel doubledeck troop barges were brought up in sections and put together three egyptian battalions came up from merawi to aid in the work which not only included building the gunboats and barges but executing the repairs to all the native craft and putting them in a thoroughly serviceable state  in june the railway reached the atbara and for the first time for two years and a half the officers who had superintended its construction had a temporary rest the stores were now transferred from abadia to the atbara and two trains ran every day each bringing up something like two hundred tons of stores  in the middle of july two egyptian battalions left atbara and proceeded up the nile one on each bank cutting down trees and piling them for fuel for the steamers as the river rose four steamers came up from dongola together with a number of sailing boats and in the beginning of august the whole flotilla consisting of ten gunboats five unarmed steamers eight troop barges and three or four hundred sailing boats were all assembled  by this time the reinforcements from home were all at cairo and their stores had already been sent up it was arranged that they were to come by half battalions by squadrons and by batteries each one day behind the other to make room for them two egyptian battalions were sent up to the foot of the shabluka cataract  the six black battalions left berber on july 30th and arrived at atbara the next day there were now four brigades in the infantry divisions instead of three two battalions having been raised from the dervishes taken at the battle of atbara these were as eager as any to join in the fight against their late comrades  this was scarcely surprising the baggara the tyrants of the desert are horsemen the infantry were for the most part drawn from the conquered tribes they had enlisted in the khalifas force partly because they had no other means of subsistence partly from their innate love of fighting they had in fact been little better than slaves and their condition as soldiers in the egyptian army was immeasurably superior to that which they had before occupied  broadwood with nine squadrons of egyptian cavalry was already on the western bank of the river opposite atbara and was to be joined at metemmeh by the camel corps and another squadron of horse from merawi  on the 3rd of august the six soudanese battalions left fort atbara for the point of concentration a few miles below the cataract to the sides of each gunboat were attached two of the steel barges behind each were two native craft all were filled as tightly as they could be crammed with troops they were packed as in slavers squatting by the side of each other as closely as sardines in a box the seven steamers and the craft they took with them contained six thousand men so crowded that a spectator remarked that planks might have been laid on their heads and that you could have walked about on them while another testified that he could not have shoved a walking stick between them anywhere white men could not have supported it for an hour but these blacks and egyptians had a hundred miles to go and the steamers could not make more than a knot an hour against the rapid stream now swollen to its fullest  while they were leaving the first four companies of the rifle brigade arrived every day boats laden with stores went forward every day white troops came up vast as was the quantity of stores sent off the piles at atbara did not seem to diminish ninety days provisions forage and necessaries for the whole force had been accumulated there and as fast as these were taken away they were replaced by others from berber  like everyone connected with the transport or store department gregory had to work from daybreak till dark accustomed to a warm climate light in figure without an ounce of spare flesh he was able to support the heat dust and fatigue better than most and as he himself said it was less trying to be at work even in the blazing sun than to lie listless and sweating under the shade of a blanket there was no necessity now to go down the line to make enquiries as to the progress of the stores or of the laden craft on their way up the telegraph was established and the sirdar at atbara knew the exact position of every one of the units between cairo and himself and from every station he received messages constantly and despatched his orders as frequently  there was no hitch whatever the arrangements were all so perfect that the vast machine with its numerous parts moved with the precision of clockwork everything was up to time for a train or steamer or even a native boat to arrive half an hour after the time calculated for it was almost unheard of  the sirdars force of will seemed to communicate itself to every officer under him and it is safe to say that never before was an expedition so perfectly organized and so marvellously carried out at atbara the sirdar saw to everything himself a brief word of commendation to those working under him cheered them through long days of toilan equally curt reproof depressed them to the depths  twice when gregory was directing some of the blacks piling large cases as they were emptied from the train anathematizing the stupid urging on the willing and himself occasionally lending a hand in order to show how it should be done the sirdar who unknown to him had been looking on rode up and said shortly you are doing well mr hilliardand he felt that his offence of jumping overboard had been condoned  general hunter himself indefatigable had more occasion to notice gregorys work and his commendations were frequent and warm  the lad had not forgotten the object with which he had come to the front after atbara he had questioned many of the prisoners who from their age might have fought at el obeid but none of these had done so the forces of the khalifa came and went as there was occasion for them the baggara were always under arms but only when danger threatened were the great levies of foot assembled for it would have been impossible in the now desolate state of the soudan to find food for an army of a hundred thousand men  all agreed however that with the exception of the egyptian artillerymen they heard that no single white man had escaped numbers of the black soldiers had been made slaves the whites had perishedall save one had fallen on the field that one had accompanied a black battalion who had held together and repulsing all attacks had marched away they had been followed however and after repeated attacks had dwindled away until they had finally been broken and massacred  with the khalifas army were several emirs who had fought at el obeid and these would no doubt be able to tell him more but none of those who were taken prisoners at the atbara had heard of any white man having escaped the slaughter of hickss army  just as the general movement began the force was joined by three companies of soudanese these had marched from suakim to berber two hundred and eightyeight miles in fifteen days an average of nineteen miles a daya record for such a march and one that no european force could have performed one day after marching thirty miles they came to a well and found it dry and had to march thirty miles farther to another water hole a feat probably altogether without precedent  you had better fall back upon your old work hilliard the general said the day before they started as my aide i shall find plenty for you to do now that i command the whole division  thank you very much sir i dont think that i shall find any work hard after what i have been doing for the past four months  you have got your horse  yes he is in good condition for i have had no riding to do for some time  well you had better get him on board one of the gyasses we shall tow up tomorrow all our horses will embark this evening we shall be on board at daybreak our private camels are going with the marching column you had better put yours with them no doubt they will join us somewhere of course your kit will be carried with us  it was a delight to gregory to be on the water again there was generally a cool breeze on the river and always an absence of dust he was now halfway between seventeen and eighteen but the sun had tanned him to a deep brown and had parched his face thus adding some years to his appearance so that the subalterns of the newlyarrived regiments looked boyish beside him the responsibilities of his work had steadied him and though he retained his good spirits his laugh had lost the old boyish ring the title of bimbashi which had seemed absurd to him seven months before was now nothing out of the way for he looked as old as many of the british subalterns serving with that rank in the egyptian army  returning to the little hut that zaki with the aid of some of the blacks had built for him he gave his orders and in a short time the camela very good one which he had obtained in exchange for that which he had handed over to the transportstarted with its driver to join those that were to carry up the baggage and stores of general hunter and his staff these were in charge of a sergeant and three privates of one of the soudanese battalions gregory had got up a case of whisky one of bottled fruit and a stock of tea and sugar from berber no tents could be carried and he left his tente dabri at the stores with his canteen taking on board in his own luggage a plate knife fork and spoon and a couple of tumblers when the camels had started he saw his horse put on board and then took a final stroll round the encampment  the change that had occurred there during the past fortnight was striking then none but black faces could be seen now it was the encampment of a british force with its white tents and all their belongings  the contrast between the newlyarrived brigade and the hardy veterans who had fought at the atbara was striking bronzed and hearty inured to heat and fatigue the latter looked fit to go anywhere and do anything and there was hardly a sick man in the four regiments on the other hand the newcomers looked white and exhausted with the heat numbers had already broken down and the doctors at the hospital had their hands full of fever patients they had scarcely marched a mile since they landed in egypt and were so palpably unfit for hard work that they were if possible to proceed the whole way in boats in order to be in fighting condition when the hour of battle arrived  the voyage up the river was an uneventful one it seemed all too short to gregory who enjoyed immensely the rest quiet and comparative coolness the sirdar had gone up a week before they landed at wady hamed here the whole egyptian portion of the army with the exception of the brigade that was to arrive the next day was assembled the blacks had constructed straw huts the egyptians erected shelters extemporized from their blankets while the british were to be installed in tents which had been brought up in sailing boats the camp was two miles in length and half a mile wide surrounded by a strong zareba  the egyptian cavalry and the camel corps had arrived on the opposite side of the river was a strong body of friendly arabs nominally under the abadar sheik but in reality commanded by major montague stuartwortley by the 23rd of august the whole force had arrived and the sirdar reviewed them drawn up in battle array and put them through a few manoeuvres as if in action general gatacre commanded the british divisioncolonel wauchope the first brigade and lyttleton the second as before macdonald maxwell and lewis commanded the first three egyptian brigades and collinson that newly raised general hunter being in command of the division  the force numbered in all about twenty thousand and although destitute of the glitter and colour of a british army under ordinary circumstances were as fine a body of men as a british general could wish to command and all alike eager to meet the foe the british division had with them two batteries and ten maxims and the egyptian division five batteries and ten maxims  as gregory was strolling through the camp he passed where the officers of one of the british regiments were seated on boxes round a rough table over which a sort of awning had been erected  come and join us hilliard we are having our last feast on our last stores which we got smuggled up in one of the gunboats the major called out  with pleasure sir  the officer who was sitting at the head of the table made room beside him  you men of the egyptian army fare a good deal better than we do i think the major went on that institution of private camels is an excellent one we did not know that they would be allowed but after all it is not a bad thing that we did not have them for there is no doubt it is as well that the soldiers should not see us faring better than they there is bother enough with the baggage as it is of course it is different in your case there are only two or three white officers with each battalion and it would not strike your black troops as a hardship that you should have different food from themselves they are living as well as or better than they ever did in their lives three camels make no material addition to your baggage train while as there are thirty or forty of us it would make a serious item in ours and the generals keen eyes would spot them at once  our camels are no burden to the army gregory said they only have a few pounds of grain a day and get their living principally on what they can pick up when they go on now they will each carry fifty pounds of private grain they get five pounds when there are no bushes or grass so that the grain will last them for a fortnight  i suppose you think that the dervishes mean fighting  i think there is no doubt about it all the fugitives that come in say that the khalifa will fight but whether it will be in the defence of omdurman or whether he will come out and attack us at kerreri none can say the khalifa keeps his intentions to himself  by the bye hilliard i dont think you know my righthand neighbour he only joined us an hour before we started having been left behind at cairo sick  mr hartley let me introduce you to mr hilliardi should say bimbashi hilliard he is on general hunters staff  the young lieutenant placed an eyeglass in his eye and bowed to gregory  have you been in this beastly country long he asked  if you include lower egypt i have been here eighteen years  dear me the other drawled the climate seems to have agreed with you  fairly well gregory replied i dont mind the heat much and one doesnt feel it while one is at work  hartley has not tried that yet one of the others laughed work is not in his line this most unfortunate illness of his kept him back at cairo and he brought such a supply of ice with him when he came up that he was able to hand over a hundredweight of it to us when he arrived i dont think major that in introducing him you should have omitted to mention that but for a temporary misfortune he would be the marquis of langdale but in another two years he will blossom out into his full title and then i suppose we shall lose him  gregory whose knowledge of the english peerage was extremely limited looked puzzled  may i ask how that is he said i always thought that the next heir to a title succeeded to it as soon as his father died  as a rule that is the case the major said but the present is an exceptional one at the death of the late marquis the heir to the title was missing i may say that the late marquis only enjoyed the title for two years the next of kin a brother of his had disappeared and up to the present no news has been obtained of him of course he has been advertised for and so on but without success it is known that he married but as he did so against the wish of his father he broke off all communication with his family and it is generally supposed that he emigrated pending any news of him the title is held in abeyance  he may have died it is probable that he has done so for he could hardly have escaped seeing the advertisements that were inserted in every paper of course if he has left children they inherit the title  after a lapse of five years mr hartleys father who was the next heir and who died five years ago applied to be declared the inheritor of the title but the peers or judges or someone decided that twentyone years must elapse before such an application could be even considered the income has been accumulating ever since so that at the end of that time it is probable that mr hartley will be allowed to assume the title  will the estates go with the title hartley  oh i should say so of course the other drawled the title would not be of much use without them  nonsense my dear fellow another said why a fellow with your personal advantage and a title would be able to command the american market and to pick up an heiress with millions  the general laugh that followed showed that hartley was by no means a popular character in the regiment  the fellow is a consummate ass the man on gregorys left whispered he only got into the service as a queens cadet he could no more have got in by marks than he could have flown no one believes that he had anything the matter with him at cairo but he preferred stopping behind and coming up by himself without any duties to taking any share in the work he is always talking about his earldomthat is why the major mentioned it so as to draw him out  but i suppose he is really heir to it  yes if no one else claims it for aught that is known there may be half a dozen children of the man that is missing knocking about somewhere in canada or australia if so they are safe to turn up sooner or later you see as the man had an elder brother he would not have counted at all upon coming to the title he may be in some outoftheway place where even a colonial newspaper would never reach him but sooner or later he or some of his sons will be coming home and will hear of the last earls death and then this fellows nose will be put out of joint  i am sure everyone in the regiment would be glad for he is an insufferable ass i suppose when he comes into the title he will either cut the army altogether or exchange into the guards  the party presently broke up having finished the last bottle of wine they had brought up gregory remained seated by the major discussing the chances of the campaign and the points where resistance might be expected the other officers stood talking a short distance off presently gregory caught the words  how is it that this young fellow calls himself bimbashi which i believe means major  he does not call himself that although that is his rank all the white officers in the egyptian army have that rank though they may only be lieutenants in ours  i call it a monstrous thing the drawling voice then said that a young fellow like this who seems to be an egyptian by birth should have a higher rank than men here who have served fifteen or twenty years  the major got up and walked across to the group  i will tell you why mr hartley he said in a loud voice it is because for the purpose of the war in this country they know infinitely more than the officers of our army they talk the languages they know the men these blacks will follow them anywhere to the death as for mr hilliard he has performed feats that any officer in the army whatever his rank would be proud to have done he went in disguise into the dervish camp at metemmeh before hunters advance began and obtained invaluable information he jumped overboard from a gunboat to save a drowning dervish woman although to do so involved almost certain capture and death at the hands of the dervishes in point of fact his escape was a remarkable one for he was tied to a tree in the first line of the dervish defences at atbara and was only saved by what was almost a miracle he may not be heir to an earldom mr hartley but he would do more credit to the title than many i could name i hear him well spoken of by everyone as an indefatigable worker and as having performed the most valuable services captain keppel on whose gunboat he served for two or three months spoke to me of him in the highest terms and general hunter has done the same  i fancy sir that it will be some years before you are likely to distinguish yourself so highly his father was an officer who fell in battle and if he happened to be born in egypt as you sneeringly said just now all i can say is that in my opinion had you been born in egypt you would not occupy the position which he now does  gregory had walked away when the major rose and he did not return to the party it was the first time that he had run across a bad specimen of the british officer and his words had stung him but as he said to himself he need not mind them as the fellows own comrades regarded him as one of them said as an insufferable ass still he could not help wishing to himself that the missing heir might turn up in time to disappoint him  general hunter started next day at noon with two of his brigades and the mounted troops the other two brigades following at nightfall the previous night had been one of the most unpleasant gregory had ever spent the longexpected rain had come at last it began suddenly there was a flash of lightning and then came a violent burst of wind which tore down the tents and the flimsy shelters of the egyptians and soudanese before this had ceased the rain poured down in a torrent lightning wind and rain kept on till morning and when the start was made everyone was soaked to the skin the egyptian baggage left at the same time in native craft  that evening they arrived at the mouth of the shabluka cataract here it had been expected that the advance would be opposed as strong forts had been erected by the enemy the river narrowed greatly and precipitous rocks rose on either side through these the course was winding and the current ran with great strength the eddies and sharp bends making it extremely difficult for the gunboats to keep their course indeed it would have been impossible for them to get up had the forts been manned as they would have had to pass within two hundred yards of the guns but although the forts could hardly have been attacked by the gunboats they were commanded by a lofty hill behind them and the scouts had discovered some weeks before that the dervishes had retired from the position and that the passage would be unopposed  maxwells and colvilles brigades started at four that afternoon and the next day the whole division was established at el hejir above the cataracts  lyttletons brigade started at five oclock am on the 25th the gunboats and other steamers moving parallel with them along the river at five in the afternoon the first brigade followed and two days afterwards the camp was entirely evacuated and the whole of the stores well on their way towards el hejir on the previous day two regiments of wortleys column of friendly natives also marched south the sirdar and headquarters after having seen everything off went up in a gunboat starting at nine in the morning  as usual the soudanese troops had been accompanied by a considerable number of their wives who were heavily laden with their little household goods and in many cases babies they trudged patiently along in the rear of the columns and formed an encampment of their own half a mile away from the mens generally selecting a piece of ground surrounded by thick bush into which they could escape should dervish raiders come down upon them  the stores arrived in due course one of the gunboats however was missingthe zafir with three gyasses in tow having suddenly sunk ten miles north of shendy owing to being so deeply loaded that the water got into the hold those on board had just time to scramble into the boats or swim to shore no lives were lost though there were many narrow escapes among these were commander keppel and prince christian victor who were on board fortunately another steamer soon came along and took the gyasses with the shipwrecked officers and crew on board and towed them up to el hejir  it had been intended to stay here some little time but the nile continued to rise to an altogether exceptional height and part of the camp was flooded at five oclock therefore the egyptian brigades started with the guns on their right and the steamers covering their left while the cavalry and camel corps were spread widely out in advance to give notice of any approaching dervish force as usual the soldiers wives turned out and as the battalions marched past shouted encouragement to their husbands calling upon them to behave like men and not to turn back in battle the presence of the women had an excellent effect on the soldiers and in addition to their assistance in carrying their effects they cooked their rations and looked after them generally the sirdar therefore did not discourage their presence in the field and even supplied them with rations when it was impossible for them to obtain them elsewhere  in the afternoon the two white brigades also moved forward at nine oclock they arrived at their camping ground and the whole army was again collected together next morning the four squadrons of egyptian horse with a portion of the cavalry went forward to reconnoitre and one of the gunboats proceeded a few miles up the river neither saw anything of the enemy  there had been heavy rain during the night this had ceased at daybreak and a strong wind speedily dried the sands raising such clouds of dust that it was difficult to see above a few yards the storm had also the effect of hindering the flotilla  on the other side of the river stuartwortleys friendlies had a sharp brush with some dervishes whom they had come upon raiding a village whose inhabitants had not obeyed the khalifas orders to move into omdurman  as the rainstorms continued it was decided by a council of war that the health of the troops would suffer by a longer stay on the 29th therefore the army set out in order of battle ready to encounter the khalifas attack but arrived without molestation at um teref a short distance from kerreri where it was expected the enemy would give battle  the camp was smaller than those hitherto made and was protected by a strong zareba the sentries were doubled and patrols thrown out heavy rain set in after sunset and almost a deluge poured down the tents had been left behind and as the little blanket shelters were soon soaked through their occupants were speedily wet to the skin  it was still raining when at halfpast five the force again started as before the army was marching in fighting order the day was cool and cloudy and at one oclock they halted at a village called merreh or seg the cavalry had come into touch with the dervish patrols but the latter although numerous avoided combat  in one of the deserted villages was found one of wingates spies in dervish attire he had left omdurman thirty hours before and brought the news that the khalifa intended to attack at kerreri this place had been chosen because there was current an old prophecy by a persian sheik to the effect that english soldiers would one day fight at kerreri and be destroyed there it had therefore become an almost holy place to the mahdists and was called the death place of all the infidels and once a year the khalifa and his followers made a pilgrimage to it  a few shots were fired during the night and fires blazed on the hills to notify to omdurman our precise position the troops started again soon after daylight facing now to the right and marching westward to leave the bush and broken ground and get out in the open desert stretching away to omdurman the cavalry were widely spread out and the lancers ascended to the top of the hill of el teb from which a view of the dervish camp was obtained  it lay some ten miles due south the dervishes were disposed in three long lines stretching from within two thousand yards of the nile out into the desert being careful to get as they believed beyond the range of the four gunboats that steamed quietly up  after a short march the force halted near the river two miles north of kerreri the place was convenient for camping but the banks of the river were steep and there was much difficulty in watering the horses and transport animals  we are in for another bad night one of the generals staff said to gregory as the evening approached  it looks like it clouds are banking up fast if the rain would but come in the daytime instead of at night one would not object to it much it would lay the dust and cool the air besides on the march we have other things to think of and though of course we should be drenched to the skin we should not mind it but it is very unpleasant lying in a pool of water with streams running in at ones neck  as to ones blanket it is like a sponge five minutes after the rain begins the officer said  i am better off in that respect gregory remarked for when i left my little tent behind i kept a waterproof sheet instead of my second blanket i had intended to use it tent fashion but it was blown down in a minute after the first storm burst now i stand up wrap my blanket tightly round me while my boy does the same with the waterproof sheet and i keep moderately dry except that the water will trickle in at the end near my neck but on the other hand the wrapping keeps me so hot that i might almost as well lie uncovered in the rain  the staff had intended taking a few tents with them but these were practically of no use at all as all canvas had to be lowered by the time that lights out sounded and after that hour no loud talking was permitted in the camp this might have been a privation had the weather been fine but even the most joyous spirit had little desire for conversation when the rain was falling in bucketfuls over him  the officers of the white division lay down by their men in the position they would occupy if an attack by the enemy took place the officers of the egyptian regiments lay together just in rear of their men as soon as the last post sounded absolute silence reigned the sentries placed a very short distance out kept their senses of sight and hearing on the alert and with eye and ear strove to detect the approach of a lurking foe jaalin scouts were stationed outside the zareba so as to give an early warning of the approach of the enemy but no reliance could be placed upon them for altogether without discipline they would probably creep under bushes and endeavour to find some shelter from the pitiless downpour  had the khalifa known his business he would have taken advantage of the tempestuous night and launched his warriors at the camp confident as the officers of the expedition were in the ability of their men to repulse any assault that might be made in the daylight it was felt that such an attack would cause terrible loss and possibly grave disaster if delivered at night the enemy might not be discovered until within a few yards of the camp the swish of the rain and the almost incessant crash of thunder would deaden the sound of their approach and long before the troops could leap to their feet and prepare to receive them calmly the dervishes would be upon them as the latter were enormously stronger in numbers the advantage of superior weapons would be lost in a handtohand fight and in the inevitable confusion as the troops in reserve would be unable to open fire while ignorant of the precise position of friends and foes  the khalifa however was relying upon prophecy it was at kerreri that the infidel army was to be utterly destroyed and he may have thought that it would be tempting fate were he to precipitate an action before the invaders reached the spot where their doom had been pronounced  even more miserable than night was the hour before dawn lying still drenched to the skin as they were nature prevailed and the men obtained some sleep but when they rose to their feet and threw off the sodden blankets they felt the full misery of eight hours drenching they were cold now as well as wet and as they endeavoured to squeeze the water from their clothes and to restore circulation by swinging their arms but few words were spoken and the rising of the sun which was regarded as a terrible infliction during the day was eagerly looked for no sooner did it appear above the horizon than the spirits of the men rose rapidly and they laughed joked and made light of the inconveniences of the situation  an hour later their clothes were nearly dry by that time they were all well on their way the brigades as before marching in echelonwauchopes brigade on the left lyttletons farther to the right but more to the rear the three egyptian brigades farther out on the plain the 21st lancers scouting the ground in front of the british division and the native cavalry and camel corps out beyond the right of the egyptians  all expected that at least they should have a skirmish before they reached kerreri where they were to encamp but as they advanced it was found that the dervishes had fallen back from that line and had joined the khalifas main force near omdurman  by ten in the morning the army had arrived at its camping place which was in the southern part of the ground occupied by the straggling village as usual both extremities of the line rested on the nile forming a semicircle in which the baggage animals and stores were placed in charge of collinsons brigade the gunboats took up their position to cover the ground over which an enemy must approach to the attack  while the infantry were settling down the cavalry and camel corps went out scouting signallers soon mounted a rugged hill named surgham and from here a fine view was obtained of omdurman and the khalifas army omdurman was six miles away covering a wide tract of ground with but few buildings rising above the general level the one conspicuous object being the great tomb of the mahdi with its white dome  in the outskirts of the town were the white tents of the dervish army for the present these were unoccupied the whole force being drawn up in regular line out on the plain about halfway between the town and surgham hill it was formed in five divisions each of which was bright with banners of all colours sizes and shapes the khalifas own division was in the centre where his great black banner waving from a lofty flagstaff could be plainly made out  the lancers egyptian cavalry and camel corps continued to advance capturing several parties of footmen principally jaalins who probably lagged purposely behind the retiring dervishes in order to be taken at times the cavalry attempted to charge the dervish horsemen when these approached but in no case did the latter await the attack  presently above the occasional musketry fire came the boom of a heavy gun there was a thrill of excitement in the camp the gunboats had arrived opposite omdurman and had opened fire upon the dervish riverside forts these were strongly constructed but as in the forts at metemmeh and shabluka the embrasures were so faultily constructed that the guns could only be brought to bear upon the portion of the river directly facing them and the four gunboats passed them without receiving any material damage and were so able to maintain the bombardment without receiving any fire in return at the same time they landed the fortypounder guns on an island but a short distance from the town and thence opened fire with lyddite shells upon it the howitzers were trained upon the mahdis tomb and soon great holes were knocked in the dome  it could be seen from the top of the hill that this caused great excitement in the dervish lines and a number of their horsemen rode out against the lancers and drove in their advance scouts but on the main body of the regiment moving forward they fell back to their line and almost immediately a heavy body of infantry moved out their intention evidently being to surround and cut off the regiment while at the same time a general advance took place the colonel of the lancers dismounted a portion of his men and these checked the advance of the enemy until the rest fell back  the news of the advance was signalled to general kitchener and the whole force at once took their position in fighting order believing that a general attack on the camp would now be made the cavalry fell back on either flank so as to clear the way for the fire of the artillery and infantry  the dervishes had a good view of our camp from the top of surgham but the khalifa apparently considered that it was too late in the day for a general attack and drew off his men to their former position and the rest of the afternoon and evening passed quietly as the men ate their meal of tinned meat and biscuit they were in higher spirits than they had been since the advance began hitherto they had been in constant apprehension lest the dervishes should shun a battle and would retire across the desert to el obeid or elsewhere and that they would have to perform interminable desert marches only to find on arriving at the goal that the enemy had again moved off the events of the day however seemed to show that this fear was groundless and that the khalifa had determined to fight a decisive battle for the defence of his capital  the british soldier is ready to support any fatigue and any hardship with a prospect of a fight at the end and during the advance he is always haunted by the fear that the enemy will retire or give in on his approach this fear was stronger than usual on this expedition for there was no question as to the greatly superior mobility of the dervishes and it was evident that if they chose to avoid fighting they had it in their power to do so    chapter 14 omdurman   the night passed quietly except that shots were occasionally fired by dervishes who crept up within range and that once a mounted man who had apparently lost his way rode fearlessly into camp and then finding himself close to the troops turned his horse and galloped off again no shot followed him as the orders were strict that the camp was not to be alarmed unless in the case of a serious attack  at half past three the bugle sounded and the troops were soon astir the animals were watered and fed and the men had a breakfast of cocoa or tea with biscuits and tinned meat at half past four colonel broadwood commanding the egyptian cavalry sent out a squadron to the hills on the west and another to surgham hill  the latter arrived at their destination at two minutes past five when daylight had just broken the officer in command saw at once that the dervish army had been reinforced in the night and were marching to attack us news was at once sent back to the camp where all was in readiness for an advance  no news could have been more welcome it was one thing to attack the dervishes in their chosen position and to carry the narrow streets of omdurman at the point of the bayonetthe dervishes had shown at abu hamed how desperately they could fight under such circumstancesand another to meet them while attacking our position in the open this was protected along the line occupied by the white troops by a hedge while the three egyptian brigades had constructed shelter trenches these afforded a vastly better defence against a foe advancing by daylight although they would not be so effective in checking a sudden and determined rush in the darkness  preparations were at once made to oppose the enemy the sirdar and his staff were already mounting when the news arrived the horses were now taken to the rear the reserve ammunition boxes lifted from the mules backs and the animals led to a sheltered position behind some huts  the guns were wheeled up into positions between the infantry brigades the troops were disposed in line two deep two companies of each battalion with the stretchers and bearers taking post at a short distance farther back to reinforce the front line if hardly pressed and to supply it from the reserve store of ammunition  already the gunboats had recommenced the bombardment of omdurman and the mosque of the mahdi but as soon as news came that the dervishes were advancing to the attack they were signalled to return to cover the flank of the zareba on their arrival they took up a position whence they could shell the line by which the dervishes were advancing and which would bring them apparently five or six hundred yards west of surgham hill  the lancers at once started forward to cover the left flank of the position in a few minutes they reached surgham hill and joined the egyptian squadron there  the sight from the crest of surgham hill was grand the enemys front extended over three miles the lines were deep and compact and the banners floated above them they were advancing steadily and in good order and their battle cries rose and fell in measured cadence their numbers were variously estimated at from fifty to seventy thousanda superb force consisting of men as brave as any in the world and animated by religious fanaticism and an intense hatred of those they were marching to assail  in the centre were the khalifas own corps twenty thousand strong on their right was the banner of yacoub his brother and beyond two divisions led by wellknown emirs while on his left was the division led by his son osman known as sheik ed din the nominal commanderinchief of the whole force  the 21st lancers out in skirmishing order were speedily driven back by the dervishes and retired into the zareba when the latter came near enough to see the small british force a shout of exultation rose from their ranks for they felt certain now of surrounding and annihilating the infidels according to the prophecy  on our side the satisfaction was no less marked the front line moved forward to the thorny hedge and prepared to open fire above it the black troops uttered a joyful shout of defiance as they took their places in their trenches  when the enemy were two thousand eight hundred yards away the three batteries on the left of the zareba opened fire and two batteries on the right and a number of maxims joined in pouring shell and bullets into the thickest of the dervish mass round the khalifas banner the effect was terrible for a moment the dervish lines halted astonished at the storm to which they were exposed but it was only for a moment the wide gaps were filled up and at a quicker pace than before the great line swept on the banner bearers and baggara horsemen pushing forward to the front to encourage the infantry  seeing how persistently they were coming on the sirdar ordered the men of lyttletons brigade to open fire at long range the grenadiers were the first to begin firing volleys in sections the other regiments of the brigade were soon hard at it but neither they nor the maxims appeared to be doing serious execution while the terrible effect of the shell fire could really be seen but although great numbers of the enemy were killed or wounded by the bursting shells there was no halt in the forward movement  suddenly over the crest and sides of the surgham hill the division of the dervish right reinforced by a portion of yacoubs division appeared and over fifteen thousand men came streaming down the hill waving banners and shouting their war cries they were led by their emirs on horseback but the infantry kept pace with these occasionally discharging their rifles at random  the guns of the three batteries and one of the maxims were swung round and opened upon them they were less than a mile away and the whole of gatacres division opened a terrific fire still the dervishes held on leaving the ground they passed over white with fallen men from seventeen hundred yards the sights had to be lowered rapidly but at a thousand yards they held their foe no man could cross the ground swept by the hail of balls so rapid and sustained was the fire that men had to retire to refill their pouches from the reserve ammunition and the rifles were so heated that they could no longer be held in some cases the men changed their weapons for those of the companies in reserve in others these companies closed up and took the places of the front line not for a moment was there any cessation in the fire  unable to do more yacoubs men moved towards the front and joined the main body whose advance had been checked by the fire of maxwells egyptian brigade a few rounds had been fired by the three cannon that the khalifa had brought out with him but they all fell short  on our side the casualties had been few in their desperate attempt to get at close quarters the dervish riflemen had not stopped to reload the weapons they had discharged and there was practically no return to the awful fire to which they had been exposed  but while yacoubs force had been terribly punished and the main body brought to a standstill at a distance of fourteen hundred yards had suffered almost as heavily the battle had not gone so well to the right of our position towards which the khalifa was now moving broadwoods horse and the camel corps had been driven off the hill they occupied and so fierce was the attack that three of the guns of the horse battery had to be left behind the camel corps were ordered to retire rapidly and make for shelter to the right rear of the camp the force made two or three stands and the egyptian cavalry more than once charged the pursuing horsemen the gunboats opened fire and covered the final retirement of the camel corps which had lost eighty men  the cavalry did not retire to the zareba but continued to fall back occasionally turning and facing the enemy until they were five miles away when the dervishes gave up the pursuit and sat down to rest after their tremendous exertions although forced to retire the cavalry had done good service for they had drawn off a great body of the enemy at a critical moment and these were unable to return and take part in the battle still raging  at length the khalifa moved off with all his force behind the western hills and for a short time there was a lull in the battle many of the wounded tribesmen crawled up to within seven or eight hundred yards of the zareba and there opened fire their aim was good and men began to drop fast in spite of the volleys fired to clear off the troublesome foe but their fire was soon disregarded for from the ravines in the range of low hills behind which the khalifas force had disappeared a mass of men burst out at a hard run from their shelter behind surgham hill a portion of the force who were there also swept down to join the khalifa while yacoub advanced from the southwest and another body from the west  instantly the infantry and artillery fire broke out again on the previous day the distance had been measured and marked on several conspicuous objects and the storm of shells tore the ranks of the enemy and the rifles swept them with a rain of bullets but in face of all this the dervishes continued to advance at a run their numbers thinning every minute  two or three hundred horsemen with their emirs dashed at the zareba at full gallop shrapnel maxim and rifle bullets swept their ranks but nearer and nearer they came with lessening numbers every yard until the last of them fell within about two hundred yards of maxwells line animated by the example the infantry rushed forward the black flag was planted within nine hundred yards of maxwells left but in addition to the egyptian fire the crossfire of the british divisions poured upon those around it  the main body began to waver but the khalifa and his emirs did their best to encourage and rally them the flag was riddled with balls and the men who held it were shot down but others seized the post of honour until a pile of bodies accumulated round it  at last but one man remained standing there for a minute he stood quietly immovable then fell forward dead then the dervishes lost heart and began to fall back in ones and twos then in dozens until the last had disappeared behind the hills  the troops then turned their attention to the men who lying in shelter were still maintaining their fire there were fully a thousand of these and the greater portion of our casualties took place from their fire while the troops were occupied in repelling the main attack it was not long however before bullets and shell proved too much for them and those who survived crawled away to join their kinsmen behind the hills  it was eight oclock now and the victory had apparently been won some ten thousand of the khalifas best troops had been killed or wounded in the british division one officer and one man had been killed and three officers and sixtyfive men wounded the latter were at once placed on board the hospital barges fresh ammunition was served out and half an hour after the last shot was fired the army prepared to march on omdurman  it was most important that they should arrive at the town before ed dins dervishes should reach it for unless they could do so the loss that would be incurred in capturing it would be vastly greater than that which had been suffered in the battle at nine oclock the start was made the troops advanced in brigades lyttleton led on the left wauchope was on his right maxwell somewhat in the rear while still more to the right came lewis and farther out on the plain macdonald they formed roughly half a semicircle lyttleton followed by wauchope was to march between the river and surgham hill maxwell was to cross over the hill while lewis and macdonald were to keep farther out to the right collinsons egyptian brigade was to guard the stores and materials left behind  the 21st lancers scouted ahead of the british brigades to discover if any foe were lurking behind surgham hill when about half a mile south of the hill they saw a small party of dervish cavalry and some infantry who were hiding in what looked like a shallow water course the four squadrons rode forward at a gallop a sharp musketry fire opened upon them but without hesitation they dashed headlong at the dervishes when they found that instead of a hundred and fifty foemen as they had supposed some fifteen hundred dervishes were lying concealed in the water course  it was too late to draw rein and with a cheer the cavalry rode down into the midst of the foe there was a wild fierce fight lance against spear sabre against sword the buttend of a rifle or the deadly knife some cut their way through unscathed others were surrounded and cut off splendid feats of heroism were performed many of those who got over returned to rescue officers or comrades until at last all the survivors climbed the bank  the brunt of the fighting fell upon the two central squadrons not only were the enemy thickest where they charged but the opposite bank of the deep nullah was composed of rough boulders almost impassable by horses these squadrons lost sixteen killed and nineteen wounded altogether twentytwo officers and men were killed and fifty wounded and there were one hundred and nineteen casualties among the horses  once across the survivors gathered at a point where their fire commanded the water course and dismounting speedily drove the dervishes from it on examining it afterwards it was found that sixty dead dervishes lay where the central squadrons had cut their way through  the charge in its daring and heroism resembled that of the 23rd light dragoons at talavera the fall into the ravine on that occasion was much deeper than that into which the lancers dashed but it was not occupied by a desperate force and although many were injured by the fall it was in their subsequent charge against a whole french division that they were almost annihilated  both incidents were like the balaclava charge magnificent but they were not war a desperate charge to cover the retreat of a defeated army is legitimate and worthy of all praise even if the gallant men who make it are annihilated but this was not the case at talavera nor at omdurman it was a brilliant but a costly mistake the bravery shown was superb and the manner in which officers and men rode back into the struggling mass to rescue comrades beyond all praise but the charge should never have been made and the lives were uselessly sacrificed  as yet all was quiet at other points bodies of the enemy could be seen making their way towards omdurman the battery opposite the town had from early morning been keeping up a fire from its heavy guns upon it but save for the occasional shot of a lurking dervish all was quiet elsewhere  while the cavalry charge was in progress gregory had moved along the line of the egyptian brigades with general hunter suddenly from behind the hills where the khalifa had fallen back with his defeated army a column of fully twelve thousand men led by the banner bearers and emirs poured out again a strong body sprang forward from another valley and made for the southeastern corner of macdonalds brigade which had moved almost due west from the position it had occupied in the zareba while the large force that had chased away the egyptian cavalry were seen returning to attack him in the rear  general hunter who was riding between macdonalds and lewiss brigades which were now a good mile apart exclaimed to gregory who happened to be the nearest officer to him  ride to macdonald and tell him to fall back if possible  then he turned and galloped off to fetch up reinforcements but the need was already seen the sudden uproar had attracted the attention of the whole army and the sirdar instantly grasped the situation the moment was indeed critical if macdonalds brigade were overwhelmed it might have meant a general disaster and the sirdar at once sent orders to wauchopes brigade to go at the double to macdonalds aid  fortunately colonel long who commanded the artillery had sent three batteries with macdonalds brigade collinsons brigade were far away near the river lewiss were themselves threatened it was evident at once that no assistance could reach macdonald in time when gregory reached him the dervishes were already approaching  it cannot be done macdonald said sternly when gregory delivered the message we must fight  indeed to retreat would have meant destruction the fire would have been ineffective and the thirty thousand fierce foes would have been among them there was nothing to do but to fight  macdonald had marched out with the 11th soudanese on his left the 2nd egyptians in the centre and the 10th soudanese on the rightall in line behind in column were the 9th soudanese the last were at once brought up into line to face the advancing enemy  fortunately the sheik ed dins force was still some little distance away the batteries took their place in the openings between the battalions and the maximnordenfeldts were soon carrying death into the advancing foe while the martinihenry with which the black and egyptian troops were armed mowed them down as by a scythe the soudanese battalions fired as was their custom individually as fast as they could load the egyptian battalion by steady volleys  still the enemy pressed on until they were within two hundred yards of the line the emirs and other leaders baggara horse and many spearmen still held on until they fell a few feet only from the steady infantry the rear ranks of the dervishes now began to fall back and the desperate charges of their leaders grew feebler but ed dins division was now within a thousand yards macdonald confident that the main attack was broken threw back the 9th soudanese to face it and wheeled a couple of his batteries to support them  the already retreating dervishes encouraged by the arrival of ed dins division returned to the attack the 11th soudanese swung round to aid the 9th in their struggle with ed dins troops the charges of the dervishes were impetuous in the extreme regardless of the storm of shell and bullets they rushed on and would have thrust themselves between the 9th and 11th had not the 2nd egyptians wheeling at the double thrown themselves into the gap  the dervishes pressed right up to them and bayonet and spear frequently crossed but in a fight of this kind discipline tells its tale the blacks and egyptians maintained their lines steadily and firmly and against these individual effort and courage even of the highest quality were in vain  the ground being now cleared the gunboats opened with maxim and cannon upon the rear of the dervishes the camel corps coming up each man dismounted and added his fire to the turmoil and finally three of wauchopes battalions arrived and the lincolns doubling to the right opened a terrible flank fire the dervishes broke and fled not as usual sullenly and reluctantly but at full speed stooping low to escape the storm of bullets that pursued them  zaki had throughout the day kept close to gregory ready to hold his horse when he dismounted but quickfooted as he was he was left behind when his master galloped across to macdonald he was up however in the course of a minute or two and gregory was glad to see him for the horse was kicking and plunging at the roar of the approaching enemy and was almost maddened when to this was added the crash of the batteries and musketry  put my blanket round his head zaki gregory said when the black ran up wrap it round so that he cannot see hold the bridle with one hand and stroke him with the other and keep on talking to him he knows your voice i dont want to dismount if i can help it for with my field glasses i see everything that is taking place and i will tell you how matters are going  for the moment it seemed as if the surging crowd streaming down must carry all before it but the steadiness with which the 9th soudanese moved into their place on the flank of the line and the other regiments remained as if on parade soon reassured him the terrible slaughter that was taking place in the ranks of the dervishes soon showed that in that quarter at least there was no fear of things going wrong but he could not but look anxiously towards the great mass of men approaching from the north  it was a matter of minutes would the present attack be repulsed in time for the position to be changed to meet the coming storm occasionally gregory looked back to see if reinforcements were coming wauchopes brigade was visible over the tops of the scattered bushes the movements of the line showed that they were coming on at the double but they were farther away than ed dins host and the latter were running like deer  he felt a deep sense of relief when the 9th soudanese were thrown back performing the movement as quietly and steadily as if on a drill ground and two batteries of artillery galloped across to their support he had hardly expected such calm courage from the black battalion as to the bravery of the soudanese troops there was no question they were of the same blood and race as their foes and had shown how bravely they could fight in many a previous battle but he was not prepared for the steady way in which they worked under such novel circumstances and although they too must have known that every moment was of consequence they moved without haste or hurry into the new position scarcely glancing at the torrent which was rushing on towards them  not less steadily and quietly did the 11th considered to be the crack regiment of the brigade swing round and as calmly and firmly did the egyptian battalioncomposed of the peasants who but twenty years before had been considered among the most cowardly of people a host of whom would have fled before a dozen of the dreaded dervishesmarch into the gap between the two black regiments and manfully hold their own  and yet he could not but feel sorry for the valiant savages who under so awful a fire still pressed forward to certain death their numbers withering away at every step until they dwindled to nothing only to be replaced by a fresh band which darted forward to meet a similar fate and yet when he remembered the wholesale slaughter at metemmeh the annihilation of countless villages and of their inhabitants and above all the absolute destruction of the army of hicks pasha the capture of khartoum the murder of gordon and the reduction to a state of slavery of all the peaceful tribes of the soudan he could not but feel that the annihilation of these human tigers and the wiping out of their false creed was a necessity  when the last shot was fired he dismounted and leant against his horse completely unnerved by the tremendous excitement that had been compressed into the space of half an hour zaki was in ecstasy at the victory the ruthless massacre of so many of his tribesmen the ruin of his native village and the murder of his relations was avenged at last the reign of the dervishes was over henceforth men could till their fields in peace it was possible that even yet he might find his mother and sisters still alive in the city but a few miles away living in wretched existence as slaves of their captors  tears of joy streamed down his cheeks he would have liked to help to revenge the wrongs of his tribe but his master needed him and moreover there was no place for an untrained man in the ranks of the soudanese regiments they were doing their work better than he could still it was the one bitter drop in his intense joy that he had not been able to aid in the conflict  he expressed this to gregory  you have had your share in the fight zaki just as i have had i have not fired a shot but i have been in the battle and run its risks and so have you each of us has done his duty and we can say for the rest of our lives that we have borne our share in the great battle that has smashed up the power of the khalifa and the rule of the dervishes    chapter 15 khartoum   there was no pause or rest for the troops who had been fighting for so many hours in the heat of the african sun it was all important to occupy omdurman before the remnants of the khalifas army reached it and as it was known that the khalifa himself had returned there it was hoped that he might be captured  it was ten oclock when macdonalds brigade fired their last shot in half an hour the troops went forward again the field presented a terrible appearance being thickly dotted with dead from the surgham hill across the plain and round by the kerreri hills to the spot where macdonalds brigade had made their stand there were comparatively few wounded for wiry and hardy as they were the wounded dervishes unless mortally hit were for the most part able to crawl or walk away which they had done unmolested for on each occasion after the bugle sounded cease firing not a shot was fired at them but of dead there were fully ten thousand scattered more or less thickly over the plain  from the position in which they were placed the egyptian troops as they marched south passed the spot where the khalifas flag was still flying as it had been left after its last defenders had fallen slatin who was with the army rode over the plain at the sirdars request to ascertain if any of the dervish leaders were among the fallen he recognized many but the khalifa his son ed din and osman digna were not among them the lastnamed had ever been chary of exposing himself and had probably as was his custom viewed the battle from a safe distance but round the flag were the khalifas brother yacoub and ten or twelve of the leading emirs  on our side the loss had been comparatively light our total number of casualties including the wounded was five hundred and twentyfour towards which macdonalds brigade contributed one hundred and twentyeight marching steadily on the force halted in the outlying suburb of omdurman at midday to obtain much needed food and water as soon as the cavalry had watered their horses they were sent round to the south of the town to cut off fugitives and some of the gunboats moved up to their support  deputations of the townsfolk greeks and natives came out and offered to surrender they said that the khalifa was in his house and that he had about a thousand of his bodyguard with him but that they could not offer any successful resistance the town was full of fugitive dervishes many thousands of them were thereamong them a great number of wounded  at half past four the sirdar with his staff entered the town accompanied by maxwells egyptian brigade only a few shots were fired the dervish courage was broken it was to the followers of the prophet and not to the infidels that the plains of kerreri had proved fatal it was their bodies and not those of the white soldiers that were strewn there so thickly the promise of the khalifa had been falsified the tomb of the mahdi was crumbling into ruins the bravest of their troops had fallenwhat more was there to be done  as slatin pasha rode in at the head of the troops he was instantly recognized by the people among whom for years he had been a prisoner and on his assurances that mercy would be shown to all if there was no resistance numbers of the dervishes came out from their houses and huts and laid down their arms  the women flocked out into the streets uttering their long and quavering cries of welcome to them the entry of the british was a relief from a living death as almost all were captives taken in war or in the dervish raids upon quiet villages they could scarce even yet believe that they were freethat their tyrants were slain or fugitives  intense was the surprise and relief of the population when they were told that there would be no lootingno harm done to any by the conquerors that all would be free if they chose to depart to their homes and to take their few belongings with them  the scene in the town was awfulthe stench overpowering the dervishes were absolutely ignorant of all sanitary methodspools of the foulest slush abounded and thousands of dead animals in all stages of decomposition lay about the streets among them were numerous dead bodies principally of girls and women who had been killed by their brutal husbands or masters to prevent them from falling into the hands of the british there were also many dead dervishes and others desperately wounded  strangely enough the latter did not seem to regard their victorious enemy with the hate that had been exhibited by many of the wounded in the field and some of them half raised themselves and saluted the sirdar and his staff as they passed along  presently there was a commotion in the crowd the wall of the great granary had been breached by some of the lyddite shells and the grain had poured out into the street the natives near ran up to gather it and finding that they were not molested by the british the news spread rapidly the crowds in the streets melted away and the inhabitants for the most part half starved made a mad rush to the spot where in a short time many thousands of men women and children were hard at work gathering and carrying off the grain  in the meantime the sirdar with a party of maxwells brigade passed along by the side of the great wall enclosing the buildings and square mile of ground in which were the khalifas house the tomb of the mahdi the arsenal storehouses and the homes of the principal emirs  as soon as they had turned the corner of the wall in view of the tomb and the khalifas house a brisk fire was opened by the garrison fortunately the wall was not loopholed and they had to get on the top of it or on to the flat roofs of the houses to fire maxwells men soon silenced them and on the troops passing in through the breaches and along the wall most of the dervishes at once surrendered  for a time further advance was barred by an inner wall that still intervened between them and the khalifas house after the gunboats fire had cleared away a number of the dervishes clustered outside the south wall the sirdar and his staff entered by a gateway and moved towards the khalifas house this was searched by slatin pasha and several officers and soldiers but to the general disappointment it was found that the khalifa had escaped but a short time before carrying with him his treasure his wives having been sent off as soon as he returned from the field of battle  the mahdis tomb was a ruin a large portion of the dome had been knocked away and the falling fragments had smashed the iron railings that surrounded the tomb itself  there was nothing more to be done the pursuit of the khalifa mounted as he would be on fresh horses was out of the question it was already almost dark and men and horses had been at work since before daybreak the town was in a very disturbed statelarge numbers of the dervishes were still possessed of their arms and the greater portion of the troops were withdrawn from the pestilential town next morning a larger force was marched in and the work of disarmament completed  the cavalry went out and scouted the country and brought in large numbers of prisoners the men belonging to the tribes that had renounced mahdismjaalin and otherswere at once allowed to leave for their homes and numbers of others whose appearance was peaceful and who had at once given up their arms were also released but there were still no fewer than eleven thousand prisoners among them some of the khalifas emirs  many of the townspeople had started the previous evening for the field of battle to bury the bodies of their friends who had fallen and to bring in the wounded of the latter after our own men had been attended to fully nine thousand received aid and attention from the british doctors  on the morning after the occupation the work of purification began great numbers of the unwounded prisoners and of the townspeople were set to work to clean the streets and in a couple of days the wider thoroughfares and avenues had been thoroughly cleansed  having but little to do gregory went into the khalifas arsenal this building was full of war material of all kinds including a perfectly appointed battery of krupp guns numbers of old cannon modern machineguns rifles and pistols mixed up with musical instruments suits of chain armour steel helmets hundreds of battle flags and thousands of native spears swords and shields besides these the collection comprised ivory percussion caps lead copper and bronze looms pianos sewing machines boilers steam engines agricultural implements ostrich feathers wooden and iron bedsteads paints india rubber leather water bottles clothes three state coaches and an american buggy there were also a modern smithy where gunpowder shell bullets and cartridge cases were made and stored and a wellappointed engineers shop and foundry with several steam engines turning lathes and other tools the machinery had been brought from gordons arsenal at khartoum where the foreman had been employed and the workmen were for the most part greeks  the battle was fought on friday the 2nd of september on sunday a flotilla of boats containing detachments from all the british and egyptian regiments and every officer who could be spared from duty proceeded up the river to khartoum the ruined and deserted city looked delightful after the sand dirt and wretchedness of omdurman the gardens of the governors house and other principal buildings had run wild and the green foliage was restful indeed to the eye after the waste of sand rock and scrub that had been traversed by the army on its way from wady halfa  the vessels drew up opposite a grove of tall palms beyond them appeared what had been the government house the upper story was gone the windows were filled up with bricks and a large acacia stood in front of the building  the troops formed up before the palace in three sides of a squarethe egyptians were to the left looking from the river and the british to the rightthe sirdar and the generals of the divisions and brigades facing the centre two flagstaffs had been raised on the upper story the sirdar gave the signal and the british and egyptian flags were run up as they flew out one of the gunboats fired a salute the guards band struck up god save the queen and the band of the 11th soudanese then played the khedives hymn while the generals and all present stood in salute with their hands to the peak of their helmets the sirdars call for three cheers for the queen was enthusiastically responded to every helmet being raised similar cheers were then given for the khedive the bands again struck up and twentyone guns were fired  as the last gun echoed out the guards played the dead march in saul and the black band the march called toll for the brave the latter in memory of the khedives subjects who had died with gordon then minute guns were fired and four chaplainsanglican presbyterian methodist and catholicby turns read a psalm or a prayer the pipers then wailed a dirge and finally the soudanese bands played gordons favourite hymn abide with me  at the conclusion general hunter and the other officers shook hands with the sirdar one by one kitchener himself was deeply moved and well he might be fourteen years of his life had been spent in preparing for and carrying out this campaign and now the great task was done gordon was avenged of the dervish host the remnant were scattered fugitives the mahdis cause the foulest and most bloodstained tyranny that had ever existed transforming as it did a flourishing province into an almost uninhabited desert was crushed forever and it was his patient and unsparing labour his wonderful organization that had been the main factor in the work no wonder that even the iron sirdar almost broke down at such a moment  the bugles sounded and the troops broke up their formation and for half an hour wandered through the empty chambers of the palace and the wild and beautiful garden another bugle call and they streamed down to the waters edge took to the boats and returned to omdurman  the longdelayed duty which england owed to one of her noblest sons had been done gordon had had his burial none knew where his bones reposed but that mattered little in the place where he was slain all honour had been done to him and the british flag waved over the spot where he disappeared forever from the sight of his countrymen  on gregorys return he found zaki in a state of the highest excitement  why what is the matter with you zaki  oh master i have found my two sisters  that is good news indeed i am very glad to hear it zaki how did you find them  while you were away master i had been walking through the town and when i was passing near the outskirts a woman came to a door and looked very hard at me then she suddenly drew aside the cloth from her face and cried surely it is zaki  then i knew hershe was my elder sister then another woman came to the doorit was my younger sister and you can imagine my joy both had been married to baggaras who had carried them off their husbands had gone to the battle and had not returned and some neighbours who had gone to the battlefield next day brought back news that they had found both bodies so one sister came to stay with the other people had told them that it was safe to go out and that no one was injured who did so but they had a store of grain in the house and they decided to wait and see what happened  one of them seeing me come along and observing that i belonged to the jaalin came out to ask me the news and they were as delighted as i was at our meeting  and your mother do they know anything of her  she was killed master zaki said sorrowfully i thought possibly it would be so the dervishes did not carry off old women they killed them and the little children i had never hoped to see her again but i did think when we entered omdurman that my sisters might be here  what are they going to do  they will go down to berber i have told them that many of the people here are going down and that they will find no difficulty in joining a party they are sure to find people they know at berber for most of the jaalin who have escaped have gone there since we occupied the place i told them that i would give them what money i had for since i have been in my lords service i have had no occasion to spend aught that he has paid me  i have no doubt zaki that i can arrange for them to go down in one of the empty store boats i believe that many of the captives who have been released will be sent down that way and of course i shall be glad to give your sisters enough to keep them for some time at berber  my lord is too good zaki said gratefully  nonsense zaki you saved my life and i owe you a great deal i will go down at once to the riverthat is if your sisters are ready to start tomorrowand i have no doubt the transport officer will give me an order for them to go in one of the boats  as he had expected he had no difficulty in making arrangements several of the native boats that had already landed their stores would leave on the following day and gregory obtained an order for the passage of the two women he then drew some money from the paymaster and on his return to headquarters gave zaki a hundred dollars for his sisters  the black was overpowered with joy and going off returned with the two girlsfor they were little more each took one of gregorys hands and pressed it to her forehead and heart and murmured her thanks  do not thank me he said it is but a small part of the debt that i owe your brother i do not know whether he has told you that he saved my life at the risk of his own  i have been thinking my lord zaki said that it would be well for them to go down in the boat as far as dongola our village is not many miles from that place and many of our people fled there and doubtless they will return to their villages and plant their fields now that they have no longer any fear of the dervishes at any rate they are certain to meet friends at dongola  very well i will get the order altered there will be no difficulty about that i shall be very glad to know that you will have a home to go to when this war is quite over  i shall never go as long as my lord will keep me zaki said fervently  i certainly shall not part with you zaki as long as i remain in this country which will probably be for a long time  the next day zaki aided in carrying his sisters goods down to the river bank and saw them on board one of the native craft which carried also fifteen or twenty other fugitives  now mr hilliard general hunter said that morning you can devote yourself to the object for which you came here unquestionably there must be many among the prisoners who fought at el obeid you may gather all particulars of the battle from their lips  the greater portion of the white troops will march down the country at once of course i dont know what your plans may be but unless you have a very good reason to the contrary i should certainly advise you to retain your position in the egyptian army a great deal of work will have to be done before matters are quite settled down and then civil administration of some sort will of course be formed under which you would certainly obtain a far better post than you could hope to get at home  i have quite made up my mind to do so sir certainly when i left cairo i had no idea of remaining permanently in the service but i have been so exceptionally fortunate owing largely to your kindness that i have been seriously thinking the matter over and am quite determined that if i can obtain an appointment i will remain here i have no ties whatever either in lower egypt or in england no way of earning my living there and possibly as i have begun so early i may rest in time in what will no doubt become an important branch of the egyptian administration  i am glad to hear that you take that view we all grumble at the soudan and yet there are few of us but would be sorry to leave it and there can be no doubt whatever that under our administration it will in time become a magnificently rich and fertile province  being relieved from other duty at present gregory went to the great yard near the mosque called the praying square where the majority of the dervish prisoners were confined addressing a man of some fiveandforty years he asked him in arabic whether many among the prisoners had fought against hicks at el obeid  the man hesitated  i am not asking on the part of the sirdar gregory said and you may be sure that if no punishment is inflicted against those who have fought against us now there can be no thought of punishment for a thing that happened so many years ago my father was i believe one of the english officers killed there but as he spoke arabic well it is just possible he was not killed but like slatin and neufeld was kept as a slave in case he might be useful  there are many here who fought against hicks the native said i myself fought there and nearly all the baggara who are as old as i am were there also i have never heard of a white man who escaped death when we broke into the square the english general and his officers charged into the middle of us and all fell i was not close at the time but i saw their bodies an hour afterwards  my father was not a fighting officer he was the interpreter and may not have been near the others when the attack by your people was made i have heard that one of the soudanese regiments held together and marched away and that there was a white officer with them  that was so two days afterwards we surrounded them they fought hard and at last when we had lost many men we offered that if they would surrender and become the mahdis men they would be spared most of them did so just as some of our tribesmen taken by you at atbara have now taken service with you  but the white officerwhat became of him  i cannot say the native said i have no memory of him he may have fallen before they surrenderedwho can say certainly i do not remember a white man being killed after they did so i will ask others who were there and tomorrow will tell you what they say  it was a busy day in omdurman the army that had made such efforts and achieved so great a triumph marched in military order with bands playing through the town the sirdar had a double motive in ordering them to do so in the first place it was a legitimate triumph of the troops thus to march as conquerors through the town in the second place the sight would impress not only the inhabitants but the dervish prisoners with a sense of the power of those who henceforth would be their masters and undoubtedly the show had the desired effect the orderly ranks as they swept along the proud demeanour of the men their physique and equipment created a profound impression among the natives half of them were their own kinsmen many of whom had fought for the khalifa and had now aided in defeating him this was what had been accomplished by drill and discipline and the influence of white officers the soudanese were evidently well fed and cared for not even the haughty baggara held their heads so high  especially admired were the artillery battery following battery in perfect order these were the guns that had carried death into the ranks of the dervishes against whose fire even the fanatical bravery of the followers of the khalifa was unable to stand when the march past was concluded there was scarce one of the prisoners who would not gladly have enlisted  on the following day gregory again went to the praying square the man he had the morning before seen at once came up to him  i have enquired of many who were at el obeid my lord he said all say that there was no white man in the camp when the black battalion surrendered though one had been seen while the fighting was going on nor was the body of one found where the fight had taken place on the previous day it was a matter of talk among the dervishes at the time for they had lain in a circle round the enemy and were convinced that no one passed through their lines those who surrendered said that he had taken the command and had exposed himself to the hottest fire and encouraged them telling them that the more bravely they defended themselves the more likely they were to obtain favourable terms the night before he had advised them to accept any offer the dervishes might make but on the following morning he was missing and none could give any account of what had become of him the same tale is told by all to whom i have spoken  the story made a profound impression upon gregory it seemed possible that the father of whom he had no remembrance might have been the sole white survivor of hickss army true there was nothing to prove that he was the white man who had joined the black battalion that escaped the first days massacre there were other noncombatants vizitelly the artist of the illustrated london news and odonovan the correspondent of the daily news either of these might also have been at any other portion of the square when the attack commenced and unable to join hicks and his officers in their final charge into the midst of the enemy  still it was at least possible that his father was the man who had retired from the field with the black battalion and who had afterwards so strangely disappeared if so what had become of him all these years had he made off in disguise only to be murdered by wandering bands had he been concealed for months in the hut of a friendly tribesman what had he been doing since had he been killed in trying to make his way down had he been enslaved and was he still lingering on in a wretched existence  he could hardly hope that he had fallen into friendly hands for had he been alive he would surely have managed with his knowledge of the country to make his way down or to reach khartoum when it was still held by the egyptians  at any rate gregory concluded that he might find out whether any european had arrived there during the siege he went down to the river and took a native boat across to khartoum at the ceremony on sunday many natives watched the arrival of the flotilla and some of these might have been there in gordons time he had no great hopes of it but there was just a chance  the flags were still flying over the governors house when he landed and a detachment of egyptian troops was stationed there a native officer came down when he landed  i have come across to question some of the natives he said i believe some are still living here  oh yes bimbashi there are a good many scattered about among the ruins they come in bringing fruit and fish for sale i think they mostly live down by the riverside  gregory kept on till he came to the huts occupied by the fishermen and men who cultivated small plots of ground he found several who had lived at khartoum when it was captured and who had escaped the general massacre by hiding till nightfall and then making their way up the river in boats none of them could give him the information he sought but one suggested that he was more likely to hear from the greeks and turks who worked in the khalifas arsenal and foundries as they had been spared for the services they would be able to render to the mahdi  returning to omdurman he went to the machine shop here work had already been resumed as repairs were needed by several of the gunboats he went up to the foreman a man of some sixty years of age  you were engaged in the city during the siege were you not he said in arabic with which he knew the foreman must be thoroughly acquainted  yes sir i had been here ten years before that  i am very anxious to learn whether any white man who had survived the battle of el obeid ever reached this town before its capture  the man thought for some time  yes he said a white man certainly came here towards the end of the siege i know because i happened to meet him when i was going home from work and he asked me the way to the governors i should not have known him to be a white man for he had a native attire and was as black from exposure to the sun as any of the arabs i gave him directions and did not ask him any questions but it was said afterwards that he was one of hickss officers later i heard that he went down in the steamer with colonel stewart  you did not hear his name gregory asked anxiously  no sir  did he talk arabic well  extremely well much better than i did at the time  do you remember how long he arrived before the steamer started  not very long sir though i really cannot tell you how long it was  after you were cut off i suppose  certainly it was but i cannot say how long  no one else here would know more about it than you do  no sir i should think not but you can ask them  he called up some of the other workmen all knew that a white officer of hicks pashas army was said to have returned one of them remembered that he had come down once with gordon to see about some repairs required to the engines of a steamer but he had never heard his name nor could he recall his personal appearance except that he seemed to be a man about thirty but he remembered once seeing him again on board stewarts steamer as they had been working at her engines just before she started  after thanking the foreman gregory returned to the hut where he and two other officers of hunters staff had taken up their quarters he was profoundly depressed this white man might well have been his father but if so it was even more certain than before that he had fallen he knew what had been the fate of stewarts steamer the remains of which he had seen at hebbeh the colonel and all with him had accepted the invitation of the treacherous sheik of that village and had been massacred he would at least go there and endeavour to learn from some of the natives the particulars of the fate of those on board and whether it was possible that any of the whites could have escaped  after sitting for some time in thought he went to general hunters quarters and asked to see him the general listened sympathetically to his story  i never for a moment thought that your father could have escaped he said but from what you tell me it is possible that he did so only to perish afterwards but i can well understand how having learnt so much you should be anxious to hear more certainly i will grant your request for leave to go down to hebbeh as you know that place was taken and destroyed by the river column under earle or rather under brackenbury for earle had been killed in the fight at kirkeban numerous relics were found of the massacre but the journal stewart was known to have kept was not among them had it been there it would no doubt have mentioned the survivor of hickss army who was coming down the river with him  the place was deserted when brackenbury arrived it certainly was so when we came up since then some of the inhabitants have probably returned and may know of places where plunder was hidden away on the approach of brackenburys column no doubt the offer of a reward would lead to their production  you may not have to be absent long the british regiments are to go down at once and several steamers will start tomorrow i will give you an order to go with them you will have no difficulty in getting back for the sirdar has already decided that the railway is to be carried on at once from atbara to khartoum and has i believe telegraphed this morning that material and stores are to be sent up at once most of these will no doubt be brought on by rail but grain of which large quantities will be required for the use of our troops and of the population of the town will come on by water  but no doubt your quickest way back will be to ride to abu hamed and take the train up to atbara  i will be back as soon as i can general i am much obliged to you for letting me go  i will tell the sirdar that i have given you leave and why it is not absolutely necessary but it is always well that ones name should be kept to the front  the next day gregory saw the general again  i mentioned to the sirdar that you wanted a fortnights leave and told him why he simply nodded and said let him have a month if he wants it  he had other things to think of for this morning a small dervish steamer came down the white nile they had the khalifas flag flying and had not heard of what had taken place till one of the gunboats ran alongside her of course she surrendered at once  it is a curious story they told they left omdurman a month ago with the sapphire which carried five hundred men the object of the voyage was to collect grain when they reached the old station of fashoda they had been fired upon by black troops with some white men among them who had a strange flag flying the firing was pretty accurate for they had forty men killed and wounded and the emir in command had disembarked and encamped his troops from the sapphire on the opposite bank and had sent the small steamer back to ask the khalifa for orders  the story seemed so strange and improbable that i went down with the sirdar to the boat which had been brought alongside there was no doubt that it had been peppered with balls some of the generals staff cut one of the bullets out of the woodwork and these fully confirmed the story they were not leaden balls or bits of old iron but conical nickel bullets they could only have been fired from smallbore rifles so there were certainly white men at fashoda of course no one can form any opinion as to who they are or where they come from they may be belgians from the congo they maybut that is most improbablebe an expeditionary party of italians but italy is withdrawing and not pushing forward so i think it is out of the question that they are concerned in the matter  the question seems to lie between belgians and french unless an expedition has been sent up from our possessions on the great lakes the dervishes in the steamer can only say that the flag is not at all like ours but as their ignorance of colour is profound they give all sorts of contradictory statements anyhow it is a serious matter certainly no foreign power has any right to send an expedition to the nile and as certainly if one of them did so our government would not allow them to remain there for beyond all question fashoda is an egyptian station and within egyptian territory which is at present as much as to say that a foreign power established there would be occupying our country  it seems an extraordinary proceeding sir  very extraordinary if it were not that it seems the thing has absolutely been done it would seem improbable that any foreign power could take such an extraordinary and unjustifiable course it is lucky for them whoever they are that we have smashed up the dervishes for they would have made very short work of them and the nation that sent them would probably never have known their fate    chapter 16 a voice from the dead   that afternoon gregory heard that orders had been issued for five of the gunboats to start up the river the first thing in the morning that the sirdar himself was going and was to take up five hundred men of the 11th soudanese an order was also issued that all correspondents were to leave the next day for cairo gregory had met one of them that evening  so you are all off i hear mr pearson  yes we did have a sort of option given us but it was really no choice at all we might go down instantly or we must stay till the last of the white troops had gone down that may be a very long time as there is no saying what may come of this fashoda business besides the khalifa has fairly escaped and if out of the sixty thousand men with him some thirty thousand got off they may yet rally round him and in another two or three months he may be at the head of as large a force as ever i dont think after the way the egyptians fought the other day there will be any need for white troops to back them still it is likely that a battalion or two may be left however we had practically to choose between going at once or waiting at least a month and you may be sure that the censorship would be put on with a round turn and that we should not be allowed to say a word of the fashoda business which would be the only thing worth telegraphing about so we have all voted for going  of course we understand that this pressure has been put upon us on account of this curious affair at fashoda fortunately none of us are sorry to be off there is certain to be a pause now for some time and one does not want to be kicking ones heels about in this ghastly town and though it is rather sharp and peremptory work i cannot say that i think the sirdar is wrong whoever these men may be they must go that is certain but of course it will be a somewhat delicate business and francethat is if they are frenchmen who are thereis sure to be immensely sore over the business and it is certainly very desirable that nothing should be written from here that could increase that feeling i have no doubt the sirdar telegraphed home for instructions as soon as he got the news of the affair and i imagine that his going up in the morning with five gunboats is proof that he has already received instructions of some sort  i hope this force is not french the feeling against us is tremendously strong in france and they certainly will not like backing down but they will have to do that or fight and with all their big talk i dont think they are ready to risk a war with us especially as though their occupation of fashoda would be an immense annoyance to us it would be of no possible utility to them  by the way we have all got to sell our horses there is no possibility of taking them down and it is a question of giving them away rather than of selling for of course the officers of the british regiments do not want to buy i have a horse for which i gave twentyfive pounds at cairo you are welcome to him you can give me a couple of pounds for the saddle and things  i am very much obliged to you but it would be robbery  not at all if you wont take him i shall have him shot tonight a horse could not possibly pick up food here and would die of starvation without a master and it would be still more cruel to give him to a native for they are brutal horse masters  well in that case i shall be glad indeed to have him and i am extremely obliged to you  that is right if you will send your man round i will hand it over to him  as you are going tomorrow it is likely that i shall go with you for i am going down also as far as abu hamed for ten days  that will be pleasant though i do not know that it will be so for you for i own the majority of us are rather sourtempered at present though we may be glad enough to go one does not care to be sent off at a moments notice just as fractious children are turned out of a room when their elders want a private chat however for myself i am not inclined to grumble i want to go and therefore i do not stand on the order of going  later general hunter gave gregory an order for a passage in a steamer on which the correspondents of the various newspapers were going down  what shall we take master zaki asked  just the clothes we stand in zaki i have got a couple of the dervish remingtons and several packets of ammunition i will take them and i can get four more we will take them all down as we know the people about hebbeh are not disposed to be friendly i dont suppose for a minute that they are likely to show any hostile feeling for you may be sure that the fall of omdurman has spread by this time over the whole land and they will be on their best behaviour still it is just as well to be able to defend ourselves and i shall engage four men at abu hamed to go with us i shall leave all my kit here  it was a pleasant run down the river to atbara the correspondents were all heartily glad to be on their way home and the irritation they had at first felt at being so suddenly ordered away at the moment when so unexpected and interesting a development occurred had subsided they had witnessed one of the most interesting battles ever fought had seen the overthrow of the mahdi and were looking forward to european comforts and luxuries again  at atbara all left the steamer which was to take in stores and go up again at once and proceeded by a military train with the first of the returned european regiments  at abu hamed gregory left them his first enquiry was whether any boats were going down the river he learned that several native craft were leaving and at once engaged a passage in one of them to hebbeh he had no difficulty whatever in engaging four sturdy arabs from among those who were listlessly hanging round the little station while he was doing this zaki bought food for six men for a week and in less than two hours from his arrival at abu hamed gregory was on board  the boat at once dropped down the river and as the current was running strongly they were off hebbeh next morning at eight oclock a boat put off and took gregory and his party ashore as they were seen to land the village sheik at once came down to them  is there anything i can do for my lord he asked  yes i have come here to ascertain whether any of those who were present at the attack upon the party who landed from the steamer over there are still living here there is no question of punishment on the contrary i have come here to obtain information as to some private matters and anyone who can give me that information will be well rewarded  there are but three men alive who were here at the time my lord there were more but they fled when the boats with the white troops came up from merawi i believe they went to the dervish camp at metemmeh  the three here are quiet and respectable men they were asked many questions and guided the white officers to the place where wad etman stoodit was there that those who landed from the steamer first restedand to the place where the great house of suleiman wad gamr emir of salamat stood  it was there that the much to be regretted attack on the white men was made when the white army came up six months afterwards they blew up the house and cut down all the palm trees in the village  i was with the force that came up from merawi last year will you bring me the three men you speak of i would question them one by one assure them that they need not be afraid of answering truthfully even if they themselves were concerned in the attack upon the white officers and the crew of the steamer for no steps will be taken against them it is eighteen years since then and no doubt their houses were destroyed and their groves cut down when the british column came here and found the place deserted i am ready to reward them if i obtain the information i require from them  the three men were presently brought to the spot where gregory had seated himself in the shade of one of the huts zaki stood beside him and the four armed men took post a short distance away  the first called up was a very old man in reply to gregorys questions he said  i was already old when the steamboat ran ashore i took no hand in the business the white men had done me no harm while the followers of the mahdi had killed many of my family and friends i heard what was going to be done and i stayed in my house i call upon allah to witness that what i say is true  do you know if any remains of that expedition are still in existence  no my lord when the white troops came here some months afterwards i fled as all here did but i know that before they destroyed wad gamrs house they took away some boxes of papers that had been brought ashore from the ship and were still in the house i know of nothing else the clothes of the men on board the steamboat were divided among those who took part in the attack but there was little booty  gregory knew that at wad gamrs house but few signs of the tragedy had been found when general brackenburys troops entered bloodstained visiting cards of stewarts a few scraps of paper and a field glass had alone been discovered besides the boxes of papers  the next man who came up said that he had been with the party who fell upon the engineers and crew of the boat by the riverside  i was ordered to kill them he said had i not done so i should have been killed myself  do you know whether any booty was hidden away before the english came  no my lord there was no booty taken no money was found on board the steamer we stripped her of the brass work and took the wood ashore to burn the sheik gave us a dollar and a half a man for what we had done there may have been some money found on the ship but as his own men were on board first and took all that they thought of value i have naught to say about it  and you never heard of anything being hidden before the british troops arrived  the arab shook his head  no my lord but there may have been though i never heard of it i went and fought at kirkeban and when we were beaten i fled at once to berber and remained there until the white troops had all gone down the country  i may want to question you again tomorrow gregory said here are two dollars i shall give you as much more if i want you again  the third man was then called up he was evidently in fear  do not be afraid to answer me truly gregory said if you do so no harm will come to you whatever share you may have had in the affair but if you answer falsely and the truth is afterwards discovered you will be punished now where were you when this business took place  we were all ordered by wad gamr to gather near his house and when the signal was given we were to run in and kill the white men we saw them go up to the house they had been told to leave their arms behind them one of the sheiks servants came out and waved his arms and we ran in and killed them  what happened then  we carried the bodies outside the house then we took what money was found in their pockets with watches and other things in to the sheik and he paid us a dollar and a half a head and said that we could have their clothes for my share i had a jacket belonging to one of them when i got it home i found that there was a pocket inside and in it was a book partly written on and many other bits of paper  and what became of that gregory asked eagerly  i threw it into a corner it was of no use to me but when the white troops came up in the boats and beat us at kirkeban i came straight home and seeing the pocketbook took it and hid it under a rock for i thought that when the white troops got here they would find it and that they might then destroy the house and cut down my trees then i went away and did not come back until they had all gone  and where is the pocketbook now  it may be under the rock where i hid it my lord i have never thought of it since it was rubbish  can you take me to the place  i think so it was not far from my house i pushed it under the first great rock i came to for i was in haste and wanted to be away before the white soldiers on camels could get here  did you hear of any other things being hidden  no i think everything was given up if this thing had been of value i should perhaps have told the sheik but as it was only written papers and of no use to anyone i did not trouble to do so  well let us go at once gregory said rising to his feet although of no use to you these papers may be of importance  followed by zaki and the four men gregory went to the peasants house which stood a quarter of a mile away  this is not the house i lived in then the man said the white troops destroyed every house in the village but when they had gone i built another on the same spot  the hill rose steeply behind it the peasant went on till he stopped at a large boulder  this was the rock he said where i thrust it under as far as my arm would reach i pushed it in on the upper side  the man lay down  it was just about here he said  it is here my lord i can just feel it but i cannot get it out i pushed it in as far as the tips of my fingers could reach it  well go down and cut a couple of sticks three or four feet long  in ten minutes the man returned with them  now take one of them and when you feel the book push the stick along its side until it is well beyond it then you ought to be able to scrape it out if you cannot do so we shall have to roll the stone over it is a big rock but with two or three poles one ought to be able to turn it over  after several attempts however the man produced the packet gregory opened it with trembling hands it contained as the man had said a large number of loose sheets evidently torn from a pocketbook and all covered with close writing  he opened the book that accompanied them it was written in ink and the first few words sufficed to tell him that his search was over it began  khartoum thank god after two years of suffering and misery since the fatal day at el obeid i am once again amongst friends it is true that i am still in peril for the position here is desperate still the army that is coming up to our help may be here in time and even if they should not do so this may be found when they come and will be given to my dear wife at cairo if she is still there her name is mrs hilliard and her address will surely be known at the bank  these are the papers i was looking for he said to zaki i will tell you about them afterwards  he handed ten dollars to the native thrust the packet into his breast pocket and walked slowly down to the river he had never entertained any hope of finding his father but this evidence of his death gave him a shock  his mother was right then she had always insisted there was a possibility that he might have escaped the massacre at el obeid he had done so he had reached khartoum he had started full of hope of seeing his wife and child but had been treacherously massacred here  he would not now read this message from the grave that must be reserved for some time when he was alone he knew enough to be able to guess the detailsthey could not be otherwise than painful he felt almost glad that his mother was not alive to him the loss was scarcely a real one his father had left him when an infant although his mother had so often spoken of him he had scarcely been a reality to gregory for when he became old enough to comprehend the matter it seemed to him certain that his father must have been killed he could then hardly understand how his mother could cling to hope  his father had been more a real character to him since he started from cairo than ever before he knew the desert now and its fierce inhabitants he could picture the battle and since the fight at omdurman he had been able to see before him the wild rush on the egyptian square the mad confusion the charge of a handful of white officers and the one white man going off with the black battalion that held together  if then it was a shock to him to know how his father had died how vastly greater would it have been to his mother she had pictured him as dying suddenly fighting to the last and scarce conscious of pain till he received a fatal wound she had said to gregory that it was better to think of his father as having died thus than lingering in hopeless slavery like neufeld but it would have been agony to her to know that he did suffer for two years that he had then struggled on through all dangers to khartoum and was on his way back full of hope and love for her when he was treacherously murdered  the village sheik met him as he went down  you have found nothing my lord  nothing but a few old papers he said  you will report well of us i hope to the great english commander  i shall certainly tell him that you did all in your power to aid me  he walked down towards the river one of the men who had gone on while he had been speaking to the sheik ran back to meet him  there is a steamer coming up the river my lord  that is fortunate indeed gregory exclaimed i had intended to sleep here tonight and to bargain with the sheik for donkeys or camels to take us back this will save two days  two or three native craft were fastened up to the shore waiting for a breeze to set in strong enough to take them up gregory at once arranged with one of them to put his party on board the steamer in their boat in a quarter of an hour the gunboat approached and they rowed out to meet her  as she came up gregory stood up and shouted to them to throw him a rope this was done and an officer came to the side  i want a passage for myself and five men to abu hamed i am an officer on general hunters staff  with pleasure  have you come down from the front he asked as gregory stepped on board with the five blacks  yes  then you can tell me about the great fight we heard of it at dongola but beyond the fact that we had thrashed the khalifa and taken omdurman we received no particulars  but before you begin have a drink  it is horribly annoying to me he went on as they sat down under the awning and the steward brought tumblers soda water some whisky and two lemons  gregory refused the whisky but took a lemon with his cold water  a horrible nuisance the officer went on this is one of gordons old steamers she has broken down twice still i console myself by thinking that even if i had been in time very likely she would not have been taken up  i hope however there will be work to do yet as you see i have got three of these native craft in tow and it is as much as i can do to get them up this cataract  now please tell me about the battle  gregory gave him an outline of the struggle of the occupation of omdurman and of what might be called the funeral service of gordon at khartoum it was dark before the story was finished  by the way the officer said as they were about to sit down to dinner while we were on deck i did not ask about your men i must order food to be given them  they have plenty gregory said i brought enough for a week with me i thought that i might be detained two or three days here and be obliged to make the journey by land to abu hamed  i have not asked you what you were doing at this out of the way place and how long you have been here  i only landed this morning i came down to search for some relics my father was on board stewarts steamer and as there would be nothing doing at omdurman for a few days i got leave to run down i was fortunate in securing a boat at abu hamed on my arrival there and i have been equally so now in having been picked up by you so that i shall not be away from omdurman more than seven days if i have equal luck in getting a steamer at atbara i do not think i shall be disappointed for the white troops are coming down and stores are going up for the egyptian brigade so that i am certain not to be kept there many hours the sirdar has gone up to fashoda or i dont suppose i should have got leave  yes i heard at merawi from the officer in command that some foreign troops had arrived there i suppose nothing more is known about it  no no news will probably come down for another fortnight perhaps longer than that  who can they be  the general idea is that they are french they can only be french or a party from the congo states  they had tremendous cheek whoever they are the officer said it is precious lucky for them that we have given the khalifa something else to think about or you may be sure he would have wiped them out pretty quickly unless they are a very strong force which doesnt seem probable i hear the sirdar has taken a regiment up with him  yes but i dont suppose any actual move will be made at present  no i suppose it will be a diplomatic business still i should think they would have to go  no one has any doubt about that at omdurman gregory said after all the expense and trouble we have had to retake the soudan it is not likely that we should let anyone else plant themselves on the road to the great lakes  when will you be at abu hamed sir  we shall be there about five oclockat any rate i think you may safely reckon on catching the morning train it goes i think at eight  i am sure to catch a train soon for orders have been sent down that railway materials shall be sent up as quickly as possible as it has been decided that the railway shall be carried on at once to khartoum i expect that as soon as the nile falls they will make a temporary bridge across the atbara  it was six in the morning when the steamer arrived at abu hamed gregory at once landed paid his four men went up to the little station and an hour later was on his way to atbara fort he had but two hours to wait there and reached omdurman at three oclock on the following afternoon as he landed he met an officer he knew  is there any news he asked  nothing but fashoda is talked about it has been ascertained that the force there is undoubtedly french the betting is about even as to whether france will back down or not they have made it difficult for themselves by an outburst of enthusiasm at what they considered the defeat of england well of course that does not go for much except that it makes it harder for their government to give in  and has any news been received of the whereabouts of the khalifa  no broadwood with two regiments of egyptian cavalry and the camel corps started in pursuit of the khalifa and osman an hour after it was found that they had got away slatin pasha went with them but as the horses had been at work all day they had to stop at half past eight they could not then get down to the water and bivouacked where they had halted at four in the morning they started again and at half past eight found a spot where they could get down to the river then they rode fifteen miles farther  they were now thirtyfive miles from omdurman one of the gunboats had gone up with supplies but owing to the nile having overflowed could not get near enough to land them next morning they got news that the khalifa was twentyfive miles ahead and had just obtained fresh camels so they were ordered to return to the town they had picked up a good many of the fugitives among them the khalifas favourite wife who doubtless with other women had slipped away at one of his halting places feeling unable to bear the constant fatigues and hardships of the flight in the desert  the cavalry have since been out again but beyond the fact that the khalifa had been joined by many of the fugitives from the battle and was making for kordofan no certain news has been obtained at present nothing can be done in that direction  that horse you bought is all right  i really did not like taking him for i already had one and it looked almost like robbery giving him two pounds for it and the saddle  others have done as well the officer laughed one of the brigade staff bought a horse for a pound from burleigh who had given forty for it at cairo there was no help for it they could not take horses down besides it is not their loss after all the newspapers can afford to pay for them they must have been coining money of late  that reconciles me gregory laughed i did not think of the correspondents expenses being paid by the papers  i dont know anything about their arrangements but it stands to reason that it must be so in a campaign like this in an ordinary war a man can calculate what his outlay might be but on an expedition of this kind no one could foretell what expenses he might have to incur  besides the sirdar has saved the newspapers an enormous expenditure the correspondents have been rigidly kept down to messages of a few hundred words whereas if they had had their own way they would have sent down columns of course the correspondents grumbled but i have no doubt their employers were very well pleased and the newspapers must have saved thousands of pounds by this restriction  you are back sooner than i expected general hunter said when gregory went in and reported his arrival it is scarce a week since you left  just a week sir everything went smoothly and i was but three or four hours at hebbeh  and did you succeed in your search  yes sir i most fortunately found a man who had hidden a pocketbook he had taken from the body of one of the white men who were murdered there there was nothing in it but old papers and when brackenburys expedition approached he had hidden it away and did not give it a thought until i enquired if he knew of any papers and other things connected with those on board the steamer he at once took me to the place where he had hidden it under a great stone and it turned out to be the notebook and journals of my father who was as i thought possible the white man who had arrived at khartoum a short time before the place was captured by the dervishes and who had gone down in the steamer that carried colonel stewart  well hilliard the general said kindly even the certain knowledge of his death is better than the fear that he might be in slavery you told me you had no remembrance of him  none sir but of course my mother had talked of him so often and had several photographs of himthe last taken at cairo before he leftso that i almost seem to have known him however i do feel it as a relief to know that he is not as i feared was remotely possible a slave among the baggara but i think it is hard that after having gone through two years of trials and sufferings he should have been murdered on his way home  no doubt that is so have you read your fathers diary yet  no sir i have not had the heart to do so and shall put it off until the shock that this has given me has passed away i feel that a little hard work will be the best thing for me is there any chance of it  you have just returned in time i am going up the blue nile tomorrow morning to clear out the villages which no doubt are all full of fugitives i am glad that you have come back i was speaking of you today to general rundle who is in command  one of the objects of the expedition is to prevent fadil from crossing the river he was advancing from gedareh at the head of ten thousand troops to join the khalifa and was but forty miles away on the day after we took this place but when he received the news of our victory he fell back if he can cross he will bring a very formidable reinforcement to the khalifa  we know that colonel parsons started from kassala on the 7th his object being to capture gedareh during the absence of fadil he is to cross the atbara at el fasher and will then march up this bank of the river till he is at the nearest point to gedareh it is probable that he will not strike across before the 18th or the 20th his force is comparatively small and we do not know how large a garrison fadil will have left there  altogether we are uneasy about the expedition it is very desirable that parsons should know that fadil is retiring and that so far as we can learn from the natives he has not yet crossed the blue nile gedareh is said to be a strong place and once there parsons might hold it against fadil until we can send him reinforcements  in order to convey this information to him we require someone on whom we can absolutely rely i said that if you were here i felt sure that you would volunteer for the service of course it is to a certain extent a dangerous one but i think that speaking the language as you do and as you have already been among the dervishes you might even if taken prisoner make out a good story for yourself  i would undertake the commission with pleasure gregory said i shall of course go in native dress  i propose that we carry you a hundred miles up the river with us and there land you from that point it would not be more than sixty or seventy miles across the desert to the atbara which you would strike forty or fifty miles above el fasher of course you would be able to learn there whether parsons had crossed if he had you would ride up the bank till you overtake him if he had not you would probably meet him at mugatta he must cross below that as it is there he leaves the river  that seems simple enough sir my story would be that i was one of the dervishes who had escaped from the battle here and had stopped at a village thinking that i was safe from pursuit until your boats came along and that i then crossed the desert to go to gedareh where i thought i should be safe that would surely carry me through i shall want two fast camelsone for myself and one for my boy  these we can get for you from abdul azil the abadah sheik of course you will put on dervish robes and badges  yes sir  i will go across and tell general rundle and obtain written instructions for you to carry despatches to parsons i will give them to you when you go up on the boat in the morning i will see at once about the camels and ask the intelligence people to get you two of the dervish suits you will also want rifles  thank you sir i have a couple of remingtons and plenty of ammunition for them i have two spears also which i picked up when we came in here  we are off again zaki he said when he returned to his hut where the black was engaged in sweeping up the dust and arranging everything as usual  yes master zaki suspended his work when do we go  tomorrow morning  do we take everything with us  no i start in uniform we shall both want dervish dresses but you need not trouble about themthey will be got for us  then we are going among the dervishes again  well i hope we are not but we may meet some of them we are going with the expedition up the blue nile and will then land and strike across the desert to the atbara that is enough for you to know at present we shall take our guns and spears with us  zaki had no curiosity if his master was going it was of course all righthis confidence in him was absolute  in about an hour a native from the intelligence department brought down two dervish dresses complete they had still three hours before mess and gregory sat down on his bed and opened his fathers pocketbook which he had had no opportunity to do since it came into his possession    chapter 17 a fugitive   i do not suppose the diary began that what i write here will ever be read it seems to me that the chances are immeasurably against it still there is a possibility that it may fall into the hands of some of my countrymen when as will surely be the case the mahdis rebellion is crushed and order restored and i intend so long as i live to jot down from time to time what happens to me in order that the only person living interested in me my wife may possibly someday get to know what my fate has been therefore should this scrap of paper and other scraps that may follow it be ever handed to one of my countrymen i pray him to send it to mrs hilliard care of the manager of the bank at cairo  it may be that this the first time i write may be the last and i therefore before all things wish to send her my hearts love to tell her that my last thoughts and my prayers will be for her and that i leave it entirely to her whether to return to england in accordance with the instructions i left her before leaving or to remain in cairo  it is now five days since the battle it cannot be called a battle it was not fighting it was a massacre the men after three days incessant fighting were exhausted and worn out half mad with thirst half mutinous at being brought into the desert as they said to die thus when the dervishes rushed down in a mass the defence was feeble almost before we knew what had happened the enemy had burst in on one side of the square then all was wild confusioncamels and dervishes flying egyptians screaming camp followers were all mixed in confusion  the other sides of the square were also attacked some of our men were firing at those in their front others turning round and shooting into the crowded mass in the square i was with a black regiment on the side opposite to where they burst in the white officer who had been in command had fallen ill and had been sent back a few days after we left khartoum and as i had been for weeks before that aiding him to the best of my powers and there were no other officers to spare hicks asked me to take his place as i had done everything i could for the poor fellows comfort on the march they had come to like me and to obey my orders as promptly as those of their former commander  as long as the other two sides of the square stood firm i did so but they soon gave way i saw hicks with his staff charge into the midst of the dervishes and then lost sight of them seeing that all was lost i called to my men to keep together to march off in regular order and repel all assaults as this was the only hope there was of getting free  they obeyed my orders splendidly two or three times the dervishes charged upon them but the blacks were as steady as rocks and their volleys were so fatal that the enemy finally left us alone preferring to aid in the slaughter of the panicstricken egyptians and to share the spoil  we made for the wells each man drank his fill those who had water bottles filled them we then marched on towards el obeid but before nightfall the dervish horse had closed up round us at daylight their infantry had also arrived and fighting began  all day we held our position killing great numbers but losing many men ourselves by night our water was exhausted then the soldiers offered to attack the enemy but they were twenty to one against us and i said to them no fight one day longer if we can hold on the dervishes may retire or they may offer us terms  so we stood by the next evening we had lost half our number after they had drawn off one of the dervish emirs came in with a white flag and offered life to all who would surrender and would wear the badge of the mahdi and be his soldiers i replied that an answer should be given in the morning when he had left i gathered the men together  you have fought nobly i said but you have scarce a round of ammunition left if we fight again tomorrow we shall all be slaughtered i thank you in the name of the khedive for all that you have done but i do not urge you to reject the terms offered your deaths would not benefit the khedive as far as i am concerned you are free to accept the terms offered  they talked for some time together and then the three native officers who were still alive came forward  bimbashi they said what will be done about you we are mahometans and their countrymen but you are a white man and a christian you would not fight for the mahdi  no i said i would not fight for him nor would i gain my life at the price of being his slave i wish you to settle the matter without any reference to me i will take my chance i may not be here in the morning one man might escape where many could not all i ask is that i may not be watched if in the morning i am not here you can all say that i disappeared and you do not know how i do not myself know what i am going to do yet  they went away and in a quarter of an hour returned and said that the men would surrender if they had water and ammunition they would go on fighting till the end but as they had neither they would surrender  i felt that this was best the soudanese love battle and would as readily fight on one side as on the other they have done their duty well to the khedive and will doubtless fight as bravely for the mahdi  the men lay in a square as they had fought with sentries placed to warn them should the dervishes make a night attack british troops would have been wellnigh maddened with thirst after being twentyfour hours without water and fighting all day in the blazing sun but they felt it little they were thirsty but in their desert marches they are accustomed to thirst and to hold on for a long time without water  i was better off for i had drunk sparingly the day before from my water bottle and had still a draught left in it i waited until i thought that the men were all asleep then i stripped and stained myself from head to foot i had carried stain with me in case i might have to go out as a native to obtain information in my valise i had a native dress and a native cloth in which i could have passed as a peasant but not as one of the baggara however i put it on passed through the sleeping men and went up to a sentry  you know me i said i am your bimbashi i am going to try and get through their lines but if it is known how i have escaped i shall be pursued and slain will you swear to me that if you are questioned you will say you know nothing of my flight  i swear by the beard of the prophet the man said may allah protect you my lord  then i went on the night was fairly dark and as the dervishes were nearly half a mile away i had no fear of being seen by them there were many of their dead scattered about seventy or eighty yards from our square i had all along felt convinced that it would be impossible to pass through their lines therefore i went to a spot where i had noticed that a number had fallen close together and went about examining them carefully it would not have done to have chosen the dress of an emir as his body might have been examined but the ordinary dead would pass unnoticed  i first exchanged the robe for one marked with the mahdis patches it was already smeared with blood i then carried the body of the man whose robe i had taken off for some distance i laid him down on his face thinking that the absence of the patches would not be seen then i crawled some thirty or forty yards nearer to the dervishes so that it would seem that i had strength to get that far before dying then i lay down partly on my side so that the patches would show but with my face downwards on my arm  i had before dyeing my skin cut my hair close to my head on which i placed the dervishs turban the only property that i brought out with me was a revolver and this pocketbook both of these i buried in the sand the pocketbook a short distance away the pistol lightly covered and within reach of my hand so that i could grasp it and sell my life dearly if discovered  soon after daylight i heard the triumphant yells of the dervishes and knew that my men had surrendered then there was a rush of horse and foot and much shouting and talking i lifted my head slightly and looked across not a dervish was to be seen in front of me  i felt that i had better move so taking up my pistol and hiding it i crawled on my hands and knees to the spot where i had hidden this book and then got up on to my feet and staggered across the plain as if sorely wounded and scarcely able to drag my feet along as i had hoped no one seemed to notice me and i saw three or four other figures also making their way painfully towards where the dervishes had encamped  here were a few camels standing untended everyone had joined in the rush for bootya rush to be met with bitter disappointment for with the exception of the arms of the fallen and what few valuables they might have about their person there was nothing to be gained i diverged from the line i had been following kept on until there was a dip in the ground that would hide me from the sight of those behind then i started to run and at last threw myself down in the scrub four or five miles away from the point from which i had started  i was perfectly safe for the present the dervishes were not likely to search over miles of the desert dotted as it was with thick bushes the question was as to the future my position was almost as bad as could be i was without food or water and there were hundreds of miles of desert between me and khartoum at every water hole i should almost certainly find parties of dervishes  from time to time i lifted my head and saw several large parties of the enemy moving in the distance they were evidently bound on a journey and were not thinking of looking for me i chewed the sour leaves of the camel bush and this to some extent alleviated my thirst  i determined at last that i would in the first place march to the wells towards which we had been pressing when the dervishes came up to us they were nearly three miles south of the spot where the square had stood no doubt dervishes would be there but if discovered by them it was better to die so than of thirst  half an hour before the sun sank i started no horsemen were in sight and if any were to come along i could see them long before they could notice me knowing the general direction i was fortunate enough to get sight of the palm grove which surrounded the wells before darkness set in  it lay about two miles away and there were certainly moving objects round it i lay down until twilight had passed and then went forward when within two or three hundred yards of the grove i lay down again and waited that the dervishes would all go to sleep however long i might wait was too much to hope for they would be sure to sit and talk far into the night of the events of the last three or four days  shielding myself as well as i could by the bushes i crawled up until i was in the midst of some camels which were browsing here i stood up and then walked boldly into the grove as i had expected two or three score of dervishes were sitting in groups talking gravely they had destroyed the turks as they always called the egyptians and their infidel white leaders but had suffered heavily themselves the three hundred soudanese who had surrendered and who had taken service with the mahdi were but poor compensation for the losses they had suffered  a year ago one old sheik said i was the father of eight brave sons now they have all gone before me four of them fell in the assaults at el obeid two at baria and the last two have now been killed i shall meet them all again in the abode of the blessed and the sooner the better for i have no one left to care for  others had tales of the loss of relations and friends but i did not wait to listen further taking up a large water gourd that stood empty at the foot of one of the trees i boldly walked to the well descended the rough steps at the waters edge and drank till i could drink no longer and then filling the gourd went up again  no one noticed me had they looked at me they would have seen even in the darkness the great patches down the front of the robe but i dont think anyone did notice me other figures were moving about from group to group and i kept on through the grove until beyond the trees i came out on the side opposite to that which i had entered and as i expected found some of the dervish horses grazing among the bushes  no guard was placed over them as they were too well trained to wander far i went out to them and chose the poorest which happened to be farther among the bushes than the others i had thought the matter well over if a good horse were taken there would be furious pursuit as soon as it was missed and this might be soon for the arabs are passionately fond of their favourite horsesmore so than they are of their families while i had been waiting at the edge of the wood more than one had come out to pat and fondle his horse and give it a handful of dates but a poor animal would meet with no such attention and the fact that he was missing was not likely to be discovered till daylight probably no great search would be made for it the others would ride on and its owner might spend some hours in looking about thinking it had strayed away and was lying somewhere among the bushes  i had no thought of trying to return to khartoum the wells were far apart and dervish bands were certain to be moving along the line it seemed to me that el obeid was the safest place to go to true it was in the hands of the mahdists but doubtless many wounded would be making their way there some doubtless would have wives and children others might have come from distant villages but these would all make for the town as the only place where they could find food water and shelter  riding till morning i let the horse graze and threw myself down among the bushes intending to remain there until nightfall in the afternoon on waking from a long sleep i sat up and saw a quarter of a mile away a dervish making his way along on foot slowly and painfully this was the very chance i had hoped might occur i got up at once and walked towards him  my friend is sorely wounded i said  my journey is wellnigh ended he said i had hoped to reach el obeid but i know that i shall not arrive at the well which lies three miles away i have already fallen three times the next will be the last would that the bullet of the infidel had slain me on the spot  the poor fellow spoke with difficulty so parched were his lips and swollen his tongue i went to the bush where i had left the gourd half full of water the man was still standing where i had left him but when he saw the gourd in my hand he gave a little cry and tottered feebly towards me  let my friend drink i said i held the gourd to his lips sip a little first i said you can drink your fill afterwards  allah has sent you to save me he said and after two or three gulps of water he drew back his head now i can rest till the sun has set and then go forward as far as the well and die there  let me see your wound i said it may be that i can relieve the pain a little  he had been shot through the body and it was a marvel to me how he could have walked so far but the arabs like other wild creatures have a wonderful tenacity of life i aided him to the shelter of the thick bush then i let him have another and longer drink and bathed his wound with water tearing off a strip from the bottom of his robe i bound it round him soaking it with water over the wound he had been suffering more from thirst than from pain and he seemed stronger already  now i said you had better sleep  i have not slept since the last battle he said i started as soon as it was dark enough for me to get up without being seen by the turks i have been walking ever since and dared not lie down at first i hoped that i might get to the town where my wife lived and die in my own house but that hope left me as i grew weaker and weaker and i have only prayed for strength enough to reach the well to drink and to die there  sleep now i said be sure that i will not leave you is it not our duty to help one another when the heat is over we may go on i have a horse here which you shall ride how far is it from the well to el obeid  it is four hours journey on foot  good then you shall see your wife before morning we will stop at the well to give my horse a good drink and then if you feel well enough to go on we will not wait above an hour  may allah bless you the man said and he then closed his eyes and at once went to sleep  i lay down beside him but not to sleep i was overjoyed with my good fortune now i could enter el obeid boldly and the wounded man being a native there no questions would be asked me i had a house to go to and shelter for the present  as to what might happen afterwards i did not care to think some way of escape would surely occur in time once my position as a mahdist was fully established i should be able to join any party going towards khartoum and should avoid all questioning whereas if i were to journey alone i should be asked by every band i met where i came from and might at any moment be detected if there happened to be any from the village i should name as my abode it was all important that this poor fellow should live until at least i had been with him two days in the town  from time to time i dipped a piece of rag in the gourd squeezed a few drops of water between his lips and then laid it on his forehead when the sun began to get low i went out and caught the horse as i came up the dervish opened his eyes  i am better he said you have restored me to life my head is cool and my lips no longer parched  now i said i will lift you into the saddle you had better ride with both legs on the same side it will be better for your wound there is a mound of earth a few yards away if you will stand up on that i can lift you into the saddle easily now put your arms round my neck and i will lift you in the standing position if you try to get up yourself your wound might easily break out again  i managed better than i had expected and taking the bridle led the horse towards the well  you must tell me the way i said for i am a stranger in this part having come from the blue nile  i know it perfectly he said having been born in el obeid i fought against the mahdists till we were starved out and then as we all saw that the power of the mahdi was great and that allah was with him we did not hesitate to accept his terms and to put on his badges  in less than an hour we saw the trees that marked the position of the well and in another half hour reached it at least a score of wounded men were there many of them so sorely hurt that they would get no farther they paid little attention to us one of them was known to salehfor the wounded man told me that that was his namehe also was from el obeid he was suffering from a terrible cut in the shoulder which had almost severed the arm he told my man that it was given by one of the infidel officers before he fell  i thought it was as well to have two friends instead of one and did what i could to bind his wound up and fasten his arm firmly to his side then i said to him  my horse after three hours rest will be able to carry you both you can sit behind saleh and hold him on with your unwounded arm  truly stranger you are a merciful man and a good one wonderful is it that you should give up your horse to men who are strangers to you and walk on foot yourself  allah commands us to be compassionate to each other what is a walk of a few miles it is nothing it is not worth speaking of say no more about it i beseech you i am a stranger in el obeid and you may be able to befriend me there  three hours later abdullah which was the name of the second man mounted and assisted me to lift saleh in front of him and we set out for el obeid we got into the town at daybreak there were few people about and these paid no attention to us wounded men had been coming in in hundreds turning into the street where both the men lived we went first to the house of saleh which was at the farther end and was indeed quite in the outskirts of the place it stood in a walled enclosure and was of better appearance than i had expected  i went to the door and struck my hand against it a voice within asked what was wanted and i said i bring home the master of the house he is sorely wounded  there was a loud cry and the door opened and a woman ran out  do not touch him abdullah exclaimed we will get him down from the horse but first bring out an angareb we will lower him down onto that  the woman went in and returned with an angareb it was the usual soudan bed of wooden framework with a hide lashed across it i directed them how to lift one end against the horse so that saleh could slide down onto it  wife the arab said when this was done by the will of allah who sent this stranger to my aid i have returned alive his name is mudil i cannot tell you now what he has done for me this house is his he is more than guest he is master he has promised to remain with me till i die or am given back to life again do as he bids you in all things  abdullah would have assisted to carry the bed in but i told him that it might hurt his arm and i and the woman could do it  you had better go off at once to your own people abdullah there must be many here who understand the treatment of wounds you had better get one at once to attend to your arm  i will come again this evening the man replied i consider that i also owe my life to you and when you have stayed a while here you must come to me my wives and children will desire to thank you when i tell them how you brought me in here  is there any place where i can put my horse i asked  yes the woman replied take it to that door in the wall i will go and unfasten it  there was a shed in the garden into this i put my horse and then entered the house  most of the arab women know something of the dressing of wounds salehs wife sent out the slave to buy various drugs then she got a melon from the garden cut off the rind and mincing the fruit in small pieces squeezed out the juice and gave it to her husband to drink when she had done this she set before me a plate of pounded maize which was boiling over a little fire of sticks when we went in  it is your breakfast i said  she waved her hand  i can cook more she said it matters not if we do not eat till sunset  i sat down at once for indeed i was famishing the food had all been exhausted at the end of the first days fighting i had been more than two days without eating a morsel i have no doubt i ate ravenously for the woman without a word emptied the contents of the pot into my bowl and then went out and cut another melon for me  when the slave woman returned she boiled some of the herbs made a sort of poultice of them and placed it on the wound saleh had fallen asleep the moment he had drunk the melon juice and did not move while the poultice was being applied  the house contained three roomsthe one which served as kitchen and living room one leading from it on the right with the curtains hanging before the door this was salehs room and on the opposite side the guest chamber i have not mentioned that there were four or five children all of whom had been turned out as soon as we entered and threatened with terrible punishments by their mother if they made any noise  when i finished my meal i went into the guest chamber threw myself down on the angareb there and slept till sunset when i awoke i found that a native doctor had come and examined saleh he had approved of what the woman had done told told her to continue to poultice the wound and had given her a small phial from which she was to pour two drops into the wound morning and evening he said what i could have told her that her husband was in the hands of allah if he willed it her husband would live  of course i had seen something of wounds for in the old timesit seems a lifetime backwhen i was for two years searching tombs and monuments with the professor there had been frays between our workmen and bands of robbers and there were also many cases of injuries incurred in the work of moving heavy fragments of masonry moreover although i had no actual practice i had seen a good deal of surgical work for when i was at the university i had some idea of becoming a surgeon and attended the courses there and saw a good many operations i had therefore of course a general knowledge of the structure of the human frame and the position of the arteries  so far the wound which i examined when the woman poured in what i suppose was a styptic looked healthy and but little inflamed of course a skilled surgeon would have probed it and endeavoured to extract the ball which had not gone through the soudanese were armed only with old muskets and it was possible that the ball had not penetrated far for if as he had told me he was some distance from the square when he was hit the bullet was probably spent  i told the woman so and asked her if she had any objection to my endeavouring to find it she looked surprised  are you then a hakim  no but i have been at khartoum and have seen how the white hakims find which way a bullet has gone they are sometimes able to get it out at any rate i should not hurt him and if as is likely the ball has not gone in very farfor had it done so he would probably have died before he got homei might draw it out  you can try she said you have saved his life and it is yours  bring me the pistol that your husband had in his belt  she brought it to me i took out the ramrod  now i said it is most important that this should be clean therefore heat it in the fire so that it is red hot and then drop it into cold water  when this had been done i took a handful of sand and polished the rod till it shone and afterwards wiped it carefully with a cloth then i inserted it in the wound very gently it had entered but an inch and a half when it struck something hard which could only be the bullet it was as i had hoped the ball had been almost spent when it struck him  saleh was awake now and had at once consented to my suggestion having come to have implicit faith in me  it is you see saleh just as i had hoped i felt sure that it could not have gone in far as in that case you could never have walked twenty miles from the battlefield to the point where you met me now if i had a proper instrument i might be able to extract the bullet i might hurt you in doing so but if i could get it out you would recover speedily while if it remains where it is the wound may inflame and you will die  i am not afraid of pain mudil  i could touch the ball with my finger but beyond feeling that the flesh in which it was embedded was not solid to the touch i could do nothing towards getting the ball out i dared not try to enlarge the wound so as to get two fingers in after thinking the matter over in every way i decided that the only chance was to make a tool from the ramrod i heated this again and again flattening it with the pistol barrel till it was not more than a tenth of an inch thick then i cut from the centre a strip about a quarter of an inch wide i then rubbed down the edges of the strip on a stone till they were perfectly smooth and bent the end into a curve i again heated it to a dull red and plunged it into water to harden it and finally rubbed it with a little oil it was late in the evening before i was satisfied with my work  now saleh i said i am going to try if this will do if i had one of the tools i have seen the white hakims use i am sure i could get the ball out easily enough but i think i can succeed with this if i cannot i must make another like it so as to put one down each side of the bullet you see this curve makes a sort of hook the difficulty is to get it under the bullet  i understand he said do not mind hurting me i have seen men die of bullets even after the wound seemed to heal i know it is better to try and get it out  it was a difficult job pressing back the flesh with my finger i succeeded at last in getting the hook under the bullet this i held firmly against it and to my delight felt as i raised finger and hook together that the bullet was coming a few seconds later i held it triumphantly between my fingers  there saleh there is your enemy i think now that if there is no inflammation it will not be long before you are well and strong again  truly it is wonderful the man said gratefully i have heard of hakims who are able to draw bullets from wounds but i have never seen it done before  if saleh had been a white man i should still have felt doubtful as to his recovery but i was perfectly confident that a wound of that sort would heal well in an arab especially as it would be kept cool and clean hard exercise life in the open air entire absence of stimulating liquors and only very occasionally if ever meat diet render them almost insensible to wounds that would paralyse a white our surgeons had been astonished at the rapidity with which the wounded prisoners recovered  salehs wife had stood by as if carved in stone while i performed the operation but when i produced the bullet she burst into tears and poured blessings on my head  i am writing this on the following morning saleh has slept quietly all night his hand is cool this morning and i think i may fairly say that he is convalescent abdullahs wife came in yesterday evening and told the women here that her husband was asleep but that he would come round in the morning i warned her not to let him stir out of doors and said i would come and see him  it has taken me five hours to write this which seems a very long time to spend on details of things not worth recording but the act of writing has taken my thoughts off myself and i intend always to note down anything special it will be interesting to me to read it if i ever get away should i be unable to escape i shall charge saleh to carry it to khartoum if he ever has the chance and hand it over to the governor there to send down to cairo  a week later i am already losing count of days but days matter nothing i have been busy so busy that i have not even had time to write after i had finished my story so far salehs slave woman took me to abdullahs house i found that he was in a state of high fever but all i could do was to recommend that a wet rag should be applied and freshly wetted every quarter of an hour that his head should be kept similarly enveloped in wet bandages and that his hands should be dipped in water very frequently  when i got back i found several women waiting outside salehs house his wife had gossiped with a neighbour and told them that i had got the bullet out of his wound the news spread rapidly and these women were all there to beg that i would see their husbands  this was awkward i certainly could not calculate upon being successful in cases where a bullet had penetrated more deeply and even if i could do so i should at once excite the hostility of the native hakims and draw very much more attention upon myself than i desired in vain i protested that i was not a hakim and had done only what i had seen a white hakim do finding that this did not avail i said that i would not go to see any man except with one of the native doctors  there are two here one of the women said i will go and fetch them  no i said who am i that they should come to me i will go and see them if you will show me where they live  ah here they come she said as two dervishes approached  i went up to them and they said we hear that you are a hakim who has done great things  i am no hakim i said i was just coming to you to tell you so the man i aided was a friend and was not deeply wounded having seen a white hakim take bullets from wounded men i tried my best and as the bullet was but a short way in i succeeded if i had had the instruments i saw the infidel use it would have been easy but i had to make an instrument which sufficed for the purpose although it would have been of no use had the bullet gone in deeper  they came in and examined salehs wound the bullet and the tool i had made  it is well they said you have profited by what you saw whence do you come  i told the same story that i had told saleh  you have been some time at khartoum  not very long i said but i went down once to cairo and was there some years it was there i came to know something of the ways of the infidels i am a poor man and very ignorant but if you will allow me i will act as your assistant as i know that there are many wounded here if you will tell me what to do i will follow your instructions carefully  the two hakims looked more satisfied at finding that i was not a dangerous rival one said  among the things that have been brought in here is a box those who brought it did not know what it contained and it was too strong for them to open though of course they were able to hammer it and break it open it contained nothing but many shining instruments but the only one that we knew the purport of was a saw there were two boxes of the same shape and the other contained a number of little bottles of drugs and we thought that maybe as the boxes were alike these shining instruments were used by the white hakim  i can tell you that if i see them i said and went with them  in a house where booty of all sorts was stored i saw the chests which i knew were those carried by hickss medical officer the one contained drugs the other a variety of surgical instrumentsprobes forceps amputating knives and many other instruments of whose use i was ignorant i picked out three or four probes and forceps of different shapes  these are the instruments i said with which they take out bullets with one of these thin instruments they search the wound until they find the ball sometimes they cannot find it and even when they have found it they sometimes cannot get hold of it with any of these tools which as you see open and shut  what are the knives for  they use the knives for cutting off limbs twice have i seen this done for i was travelling with a learned hakim who was searching the tombs for relics in one case a great stone fell on a mans foot and smashed it and the hakim took it off at the ankle in another case a man had been badly wounded by a bullet in the arm he was not one of our party but hearing of the hakims skill he had made a journey of three days to him the wound was very bad and they said it was too late to save the arm so they cut it off above the elbow  and they lived  yes they both lived  could you do that  i shook my head it requires much skill i said i saw how it was done but to do it ones self is very different if there was a man who must die if an arm or a leg were not taken off i would try to save his life but i would not try unless it was clear that the man must die if it were not done  but you are learned men hakims and if you will take me as your assistant i will show you how the white doctors take out balls and if there is no other way cut off limbs and when i have once shown you you will do it far better than i  the two men seemed much pleased it was evident to them that if they could do these things it would widely add to their reputation  it is good they said you shall go round with us and see the wounded and we will see for ourselves what you can do will you want this chest carried  no i said i will take these instruments with me should it be necessary to cut off a limb to try and save life i shall need the knives the saw and this instrument which i heard the white hakim call a tourniquet and which they use for stopping the flow of blood while they are cutting there are other instruments too that will be required    chapter 18 a hakim   i succeeded in getting out two more bullets and then handed the instruments to the hakims saying that i had shown them all i knew and would now leave the matter in their hands altogether or would act as their assistant if they wished it i had no fear that harm would come of it for being so frequently engaged in war i knew that they had in a rough way considerable skill in the treatment of wounds i had impressed upon them while probing the wounds that no force must be used and that the sole object was to find the exact course the ball had taken  as to the amputations they would probably not be attempted a fighting dervish would rather die than lose a limb and were he to die under an operation his relatives would accuse the operator of having killed him  i remained at work with them for two or three days in nearly half the cases they failed to find the course of the ball but when they did so and the wound was not too deep they generally succeeded in extracting it they were highly pleased and i took great pains to remain well in the background  they were very friendly with me their fees were mostly horses or carpets or other articles in accordance with the means of the patients and of these they gave me a portion together with some money which had been looted from the chests carrying silver for the purchase of provisions and the payment of troops although they made a pretence of begging me to remain always with them i refused saying that i saw i could no longer be of assistance to them i could see they were inwardly pleased they gave me some more money and i left them saying that i did not for a moment suppose that i could tell them anything further but that if at any time they should send for me i would try and recall what i had seen the white hakims do in such a case as they were dealing with  in the meantime saleh was progressing very favourably and indeed would have been up and about had i not peremptorily ordered him to remain quiet  you are doing well i said why should you risk bringing on inflammation merely for the sake of getting about a few days earlier  abdullah was also better but still extremely weak and i had to order that meat should be boiled for some hours and that he should drink small quantities of the broth three or four times a day many times a day women came to me to ask me to see to their husbands wounds and sometimes the wounded men came to me themselves all the serious cases i referred to the hakims and confined myself simply to dressing and bandaging wounds which had grown angry for want of attention i always refused to accept fees insisting that i was not a hakim and simply afforded my help as a friend  i had the satisfaction however of doing a great deal of good for in the medicine chest i found a large supply of plaster and bandages frequently mothers brought children to me these i could have treated with some of the simple drugs in the chest but i refused to do so for i could not have explained in any satisfactory way how i knew one drug from another or was acquainted with their qualities still although i refused fees i had many little presents of fowls fruit pumpkins and other things these prevented my feeling that i was a burden upon saleh for of course i put them into the general stock  so far i cannot but look back with deep gratitude for the strange manner in which i have been enabled to avert all suspicion and even to make myself quite a popular character among the people of el obeid  one bottle i found in the medicine chest was a great prize to me it contained iodine and with a weak solution of this i was able to maintain my colour i did not care so much for my face and hands for i was so darkened by the sun that my complexion was little fairer than that of many of the arabs but i feared that an accidental display of a portion of my body usually covered by my garments would at once prove that i was a white man i had used up the stuff that i had brought with me when i escaped from the square and having no means of procuring fresh stain was getting uneasy but this discovery of the iodine put it within my power to renew my colouring whenever it was necessary  about a month later i have been living here quietly since i last wrote in this journal the day after i had done so the emir sent for me and said he had heard that i had taken bullets out of wounds and had shown the two doctors of the town how to do so by means of instruments found in a chest that was among the loot brought in from the battlefield i repeated my story to him as to how i had acquired the knowledge from being in the service of a white hakim from cairo who was travelling in the desert and that i had no other medical knowledge except that i had seen in the chest a bottle which contained stuff like that the white doctors used in order to put a patient to sleep so that they could take off a limb without his feeling pain  i have heard of such things being done by the turkish hakims at khartoum but i did not believe them it is against all reason  i have seen it done my lord i said i do not say that i could take off a limb as they did but i am sure that the stuff would put anyone to sleep  i wish you to put it to the trial the emir said one of my sons came back from the battle with a bullet hole through his hand the hakim said that two of the bones were broken he put bandages round and my son said no more about it he is a man who does not complain of slight troubles but yesterday evening the pain became so great that he was forced to mention it and when i examined his arm i found that it was greatly swelled slaves have been bathing it with cold water ever since but the pain has increased rather than diminished  i will look at it my lord but i greatly fear that it is beyond my poor skill to deal with it  the young man was brought in and on removing the bandage i saw that the wound was in a terrible state and the arm greatly inflamed some distance up the wrist it was a bad case and it seemed to me that unless something was done mortification would speedily set in  the two doctors saw it an hour ago the emir went on and they greatly fear for his life they told me that they could do nothing but that as you had seen the white hakim do wonderful things you might be able to do something  my lord i said it is one thing to watch an operation but quite another to perform it yourself i think as the doctors have told you your sons life is in great danger and i do believe that if there were white doctors here to take off his arm he might be saved but i could not undertake it the skill to do so is only acquired by long years of study how can i a poor man know how to do such things were i to attempt and fail what would you saythat i had killed your son and that but for me he might have recovered  he will not recover the emir said moodily  what say you abu you have heard what this man says what do you think  i think father that it were well to try this man has used his eyes so well that he has taken the white mans instruments and drawn out bullets from wounds i feel as if this wound will kill me therefore if the man fails i shall be none the worse indeed it would be better to die at once than to feel this fire burning till it burns me up  you hear what my son says i am of the same opinion do your best should you fail i swear by the head of the prophet that no harm shall come to you  the wounded man was a fine young fellow of three or four and twenty  if it is my lords will i will try i said but i pray you to bear in mind that i do so at your command and without much hope of accomplishing it successfully it would i think be advisable that the limb should be taken off above the elbow so that it will be above the spot to which the inflammation has extended  the emir looked at his son who said  it matters not father tis but my left arm and i shall still have my right to hurl a spear or wield a sword  i need not tell how i got through the operation everything required for itthe inhaler sponges straight and crooked needles and threadwas in the chest the young arab objected to be sent to sleep he said it might be well for cowards but not for a fighting man i had to assure him that it was not for his sake but for my own that i wished him to go to sleep and that if i knew he was not suffering pain i might be able to do the thing without my hand trembling but that if i knew he was suffering i should be flurried  i insisted that the hakims should be sent for when they came i called them to witness that at the emirs command i was going to try to do the operation i had seen the white doctor perform although i was but an ignorant man and feared greatly that i might fail i really was desperately nervous though at the same time i did feel that having seen the operation performed two or three times and as it was a simple one i ought to be able to do it of course i had everything laid handy the tourniquet was first put on the arm and screwed tightly then i administered the chloroform which took its effect speedily my nerves were braced up now and i do think i made a fair job of itfinding and tying up the arteries cutting and sawing the bone off and making a flap a few stitches to keep this together and it was done and to my relief the arab who had lain as rigid as a statue winced a little when the last stitch was put in  this was the point on which i had been most anxious i was not sure whether the amount of chloroform he had inhaled might not have been too strong for him  do not try to move i said as he opened his eyes and looked round as if trying to remember where he was  as his eyes fell upon me he said when are you going to begin  i have finished i said but you must lie quiet for some time the slightest movement now might cause the flow of blood to burst out  the emir had stood staring at his sons quiet face as if amazed beyond the power of speech four dervishes had held the patients limbs so as to prevent any accidental movement a female slave had held a large basin of warm water and another handed me the things i pointed to i had begged the hakims to keep their attention fixed on what i was doing in order that these also might see how the white doctor did such things  when his son spoke the emir gave a gasp of relief he lives he murmured as if even now he could scarcely believe that this was possible and as he put his hand upon my shoulder it trembled with emotion  truly the ways of the white infidels are marvellous abu my son allah has been merciful he must have meant that you should not die and thus have sent this man who has seen the white hakims at work to save your life  what is to be done now he went on turning to me  he should be raised very gently and clothes put under his shoulder and head then he should be carried on the angareb to the coolest place in the house he may drink a little juice of fruit but he had best eat nothing the great thing is to prevent fever coming on with your permission i will stay with him for if one of the threads you saw me tie round these little white tubes in the arm should slip or give way he would be dead in five minutes unless this machine round the arm is tightened at once and the tube that carries the blood is tied up it would be well that he should have a slave to fan him i hope he will sleep  the emir gave orders for the bed to be carried to the room adjoining his harem  his mother and his young wife will want to see him he said to me and when the danger that you speak of is past the women will care for him you will be master in the room and will give such orders as you please  then he turned off and walked hastily away i could see that he had spoken with difficulty and that in spite of his efforts to appear composed and tranquil his mouth was twitching and his eyes moist  as soon as the bed had been placed by my directions near the open window the four dervishes left the room the hakims were on the point of doing so when i said  i will stay here for a few minutes and will then come out and talk this matter over with you i have been fortunate indeed in remembering so well what i saw i heard a white hakim explain how he did each thing and why to the sheik of the wounded mans party and i will tell you what i remember of it and you with your wisdom in these matters will be able to do it far better than i  when they had retired the door leading into the harem opened and a woman slightly veiled followed by a younger woman and two slave girls came in i stopped her as she was hurrying towards her son  lady i said i pray you to speak very quietly and in few words it is most important that he should not be excited in any way but should be kept perfectly quiet for the next two or three days  i will do so she said may i touch him  you may take his hand in yours but do not let him move i will leave you with him for a few minutes please remember that everything depends upon his not being agitated  i went out and joined the hakims  truly mudil allah has given you strange gifts one of them said wonderful is it that you should have remembered so well what you saw and more wonderful still is it that you should have the firmness to cut and saw flesh and bone as if they were those of a dead sheep with the emir standing by to look at you  i knew that his life and perhaps mine depended upon it the emir would have kept his oath i doubt not but when it became known in the town that abu who is known to all for his bravery and goodness died in my hands it would not have been safe for me to leave this house  i then explained the reason for each step that i took they listened most attentively and asked several questions showing that they were intensely interested and most anxious to be able to perform so wonderful an operation themselves they were greatly surprised at the fact that so little blood flowed  it seems i said from what i heard the white hakim say that the blood flowed through those little white tubes by twisting the tourniquet very tight that flow of blood is stopped the great thing is to find those little tubes and tie them up as you would notice the large ones in the inside of the arm could be seen quite plainly when they cannot be seen the screw is unloosed so as to allow a small quantity of blood to flow which shows you where the tubes are you will remember that i took hold of each with the bent point of a small wire or a pair of these nippers and while you held it tied the thread tightly round it when that is done one is ready to cut the bone you saw me push the flesh back so as to cut the bone as high up as possible that is because the white doctor said the flesh would shrink up and the bone would project i cut the flesh straight on one side and on the other with a flap that will when it is stitched cover over the bone and the rest of the flesh and make what the hakim called a pad he said all cutting off of limbs was done in this way but of course the tubes would not lie in the same place and the cutting would have to be made differently but it was all the same system he called these simple operations and said that anyone with a firm hand and a knowledge of where these tubes lie ought to be able to do it after seeing it done once or twice he said of course it would not be so neatly done as by men who had been trained to it but that in cases of extreme necessity anyone who had seen it done once or twice and had sufficient nerve could do it especially if they had ready at hand this stuff that makes the wounded man sleep and feel no pain  i listened very attentively because all seemed to me almost like magic but i certainly did not think that i should ever have to do such a thing myself  but what would be done if they had not that sleep medicine  the hakim said that in that case the wounded man would have to be fastened down by bandages to the bed and held by six strong men so that he could not move in the slightest however there is enough of that stuff to last a hundred times or more for as you see only a goodsized spoonful was used  the emir who had passed through the harem rooms now opened the door  come in he said my son is quiet and has not moved he has spoken to his mother and seems quite sensible is there anything more for you to do to him  i will put a bandage loosely round his arm and bind it to his body so that he cannot move it in his sleep or on first waking it will not be necessary for me to stay with him as the ladies of the harem can look after him but i must remain in the next room so as to be ready to run in at once should they see that the wound is bleeding again i have asked the hakims to make a soothing potion to aid him to sleep long and soundly  as i went up to the side of the bed abu smiled i bent down to him and he said in a low voice  all the pain has gone may allah bless you  i am afraid that you will feel more pain tomorrow but i do not think it will be so bad as it was before now i hope you will try to go to sleep you will be well looked after and i shall be in the next room if you want me the hakims will give you a soothing draught soon and you can have cool drinks when you want them  things went on as well as i could have wished in four or five days the threads came away and i loosened the tourniquet slightly and strapped up the edges of the wound which were already showing signs of healing for the first twentyfour hours i had remained always on watch after that the hakims took their turns i remaining in readiness to tighten up the tourniquet should there be any rush of blood i did not leave the emirs house but slept in a room close by that of the patient  there was now however no longer need for my doing so the splendid constitution of the young baggara had indeed from the first rendered any attendance unnecessary there was no fever and very little local inflammation and i was able to gladden his heart by telling him that in another fortnight he would be able to be up  the day i was intending to leave the emir sent for me he was alone  the more i think over this matter he said the more strange it is that you should be able to do all these wonderful things after having seen it done once by the white hakim the more i think of it the more certain i feel that you are not what you seem i have sent for saleh and abdullah they have told me what you did for them and that you gave up your horse to them and dressed their wounds and brought them in here they are full of praise of your goodness and but few of my people would have thus acted for strangers they would have given them a drink of water and ridden on  now tell me frankly and without fear i have thought it over and i feel sure that you yourself are a white hakim who escaped from the battle in which hickss army was destroyed  i am not a hakim all that i said was truethat although i have seen operations performed i have never performed them myself as to the rest i answer you frankly i am an englishman i did escape when the black soudanese battalion surrendered three days after the battle i was not a fighting officer i was with them as interpreter i may say that though i am not a hakim i did for some time study with the intention of becoming one and so saw many operations performed  i am glad that you told me the emir said gravely your people are brave and very wise though they cannot stand against the power of the mahdi but were you sheitan himself it would be nothing to me you have saved my sons life you are the honoured guest of my house your religion is different from mine but as you showed that you were willing to aid followers of the prophet and the mahdi although they were your enemies surely i for whom you have done so much may well forget that difference  i thank you emir from what i had seen of you i felt sure that my secret would be safe with you we christians feel no enmity against followers of mahometthe hatred is all on your side and yet tis strange the allah that you worship and the god of the christians is one and the same mahomet himself had no enmity against the christians and regarded our christ as a great prophet like himself  our queen reigns in india over many more mohamedans than are ruled by the sultan of turkey they are loyal to her and know that under her sway no difference is made between them and her christian subjects and have fought as bravely for her as her own white troops  i had never thought the emir said that the time would come when i should call an infidel my friend but now that i can do so i feel that there is much in what you say however your secret must be kept were it known that you are a white man you would be torn to pieces in the streets and even were you to remain here where assuredly none would dare touch you the news would speedily travel to my lord the mahdi and he would send a troop of horse to bring you to him therefore though i would fain honour you i see that it is best that you should to all save myself continue to be mudil i will not even as i would otherwise have done assign you a house and slaves and horses in token of my gratitude to you for having saved the life of my son  something i must do or i should seem utterly ungrateful i can at any rate give you rooms here and treat you as an honoured guest this would excite no remark as it would be naturally expected that you would stay here until my son is perfectly cured i shall tell no one not even my wife but abu i will tell when he is cured and the secret will be as safe with him as with me i think it would please him to know although a baggara like myself and as brave as any he is strangely gentle in disposition and though ready and eager to fight when attacked by other tribes he does not care to go on expeditions against villages which have not acknowledged the power of the mahdi and makes every excuse to avoid doing so it will please him to know that the man who has saved his life is one who although of a different race and religion is willing to do kindness to an enemy and will love and honour you more for knowing it  i thank you deeply emir and anything that i can do for members of your family i shall be glad to do i have a knowledge of the usages of many of the drugs in the chest that was brought here i have not dared to say so before because i could not have accounted for knowing such things  so at present i am installed in the emirs palace and my prospects grow brighter and brighter after the great victory the mahdi has won it is likely that he will be emboldened to advance against khartoum in that case he will no doubt summon his followers from all parts and i shall be able to ride with the emir or his son and it will be hard if when we get near the city i cannot find some opportunity of slipping off and making my way there whether it will be prudent to do so is another question for i doubt whether the egyptian troops there will offer any resolute resistance to the dervish hosts and in that case i should have to endeavour to make my way down to dongola and from there either by boat or by the river bank to assouan  a month later i have not written for some time because there has been nothing special to put down all the little details of the life here can be told to my dear wife if i should ever see her again but they are not of sufficient interest to write down i have been living at the emirs house ever since i do not know what special office i am supposed to occupy in his householdthat is what office the people in general think that i hold in fact i am his guest and an honoured one when he goes out i ride beside him and abu who has now sufficiently recovered to sit his horse i consider myself as medical attendant in ordinary to him and his family i have given up all practice in the townin the first place because i do not wish to make enemies of the two doctors who really seem very good fellows and i am glad to find that they have performed two or three operations successfully and in the second place were i to go about trying to cure the sick people would get so interested in me that i should be continually questioned as to how i attained my marvellous skill happily though no doubt they must have felt somewhat jealous at my success with abu i have been able to do the hakims some service put fees into their pockets and at the same time benefited poor people here i have told them that just as i recognized the bottle of chloroform so i have recognized some of the bottles from which the white hakims used to give powder to sick people  for instance i said you see this bottle which is of a different shape from the others it is full of a white featherylooking powder they used to give this to people suffering from feverabout as much as you could put on your nail for men and women and half as much for children they used to put it in a little water and stir it up and give it to them night and morning they call it kena or something like that it did a great deal of good and generally drove away the fever  this other bottle they also used a good deal they put a little of its contents in water and it made a lotion for weak and sore eyes they called it zing they saw i was a careful man and i often made the eye wash and put the other white powder up into little packets when they were busy as fever and ophthalmia are the two most common complaints among the natives  the hakims were immensely pleased and both told me afterwards that both these medicines had done wonders i told them that i thought there were some more bottles of these medicines in the chest and that when they had finished those i had now given them i would look out for the others i had in fact carried off a bottle both of quinine and zinc powder for my own use and with the latter i greatly benefited several of the emirs children and grandchildren all of whom were suffering from ophthalmia or from sore eyes that would speedily have developed that disease if they had not been attended to  i had only performed one operation which was essentially a minor one abu told me that his wife of whom he was very fond was suffering very great pain from a toothcould i cure her  i said that without seeing the tooth i could not do anything and he at once said  as it is for her good mudil i will bring her into this room and she shall unveil so that you can examine the tooth  she was quite a girl and for an arab very good looking she and the emirs wife were continually sending me out choice bits from their dinner but i had not before seen her face she was evidently a good deal confused at thus unveiling before a man but abu said  it is with my permission that you unveil therefore there can be no harm in it besides has not mudil saved my life and so become my brother  he opened her mouth the tooth was far back and broken and the gum was greatly swelled  it is very bad i said to abu it would hurt her terribly if i were to try and take it out but if she will take the sleeping medicine i gave you i think that i could do it  then she shall take it he said at once it is not unpleasant on the contrary i dreamt a pleasant dream while you were taking off my arm please do it at once  i at once fetched the chloroform the inhaler and a pair of forceps which looked well suited for the purpose and probably were intended for it i then told her to lie down on the angareb which i placed close to the window  now abu i said directly she has gone off to sleep you must force her mouth open and put the handle of your dagger between her teeth it will not hurt her at all but i cannot get at the tooth unless the mouth is open and we cannot open it until she is asleep for the whole side of her face is swollen and the jaw almost stiff  the chloroform took effect very quickly her husband had some difficulty in forcing the mouth open when he had once done so i took a firm hold of the tooth and wrenched it out  you can withdraw the dagger i said and then lift her up and let her rinse her mouth well with the warm water i brought in she will have little pain afterwards though of course it will take some little time before the swelling goes down  then i went out and left them together in a few minutes abu came out  she has no pain he said she could hardly believe when she came round that the tooth was out it is a relief indeed she has cried day and night for the past three days  tell her that for the rest of the day she had better keep quiet and go to sleep if possible which i have no doubt she will do as she must be worn out with the pain she has been suffering  i begin to see mudil that we are very ignorant we can fight but that is all we are good for how much better it would be if instead of regarding you white men as enemies we could get some of you to live here and teach us the wonderful things that you know  truly it would be better i said it all depends upon yourselves you have a great country if you would but treat the poor people here well and live in peace with other tribes and send word down to cairo that you desire above all things white hakims and others who would teach you to come up and settle among you assuredly they would come there are thousands of white men and women working in india and china and other countries content to do good not looking for high pay but content to live poorly the difficulty is not in getting men willing to heal and to teach but to persuade those whom they would benefit to allow them to do the work  abu shook his head  that is it he said i would rather be able to do such things as you do than be one of the most famous soldiers of the mahdi but i could never persuade others they say that the mahdi himself although he is hostile to the turks and would conquer egypt would willingly befriend white men but even he powerful as he is cannot go against the feelings of his emirs must we always be ignorant must we always be fighting i can see no way out of it can you mudil  i can see but one way i said and that may seem to you impossible because you know nothing of the strength of england we have as you know easily beaten the egyptian army and we are now protectors of egypt if you invade that country as the mahdi has already threatened to do it is we who will defend it and if there is no other way of obtaining peace we shall some day send an army to recover the soudan you will fight and you will fight desperately but you have no idea of the force that will advance against you you know how osman dignas tribes on the red sea have been defeated not by the superior courage of our men but by our superior arms and so it will be here it may be many years before it comes about but if you insist on war that is what will come  then when we have taken the soudan there will come peace and the peasant will till his soil in safety those who desire to be taught will be taught great canals from the nile will irrigate the soil and the desert will become fruitful  you really think that would come of it abu asked earnestly  i do indeed abu we have conquered many brave peoples far more numerous than yours and those who were our bitterest enemies now see how they have benefited by it certainly england would not undertake the cost of such an expedition lightly but if she is driven to it by your advance against egypt she will assuredly do so your peoplei mean the baggaras and their allieswould suffer terribly but the people whom you have conquered whose villages you have burned whose women you have carried off would rejoice  we would fight abu said passionately  certainly you would fight and fight gallantly but it would not avail you besides abu you would be fighting for that ignorance you have just regretted and against the teaching and progress you have wished for  it is hard abu said quietly  it is hard but it has been the fate of all people who have resisted the advance of knowledge and civilization those who accept civilization as the people of indiaof whom there are many more than in all africahave accepted it are prosperous in america and other great countries far beyond the seas the native indians opposed it but in vain and now a great white race inhabit the land and there is but a handful left of those who opposed them  these things are hard to understand if as you say your people come here some day to fight against us i shall fight if my people are defeated and i am still alive i shall say it is the will of allah let us make the best of it and try to learn to be like those who have conquered us i own to you that i am sick of bloodshednot of blood shed in battle but the blood of peaceful villagers and though i grieve for my own people i should feel that it was for the good of the land that the white men had become the masters    chapter 19 the last page   khartoum september 3rd 1884  it is a long time since i made my last entry i could put no date to it then and till yesterday could hardly even have named the month i am back again among friends but i can hardly say that i am safer here than i was at el obeid i have not written because there was nothing to write one day was like another and as my paper was finished and there were no incidents in my life i let the matter slide  again and again i contemplated attempting to make my way to this town but the difficulties would be enormous there were the dangers of the desert the absence of wells the enormous probability of losing my way and most of all the chance that before i reached khartoum it would have been captured the emir had been expecting news of its fall for months  there had been several fights in some of which they had been victorious in others even according to their own accounts they had been worsted traitors in the town kept them well informed of the state of supplies they declared that these were almost exhausted and that the garrison must surrender indeed several of the commanders of bodies of troops had offered to surrender posts held by them  so i had put aside all hope of escape and decided not to make any attempt until after khartoum fell when the dervishes boasted they would march down and conquer egypt to the sea  they had already taken berber dongola was at their mercy i thought the best chance would be to go down with them as far as they went and then to slip away in this way i should shorten the journey i should have to traverse alone and being on the river bank could at least always obtain water besides i might possibly secure some small native boat and with the help of the current get down to assouan before the dervishes could arrive there this i should have attempted but three weeks ago an order came from the mahdi to el khatim ordering him to send to omdurman five hundred wellarmed men who were to be commanded by his son abu khatim was to remain at el obeid with the main body of his force until further orders  abu came to me at once with the news  you will take me with you abu i exclaimed this is the chance i have been hoping for once within a days journey of khartoum i could slip away at night and it would be very hard if i could not manage to cross the nile into khartoum  i will take you if you wish it he said the danger will be very great not in going with me but in making your way into khartoum  it does not seem to me that it would be so i said i should strike the river four or five miles above the town cut a bundle of rushes swim out to the middle of the river drift down till i was close to the town and then swim across  so be it he said it is your will not mine  khatim came to me afterwards and advised me to stay but i said that it might be years before i had another chance to escape and that whatever risk there was i would prefer running it  then we shall see you no more he said for khartoum will assuredly fall and you will be killed  if you were a prisoner in the hands of the white soldiers emir i said i am sure that you would run any risk if there was a chance of getting home again so it is with me i have a wife and child in cairo her heart must be sick with pain at the thought of my death i will risk anything to get back as soon as possible if i reach khartoum and it is afterwards captured i can disguise myself and appear as i now am hide for a while and then find out where abu is and join him again but perhaps when he sees that no further resistance can be made general gordon will embark on one of his steamers and go down the river knowing that it would be better for the people of the town that the mahdi should enter without opposition in which case you would scarcely do harm to the peaceful portion of the population or to the troops who had laid down their arms  very well the emir said abu has told me that he has tried to dissuade you but that you will go we owe you a great debt of gratitude for all that you have done for us and therefore i will not try to dissuade you i trust allah will protect you  and so we started the next morning i rode by the side of abu and as all knew that i was the hakim who had taken off his arm none wondered the journey was made without any incident worth recording abu did not hurry we made a long march between each of the wells and then halted for a day so we journeyed until we made our last halt before arriving at omdurman  you are still determined to go abu said to me  i shall leave tonight my friend  i shall not forget all that you have told me about your people hakim should any white man fall into my hands i will spare him for your sake these are evil times and i regret all that has passed i believe that the mahdi is a prophet but i fear that in many things he has misunderstood the visions and orders he received i see that evil rather than good has fallen upon the land and that though we loved not the rule of the egyptians we were all better off under it than we are now we pass through ruined villages and see the skeletons of many people we know that where the waterwheels formerly spread the water from the rivers over the fields is now a desert and that except the fighting men the people perish from hunger  all this is bad i see that if we enter egypt we shall be like a flight of locusts we shall eat up the country and leave a desert behind us surely this cannot be according to the wishes of allah who is all merciful you have taught me much in your talks with me and i do not see things as i used to so much do i feel it that in my heart i could almost wish that your countrymen should come here and establish peace and order  the mohamedans of india you tell me are well content with their rulers men may exercise their religion and their customs without hindrance they know that the strong cannot prey upon the weak and each man reaps what he has sown in peace you tell me that india was like the soudan before you went therethat there were great conquerors constant wars and the peasants starved while the robbers grew rich and that under your rule peace and contentment were restored i would that it could be so here but it seems to me impossible that we should be conquered by people so far away  i hope that it will be so abu and i think that if the great and good white general governor gordon is murdered at khartoum the people of my country will never rest until his death has been avenged  you had better take your horse he said if you were to go on foot it would be seen that there was a horse without a rider and there would be a search for you but if you and your horse are missing it will be supposed that you have ridden on to omdurman to give notice of our coming and none will think more of the matter  as soon as the camp was asleep i said goodbye to abu and took my horse by the reins and led him into the desert half a mile away then i mounted and rode fast the stars were guide enough and in three hours i reached the nile i took off the horses saddle and bridle and left him to himself then i crept out and cut a bundle of rushes and swam into the stream with them  after floating down the river for an hour i saw the light of a few fires on the right bank and guessed that this was a dervish force beleaguering khartoum from that side i drifted on for another hour drawing closer and closer to the shore until i could see walls and forts then i stripped off my dervish frock and swam ashore  i had during the time we had been on the journey abstained from staining my skin under my garments in order that i might be recognized as a white man as soon as i bared my arms  i lay down till it was broad daylight and then walked up to the foot of a redoubt there were shouts of surprise from the black soldiers there as i approached i shouted to them in arabic that i was an englishman and two or three of them at once ran down the slope and aided me to climb it i was taken at my request to general gordon who was surprised indeed when i told him that i was a survivor of hickss force and had been living nine months at el obeid  you are heartily welcome sir he said but i fear that you have come into an even greater danger than you have left for our position here is wellnigh desperate for months i have been praying for aid from england and my last news was that it was just setting out so i fear there is no hope that it will reach me in time the government of england will have to answer before god for their desertion of me and of the poor people here whom they sent me to protect from the mahdi  for myself i am content i have done my duty as far as lay in my power but i had a right to rely upon receiving support from those who sent me i am in the hands of god but for the many thousands who trusted in me and remained here i feel very deeply  now the first thing is to provide you with clothes i am expecting colonel stewart here every minute and he will see that you are made comfortable  i shall be glad to place myself at your disposal sir i said i speak arabic fluently and shall be ready to perform any service of which i may be capable  i thank you he said and will avail myself of your offer if i see any occasion but at present we have rather to suffer than to do we have occasional fights but of late the attacks have been feeble and i think that the mahdi depends upon hunger rather than force to obtain possession of this town  this evening i will ask you to tell me your story colonel stewart will show you a room there is only one other white manmr powerhere we live together as one family of which you will now be a member  i felt strange when i came to put on my european clothes mr power who tells me he has been here for some years as correspondent of the times has this afternoon taken me round the defences and into the workshops i think the place can resist any attacks if the troops remain faithful but of this there is a doubt a good many of the soudanese have already been sent away as gordon said at dinner this evening if he had but a score of english officers he would be perfectly confident that he could resist any enemy save starvation  september 12th  it has been settled that colonel stewart and mr power are to go down the river in the abbas and i am to go with them the general proposed it to me i said that i could not think of leaving him here by himself so he said kindly  i thank you mr hilliard but you could do no good here and would only be throwing away your life we can hold on to the end of the year though the pinch will be very severe but i think we can make the stores last till then but by the end of december our last crust will have been eaten and the end will have come it will be a satisfaction to me to know that i have done my best and fail only because of the miserable delays and hesitation of government  so it is settled that i am going the gunboats are to escort us for some distance were it not for gordon i should feel delighted at the prospect it is horrible to leave himone of the noblest englishmenalone to his fate my only consolation is that if i remained i could not avert it but should only be a sharer in it  september 18th  we left khartoum on the 14th and came down without any serious trouble until this morning when the boat struck on a rock in the cataract opposite a village called hebbeh a hole has been knocked in her bottom and there is not a shadow of hope of getting her off numbers of the natives have gathered on the shore i have advised that we should disregard their invitations to land but that as there would be no animosity against the black crew they would be safe and that we three whites should take the ships boat and four of the crew put provisions for a week on board and make our way down the river colonel stewart however feels convinced that the people can be trusted and that we had better land and place ourselves under the protection of the sheik he does not know the arabs as well as i do  however as he has determined to go ashore i can do nothing i consider it unlikely in the extreme that there will be any additions to this journal if at any time in the future this should fall into the hands of any of my countrymen i pray that they will send it down to my dear wife mrs hilliard whom i pray god may bless and comfort care of the manager of the bank cairo    chapter 20 a momentous communication   gregory had after finishing the record sat without moving until the dinner hour it was a relief to him to know that his father had not spent the last years of his life as he had feared as a miserable slaveill treated reviled insulted perhaps chained and beaten by some brutal taskmaster but had been in a position where save that he was an exile kept from his home and wife his lot had not been unbearable he knew more of him than he had ever known before it was as a husband that his mother had always spoken of him but here he saw that he was daring full of resource quick to grasp any opportunity hopeful and yet patient longing eagerly to rejoin his wife and yet content to wait until the chances should be all in his favour he was unaffectedly glad thus to know him to be able in future to think of him as one of whom he would have been proud who would assuredly have won his way to distinction  it was not so that he had before thought of him his mother had said that he was of good family and that it was on account of his marriage with her that he had quarrelled with his relations it had always seemed strange to him that he should have been content to take as she had told him an altogether subordinate position in a mercantile house in alexandria she had accounted for his knowledge of arabic by the fact that he had been for two years exploring the temples and tombs of egypt with a learned professor but surely as a man of good family he could have found something to do in england instead of coming out to take so humble a post in egypt  gregory knew nothing of the difficulty that a young man in england has in obtaining an appointment of any kind or of fighting his way single handed influence went for much in egypt and it seemed to him that even if his father had quarrelled with his own people there must have been many ways open to him of maintaining himself honourably therefore he had always thought that although he might have been all that his mother described himthe tenderest and most loving of husbands a gentleman and estimable in all respectshis father must have been wanting in energy and ambition deficient in the qualities that would fit him to fight his own battle and content to gain a mere competence instead of struggling hard to make his way up the ladder he had accounted for his going up as interpreter with hicks pasha by the fact that his work with the contractor was at an end and that he saw no other opening for himself  he now understood how mistaken he had been in his estimate of his fathers character and wondered even more than before why he should have taken that humble post at alexandria his mother had certainly told him again and again that he had done so simply because the doctors had said that she could not live in england but surely in all the wide empire of england there must be innumerable posts that a gentleman could obtain perhaps he should understand it better some day at present it seemed unaccountable to him he felt sure that had he lived his father would have made a name for himself and that it was in that hope and not of the pay that he would receive as an interpreter that he had gone up with hicks and that had he not died at that little village by the nile he would assuredly have done so for the narrative he had left behind him would in itself if published have shown what stuff there was in him  it was hard that fate should have snatched him away just when it had seemed that his trials were over that he was on the point of being reunited to his wife still it was a consolation to know he had died suddenly as one falls in battle not as a slave worn out by grief and suffering  as he left his hut he said to zaki  i shall not want you again this evening but mind we must be on the move at daylight  you did not say whether we were to take the horses master but i suppose you will do so  oh i forgot to tell you that we are going to have camels they are to be put on board for us tonight they are fast camels and as the distance from the point where we shall land to the atbara will not be more than seventy or eighty miles we shall be able to do it in a day  that will be very good master camels are much better than horses for the desert i have got everything else ready  after dinner was over the party broke up quickly as many of the officers had preparations to make gregory went off to the tent of the officer with whom he was best acquainted in the soudanese regiment  i thought that i would come and have a chat with you if you happened to be in  i shall be very glad but i bar fashoda one is quite sick of the name  no it was not fashoda that i was going to talk to you about i want to ask you something about england i know really nothing about it for i was born in alexandria shortly after my parents came out from england  is it easy for anyone who has been well educated and who is a gentleman to get employment there i mean some sort of appointment say in india or the west indies  easy my dear hilliard the camel in the eye of a needle is a joke to it if a fellow is eighteen and has had a firstrate education and a good private coach that is a tutor he may pass through his examination either for the army or the civil service or the indian service there are about five hundred go up to each examination and seventy or eighty at the outside get in the other four hundred or so are chucked some examinations are for fellows under nineteen others are open for a year or two longer suppose finally you dont get in that is to say when you are twoandtwenty your chance of getting any appointment whatever in the public service is at an end  then interest has nothing to do with it  well yes there are a few berths in the foreign office for example in which a man has to get a nomination before going in for the exam but of course the age limit tells there as well as in any other  and if a man fails altogether what is there open to him  the other shrugged his shoulders  well as far as i know if he hasnt capital he can emigrate that is what numbers of fellows do if he has interest he can get a commission in the militia and from that possibly into the line or he can enlist as a private for the same object there is a third alternative he can hang himself of course if he happens to have a relation in the city he can get a clerkship but that alternative i should say is worse than the third  but i suppose he might be a doctor a clergyman or a lawyer  i dont know much about those matters but i do know that it takes about five years grinding and what is called walking the hospitals that is going round the wards with the surgeons before one is licensed to kill i think but i am not sure that three years at the bar would admit you to practice and usually another seven or eight years are spent before you earn a penny as for the church you have to go through the university or one of the places we call training colleges and when at last you are ordained you may reckon unless you have great family interest on remaining a curate with perhaps one hundred or one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for eighteen or twenty years  and no amount of energy will enable a man of say fourandtwenty without a profession to obtain a post on which he could live with some degree of comfort  i dont think energy would have anything to do with it you cannot drop into a merchants office and say i want a snug berth out in china or i should like an agency in mesopotamia if you have luck anything is possible if you havent luck you ought to fall back on my three alternativesemigrate enlist or hang yourself of course you can sponge on your friends for a year or two if you are mean enough to do so but there is an end to that sort of thing in time  may i ask why you put the question hilliard you have really a splendid opening here you are surely not going to be foolish enough to chuck it with the idea of returning to england and taking anything that may turn up  no i am not so foolish as that i have had as you say luckextraordinary luckand i have quite made up my mind to stay in the service no i am really asking you because i know so little of england that i wondered how men who had a fair education but no family interest did get on  they very rarely do get on the other said of course if they are inventive geniuses they may discover somethingan engine for example that will do twice the work with half the consumption of fuel that any other engine will do or if chemically inclined they may discover something that will revolutionize dyeing for example but not one man in a thousand is a genius and as a rule the man you are speaking ofthe ordinary public school and varsity manif he has no interest and is not bent upon entering the army even as a private emigrates if he hasnt sufficient income to live upon at home  thank you i had no idea it was so difficult to make a living in england or to obtain employment for a welleducated man of two or three and twenty  my dear hilliard that is the problem that is exercising the minds of the whole of the middle class of england with sons growing up of course men of business can take their sons into their own offices and train them to their own profession but after all if a man has four or five sons he cannot take them all into his office with a view to partnership he may take one but the others have to make their own way somehow  they chatted now upon the war the dates upon which the various regiments would go down and the chance of the khalifa collecting another army and trying conclusions with the invaders again at last gregory got up and went back to his hut he could now understand why his father having quarrelled with his family might have found himself obliged to take the first post that was offered however humble in order to obtain the advantage of a warm climate for his wife  he must have felt it awfully he mused if he had been the sort of man i had always thought him he could have settled down to the life but now i know him better i can understand that it must have been terrible for him and he would be glad to exchange it for the interpretership where he would have some chance of distinguishing himself or at any rate of taking part in exciting events  i will open that packet but from what my mother said i do not think it will be of any interest to me now i fancy by what she said that it contained simply my fathers instructions as to what she was to do in the event of his death during the campaign i dont see what else it can be  he drew the curtains he had rigged up at the doorway and window to keep out insects lighted his lantern and then sitting down on the ground by his bed opened the packet his mother had given him the outer cover was in her handwriting  my dearest boy  i have as i told you kept the enclosed packet which is not to be opened until i have certain news of your fathers death this news i trust you will some day obtain as you see the enclosed packet is directed to me i do not think that you will find in it anything of importance to yourself it probably contains only directions and advice for my guidance in case i should determine to return to england i have been the less anxious to open it because i have been convinced that it is so for of course i know the circumstances of his family and there could be nothing new that he could write to me on that score  i have told you that he quarrelled with his father because he chose to marry me as you have heard from me i was the daughter of a clergyman and at his death took a post as governess your father fell in love with me he was the son of the honorable james hartley who was brother to the earl of langdale your father had an elder brother mr hartley was a man of the type now happily less common than it was twenty years ago he had but a younger brothers portion and a small estate that had belonged to his mother but he was as proud as if he had been a peer of the realm and owner of a county i do not know exactly what the law of england iswhether at the death of his brother your grandfather would have inherited the title or not i never talked on this subject with your father who very seldom alluded to matters at home he had also two sisters  as he was clever and had already gained some reputation by his explorations in egypt and was moreover an exceptionally handsome manat least i thought soyour grandfather made up his mind that he would make a very good marriage when he learned of your fathers affection for me he was absolutely furious told his son that he never wished to see him again and spoke of me in a manner that gregory resented and as a result they quarrelled  your father left the house never to enter it again i would have released him from his promise but he would not hear of it and we were married he had written for magazines and newspapers on egyptian subjects and thought that he could make a living for us both with his pen but unhappily he found that great numbers of men were trying to do the same and that although his papers on egyptian discoveries had always been accepted it was quite another thing when he came to write on general subjects  we had a hard time of it but we were very happy nevertheless then came the time when my health began to give way i had a terrible cough and the doctor said that i must have a change to a warmer climate we were very poor thenso poor that we had only a few shillings left and lived in one room your father saw an advertisement for a man to go out to the branch of a london firm at alexandria without saying a word to me he went and obtained it thanks to his knowledge of arabic  he was getting on well in the firm when the bombardment of alexandria took place the offices and stores of his employers were burned and as it would take many months before they could be rebuilt the employees were ordered home but any who chose to stay were permitted to do so and received three months pay your father saw that there would be many chances when the country settled down and so took a post under a contractor of meat for the army  we moved to cairo shortly after our arrival there he was as he thought fortunate in obtaining the appointment of an interpreter with hicks pasha i did not try to dissuade him everyone supposed that the egyptian troops would easily defeat the dervishes there was some danger of course but it seemed to me as it did to him that this opening would lead to better things and that when the rebellion was put down he would be able to obtain some good civil appointment in the soudan it was not the thought of his pay as interpreter that weighed in the slightest with either of us i was anxious above all things that he should be restored to a position where he could associate with gentlemen as one of themselves and could again take his real name  gregory started as he read this he had never had an idea that the name he bore was not rightly his own and even the statement of his grandfathers name had not struck him as affecting himself  your father had an honourable pride in his name which was an old one and when he took the post at alexandria which was little above that of an ordinary office messenger he did not care that he should be recognized or that one of his name should be known to be occupying such a station he did not change his name he simply dropped the surname his full name was gregory hilliard hartley he had always intended when he had made a position for himself to recur to it and of course it will be open to you to do so also but i know that it would have been his wish that you like him should not do so unless you had made such a position for yourself that you would be a credit to it  on starting your father left me to decide whether i should go home i imagine that the packet merely contains his views on that subject he knew what mine were i would rather have begged my bread than have gone back to ask for alms of the man who treated his son so cruelly it is probable that by this time the old man is dead but i should object as much to have to appeal to my husbands brother a character i disliked although he knew that his fathers means were small he was extravagant to the last degree and the old man was weak enough to keep himself in perpetual difficulties to satisfy his son your father looked for no pecuniary assistance from his brother but the latter might at least have come to see him or written kindly to him when he was in london as your father was writing in his own name for magazines his address could be easily found out by anyone who wanted to know it he never sent one single word to him and i should object quite as much to appeal to him as to the old man  as to the sisters who were younger than my husband they were nice girls but even if your grandfather is dead and has as no doubt would be the case left what he had between them it certainly would not amount to much your father has told me that the old man had mortgaged the estate up to the hilt to pay his brothers debts and that when it came to be sold as it probably would be at his death there would be very little left for the girls therefore certainly i could not go and ask them to support us  my hope is my dear boy that you may be able to make your way here in the same manner as your father was doing when he fell and that someday you may attain to an honourable position in which you will be able if you visit england to call upon your aunts not as one who has anything to ask of them but as a relative of whom they need not feel in any way ashamed  i feel that my end is very near gregory i hope to say all that i have to say to you before it comes but i may not have an opportunity and in that case some time may elapse before you read this and it will come to you as a voice from the grave i am not in any way wishing to bind you to any course of action but only to explain fully your position to you and to tell you my thoughts  god bless you my dear boy prosper and keep you i know enough of you to be sure that whatever your course may be you will bear yourself as a true gentleman worthy of your father and of the name you bear  your loving mother  gregory sat for some time before opening the other enclosure it contained an open envelope on which was written to my wife and three others also unfastened addressed respectively the hon james hartley kings lawn tavistock devon the second g hilliard hartley esquire the albany piccadilly london the third miss hartley the address being the same as that of her father he first opened the one to his mother  my dearest wife  i hope that you will never read these lines but that i shall return to you safe and soundi am writing this in case it should be otherwiseand that you will never have occasion to read these instructions or rather i should say this advice for it is no more than that we did talk the matter over but you were so wholly averse from any idea of ever appealing to my father or family however sore the straits to which you might be reduced that i could not urge the matter upon you and yet although i sympathize most thoroughly with your feelings i think that in case of dire necessity you should do so and at least afford my father the opportunity of making up for his treatment of myself the small sum that i left in your hands must soon be exhausted if i am killed you will perhaps obtain a small pension but this assuredly would not be sufficient to maintain you and the boy in comfort i know that you said at the time that possibly you could add to it by teaching should this be so you may be able to remain in egypt and when the boy grows up he will obtain employment of some sort here  but should you be unsuccessful in this direction i do not see what you could do were you to go to england with the child what chance would you have of obtaining employment there without friends or references i am frightened at the prospect i know that were you alone you would do anything rather than apply to my people but you have the child to think of and painful as it would be to you it yet seems to me the best thing that could be done at any rate i enclose you three letters to my brother father and sisters i have no legal claim on any of them but i certainly have a moral claim on my brother it is he who has impoverished the estate so that even had i not quarrelled with my father there could never after provision had been made for my sisters have been anything to come to me  i do not ask you to humiliate yourself by delivering these letters personally i would advise you to post them from cairo enclosing in each a note saying how i fell and that you are fulfilling my instructions by sending the letter i wrote before leaving you it may be that you will receive no reply in that case whatever happens to you and the child you will have nothing to reproach yourself for possibly my father may have succeeded to the title and if for no other reason he may then be willing to grant you an allowance on condition that you do not return to england as he would know that it would be nothing short of a scandal that the wife of one of his sons was trying to earn her bread in this country  above all dear i ask you not to destroy these letters you may at first scorn the idea of appealing for help but the time might come as it came to us in london when you feel that fate is too strong for you and that you can struggle no longer then you might regret for the sake of the child that you had not sent these letters  it is a terrible responsibility that i am leaving you i well know that you will do all dear that it is possible for you to do to avoid the necessity for sending these letters that i quite approve if you can struggle on god strengthen you to do it it is only if you fail that i say send them my father may by this time regret that he drove me from home he may be really anxious to find me and at least it is right that he should have the opportunity of making what amends he can from my sisters i know that you can have little but sympathy but that i feel sure they will give you and even sympathy is a great deal to one who has no friends i feel it sorely that i should have naught to leave you but my name and this counsel earnestly i hope and pray that it may never be needed  yours till death  gregory hilliard hartley  gregory then opened the letter to his grandfather  dear father  you will not receive this letter till after my death i leave it behind me while i go up with general hicks to the soudan it will not be sent to you unless i die there i hope that long ere this you may have felt as i have done that we were both somewhat in the wrong in the quarrel that separated us you i think were hard i no doubt was hasty you i think assumed more than was your right in demanding that i should break a promise that i had given to a lady against whom nothing could be said save that she was undowered had i like geoffrey been drawing large sums of money from you you would necessarily have felt yourself in a position to have a very strong voice in so important a matter but the very moderate allowance i received while at the university was never increased i do not think it is too much to say that for every penny i have got from you geoffrey has received a guinea  however that is past and gone i have been fighting my own battle and was on my way to obtaining a good position until i did so i dropped our surname i did not wish that it should be known that one of our family was working in an almost menial position in egypt i have now obtained the post of interpreter on the staff of general hicks and if he is successful in crushing the rebellion i shall be certain of good permanent employment when i can resume my name the fact that you receive this letter will be a proof that i have fallen in battle or by disease  i now as a dying prayer beg you to receive my wife and boy or if that cannot be to grant her some small annuity to assist her in her struggle with the world except for her sake i do not regret my marriage she has borne the hardships through which we have passed nobly and without a murmur she has been the best of wives to me and has proved herself a noble woman in every respect  i leave the matter in your hands father feeling assured that from your sense of justice alone if not for the affection you once bore me you will befriend my wife as i know that the earl was in feeble health when i left england you may by this time have come into the title in which case you will be able without in any way inconveniencing yourself to settle an annuity upon my wife sufficient to keep her in comfort i can promise in her name that in that case you will never be troubled in any way by her and she will probably take up her residence permanently in egypt as she is not strong and the warm climate is essential to her  the letter to his brother was shorter  my dear geoffrey  i am going up with general hicks to the soudan if you receive this letter it will be because i have died there i leave behind me my wife and a boy i know that at present you are scarcely likely to be able to do much for them pecuniarily but as you will somedaypossibly not a very distant oneinherit the title and estate you will then be able to do so without hurting yourself  we have never seen much of each other you left school before i began it and you left oxford two years before i went up to cambridge you have never been at home much since and i was two years in egypt and have now been about the same time here i charge my wife to send you this and i trust that for my sake you will help her she does not think of returning to england life is not expensive in this country even an allowance of a hundred a year would enable her to remain here if you can afford double that do so for my sake but at any rate i feel that i can rely upon you to do at least that much when you come into the title had i lived i should never have troubled anyone at home but as i shall be no longer able to earn a living for her and the boy i trust that you will not think it out of the way for me to ask for what would have been a very small younger brothers allowance had i remained at home  the letter to his sisters was in a different strain  my dear flossie and janet  i am quite sure that you like myself felt deeply grieved over our separation and i can guess that you will have done what you could with our father to bring about a reconciliation when you receive this dears i shall have gone i am about to start on an expedition that is certain to be dangerous and which may be fatal and i have left this with my wife to send you if she has sure news of my death i have had hard times i see my way now and i hope that i shall ere long receive a good official appointment out here still it is as well to prepare for the worst and if you receive this letter the worst has come as i have only just begun to rise again in the world i have been able to make no provision for my wife i know that you liked her and that you would by no means have disapproved of the step i took if our father has not come into the title when you receive this your pocket money will be only sufficient for your own wants therefore i am not asking for help in that way but only that you will write to her an affectionate letter she is without friends and will fight her battle as best she can she is a woman in a thousand and worthy of the affection and esteem of any man on earth  there is a boy tooanother gregory hilliard hartley she will be alone in the world with him and a letter from you would be very precious to her probably by the same post as you receive this our father will also get one requesting more substantial assistance but with that you have nothing to do i am only asking that you will let her know there are at least two people in the world who take an interest in her and my boy  your affectionate brother  there was yet another envelope with no address upon it it contained two documents one was a copy of the certificate of marriage between gregory hilliard hartley and anne forsyth at saint pauls church plymouth with the names of two witnesses and the signature of the officiating minister the other was a copy of the register of the birth at alexandria of gregory hilliard son of gregory hilliard hartley and anne his wife a third was a copy of the register of baptism of gregory hilliard hartley the son of gregory hilliard and anne hartley at the protestant church alexandria  i will write someday to my aunts gregory said as he replaced the letters in the envelopes the others will never go still i may as well keep them  so i am either grandson or nephew of an earl i cant say that i am dazzled by the honour i should like to know my aunts but as for the other two i would not go across the street to make their acquaintance  he carefully stowed the letters away in his portmanteau and then lay down for a few hours sleep  the day is breaking master zaki said laying his hand upon gregorys shoulder  all right zaki while you get the water boiling i shall run down to the river and have a bathe and shall be ready for my cocoa in twenty minutes  are we going to put on those dervish dresses at once master they came yesterday evening  no i shant change till we get to the place where we land  as soon as he had breakfasted he told zaki to carry his portmanteau bed and other belongings to the house that served as a store for general hunters staff he waited until his return and then told him to take the two rifles the packets of ammunition the spears and the dervish dresses down to the steamer then he joined the general who was just starting with his staff to superintend the embarkation  three steamers were going up and each towed a barge in which the greater part of the troops was to be stowed and in the stern of one of these knelt two camels  there are your nags mr hilliard the general said there is an attendant with each they will manage them better than strangers and without them we might have a job in getting the animals ashore of course i shall take the drivers on with us the sheik told me the camels are two of the fastest he has ever had he has sent saddles with them and water skins the latter you will probably not want if all goes well still it is better to take them  i shall assuredly do so sir they may be useful to us on the ride and though i suppose the camels would do well enough without them it is always well to be provided when one goes on an expedition for any emergency that may occur  an hour later the steamer started the river was still full and the current rapid and they did not move more than five miles an hour against it at the villages they passed the people flocked down to the banks with cries of welcome and the waving of flags they felt now that their deliverance was accomplished and that they were free from the tyranny that had for so many years oppressed them  the banks were for the most part low and save at these villages the journey was a monotonous one the steamers kept on their way till nightfall and then anchored  they started again at daybreak at breakfast general hunter said  i think that in another two hours we shall be pretty well due west of el fasher so you had better presently get into your dervish dress you have got some iodine from the doctor have you not  yes  you had better stain yourself all over and take a good supply in case you have to do it again  gregory went below and had his head shaved by one of the soudanese then restained himself from head to foot and put on the dervish attireloose trousers and a long smock with six large square patches arranged in two lines in front a white turban and a pair of shoes completed the costume the officers laughed as he came on deck again  you look an outandout dervish hilliard one of them said it is lucky that there are none of the lancers scouting about they would hardly give you time to explain especially with that rifle and spear  presently they came to a spot where the water was deep up to the bank which was some six feet above its level the barge with the camels was brought up alongside it had no bulwark and as the deck was level with the land the camels were with a good deal of pressing on the part of their drivers and pushing by as many soudanese as could come near enough to them got ashore  none of the soudanese recognized gregory and looked greatly surprised at the sudden appearance of two dervishes among them as soon as the camels were landed gregory and zaki mounted them  you had better keep if anything to the south of east general hunters last instructions had been unless parsons has been greatly delayed they should be two or three days march farther up the river and every mile you strike the stream behind him is so much time lost  he waved his hand to them and wished them farewell as they started and his staff shouted their wishes for a safe journey the black soldiers seeing that whoever these dervishes might be they were well known to the general and his officers raised a cheer to which zaki who had hitherto kept in the background waved his rifle in reply as his face was familiar to numbers of the soudanese they now recognized him and cheered more heartily than before laughing like schoolboys at the transformation    chapter 21 gedareh   abdul azim was right about the camels gregory said as soon as they were fairly off i have never ridden on one like this before what a difference there is between them and the ordinary camel it is not only that they go twice as fast but the motion is so pleasant and easy  yes master these are riding camels of good breed they cost twenty times as much as the others they think nothing of keeping up this rate for twelve hours without a stop  if they do that we shall be near the atbara before it is dark it is ten oclock now and if general hunters map is right we have only about eighty miles to go and i should think they are trotting seven miles an hour  they carried their rifles slung behind them and across the shoulders rather than upright as was the arab fashion the spears were held in their right hands  we must see if we cant fasten the spears in some other way zaki we should find them a nuisance if we held them in our hands all the way i should say it would be easy to fasten them across the saddle in front of us if we see horsemen in the distance we can take them into our hands  i think master it would be easier to fasten them behind the saddles where there is more width and rings on the saddle on both sides  a short halt was made and the spears fixed gregory then looked at his compass  we must make for that rise two or three miles away i see exactly the point we must aim for when we get there we must look at the compass again  they kept steadily on for six hours they had seen no human figure since they started  we will stop here for half an hour gregory said give the animals a drink of water and a handful or two of grain  i dont think they will want water master they had as much as they could drink before starting and they are accustomed to drink when their work is over  very well at any rate we will take something  they opened one of the water skins and poured some of the contents into a gourd then sitting down in the shadow of the camels they ate some dates and bread they had only brought native food with them so that if captured and examined there should be nothing to show that they had been in contact with europeans gregory had even left his revolver behind him as being armed with so good a weapon as a remington it was hardly likely that it would be needed and if found upon them it would be accepted as a proof that he was in the employment of the infidels  it was dusk when they arrived at the bank of the river no incident had marked the journey nor had they seen any sign that dervishes were in the neighbourhood the atbara was in full flood and was rushing down at six or seven miles an hour  colonel parsons must have had great difficulty in crossing zaki he is hardly likely to have brought any boats across from kassala i dont know whether he has any guns with him but if he has i dont think he can have crossed even if they made rafts enough to carry them  they kept along the bank until they reached a spot where the river had overflowed here the camels drank their fill a little grain was given to them and then they were turned loose to browse on the bushes  there is no fear of their straying i suppose zaki  no master they are always turned loose at night as there are plenty of bushes here they will not go far  after another meal they both lay down to sleep and as soon as it was light zaki fetched in the camels and they continued their journey in an hour they arrived at a village the people were already astir and looked with evident apprehension at the seeming dervishes  has a party of infidels passed along here gregory asked the village sheik who came out and salaamed humbly  yes my lord a party of soldiers with some white officers came through here three days ago  how many were there of them  there must have been more than a thousand of them  many more  not many perhaps a hundred more your servant did not count them  had they any cannon with them  no my lord they were all on foot they all carried guns but there were no mounted men or cannon  where is fadil and his army that they thus allowed so small a force to march along unmolested  they say that he is still near the nile two of his scouts were here the day before the turks came along they stayed here for some hours but as they said nothing about the turks coming from kassala i suppose they did not know they had crossed the river  well we must go on and see where they are they must be mad to come with so small a force when they must have known that fadil has a large army they will never go back again  without further talk gregory rode farther on at each village through which they passed they had some news of the passage of colonel parsons command the camels had been resting from the time when omdurman was taken and having been well fed that morning gregory did not hesitate to press them the troops would not march above twentyfive miles a day and two days would take them to mugatta so that if they halted there but for a day he should be able to overtake them that night  the character of the country was now greatly changed the bush was thick and high and a passage through it would be very difficult for mounted men there was no fear therefore that they would turn off before arriving at mugatta from which place there would probably be a track of some sort to gedareh it was but a thirtymile ride and on arriving near the village gregory saw that a considerable number of men were assembled there he checked his camel  what do you make them out to be zaki your eyes are better than mine they may be colonel parsons force and on the other hand they may be dervishes who have closed in behind him to cut off his retreat  they are not dervishes master zaki said after a long steady look they have not white turbans some of their clothes are light and some dark but all have dark caps like those the soudanese troops wear  that is good enough zaki we will turn our robes inside out so as to hide the patches as otherwise we might have a hot reception  when they were a quarter of a mile from the village several men started out from the bushes rifle in hand they were all in egyptian uniform  we are friends gregory shouted in arabic i am an officer of the khedive and have come from omdurman with a message to your commander  a native officer one of the party at once saluted  you will find the bey in the village bimbashi  how long have you been here  we came in yesterday and i hear that we shall start tomorrow but i know not whether that is so  are there any dervishes about  yes forty of them yesterday afternoon coming from gedareh and ignorant that we were here rode in among our outposts on that hill to the west three of them were killed and three made prisoners the rest rode away  with a word of thanks gregory rode on he dismounted when he reached the village and was directed to a neighbouring hut here colonel parsons and the six white officers with him were assembled a native soldier was on sentry at the door  i want to speak to parsons bey  the colonel hearing the words came to the door  colonel parsons gregory said in english i am major hilliard of the egyptian army and have the honour to be the bearer of a message to you from general rundle now in command at omdurman  you are well disguised indeed sir the colonel said with a smile as he held out his hand i should never have taken you for anything but a native where did you spring from you can never have ridden much less walked across the desert from omdurman  no sir i was landed from one of the gunboats in which general hunter with fifteen hundred soudanese troops is ascending the blue nile to prevent fadil from crossing and joining the khalifa  have you a written despatch  it was thought better that i should carry nothing so that even the strictest search would not show that i was a messenger  is your message of a private character  no sir i think not  then will you come in  gregory followed colonel parsons into the hut which contained but one room  gentlemen the former said with a smile allow me to introduce bimbashi hilliard who is the bearer of a message to me from general rundle now in command at omdurman  major hilliard these are captain mackerrel commanding four hundred and fifty men of the 16th egyptians captain wilkinson an equal number of the arab battalion major lawson who has under his command three hundred and seventy arab irregulars captain the honorable h ruthven who has under him eighty camel men also captain fleming of the royal army medical corps who is at once our medical officer and in command of the baggage column and captain dwyer they are all like yourself officers in the egyptian army and rank like yourself as bimbashis  now sir will you deliver your message to me  it is of a somewhat grave character sir but general rundle thought it very important that you should be acquainted with the last news the sirdar has gone up the white nile with some of the gunboats and the 11th soudanese he deemed it necessary to go himself because a body of foreign troopsbelieved to be frenchhave established themselves at fashoda  an exclamation of surprise broke from all the officers  in the next place sir fadil who had arrived with his force within forty miles of khartoum has retired up the banks of the blue nile on hearing of the defeat of the khalifa major general hunter has therefore gone up that river with three gunboats and another soudanese battalion to prevent him if possible from crossing it and joining the khalifa who is reported to be collecting the remains of his defeated army  it is possibleindeed the general thinks it is probablethat fadil if unable to cross may return with his army to gedareh it is to warn you of this possibility that he sent me here gedareh is reported to be a defensible position and therefore he thinks that if you capture it it would be advisable to maintain yourself there until reinforcements can be sent to you either from the blue nile or the atbara the place it seems is well supplied with provisions and stores and in the event of fadil opposing you it would be far safer for you to defend it than to be attacked in the open or during a retreat  it is certainly important news mr hilliard hitherto we have supposed that fadil had joined the khalifa before the fight at omdurman and there was therefore no fear of his reappearing here we know very little of the force at gedareh we took some prisoners yesterday but their accounts are very conflicting still there is every reason to believe that the garrison is not strong certainly as general rundle says we should be in a much better position there than if we were attacked in the open no doubt the arabs who got off in the skirmish yesterday carried the news there and probably some of them would go direct to fadil and if he came down upon us here with his eight thousand men our position would be a desperate one it cost us four days to cross the river at el fasher and would take us as much to build boats and recross here and before that time he might be upon us  it is evident gentlemen that we have only the choice of these alternativeseither to march at once against gedareh or to retreat immediately crossing the river here or at el fasher as to remaining here of course it is out of the question  the consultation was a short one all the officers were in favour of pushing forward pointing out that as only the 16th egyptians could be considered as fairly disciplined the troops would lose heart if they retired and could not be relied upon to keep steady if attacked by a largely superior force while at present they would probably fight bravely the arab battalion had been raised by the italians and were at present full of confidence as they had defeated the mahdists who had been besieging kassala the arab irregulars had of course the fighting instincts of their race and would assault an enemy bravely but in a defensive battle against greatly superior numbers could scarcely be expected to stand well as for the eighty camel men they were all soudanese soldiers discharged from the army for old age and physical unfitness they could be relied upon to fight but small in number as they were could but have little effect on the issue of a battle all therefore agreed that having come thus far the safest as well as the most honourable course would be to endeavour to fight the enemy in a strong position  although it may be said that success justified it no wilder enterprise was ever undertaken than that of sending thirteen hundred only partly disciplined men into the heart of the enemys country omdurman and atbara to say nothing of previous campaigns had shown how desperately the dervishes fought and the order for the garrison of kassala to undertake it can only have been given under an entire misconception of the circumstances and of the strength of the army under fadil that they would almost certainly be called upon to encounter this was the more probable as all the women and the property of his soldiers had been left at gedareh when he marched away and his men would therefore naturally wish to go there before they made any endeavour to join the khalifa  such indeed was the fact fadil concealed from them the news of the disaster at omdurman for some days and when it became known he had difficulty in restraining his troops from marching straight for gedareh  do you go on with us mr hilliard colonel parsons asked when they had decided to start for gedareh  yes sir my instructions are to go on with you and if the town is besieged to endeavour to get through their lines and carry the news to general hunter if i can ascertain his whereabouts if not to make straight for omdurman i have two fast camels which i shall leave here and return for them with my black boy when we start  we shall be glad to have you with us the colonel said every white officer is worth a couple of hundred men  as they sat and chatted gregory asked how the force had crossed the atbara  it was a big job colonel parsons said the river was wider than the thames below london bridge and running something like seven miles an hour we brought with us some barrels to construct a raft when this was built it supported the ten men who started on it but they were in spite of their efforts carried ten miles down the stream and it was not until five hours after they embarked that they managed to land the raft did not get back from its journey till the next afternoon being towed along the opposite bank by the men  it was evident that this would not do the egyptian soldiers then took the matter in hand they made frameworks with the wood of the mimosa scrub and covered these with tarpaulins which we had fortunately brought with us they turned out one boat a day capable of carrying two tons and six days after we reached the river we all got across  the delay was a terrible nuisance at the time but it has enabled you to come up here and warn us about fadil fortunately no dervishes came along while we were crossing and indeed we learned from the prisoners we took yesterday that the fact that a force from kassala had crossed the river was entirely unknown so no harm was done  the sheik of the little village took charge of gregorys camels some stores were also left there under a small guard as it was advisable to reduce the transport to the smallest possible amount  the next morning the start was made the bush was so thick that it was necessary to march in single file in the evening the force halted in a comparatively open country the camel men reconnoitred the ground for some little distance round and saw no signs of the enemy they camped however in the form of a square and lay with their arms beside them in readiness to resist an attack  the night passed quietly and at early dawn they moved forward again at six oclock the camel men exchanged a few shots with the dervish scouts who fell back at once at eight a village was sighted and the force advanced upon it in fighting order  it was found however to have been deserted except by a few old people these on being questioned said that the emir saadalla who commanded had but two hundred rifles and six hundred spearmen and had received orders from fadil to surrender subsequent events showed that they had been carefully tutored as to the reply to be given  the force halted here as gedareh was still twelve miles away and it was thought better that if there was fighting they should be fresh at midnight a deserter from the dervishes came in with the grave news that the emir had three thousand five hundred men and was awaiting them two miles outside the town there was another informal council of war but all agreed that a retreat through this difficult country would bring about the total annihilation of the force and that there was nothing to do but to fight  early in the morning they started again for the first two hours the road led through grass so high that even the men on camels could not see above it they pushed on till eight oclock when they reached a small knoll at the foot of this they halted and colonel parsons and the officers ascended it to reconnoitre  they saw at once that the deserters news was true a mile away four lines of dervishes marching in excellent order were making their way towards them colonel parsons considered that their numbers could not be less than four thousand and at once decided to occupy a saddleback hill half a mile away and the troops were hurried across the dervishes also quickened their movements but were too late to prevent the hill from being seized  the arab battalion had been leading followed by the egyptians while the irregulars divided into two bodies under arab chiefs guarded the hospital and baggage the dervishes at once advanced to the attack of the hill and the column wheeled into line to meet it even on the crest of the hill the grass was breast high but it did not impede the view of the advancing lines of the dervishes into these a heavy and destructive fire was at once poured the enemy however pushed on firing in return but being somewhat out of breath from the rapidity with which they had marched and seeing nothing of the defenders of the hill save their heads they inflicted far less loss than they were themselves suffering  the fight was continuing when colonel parsons saw that a force of about three hundred dervishes had worked round the back of the hill with the intention of falling upon the baggage he at once sent one of the arab sheiks to warn captain fleming who from his position was unable to see the approaching foe colonel parsons had asked gregory to take up his position with the baggage as he foresaw that with their vastly greater numbers it was likely that the dervishes might sweep round and attack it  scarcely had the messenger arrived with the news when the dervishes came rushing on through the high grass in spite of the shouts of doctor fleming and gregory the escort of one hundred and twenty irregular arabs stationed at this point at once broke and fled happily a portion of the camel corps with its commander captain ruthven a militia officer was close at hand though he had but thirtyfour of these old soldiers with him he rushed forward to meet the enemy doctor fleming and gregory joined him and all cheering to encourage the soudanese made a determined stand  gregory and zaki kept up a steady fire with their remingtons and picked off several of the most determined of their assailants the fight however was too unequal the dervishes got in behind them and cut off the rear portion of the transport and the little band fighting obstinately fell back with their faces to the foe towards the main body  one of the native officers of the soudanese fell captain ruthven a very powerful man ran back and lifted the wounded soldier and made his way towards his friends so closely pressed was he by the dervishes that three times he had to lay his burden down and defend himself with his revolver while gregory and zaki aided his retreat by turning their fire upon his assailants for this splendid act of bravery captain ruthven afterwards received the victoria cross  flushed by their success the dervishes pushed on fortunately at this time the main force of the dervishes was beginning to waver unable to withstand the steady fire of the defenders of the hill and as they drew back a little the egyptian and arab battalions rushed forward  shaken as they were the dervishes were unable to resist the attack and broke and fled pursued by the arab battalion the egyptians however obeyed the orders of captain mackerrel and halting faced about to encounter the attack from the rear their volleys caused the dervishes to hesitate and captain ruthven and his party reached the summit of the hill in safety  the enemy however maintained a heavy fire for a few minutes but the volleys of the egyptians at a distance of only a hundred yards were so deadly that they soon took to flight  the first shot had been fired at halfpast eight at ten the whole dervish force was scattered in headlong rout had colonel parsons possessed a cavalry force the enemy would have been completely cut up as it was pursuit was out of the question  the force therefore advanced in good order to gedareh here a dervish emir who had been left in charge when the rest of the garrison moved out surrendered at once with the two hundred black riflemen under him he had long been suspected of disloyalty by the khalifa and at once declared his hatred of mahdism declaring that though he had not dared to declare himself openly he had always been friendly to egyptian rule  the men with him at once fraternized with the arabs of colonel parsons force and were formally received into their ranks the emir showed his sincerity by giving them all the information in his power as to fadils position and movements and by pointing out the most defensible positions  none of the british officers had been wounded but fiftyone of the men had been killed and eighty wounded five hundred of the dervishes were left dead upon the field including four emirs  not a moment was lost in preparing for defence for it was certain that fadil on hearing the news would at once march to retake the town the position was naturally a strong one standing on rising ground was fadils house surrounded by a brick wall twelve feet high here the egyptian battalion and camel corps were placed with the hospital and two brass guns which had been found there  a hundred yards away was another enclosure with a fivefoot wall and two hundred yards away a smaller one the arab battalion was stationed to the rear of this in a square enclosure with a brick wall twelve feet high in which was situated a well these four buildings were so placed that the fire from each covered the approaches to the other two hundred yards from the well enclosure was a fortified house surrounded by a high wall as the latter would need too many men for its defence the wall was pulled down and a detachment placed in the house  no time was lost the whole force was at once employed in pulling down huts clearing the ground of the high grass and forming a zareba round the town the greatest cause for anxiety was ammunition a large proportion of that carried in the pouches had been expended during the battle and the next morning colonel parsons with a small force hurried back to mugatta to fetch up the reserve ammunition which had been left there under a guard he returned with it three days later  an abundant supply of provisions had been found in gedareh for here were the magazines not only of the four thousand men of the garrison and the women who had been left there but sufficient for fadils army on their return there were three or four wells and a good supply of water  the ammunition arrived just in time for on the following morning captain ruthvens camel men brought in news that fadil was close at hand at halfpast eight the dervishes began the attack on three sides of the defences sheltered by the long grass they were able to make their way to within three hundred yards of the dwellings occupied by the troops but the intervening ground had all been cleared and though time after time they made rushes forward they were unable to withstand the withering fire to which they were exposed  after an hours vain efforts their musketry fire ceased but half an hour later strong reinforcements came up and the attack recommenced this was accompanied with no greater success than the first attack and fadil retired to a palm grove two miles away of the defenders five men were killed and captain dwyer and thirteen men wounded  for two days fadil endeavoured to persuade his troops to make another attack but although they surrounded the town and maintained a scattered fire they could not be brought to attempt another assault having lost over five hundred men in the two attacks the first day he then fell back eight miles  three days later colonel parsons said to gregory  i think the time has come mr hilliard when i must apply for reinforcements i am convinced that we can repel all attacks but we are virtually prisoners here were we to endeavour to retreat fadil would probably annihilate us our men have behaved admirably but it is one thing to fight well when you are advancing and another to be firm in retreat  but our most serious enemy at present is fever already the stink of the unburied bodies of the dervishes is overpowering and every day it will become worse doctor fleming reports to me that he has a great many sick on his hands and that he fears the conditions that surround us will bring about an epidemic therefore i have decided to send to general rundle for a reinforcement that will enable us to move out to attack fadil  very well sir i will start at once  i will write my despatch it will be ready for you to carry in an hours time you had better pick out a couple of good donkeys from those we captured here as it is only nine oclock you will be able to get to mugatta this evening i dont think there is any fear of your being interfered with by the dervishes we may be sure that fadil is not allowing his men to roam over the country for there can be little doubt that a good many of them would desert as soon as they got fairly beyond his camp  i dont think there is any fear of that sir and as my camels will have had ten days rest i should have very little fear of being overtaken even if they did sight us  we are off again zaki gregory said we will go down to the yard where the animals we captured are kept and choose a couple of good donkeys i am to carry a despatch to omdurman and as time is precious we will make a straight line across the desert it will save us fifty or sixty miles  i am glad to be gone master the smells here are as bad as they were at omdurman when we went in there  yes i am very glad to be off too  an hour later they started and arrived at mugatta at eight oclock in the evening the native with whom the camels had been left had taken good care of them and after rewarding him and taking a meal gregory determined to start at once the stars were bright and there was quite light enough for the camels to travel  the water was emptied from the skins and filled again they had brought with them sufficient food for four days travel and a sack of grain for the camels an hour after arriving at the village they again started  we will follow the river bank till we get past the country where the bushes are so thick and then strike west by north i saw by colonel parsons map that that is about the line we should take  they left the river before they reached el fasher and continued their journey all night and onward till the sun was well up then they watered the camels they had this time brought with them a large half gourd for the purpose ate a good meal themselves and after placing two piles of grain before the camels lay down and slept until five oclock in the afternoon  we ought to be opposite omdurman tomorrow morning i expect we shall strike the river tonight i have kept our course rather to the west of the direct line on purpose it would be very awkward if we were to miss it i believe the compass is right and i have struck a match every hour to look at it but a very slight deviation would make a big difference at the end of a hundred and fifty miles  it was just midnight when they saw the river before them  we cant go wrong now zaki  that is a comfort how many miles are we above its junction with the white nile  i dont know  they rode steadily on and day was just breaking when he exclaimed  there are some buildings opposite that must be khartoum we shall be opposite omdurman in another hour  soon after six oclock they rode down to the river bank opposite the town and in answer to their signals a large native boat was rowed across to them after some trouble the camels were got on board and in a quarter of an hour they landed  take the camels up to my house zaki i must go and report myself at headquarters  general rundle had not yet gone out and on gregory sending in his name he was at once admitted  so you are back mr hilliard the general said i am heartily glad to see you for it was a very hazardous mission that you undertook what news have you  this is colonel parsons report  before reading the long report the general said tell me in a few words what happened  i overtook colonel parsons at mugatta on the third morning after leaving we were attacked by nearly four thousand dervishes five miles from gedareh after a sharp fight they were defeated and we occupied the town without resistance four days later fadil came up with his army and attacked the town but was driven off with a loss of five hundred men he is now eight miles from the town the place is unhealthy and although it can be defended colonel parsons has asked for reinforcements to enable him to attack fadil  that is good news indeed we have all been extremely anxious for there was no doubt that colonel parsons force was wholly inadequate for the purpose how long is it since you left  about fortysix hours sir  indeed that seems almost impossible mr hilliard  we started at eleven oclock in the morning sir and rode on donkeys to mugatta where i had left my camels arrived there at eight and started an hour later on the camels we rode till nine oclock the next day halted till five and have just arrived here the camels were excellent beasts and travelled a good six miles an hour i did not press them as i knew that if we arrived opposite the town at night we should have difficulty in getting across the river  it was a great ride a great achievement you must be hungry as well as tired i will tell my man to get you some breakfast at once you can eat it while i read this despatch then i may have a few questions to ask you after that you had better turn in till evening  gregory enjoyed his breakfast with the luxuries of tinned fruit after his rough fare for the past fortnight when he went to the generals room again the latter said  colonel parsons despatches are very full and i think i quite understand the situation no praise is too high for the conduct of his officers and troops all seemed to have behaved equally well and he mentions the gallant part you took in the defence of the baggage with captain ruthven and the doctor and only some thirtyfour soldiers of the camel corps  now i will not detain you longer i hope you will dine with me this evening i should like to hear more of the affair  returning to his hut gregory found that zaki had already got his bed and other things from the store and he was just about to boil the kettle  i have breakfasted zaki here is a dollar go to one of those big shops and buy anything you like and have a good meal then you had better take the camels across to azims camp i shall not want you then till evening  no time was lost three battalions and a half of soudanese were sent up the blue nile in steamers and the garrisons stationed at several points on the river were also taken on board three companies of camel corps marched along the bank and arrived at abu haraz a hundred and thirty miles up the river in fiftysix hours after starting five hundred baggage camels were also sent up as the distance from gedareh to this point was a hundred miles and as water was only to be found at one point it was necessary to carry up a supply for the troops  colonel collinson who was in command pushed forward at once with the 12th soudanese and the camel corps when fadil heard of their approach he made a night attack on gedareh this however was easily repulsed by the garrison he then broke up his camp and marched away intending to cross the blue nile and join the khalifa  his troops were greatly demoralized by their failures and in spite of the precautions he took the darfur sheik with five hundred of his men succeeded in effecting his escape and at once joined us actively in the further operations against fadil as there was no further danger the soudanese marched back again and joined the other battalions the garrisons on the river were reestablished and part of the force returned to omdurman  the sirdar had returned from fashoda before gregory came back and had left almost immediately for cairo on the day after gregorys return he had a sharp attack of fever the result partly of the evil smells at gedareh heightened by the fact that the present was the fever season in the blue nile country    chapter 22 the crowning victory   it was eight weeks before he recovered and even then the doctor said that he was not fit for any exertion he learned that on the 22nd of october colonel lewis with two companies of the camel corps and three squadrons of lancers had started from omdurman to visit the various villages between the white and blue niles to restore order and proclaim that the authority of the khedive was established there on the 7th of november following the blue nile up he reached karkoj but a short distance below the point at which the navigation of the river ceased he had come in contact with a portion of fadils force but nothing could be done in the thick undergrowth in which the latter was lurking and he therefore remained waiting for the next move on the part of the dervish commander while the gunboats patrolled the blue river up to rosaires  six weeks passed his force and all the garrisons on the river suffered severely from heat thirty percent of the troops being down together the cavalry had suffered particularly heavily of the four hundred and sixty men ten had died and four hundred and twenty were reported unfit for duty a month after their arrival at karkoj while of the thirty white officers on the blue nile only two escaped an attack of fever  at the end of the month colonel lewis was joined by the darfur sheik and three hundred and fifty of his men he had had many skirmishes with dervish parties scouring the country for food and his arrival was very welcome  gregory was recommended to take a river trip to recover his health and left on a steamer going up with stores and some small reinforcements to colonel lewis they arrived at karkoj on the 14th of december and learned that the little garrison at rosaires had been attacked by the dervishes  the fifty feverstricken men who formed the garrison would have had no chance of resisting the attack but fortunately they had that very morning been reinforced by two hundred men of the 10th soudanese and two maxims and the dervishes were repulsed with considerable loss two companies of the same battalion had reinforced colonel lewis who marched on the day after receiving the news to rosaires the gunboat went up to that point and remained there for some days  gregory went ashore as soon as the boat arrived and saw colonel lewis to whom he was well known  i am supposed to be on sick leave sir but i feel quite strong now and shall be glad to join you if you will have me  i can have no possible objection mr hilliard i know that you did good service with colonel parsons and it is quite possible that we shall find ourselves in as tight a place as he was so many of our white officers have been sent down with fever that i am very shorthanded and shall be glad if you will temporarily serve as my assistant  on the 20th the news came that fadil was crossing the river at dakhila twenty miles farther to the south he himself had crossed and the women and children had been taken over on a raft on the 22nd the darfur sheik was sent off up the west bank to harass the dervishes who had already crossed on the 24th two gunboats arrived with two hundred more men of the 10th soudanese and a small detachment of the 9th  on the following day the little force started at five in the afternoon and at eleven at night halted at a little village at three in the morning they again advanced and at eight oclock came in contact with the dervish outposts colonel lewis had already learned that instead of half the dervish force having crossed only one division had done so and that he had by far the greater part of fadils army opposed to him  it was a serious matter to attack some four or five thousand men with so small a force at his disposal for he had but half the 10th soudanese a handful of the 9th and two maxim guns as to the darfur irregulars no great reliance could be placed upon them  as the force issued from the wood through which they had been marching they saw the river in front of them in its midst rose a large island a mile and a quarter long and more than threequarters of a mile wide there were clumps of sand hills upon it they had learned that the intervening stream was rapid but not deep while that on the other side of the island was very deep with a precipitous bank  it was upon this island that fadils force was established the position was a strong onethe sand hills rose from an almost flat plain a thousand yards away and this would have to be crossed by the assailants without any shelter whatever the dervishes were bound to fight their hardest as there was no possibility of escape if defeated  at nine oclock the soudanese and irregulars lined the bank and opened fire while the two maxims came into action the dervishes replied briskly and it was soon evident that at so long a range they could not be driven from their position several fords were found and the irregulars supported by a company of the 10th crossed the river and took up a position two hundred yards in advance to cover the passage of the rest these crossed with some difficulty for the water was three and a half feet deep and the current very strong and they were moreover exposed to the fire of fadils riflemen from the high cliff on the opposite bank  colonel lewis determined to turn the left flank of the dervishes kept along the rivers edge until he reached the required position then wheeled the battalion into line and advanced across the bare shingle against the sand hills major ferguson with one company was detached to attack a knoll on the right held by two hundred dervishes the remaining four companies under colonel mason kept straight on towards the main position  a very heavy fire was concentrated upon them not only from the sand hills but from fadils riflemen the soudanese fell fast but held on increasing their pace to a run until they reached the foot of the first sandhill where they lay down in shelter to take breath a quarter of the force had already fallen and their doctor captain jennings remained out in the open binding up their wounds although exposed to a continuous fire  this halt was mistaken by the dervishes who thought that the courage of the soudanese was exhausted and fadil from the opposite bank sounded the charge on drum and bugle and the whole dervish force with banners waving and exultant shouts poured down to annihilate their assailants  but the soudanese led by colonels lewis and mason who were accompanied by gregory leapt to their feet ran up the low bank behind which they were sheltering and opened a terrible fire the dervishes were already close at hand and every shot told among them astonished at so unlookedfor a reception and doubtless remembering the heavy loss they had suffered at gedareh they speedily broke like dogs slipped from their leash the black troops dashed on with triumphant shouts driving the dervishes from sandhill to sandhill until the latter reached the southern end of the island  here the soudanese were joined by the irregulars who had first crossed and a terrible fire was maintained from the sand hills upon the crowded mass on the bare sand cut off from all retreat by the deep river some tried to swim across to join their friends on the west bank a few succeeded in doing so among them the emir who had given battle to colonel parsons force near gedareh  many took refuge from the fire by standing in the river up to their necks some four hundred succeeded in escaping by a ford to a small island lower down but they found no cover there and after suffering heavily from the musketry fire the survivors three hundred strong surrendered  major fergusons company however was still exposed to a heavy fire turned upon them by the force on the other side of the river he himself was severely wounded and a third of his men hit the maxims were accordingly carried over the river to the island and placed so as to command the west bank which they soon cleared of the riflemen  over five hundred arabs lay dead on the two islands two thousand one hundred and seventyfive fighting men surrendered and several hundred women and children fadil with the force that had escaped crossed the desert to rung on the white nile where on the 22nd of january they surrendered to the english gunboats their leader with ten or twelve of his followers only escaping to join the khalifa  our casualties were heavy twentyfive noncommissioned officers and men were killed one british officer six native officers and one hundred and seventeen noncommissioned officers and men wounded of the 10th soudanese out of a total strength of five hundred and eleven the remaining casualties were among the irregulars  never was there a better proof of the gallantry of the black regiments of egypt for including the commander and medical officer there were but five british officers and two british sergeants to direct and lead them  after the battle of rosaires there was a lull in the fighting on the east of the white nile the whole country had been cleared of the dervishes and it was now time for the sirdar who had just returned from england to turn his attention to the khalifa the latter was known to be near el obeid where he had now collected a force of whose strength very different reports were received  gregory whose exertions in the fight and the march through the scrub from karkoj had brought on a slight return of fever went down in the gunboat with the wounded to omdurman zaki was with him but as a patient he had been hit through the leg while charging forward with the soudanese at omdurman gregory fell into regular work again so many of the officers of the egyptian battalions had fallen in battle or were down with fever that colonel wingate took him as his assistant and his time was now spent in listening to the stories of tribesmen who as soon as the khalifas force had passed had brought in very varying accounts of his strength then there were villagers who had complaints to make of robbery of ill usagefor this the arab irregulars who had been disbanded after the capture of omdurman were largely responsible besides these there were many petitions by fugitives who had returned to find their houses occupied and their land seized by others  gregory was constantly sent off to investigate and decide in these disputes and was sometimes away for a week at a time zaki had recovered rapidly and as soon as he was able to rise accompanied his master who obtained valuable assistance from him as while gregory was hearing the stories of witnesses zaki went quietly about the villages talking to the old men and women and frequently obtained evidence that showed that many of the witnesses were perjured and so enabled his master to give decisions which astonished the people by their justness  indeed the reports of the extraordinary manner in which he seemed able to pick out truth from falsehood and to decide in favour of the rightful claimant spread so rapidly from village to village that claimants who came in to colonel wingate often requested urgently that the young bimbashi should be sent out to investigate the matter  you seem to be attaining the position of a modern solomon hilliard the colonel said one day with a smile how do you do it  gregory laughed and told him the manner in which he got at the truth  an excellent plan he said and one which it would be well to adopt generally by sending men beforehand to a village the only objection is that you could not rely much more upon the reports of your spies than on those of the villagers the chances are that the claimant who could bid highest would receive their support  matters were quiet until the sirdar returned from england and determined to make an attempt to capture the khalifa whose force was reported not to exceed one thousand men two squadrons of egyptian cavalry and a soudanese brigade two maxims two mule guns and a company of camel corps were placed under the command of colonel kitchener the great difficulty was the lack of water along the route to be traversed camels were brought from the atbara and the blue nile and the whole were collected at kawa on the white nile they started from that point but the wells were found to be dry and the force had to retrace its steps and to start afresh from koli some forty miles farther up the river  they endured great hardships for everything was left behind save the clothes the men and officers stood in and one hundred rounds of ammunition each only one pint of water being allowed per head the country was a desert covered with interlacing thorn bushes an eight days march brought the force to a village which was considered sacred as it contained the grave of the khalifas father and the house where the khalifa himself had been born  three days later they reached the abandoned camp of the khalifa a wide tract that had been cleared of bush a great multitude of dwellings constructed of spear grass stretched away for miles and at the very lowest compilation it had contained twenty thousand people of which it was calculated that from eight thousand to ten thousand must have been fighting men ten times as many as had before been reported to be with the khalifa a reconnaissance showed that a large army was waiting to give battle on a hill which was of great strength surrounded by deep ravines and pools of water  the position was an anxious one the total force was about fourteen hundred strong and a defeat would mean annihilation while even a victory would scarcely secure the capture of the khalifa who with his principal emirs osman digna el khatim the sheik of el obeid the sheik ed din and fadil would be able to gallop off if they saw the battle going against them colonel kitchener had the wisdom to decide against risking the destruction of his followers by an assault against so great a force posted in so strong a position it was a deep mortification to him to have to retreat and the soldiers were bitterly disappointed but their commander felt that brave as the egyptians and soudanese had shown themselves the odds against victory were too great after a terrible march and great sufferings from thirst and scanty food the force reached koli on the 5th of february and were conveyed in steamers down to omdurman  after this somewhat unfortunate affair which naturally added to the prestige of the khalifa the months passed uneventfully but late in october preparations were made for an attack upon a large scale against the khalifas camp and eight thousand men were concentrated at karla on the white nile it was known that the khalifa was at gedir eighty miles away but after proceeding half the distance it was found that he had marched away and the column returned as pursuit through a denselywooded country would have been impracticable  the gunboats had gone up the river with a flying column under colonel lewis to check any of the khalifas forces that attempted to establish themselves on the banks mounted troops and transport were at once concentrated and colonel wingate was sent up to take command the force consisted of a brigade of infantry under colonel lewis with the 9th and 13th soudanese an irregular soudanese battalion a company of the 2nd egyptians six companies of camel corps a squadron of cavalry a field battery six maxims and detachments of medical and supply departments with a camel transport train to carry rations and three days waterin all three thousand seven hundred men  on the afternoon of the 21st of november the column moved forward and favoured by a bright moonlight made a march of fifteen miles the cavalry scouting two miles in front the flanks and rear being covered by the camel corps native reports had brought in information that fadil who had been raiding the country was now in the neighbourhood on his way to rejoin the main dervish army which was lying near gadi  the cavalry pushed forward at dawn and found that fadil had retreated leaving a quantity of grain behind a sick dervish who had remained there said that the dervishes had moved to a point seven miles away the cavalry camel corps and some of the guns advanced and seized a position within three hundred yards of the dervish encampment on which they immediately opened fire  the rest of the guns were at once pushed forward to reinforce them and arrived in time to assist them in repulsing a fierce attack of the dervishes owing to the nature of the ground these were able to approach to within sixty yards of the guns before coming under their fire they were then mowed down by the guns and maxims and the musketry fire of the camel corps to which was added that of the infantry brigade when they arrived this was too much even for dervish valour to withstand and they fled back to their camp  the british force then advanced they met with but little opposition and as they entered the camp they saw the enemy in full flight the infantry followed them for a mile and a half while the cavalry and camel corps kept up the pursuit for five miles  fadils camp containing a large amount of grain and other stores fell into the hands of the captors with a number of prisoners including women and children and animals four hundred dervishes had fallen great numbers had been wounded while the british casualties amounted to a native officer of the camel corps dangerously wounded one man killed and three wounded  gregory had accompanied colonel wingate and acted as one of his staff officers he had of course brought his horse with him it was an excellent animal and had been used by him in all his excursions from omdurman  that is rather a different affair from the fight on the atbara zaki he said when the force gathered in fadils camp after the pursuit was relinquished the dervishes fought just as bravely but in one case they had a strong position to defend while today they took the offensive it makes all the difference  i am glad to have seen some fighting again master for it has been dull work stopping ten months in omdurman with nothing to do but ride about the country and decide upon the villagers quarrels  it has been useful work zaki and i consider myself very fortunate in being so constantly employed i was desperately afraid that colonel wingate would leave me there and i was greatly relieved when he told me that i was to come with him it is a fortunate thing that we have beaten our old enemy fadil here in the first place because if the three or four thousand men he had with him had joined the khalifa it would have given us harder work in tomorrows fight and in the next place his arrival with his followers who have escaped at the khalifas camp is not likely to inspirit the dervishes there  gregory was occupied all the afternoon in examining the prisoners they affirmed that they had left the former camp three days before with the intention of proceeding to gedid where fadil was to join the khalifa with captured grain when the whole dervish force was to march north  the troops slept during the afternoon and in the evening set out for gedid which they reached at ten oclock the next morning a dervish deserter reported that the khalifa was encamped seven miles to the southeast fortunately a pool with sufficient water for the whole force was found at gedid which was a matter of great importance for otherwise the expedition must have fallen back  it was hoped that the khalifa would now stand at bay as our occupation of gedid barred his advance north behind him was a waterless and densely wooded district the capture of the grain on which he had relied would render it impossible for him to remain long in his present position and his only chance of extricating himself was to stand and fight  after twelve hours rest the troops were roused and started a few minutes after midnight the transport was left under a strong guard near the water with orders to follow four hours later the cavalry with two maxims moved in advance and the camel corps on the flanks the ground was thickly wooded in many places a way had to be cut for the guns  at three oclock news was received from the cavalry that the enemys camp was but three miles distant from the point which the infantry had reached and that they and the maxims had halted two miles ahead at the foot of some slightly rising ground beyond which the scouts had on the previous day discovered the main force of the enemy to be stationed the infantry continued to advance slowly and cautiously making as little noise as possible  it was soon evident however that in spite of their caution the enemy were aware of their approach as there was an outburst of the beating of drums and the blowing of war horns this did not last long but it was enough to show that the dervishes were not to be taken by surprise when the infantry reached the spot where the cavalry were halted the latters scouts were withdrawn and the infantry pickets thrown out and the troops then lay down to await daybreak  the officers chatted together in low tones there were but two hours till dawn and with the prospect of heavy fighting before them none were inclined to sleep the question was whether the dervishes would defend their camp or attack the result of the battle of omdurman should have taught them that it was impossible to come to close quarters in the face of the terrible fire of our rifles fadil could give his experience at gedareh which would teach the same lesson on the other hand the storming of the dervish camp on the atbara and the fight at rosaires would both seem to show them that the assault of the egyptian force was irresistible  as gregory had been present at all four of these battles he was asked to give his opinion  i think that they will attack he said the dervish leaders rely upon the enthusiasm of their followers and in almost all the battles we have fought here they have rushed forward to the assault it was so in all the fights down by the red sea it was so in the attacks on lord wolseleys desert column it succeeded against hickss and bakers forces and even now they do not seem to have recognized that the egyptians whom they once despised have quite got over their dread of them and are able to face them steadily  there was only the faintest light in the sky when firing broke out in front everyone leapt to his feet and stood listening intently was it merely some dervish scouts who had come in contact with our pickets or was it an attacking force  the firing increased in volume and was evidently approaching the pickets then were being driven in and the dervishes were going to attack the men were ordered to lie down in the position in which they were to fight in five minutes after the first shot all were ready for action the pickets had run in and in the dim light numbers of dark figures could be made out  the guns and maxims at once spoke out while the infantry fired volleys it was still too dark to make out the movements of the enemy but their reply to our fire came louder and louder on our left and it was apparent that the intention of the dervishes was to turn that flank of our position  colonel wingate sent gregory to order the guns to turn their fire more in that direction and other officers ordered our right to advance somewhat while the left were slightly thrown back and pushed farther out the light was now getting brighter and heavy bodies of dervishes shouting and firing rushed forward but they were mown down by grape from our guns a storm of maxim bullets and the steady volleys of the infantry they wavered for a moment and then gradually fell back  the bugles sounded the advance and with a cheer our whole line moved forward down the gentle slope quickening their pace as the enemy retired before them and still keeping up a heavy fire towards the clump of trees that concealed the dervish camp from sight the enemys fire had now died out at twentyfive minutes past six the cease fire was sounded and as the troops advanced it was evident that resistance was at an end  as they issued through the trees many dervishes ran forward and surrendered and thousands of women and children were found in the camp happily none of these had been injured as a slight swell in the ground had prevented our bullets from falling among them numbers of dervishes who had passed through now turned and surrendered and the cavalry and camel corps started in pursuit  gregory had learned from the women that the emir el khatim with a number of his trained men from el obeid had passed through the camp in good order but that none of the other emirs had been seen and the 9th soudanese stated that as they advanced they had come upon a number of chiefs lying together a few hundred yards in advance of our first position one of the arab sheiks of the irregulars was sent to examine the spot and reported that the khalifa himself and almost all his great emirs lay there dead  with the khalifa were ali wad helu fadil two of his brothers the mahdis son and many other leaders behind them lay their dead horses and one of the men still alive said that the khalifa having failed in his attempt to advance over the crest had endeavoured to turn our position but seeing his followers crushed by our fire and retiring and after making an ineffectual attempt to rally them he recognized that the day was lost and calling on his emirs to dismount seated himself on his sheepskin as is the custom of arab chiefs who disdain to surrender the emirs seated themselves round him and all met their death unflinchingly the greater part being mowed down by the volleys fired by our troops as they advanced  gregory went up to colonel wingate  i beg your pardon sir but i find that khatim and probably his son who were so kind to my father at el obeid have retired with a fighting force have i your permission to ride forward and call upon them to surrender  certainly mr hilliard there has been bloodshed enough  being well mounted gregory overtook the cavalry and camel corps before they had gone two miles as they were delayed by disarming the dervishes who were coming in in large numbers half a mile away a small body of men were to be seen keeping together firing occasionally their leaders flag was flying and gregory learned from a native that it was khatims the cavalry were on the point of gathering for a charge as he rode up to the officer in command  i have colonel wingates orders sir to ride forward and try to persuade the emir to surrender he does not wish any further loss of life  very well sir i am sure we have killed enough of the poor beggars i hope he will give in  as gregory neared the party which was some five hundred strong several shots were fired at him he waved a white handkerchief and the firing ceased two emirs rode forward to meet him  i have come sir from the english general to ask you to surrender your cause is lost the khalifa is dead and most of his principal emirs he is anxious that there should be no further loss of blood  we can die sir as the others have done the elder emir a man of some sixty years old said sternly  but that would not avail your cause sir i solicited this mission as i owe much to you  how can that be the chief asked  i am the son of that white man whom you so kindly treated at el obeid where he saved the life of your son abu and he bowed to the younger emir  then he escaped the latter exclaimed  no sir he was killed at hebbeh when the steamer in which he was going down from khartoum was wrecked there but i found his journal in which he told the story of your kindness to him i can assure you that you shall be well treated if you surrender and those of your men who wish to do so will be allowed to return to el obeid i feel sure that when i tell our general how kindly you acted to the sole white officer who escaped from the battle you and your son will be treated with the greatest consideration  i owe more to your father than he did to me abu exclaimed he saved my life and did many great services to us  what say you father i am ready to die if you will it but as the khalifa is dead and the cause of mahdism lost i see no reason and assuredly no disgrace in submitting to the will of allah  so be it khatim said i have never thought of surrendering to the turks but as it is the will of allah i will do so  he turned to his men  it is useless to fight further he said the khalifa is dead it were better to return to your wives and families than to throw away your lives lay down your arms none will be injured  it was with evident satisfaction that the arabs laid musket and spear on the ground they would have fought to the death had he ordered them for they greatly loved their old chief but as it was his order they gladly complied with it as they saw that they had no chance of resisting the array of cavalry and camel corps gathered less than half a mile away  if you will ride back with me gregory said to the emir i will present you to the general the men had better follow i will ride forward and tell the officer commanding the cavalry that you have surrendered and that the men approaching are unarmed  he cantered back to the cavalry  they have all surrendered sir he said they have laid down their arms at the place where they stood and are going back to camp to surrender to colonel wingate  i am glad of it my orders are to push on another three miles on our return the camel corps shall collect the arms and bring them in  gregory rode back to the emirs who were slowly crossing the plain but who halted as the cavalry dashed on  now emirs he said we can ride quietly back to camp  you have not taken our arms khatim said  no emir it is not for me to ask for them it is the general to whom you surrender not me  i mourn to hear of the death of your father abu said as they rode in he was a good man and a skilful hakim  he speaks always in the highest terms of you emir in his journal and tells how he performed that operation on your left arm which was necessary to save your life but did so with great doubt fearing that never having performed one before he might fail to save your life  i have often wondered what became of him abu said i believed that he had got safely into khartoum and i enquired about him when we entered when i found that he was not among the killed i trusted that he might have escaped i grieve much to hear that he was killed while on his way down  such was the will of allah khatim said he preserved him at the battle he preserved him in the town he enabled him to reach khartoum but it was not his will that he should return to his countrymen i say with abu that he was a good man and while he remained with us was ever ready to use his skill for our benefit it was allahs will that his son should after all these years come to us for assuredly if any other white officer had asked us to surrender i would have refused  many strange things happen by the will of god gregory said it was wonderful that sixteen years after his death i should find my fathers journal at hebbeh and learn the story of his escape after the battle and of his stay with you at el obeid  gregory rode into camp between the two emirs he paused for a minute and handed over their followers to the officer in charge of the prisoners and then went to the hut formerly occupied by the khalifa where colonel wingate had now established himself colonel wingate came to the entrance  these are el khatim and his son abu sir they surrendered on learning that i was the son of the british officer whom they had protected and sheltered for a year after the battle of el obeid  the two emirs had withdrawn their swords and pistols from their sashes and advancing offered them to the colonel the latter did not offer to receive them  keep them he said we can honour brave foes and you and your followers were ready to fight and die when all seemed lost still more do i refuse to receive the weapons of the men who defended an english officer when he was helpless and a fugitive such an act would alone ensure good treatment at our hands your followers have surrendered  they have all laid down their arms khatim said  do you give me your promise that you will no more fight against us  we do khatim replied we have received our weapons back from you and would assuredly not use them against our conquerors  in that case emir you and your son are at liberty to depart and your men can return with you there will i trust be no more fighting in the land the mahdi is dead his successor proved a false prophet and is dead also mahdism is at an end and now our object will be to restore peace and prosperity to the land  in a short time all the prisoners will be released those who choose will be allowed to enter our service the rest can return to their homes we bear no enmity against them they fought under the orders of their chiefs and fought bravely and well when they return i hope they will settle down and cultivate the land and undo as far as may be the injuries they have inflicted upon it  i will write an order mr hilliard to release at once the men you have brought in then i will ask you to ride with these emirs to a point where there will be no fear of their falling in with our cavalry  you are a generous enemy khatim said and we thank you we give in our allegiance to the egyptian government and henceforth regard ourselves as its servants  see mr hilliard that the party takes sufficient food with it for their journey to el obeid  colonel wingate stepped forward and shook hands with the two emirs  you are no longer enemies he said and i know that henceforth i shall be able to rely upon your loyalty  we are beaten khatim said as they walked away each leading his horse you can fight like men and we who thought ourselves brave have been driven before you like dust before the wind and now when you are masters you can forgive as we should never have done you can treat us as friends you do not even take our arms and we can ride into el obeid with our heads high  it will be good for the soudan abu said your father told me often how peace and prosperity would return were you ever to become our masters and i felt that his words were true two hours ago i regretted that allah had not let me die so that i should not have lived to see our people conquered now i am glad i believe all that he said and that the soudan will some day become again a happy country  khatims men were separated from the rest of the prisoners six days supply of grain from the stores found in the camp were handed over to them together with ten camels with water skins and they started at once on their long march gregory rode out for a couple of miles with them and then took leave of the two emirs  come to el obeid khatim said and you shall be treated as a king farewell and may allah preserve you  so they parted and gregory rode back to the camp with a feeling of much happiness that he had been enabled in some way to repay the kindness shown to his dead father    chapter 23 an unexpected discovery   the victory had been a decisive one indeed three thousand prisoners great quantities of rifles swords grain and cattle had been captured together with six thousand women and children a thousand dervishes had been killed or wounded all the most important emirs had been killed and the sheik ed din the khalifas eldest son and intended successor was with twentynine other emirs among the prisoners our total loss was four men killed and two officers and twentyseven men wounded in the action  i am much obliged to you mr hilliard colonel wingate said to him that evening for the valuable services you have rendered and shall have the pleasure of including your name among the officers who have specially distinguished themselves as it was mentioned by general rundle and colonel parsonsby the former for undertaking the hazardous service of carrying despatches to the latter and by colonel parsons for gallant conduct in the fieldyou ought to be sure of promotion when matters are arranged here  thank you very much sir may i ask a favour  you know the outline of my story i have learned by the papers i obtained at hebbeh and others which i was charged not to open until i had certain proof of my fathers death that the name under which he was known was an assumed one he had had a quarrel with his family and as when he came out to egypt he for a time took a subordinate position he dropped a portion of his name intending to resume it when he had done something that even his family could not consider was any discredit to it i was myself unaware of the fact until on returning to omdurman from hebbeh i opened those papers i continued to bear the name by which i am known but as you are good enough to say that you will mention me in despatches i feel that i can now say that my real name is gregory hilliard hartley  i quite appreciate your motives in adhering to your former name mr hartley and in mentioning your services under your new name i will add a note saying that your name mentioned in former despatches for distinguished services had been erroneously given as gregory hilliard only  thank you very much sir  that evening when several of the officers were gathered in colonel wingates hut the latter said when one of them addressed gregory as hilliard  that is not his full name colonel hickman for various family reasons with which he has acquainted me he has borne it hitherto but he will in future be known by his entire name which is gregory hilliard hartley i may say that the reasons he has given me for not having hitherto used the family name are in my opinion amply sufficient involving as they do no discredit to himself or his father a brave gentleman who escaped from the massacre of hickss force at el obeid and finally died with colonel stewart at hebbeh  i seem to know the name colonel lewis said gregory hilliard hartley i have certainly either heard or seen it somewhere may i ask if your father bore the same christian names  yes sir  i have it now colonel lewis exclaimed a minute or two later i have seen it in an advertisement ever since i was a boy that name has occasionally been advertised for every two or three months it appeared in the times i can see it plainly now  five hundred pounds reward will be given for any information concerning the present abode or death of gregory hilliard hartley or the whereabouts of his issue if any he left england about the year 1881 it is supposed that he went to the united states or to one of the british colonies apply to messieurs tufton and sons solicitors lincolns inn fields  do you know when your father left england  he certainly left about that time i am nineteen now and i know that i was born a few weeks after he came out to alexandria  then there ought to be something good in store for you colonel wingate said people dont offer a reward of five hundred pounds unless something important hangs to it of course there may be another of the same name but it is hardly likely that anyone would bear the two same christian names as well as surname is it indiscreet to ask you if you know anything about your fathers family  not at all sir now that i have taken his name i need have no hesitation in relating what i know of him previous to his leaving england he married without his fathers consent and failing to make a living in england he accepted a situation in alexandria which he gained i may say because he was an excellent arabic scholar as he had spent two years in exploring tombs and monuments in egypt he was the second son of the honourable james hartley who was brother and i believe heir of the marquis of langdale and i should think by this time has succeeded to the title at his death my fathers eldest brother would of course succeed him  then my dear fellow colonel mahon said giving him a hearty slap on the shoulder allow me to congratulate you i can tell you that the title has been in abeyance for the past fourteen years everyone knows the facts your grandfather died before the marquis your uncle succeeded him lived only three years and being unmarried your father became the next earl and has been advertised for in vain ever since as unhappily your father is dead also you are unquestionably the marquis of langdale  gregory looked round with a bewildered air the news was so absolutely unexpected that he could hardly take it in  it seems impossible he said at last  it is not only impossible but a fact the colonel said there is nothing very surprising in it there were only two lives between your father and the peerage and as one was that of an old man the second of a man certainly in the prime of life but unmarried why the jews would have lent money on the chance  i fancy your uncle was a somewhat extravagant man i remember he kept a lot of race horses and so on but he could not have dipped very seriously into the property at any rate there will be fourteen years accumulations which will put matters straight  i hope you have got papers that will prove you are your fathers son and that he was brother of the late earl  i think there can be no difficulty about that gregory said i have letters from both my parents a copy of their marriage certificate and of the registers of my birth and baptism there are some persons in cairo who knew my father and a good many who knew my mother  then i should say that it would be quite safe sailing  i dont know lewis whether you are not entitled to that five hundred pounds  i am afraid not the other laughed mr hartley or rather i should say the earl would have discovered it himself i only recognized the name which plenty of people would have done as soon as they saw it in despatches  it will be a great disappointment to someone gregory said if they have been for fourteen years expecting to come in for this  you need not fret about that another officer said the next heir is a distant cousin he has been trying over and over again to get himself acknowledged but the courts would not hear of it and told him that it was no use applying until they had proof of the death of your father i know all about it because there was a howling young ass in the regiment from which i exchanged he was always giving himself airs on the strength of the title he expected to get and if he is still in the regiment there will be general rejoicings at his downfall  then i have met him gregory said on the way up he made himself very unpleasant and i heard from the other officers that he was extremely unpopular the major spoke very sharply to him for the offensive tone in which he addressed me and an officer sitting next to me said that he was terribly puffed by his expectations of obtaining a title shortly owing to the disappearance of those who stood before him in succession some of the officers chaffed him about it then i remember now that his name was hartley but as i had no idea at that time that that was also mine i never thought anything more about it until now as he was the only officer who has been in any way offensive to me since i left cairo nearly three years ago certainly i would rather that he should be the sufferer if i succeed in proving my right to the title than anyone else  i dont think he will suffer except in pride the officer said his father who was a very distant cousin of the earls had gone into trade and made a considerable fortune so that the young fellow was a great deal better off than the vast majority of men in the army it was the airs he gave himself on the strength of being able to indulge in an expenditure such as no one else in the regiment could attemptby keeping three or four race horses in training and other folliesthat had more to do with his unpopularity than his constant talk about the peerage he was so confident of getting  of course you will go home to england at once colonel wingate said the war is over now and it would be rank folly for you to stay here you have got the address of the lawyers who advertised for you and have only to go straight to them with your proofs in your hand and they will take all the necessary steps  i should say that it would facilitate matters if as you go through cairo you were to obtain statements or affidavits from some of the people who knew your mother stating that you are as you claim to be her son and that she was the wife of the gentleman known as gregory hilliard who went up as an interpreter with hicks i dont say that this would be necessary at all for the letters you have would in themselves go far to prove your case still the more proofs you accumulate the less likely there is of any opposition being offered to your claim any papers or letters of your mother might contain something that would strengthen the case  it is really a pity you know when you have done so well out here and would be certain to rise to a high post under the administration of the province which will be taken in hand in earnest now that you should have to give it all up  i scarcely know whether to be pleased or sorry myself sir at present i can hardly take in the change that this will make or appreciate its advantages  you will appreciate them soon enough one of the others laughed as long as this war has been going on one could put up with the heat and the dust and the horrible thirst one gets and the absence of anything decent to drink but now that it is all over the idea of settling down here permanently would be horrible except to menand there are such fellowswho are never happy unless they are at work to whom work is everythingmeat and drink and pleasure it would have to be everything out here for no one could ever think of marrying and bringing a wife to such a country as this women can hardly live in parts of india but the worst station in india would be a paradise in comparison with the soudan though possibly in time khartoum will be rebuilt and being situated between two rivers might become a possible placewhich is more than any other station in the soudan can befor ladies  i am not old enough to take those matters into consideration gregory laughed i am not twenty yet still i do think that anyone permanently stationed in the soudan would have to make up his mind to remain a bachelor  the next morning the greater portion of the prisoners were allowed to return to their homes all the grain and other stores found in the camp were divided among the women who were advised to return to their native villages but those who had lost their husbands were told that they might accompany the force to the river and would be taken down to omdurman and given assistance for a time until they could find some means of obtaining a subsistence  on returning to khartoum colonel wingate at gregorys request told lord kitchener of the discovery that had been made and said that he wished to return to england at once the next day the sirdar sent for gregory  colonel wingate has been speaking to me about you he said and i congratulate you on your good fortune in one respect i am sorry for you have done so surprisingly well that i had intended to appoint you to a responsible position in the soudan civil service which is now being formed colonel wingate says that you naturally wish to resign your present post but i should advise you not to do so the operation of the law in england is very uncertain i trust that in your case you will meet with but small difficulty in proving your birth but there may be some hitch in the matter some missing link  i will therefore grant you six months leave of absence at the end of that time you will see how you stand if things have gone on well with you you can then send in your resignation if on the other hand you find yourself unable to prove your claim it will still be open to you to return here and continue the career in which you have begun so well  i am greatly obliged to you sir for your kindness and should i fail in proving my claim i shall gladly avail myself of your offer at the end of the six months  now zaki he said on returning to the hut of which he had again taken possession we must have one more talk i have told you about the possible change in my position and that i was shortly leaving for england you begged me to take you with me and i told you that if you decided to go i would do so i shall be put in orders tomorrow for six months leave if i succeed in proving my claim to a title which is what you would call here an emirship i shall not return if i fail i shall be back again in six months now i want you to think it over seriously before you decide  everything will be different there from what you are accustomed to you will have to dress differently live differently and be among strangers it is very cold there in winter and it is never what you would call hot in summer  it is not that i should not like to have you with me we have been together now for three years you saved my life at atbara and have always been faithfully devoted to me it is for your sake not my own that i now speak  i will go with you master if you will take me i hope never to leave you till i die  very well zaki i am more than willing to take you if i remain in england you shall always be with me if you choose to remain but i shall then be able to give you a sum that will enable you to buy much land and to hire men to work your sakies to till your land and to make you what you would call a rich man here should you wish to return at the end of the six months if i return you will of course come back with me  on the following day after having said goodbye to all his friends disposed of his horse and belongings and drawn the arrears of his pay gregory took his place in the train for the railway had now been carried to khartoum  four days later he arrived at cairo his first step was to order european clothes for zaki and a warm and heavilylined greatcoat for it was now the first week in december and although delightful at cairo it would be to the native bitterly cold in england  then he went to the bank and mr murray on hearing the story made an affidavit at the british residents affirming that he had for fifteen years known mrs gregory hilliard and was aware that she was the widow of mr gregory hilliard who joined hicks pasha and that mr gregory hilliard now claiming to be mr gregory hilliard hartley was her son mr gregory hilliard senior had kept an account at the bank for eighteen months and had on leaving given instructions for mrs hilliards cheques to be honoured mrs hilliard had received a pension from the egyptian government up to the date of her death as his widow he having fallen in the service of the khedive  gregory looked up his old nurse whom he found comfortable and happy she also made an affidavit to the effect that she had entered the service of mrs hilliard more than eighteen years before as nurse to gregory hilliard then a child of a year old she had been in her service until her death and she could testify that gregory hilliard hartley was the child she had nursed  after a stay of four days at cairo gregory started for england even he who had heard of london from his mother was astonished at its noise extent and bustle while zaki was almost stupefied he took two rooms at cannon street hotel for himself and servant and next morning went to the offices of messieurs tufton and sons the solicitors he sent in his name as mr gregory hilliard hartley  even in the outer office he heard an exclamation of surprise as the piece of paper on which he had written his name was read he was at once shown in mr tufton looked at him with a little surprise  i am the son of the gentleman for whom i understand you have advertised for a long time  if you can prove that you are so sir mr tufton said wearily you are the marquis of langdalethat is to say if your father is deceased  may i ask to begin with how it is that the advertisement has for so many years remained unanswered  that is easily accounted for sir my father being unable to obtain a situation in england accepted a very minor appointment in the house of messieurs partridge and company at alexandria this he obtained owing to his knowledge of arabic he had been engaged as you doubtless know for two years in explorations there he did not wish it to be known that he had been obliged to accept such a position so he dropped his surname and went out as gregory hilliard as the firms establishment at alexandria was burned during the insurrection there he went to cairo and obtained an appointment as interpreter to general hicks he escaped when the army of that officer was destroyed at el obeid was a prisoner for many months at that town and then escaped to khartoum he came down in the steamer with colonel stewart that steamer was wrecked at hebbeh and all on board with one exception were massacred  my mother always retained some hope that he might have escaped from his knowledge of arabic she received a small pension from the egyptian government for the loss of my father and added to this by teaching in the families of several turkish functionaries three years ago she died and i obtained through the kindness of lord kitchener an appointment as interpreter in the egyptian army i was present at the fights of abu hamed the atbara omdurman and the late victory by colonel wingate my name as gregory hilliard was mentioned in despatches and will be mentioned again in that sent by colonel wingate but this time with the addition of hartley  it was only accidentally on the night after that battle that i learned that my father was the heir to the marquis of langdale and i thereupon obtained six months leave to come here  it is a singular story the lawyer said and if supported by proofs there can be no question that you are the marquis for whom we have been advertising for many years  i think that i have ample proof sir here is the certificate of my fathers marriage and the copies of the registers of my birth and baptism here is the journal of my father from the time he was taken prisoner till his death here are his letter to my mother and letters to his father brother and sisters which were to be forwarded by her should she choose to return to england here are two affidavitsthe one from a gentleman who has known me from childhood the other from the woman who nursed me and who remained with our family till i reached the soudan here also is a letter that i found among my mothers papers written from khartoum in which my father speaks of resuming the name of hartley if things went well there  then sir mr tufton said i think i can congratulate you upon obtaining the title but at the same time i will ask you to leave these papers with me for an hour i will put everything else aside and go through them you understand i am not doubting your word but of course it is necessary to ascertain the exact purport of these letters and documents if they are as you say the evidence in favour of your claim would be overwhelming  of course it is necessary that we should be most cautious we have for upwards of a hundred years been solicitors to the family and as such have contested all applications from the junior branch of the family that the title should be declared vacant by the death of the last marquis who would be your uncle we have been the more anxious to do so as we understand the next claimant is a young man of extravagant habits and in no way worthy to succeed to the title  i will return in an hour and a half sir gregory said rising i may say that the contents of this pocketbook although intensely interesting to myself as a record of my father do not bear upon the title they are a simple record of his life from the time when the army of hicks pasha was destroyed to the date of his own murder at hebbeh the last entry was made before he landed i mention this as it may save you time in going through the papers  gregory went out and spent the time in watching the wonderful flow of traffic and gazing into the shops and when he returned to the office he was at once shown in mr tufton rose and shook him warmly by the hand  i consider these documents to be absolutely conclusive my lord he said the letters to your grandfather uncle and aunts are conclusive as to his identity and that of your mother strengthened by the two affidavits is equally conclusive as to your being his son i will take the necessary measures to lay these papers before the court which has several times had the matter in hand and to obtain a declaration that you have indisputably proved yourself to be the son of the late gregory hilliard hartley and therefore entitled to the title and estates with all accumulations of the marquis of langdale  thank you very much sir i will leave the matter entirely in your hands can you tell me the address of my aunts as you will have seen by my fathers letter he believed implicitly in their affection for him  their address is the manor house wimperton tavistock devon they retired there at the accession of their brother to the title it has been used as a dower house in the family for many years and pending the search for your father i obtained permission for them to continue to reside there i was not obliged to ask for an allowance for them as they had an income under their mothers marriage settlement sufficient for them to live there in comfort  i will not give you the letter addressed to them as i wish to show the original in court but i will have a copy made for you at once and i will attest it  now may i ask how you are situated with regard to money i have sufficient confidence in the justice of your claim to advance any sum for your immediate wants  thank you sir i am in no need of any advance my mothers savings amounted to five hundred pounds of which i only drew fifty to buy my outfit when i went up to the soudan my pay sufficed for my wants there and i drew out the remaining four hundred and fifty pounds when i left cairo so i am amply provided  gregory remained four days in london obtaining suitable clothes then attended by zaki he took his place in the great western for tavistock zaki had already picked up a good deal of english and gregory talked to him only in that language on their way down from the battlefield so that he could now express himself in simple phrases  mr tufton had on the previous day written at gregorys request to his aunts saying that the son of their brother had called upon him and given him proofs which he considered incontestable of his identity and of the death of his father he was the bearer of a letter from his father to them and proposed delivering it the next day in person he agreed with gregory that it was advisable to send down this letter as otherwise the ladies might doubt whether he was really what he claimed to be as his fathers letter might very well have come into the hands of a third person  he went down by the night mail to tavistock put up at an hotel and after breakfast drove over to the manor house and sent in a card which he had had printed in town he was shown into a room where the two ladies were waiting for him they had been some four or five years younger than his father a fact of which he was not aware and instead of being elderly women as he expected he found by their appearance they were scarcely entering middle age they were evidently much agitated  i have come down without waiting for an invitation he said i was anxious to deliver my fathers letter to you or at least a copy of it as soon as possible it was written before his death some eighteen years ago and was intended for my mother to give to you should she return to england its interest to you consists chiefly in the proof of my fathers affection for you and that he felt he could rely on yours for him i may say that this is a copy signed as correct by mr tufton he could not give me the original as it would be required as an evidence of my fathers identity in the application he is about to make for me to be declared heir to the title  then gregory has been dead eighteen years the elder of the ladies said we have always hoped that he would be alive in one of the colonies and that sooner or later he would see the advertisement that had been put in the papers  no madam he went out to alexandria with my mother shortly before i was born he died some three or four years before his brother it was seldom my mother saw an english paper unfortunately as it turned out my father had dropped his surname when he accepted a situation which was a subordinate one at alexandria and his reason for taking it was that my mother was in weak health and the doctor said it was necessary she should go to a warm climate therefore had any of her friends seen the advertisement they would not have known that it applied to her i myself did not know that my proper name was hartley until a year back when i discovered my fathers journal at hebbeh the place where he was murdered and then opened the documents that my mother had entrusted to me before her death with an injunction not to open them until i had ascertained for certain that my father was no longer alive  one of the ladies took the letter and opened it they read it together  poor gregory one said wiping her eyes we were both fond of him and certainly would have done all in our power to assist his widow he was nearer our age than geoffrey it was a terrible grief to us when he quarrelled with our father of course our sympathies were with gregory but we never ventured to say so and our father never mentioned his name from the day he left the house why did not your mother send his letter to us  because she did not need assistance she was maintaining herself and me in comfort by teaching music french and english to the wives and children of several of the high egyptian officials  how long is it since you lost her  more than three years ago at her death i was fortunate enough to obtain an appointment similar to that my father had and at the same time a commission in the egyptian service and have been fortunate in being two or three times mentioned in despatches  yes curiously enough after receiving mr tuftons letter we saw colonel wingates despatch in the paper in which your name is mentioned we should have been astonished indeed had we not opened the letter before we looked at the paper  well gregory we are very glad to see you and to find that you have done honour to the name the despatch said that you have been previously mentioned under the name of gregory hilliard we always file our papers and we spent an hour after breakfast in going through them i suppose you threw up your appointment as soon as you discovered that geoffrey died years ago and that you had come into the title  i should have thrown it up but lord kitchener was good enough to give me six months leave so that if i should fail to prove my right to the title i could return there and take up my work again he was so kind as to say that i should be given a responsible position in the civil administration of the soudan  well we both feel very proud of you and it does sound wonderful that being under twenty you should have got on so well without friends or influence i hope you intend to stay with us until you have to go up to london about these affairs  i shall be very happy to stay a few days aunt but it is better that i should be on the spot as there may be questions that have to be answered and signatures and all sorts of things  i have brought my arab servant down with me he has been with me for three years and is most faithful and devoted and moreover he once saved my life at tremendous risk to himself  oh of course we can put him up can he speak english  he speaks a little english and is improving fast  does he dress as a native  no aunt he would soon freeze to death in his native garb as soon as i got down to cairo with him i put him into good european clothes he is a fine specimen of a soudan arab but when he came to me he was somewhat weakly however he soon got over that  where is he now  he is with the trap outside i told him that he had better not come in until i had seen you for i thought that your domestics would not know what to do with him till they had your orders  you brought your portmanteau with you i hope  i have brought it but not knowing whether it would be wanted for i did not know whether you would take sufficiently to me to ask me to stay  the idea of such a thing you must have had a bad opinion of us  no aunt i had the best of opinions i am sure that my father would not have written as he did to you unless he had been very fond of you still as at present i am not proved to be your nephew i thought that you might not be disposed to ask me to stay  now with your permission i will go and tell zakithat is the mans nameto bring in my portmanteau i can then send the trap back  do you know gregory one of his aunts said that evening even putting aside the fact that you are our nephew we are delighted that the title and estates are not to go to the next heir he came down here about a year ago his regiment had just returned from the soudan he drove straight to the hall and requested to be shown over it saying that in a short time he was going to take possession the housekeeper came across here quite in distress and said that he talked as if he were already master said he should make alterations in one place enlarge the drawing room build a conservatory against it do away with some of the pictures on the walls and in fact he made himself very objectionable he came on here and behaved in a most offensive and ungentlemanly way he actually enquired of us whether we were tenants by right or merely on sufferance i told him that if he wanted to know he had better enquire of mr tufton and flossie who is more outspoken than i am said at once that whether we were tenants for life or not we should certainly not continue to reside here if so objectionable a person were master at the hall he was very angry but i cut him short by saying  this is our house at present sir and unless you leave it at once i shall call the gardener in and order him to eject you  i am not surprised at what you say aunt for i met the fellow myself on the way up to omdurman and found him an offensive cad it has been a great satisfaction to me to know that he was so for if he had been a nice fellow i could not have helped being sorry to deprive him of the title and estates which he has for years considered to be his  after remaining four days at the manor house gregory went back to town a notice had already been served upon the former claimant to the title that an application would be made to the court to hear the claim of gregory hilliard hartley nephew of the late marquis to be acknowledged as his successor to the title and estates and that if he wished to appear by counsel he could do so  the matter was not heard of for another three months lieutenant hartley was in court and was represented by a queens counsel of eminence who however when gregorys narrative had been told and the various documents put in at once stated that after the evidence he had heard he felt that it would be vain to contest the case at this point but that he reserved the right of appealing should anything come to light which would alter the complexion of the affair  the judgment was that gregory hilliard hartley had proved himself to be the son of the late gregory hilliard hartley brother of and heir to the late marquis of langdale and was therefore seized of the title and estates  as soon as the case was decided gregory went down again to devonshire and asked his aunts to take charge for him this they at first said was impossible but he urged that if they refused to do so he should be driven to go back to the soudan again  my dear aunts he said what in the world am i to do i know no one i know nothing of english customs or society i should indeed be the most forlorn person in existence with a large country estate and a mansion in london i want someone to introduce me into society and set me on my legs manage me and my house and preside at my table i am not yet twenty and have not as much knowledge of english ways as a boy of ten i should be taken in and duped in every way and be at the mercy of every adventurer i feel that it would be a sacrifice for you to leave your pretty home here but i am sure for the sake of my father you will not refuse to do so  his aunts admitted that there was great justice in what he said and finally submitted to his request to preside over his house until as they said the time came when he would introduce a younger mistress  zaki when his six months trial was over scorned the idea of returning to the soudan declaring that if gregory would not keep him he would rather beg in the streets than go back there  it is all wonderful here he said we poor arabs could not dream of such things no master as long as you live i shall stay here  very well zaki so be it and i can promise you that if i die before you you will be so provided for that you will be able to live in as much comfort as you now enjoy and in addition you will be your own master  zaki shook his head  i should be a fool to wish to be my own master he said after having such a good one at present  gregory is learning the duties of a large land owner and is already very popular in his part of devonshire the mansion in london has not yet been reopened as gregory says he must learn his lessons perfectly before he ventures to take his place in society
