15141093	the fallen leaves  by wilkie collins   to caroline  experience of the reception of the fallen leaves by intelligent readers who have followed the course of the periodical publication at home and abroad has satisfied me that the design of the work speaks for itself and that the scrupulous delicacy of treatment in certain portions of the story has been as justly appreciated as i could wish having nothing to explain and so far as my choice of subject is concerned nothing to excuse i leave my book without any prefatory pleading for it to make its appeal to the reading public on such merits as it may possess  w c gloucester place london july 1st 1879     the prologue  i  the resistless influences which are one day to reign supreme over our poor hearts and to shape the sad short course of our lives are sometimes of mysteriously remote origin and find their devious ways to us through the hearts and the lives of strangers  while the young man whose troubled career it is here proposed to follow was wearing his first jacket and bowling his first hoop a domestic misfortune falling on a household of strangers was destined nevertheless to have its ultimate influence over his happiness and to shape the whole aftercourse of his life  for this reason some first words must precede the story and must present the brief narrative of what happened in the household of strangers by what devious ways the event here related affected the chief personage of these pages when he grew to manhood it will be the business of the story to trace over land and sea among men and women in bright days and dull days alike until the end is reached and the pen god willing is put back in the desk  ii  old benjamin ronald of the stationers company took a young wife at the ripe age of fifty and carried with him into the holy estate of matrimony some of the habits of his bachelor life  as a bachelor he had never willingly left his shop situated in that exclusively commercial region of london which is called the city from one years end to another as a married man he persisted in following the same monotonous course with this one difference that he now had a woman to follow it with him travelling by railway he explained to his wife will make your head acheit makes my head ache travelling by sea will make you sickit makes me sick if you want change of air every sort of air is to be found in the city if you admire the beauties of nature there is finsbury square with the beauties of nature carefully selected and arranged when we are in london you and i are all right and when we are out of london you and i are all wrong as surely as the autumn holiday season set in so surely old ronald resisted his wifes petition for a change of scene in that form of words a man habitually fortified behind his own inbred obstinacy and selfishness is for the most part an irresistible power within the limits of his domestic circle as a rule patient mrs ronald yielded and her husband stood revealed to his neighbours in the glorious character of a married man who had his own way  but in the autumn of 1856 the retribution which sooner or later descends on all despotisms great and small overtook the iron rule of old ronald and defeated the domestic tyrant on the battlefield of his own fireside  the children born of the marriage two in number were both daughters the elder had mortally offended her father by marrying imprudentlyin a pecuniary sense he had declared that she should never enter his house again and he had mercilessly kept his word the younger daughter now eighteen years of age proved to be also a source of parental inquietude in another way she was the passive cause of the revolt which set her fathers authority at defiance for some little time past she had been out of health after many ineffectual trials of the mild influence of persuasion her mothers patience at last gave way mrs ronald insistedyes actually insistedon taking miss emma to the seaside  whats the matter with you old ronald asked detecting something that perplexed him in his wifes look and manner on the memorable occasion when she asserted a will of her own for the first time in her life  a man of finer observation would have discovered the signs of no ordinary anxiety and alarm struggling to show themselves openly in the poor womans face her husband only saw a change that puzzled him send for emma he said his natural cunning inspiring him with the idea of confronting the mother and daughter and of seeing what came of that emma appeared plump and short with large blue eyes and full pouting lips and splendid yellow hair otherwise miserably pale languid in her movements careless in her dress sullen in her manner out of health as her mother said and as her father saw  you can see for yourself said mrs ronald that the girl is pining for fresh air i have heard ramsgate recommended  old ronald looked at his daughter she represented the one tender place in his nature it was not a large place but it did exist and the proof of it is that he began to yieldwith the worst possible grace  well we will see about it he said  there is no time to be lost mrs ronald persisted i mean to take her to ramsgate tomorrow  mr ronald looked at his wife as a dog looks at the maddened sheep that turns on him you mean repeated the stationer upon my soulwhat next you mean where is the money to come from answer me that  mrs ronald declined to be drawn into a conjugal dispute in the presence of her daughter she took emmas arm and led her to the door there she stopped and spoke i have already told you that the girl is ill she said to her husband and i now tell you again that she must have the sea air for gods sake dont let us quarrel i have enough to try me without that she closed the door on herself and her daughter and left her lord and master standing face to face with the wreck of his own outraged authority  what further progress was made by the domestic revolt when the bedroom candles were lit and the hour of retirement had arrived with the night is naturally involved in mystery this alone is certain on the next morning the luggage was packed and the cab was called to the door mrs ronald spoke her parting words to her husband in private  i hope i have not expressed myself too strongly about taking emma to the seaside she said in gentle pleading tones i am anxious about our girls health if i have offended youwithout meaning it god knowssay you forgive me before i go i have tried honestly dear to be a good wife to you and you have always trusted me havent you and you trust me still  she took his lean cold hand and pressed it fervently her eyes rested on him with a strange mixture of timidity and anxiety still in the prime of her life she preserved the personal attractionsthe fair calm refined face the natural grace of look and movementwhich had made her marriage to a man old enough to be her father a cause of angry astonishment among all her friends in the agitation that now possessed her her colour rose her eyes brightened she looked for the moment almost young enough to be emmas sister her husband opened his hard old eyes in surly bewilderment why need you make this fuss he asked i dont understand you mrs ronald shrank at those words as if he had struck her she kissed him in silence and joined her daughter in the cab  for the rest of that day the persons in the stationers employment had a hard time of it with their master in the shop something had upset old ronald he ordered the shutters to be put up earlier that evening than usual instead of going to his club at the tavern round the corner he took a long walk in the lonely and lifeless streets of the city by night there was no disguising it from himself his wifes behaviour at parting had made him uneasy he naturally swore at her for taking that liberty while he lay awake alone in his bed damn the woman what does she mean the cry of the soul utters itself in various forms of expression that was the cry of old ronalds soul literally translated  iii  the next morning brought him a letter from ramsgate  i write immediately to tell you of our safe arrival we have found comfortable lodgings as the address at the head of this letter will inform you in albion place i thank you and emma desires to thank you also for your kindness in providing us with ample means for taking our little trip it is beautiful weather today the sea is calm and the pleasureboats are out we do not of course expect to see you here but if you do by any chance overcome your objection to moving out of london i have a little request to make please let me hear of your visit beforehandso that i may not omit all needful preparations i know you dislike being troubled with letters except on business so i will not write too frequently be so good as to take no news for good news in the intervals when you have a few minutes to spare you will write i hope and tell me how you and the shop are going on emma sends you her love in which i beg to join so the letter was expressed and so it ended  they neednt be afraid of my troubling them calm seas and pleasureboats stuff and nonsense such was the first impression which his wifes report of herself produced on old ronalds mind after a while he looked at the letter againand frowned and reflected please let me hear of your visit beforehand he repeated to himself as if the request had been in some incomprehensible way offensive to him he opened the drawer of his desk and threw the letter into it when business was over for the day he went to his club at the tavern and made himself unusually disagreeable to everybody  a week passed in the interval he wrote briefly to his wife im all right and the shop goes on as usual he also forwarded one or two letters which came for mrs ronald no more news reached him from ramsgate i suppose theyre enjoying themselves he reflected the house looks queer without them ill go to the club  he stayed later than usual and drank more than usual that night it was nearly one in the morning when he let himself in with his latchkey and went upstairs to bed  approaching the toilettetable he found a letter lying on it addressed to mr ronaldprivate it was not in his wifes handwriting not in any handwriting known to him the characters sloped the wrong way and the envelope bore no postmark he eyed it over and over suspiciously at last he opened it and read these lines  you are advised by a true friend to lose no time in looking after your wife there are strange doings at the seaside if you dont believe me ask mrs turner number 1 slains row ramsgate  no address no date no signaturean anonymous letter the first he had ever received in the long course of his life  his hard brain was in no way affected by the liquor that he had drunk he sat down on his bed mechanically folding and refolding the letter the reference to mrs turner produced no impression on him of any sort no person of that name common as it was happened to be numbered on the list of his friends or his customers but for one circumstance he would have thrown the letter aside in contempt his memory reverted to his wifes incomprehensible behaviour at parting addressing him through that remembrance the anonymous warning assumed a certain importance to his mind he went down to his desk in the back office and took his wifes letter out of the drawer and read it through slowly ha he said pausing as he came across the sentence which requested him to write beforehand in the unlikely event of his deciding to go to ramsgate he thought again of the strangely persistent way in which his wife had dwelt on his trusting her he recalled her nervous anxious looks her deepening colour her agitation at one moment and then her sudden silence and sudden retreat to the cab fed by these irritating influences the inbred suspicion in his nature began to take fire slowly she might be innocent enough in asking him to give her notice before he joined her at the seasideshe might naturally be anxious to omit no needful preparation for his comfort still he didnt like it no he didnt like it an appearance as of a slow collapse passed little by little over his rugged wrinkled face he looked many years older than his age as he sat at the desk with the flaring candlelight close in front of him thinking the anonymous letter lay before him side by side with his wifes letter on a sudden he lifted his gray head and clenched his fist and struck the venomous written warning as if it had been a living thing that could feel whoever you are he said ill take your advice  he never even made the attempt to go to bed that night his pipe helped him through the comfortless and dreary hours once or twice he thought of his daughter why had her mother been so anxious about her why had her mother taken her to ramsgate perhaps as a blindah yes perhaps as a blind more for the sake of something to do than for any other reason he packed a handbag with a few necessaries as soon as the servant was stirring he ordered her to make him a cup of strong coffee after that it was time to show himself as usual on the opening of the shop to his astonishment he found his clerk taking down the shutters in place of the porter  what does this mean he asked where is farnaby  the clerk looked at his master and paused aghast with a shutter in his hands  good lord what has come to you he cried are you ill  old ronald angrily repeated his question where is farnaby  i dont know was the answer  you dont know have you been up to his bedroom  yes  well  well he isnt in his bedroom and whats more his bed hasnt been slept in last night farnabys off sirnobody knows where  old ronald dropped heavily into the nearest chair this second mystery following on the mystery of the anonymous letter staggered him but his business instincts were still in good working order he held out his keys to the clerk get the petty cashbook he said and see if the money is all right  the clerk received the keys under protest thats not the right reading of the riddle he remarked  do as i tell you  the clerk opened the moneydrawer under the counter counted the pounds shillings and pence paid by chance customers up to the closing of the shop on the previous evening compared the result with the petty cashbook and answered right to a halfpenny  satisfied so far old ronald condescended to approach the speculative side of the subject with the assistance of his subordinate if what you said just now means anything he resumed it means that you suspect the reason why farnaby has left my service lets hear it  you know that i never liked john farnaby the clerk began an active young fellow and a clever young fellow i grant you but a bad servant for all that false mr ronaldfalse to the marrow of his bones  mr ronalds patience began to give way come to the facts he growled why has farnaby gone off without a word to anybody do you know that  i know no more than you do the clerk answered coolly dont fly into a passion i have got some facts for you if you will only give me time turn them over in your own mind and see what they come to three days ago i was short of postagestamps and i went to the office farnaby was there waiting at the desk where they pay the postoffice orders there must have been ten or a dozen people with letters orders and what not between him and me i got behind him quietly and looked over his shoulder i saw the clerk give him the money for his postoffice order five pounds in gold which i reckoned as they lay on the counter and a banknote besides which he crumpled up in his hand i cant tell you how much it was for i only know it was a banknote just ask yourself how a porter on twenty shillings a week with a mother who takes in washing and a father who takes in drink comes to have a correspondent who sends him an order for five sovereignsand a banknote value unknown say hes turned bettingman in secret very good theres the postoffice order in that case to show that hes got a run of luck if he has got a run of luck tell me thiswhy does he leave his place like a thief in the night hes not a slave hes not even an apprentice when he thinks he can better himself he has no earthly need to keep it a secret that he means to leave your service he may have met with an accident to be sure but thats not my belief i say hes up to some mischief and now comes the question what are we to do  mr ronald listening with his head down and without interposing a word on his own part made an extraordinary answer leave it he said leave it till tomorrow  why the clerk answered without ceremony  mr ronald made another extraordinary answer because i am obliged to go out of town for the day look after the business the ironmongers man over the way will help you to put up the shutters at night if anybody inquires for me say i shall be back tomorrow with those parting directions heedless of the effect that he had produced on the clerk he looked at his watch and left the shop   iv  the bell which gave five minutes notice of the starting of the ramsgate train had just rung  while the other travellers were hastening to the platform two persons stood passively apart as if they had not even yet decided on taking their places in the train one of the two was a smart young man in a cheap travelling suit mainly noticeable by his florid complexion his restless dark eyes and his profusely curling black hair the other was a middleaged woman in frowsy garments tall and stout sly and sullen the smart young man stood behind the uncongeniallooking person with whom he had associated himself using her as a screen to hide him while he watched the travellers on their way to the train as the bell rang the woman suddenly faced her companion and pointed to the railway clock  are you waiting to make up your mind till the train has gone she asked  the young man frowned impatiently i am waiting for a person whom i expect to see he answered if the person travels by this train we shall travel by it if not we shall come back here and look out for the next train and so on till nighttime if its necessary  the woman fixed her small scowling gray eyes on the man as he replied in those terms look here she broke out i like to see my way before me youre a stranger young mister and its as likely as not youve given me a false name and address that dont matter false names are commoner than true ones in my line of life but mind this i dont stir a step farther till ive got half the money in my hand and my returnticket there and back  hold your tongue the man suddenly interposed in a whisper its all right ill get the tickets  he looked while he spoke at an elderly traveller hastening by with his head down deep in thought noticing nobody the traveller was mr ronald the young man who had that moment recognized him was his runaway porter john farnaby  returning with the tickets the porter took his repellent travelling companion by the arm and hurried her along the platform to the train the money she whispered as they took their places farnaby handed it to her ready wrapped up in a morsel of paper she opened the paper satisfied herself that no trick had been played her and leaned back in her corner to go to sleep the train started old ronald travelled by the second class his porter and his porters companion accompanied him secretly by the third  v  it was still early in the afternoon when mr ronald descended the narrow street which leads from the high land of the southeastern railway station to the port of ramsgate asking his way of the first policeman whom he met he turned to the left and reached the cliff on which the houses in albion place are situated farnaby followed him at a discreet distance and the woman followed farnaby  arrived in sight of the lodginghouse mr ronald pausedpartly to recover his breath partly to compose himself he was conscious of a change of feeling as he looked up at the windows his errand suddenly assumed a contemptible aspect in his own eyes he almost felt ashamed of himself after twenty years of undisturbed married life was it possible that he had doubted his wifeand that at the instigation of a stranger whose name even was unknown to him if she was to step out in the balcony and see me down here he thought what a fool i should look he felt halfinclined at the moment when he lifted the knocker of the door to put it back again quietly and return to london no it was too late the maidservant was hanging up her birdcage in the area of the house the maidservant had seen him  does mrs ronald lodge here he asked  the girl lifted her eyebrows and opened her mouthstared at him in speechless confusionand disappeared in the kitchen regions this strange reception of his inquiry irritated him unreasonably he knocked with the absurd violence of a man who vents his anger on the first convenient thing that he can find the landlady opened the door and looked at him in stern and silent surprise  does mrs ronald lodge here he repeated  the landlady answered with some appearance of effortthe effort of a person who was carefully considering her words before she permitted them to pass her lips  mrs ronald has taken rooms here but she has not occupied them yet  not occupied them yet the words bewildered him as if they had been spoken in an unknown tongue he stood stupidly silent on the doorstep his anger was gone an allmastering fear throbbed heavily at his heart the landlady looked at him and said to her secret self just what i suspected there is something wrong  perhaps i have not sufficiently explained myself sir she resumed with grave politeness mrs ronald told me that she was staying at ramsgate with friends she would move into my house she said when her friends leftbut they had not quite settled the day yet she calls here for letters indeed she was here early this morning to pay the second weeks rent i asked when she thought of moving in she didnt seem to know her friends as i understood had not made up their minds i must say i thought it a little odd would you like to leave any message  he recovered himself sufficiently to speak can you tell me where her friends live he said  the landlady shook her head no indeed i offered to save mrs ronald the trouble of calling here by sending letters or cards to her present residence she declined the offerand she has never mentioned the address would you like to come in and rest sir i will see that your card is taken care of if you wish to leave it  thank you maamit doesnt mattergood morning  the landlady looked after him as he descended the housesteps its the husband peggy she said to the servant waiting inquisitively behind her poor old gentleman and such a respectablelooking woman too  mr ronald walked mechanically to the end of the row of houses and met the wide grand view of sea and sky there were some seats behind the railing which fenced the edge of the cliff he sat down perfectly stupefied and helpless on the nearest bench  at the close of life the loss of a mans customary nourishment extends its debilitating influence rapidly from his body to his mind mr ronald had tasted nothing but his cup of coffee since the previous night his mind began to wander strangely he was not angry or frightened or distressed instead of thinking of what had just happened he was thinking of his young days when he had been a cricketplayer one special game revived in his memory at which he had been struck on the head by the ball just the same feeling he reflected vacantly with his hat off and his hand on his forehead dazed and giddyjust the same feeling  he leaned back on the bench and fixed his eyes on the sea and wondered languidly what had come to him farnaby and the woman still following waited round the corner where they could just keep him in view  the blue lustre of the sky was without a cloud the sunny sea leapt under the fresh westerly breeze from the beach the cries of children at play the shouts of donkeyboys driving their poor beasts the distant notes of brass instruments playing a waltz and the mellow music of the small waves breaking on the sand rose joyously together on the fragrant air on the next bench a dirty old boatman was prosing to a stupid old visitor mr ronald listened with a sense of vacant content in the mere act of listening the boatmans words found their way to his ears like the other sounds that were abroad in the air yes thems the goodwin sands where you see the lightship and that steamer there towing a vessel into the harbour thats the ramsgate tug do you know what i should like to see i should like to see the ramsgate tug blow up why ill tell you why i belong to broadstairs i dont belong to ramsgate very well im idling here as you may see without one copper piece in my pocket to rub against another what trade do i belong to i dont belong to no trade i belong to a boat the boats rotting at broadstairs for want of work and all along of what all along of the tug the tug has took the bread out of our mouths me and my mates wait a bit ill show you how what did a ship do in the good old times when she got on them sandsgoodwin sands went to pieces if it come on to blow or got sucked down little by little when it was fair weather now im coming to it what did we do in the good old times mind you when we happened to see that ship in distress out with our boat blow high or blow low out with our boat and saved the lives of the crew did you say well yes saving the crew was part of the days work to be sure the part we didnt get paid for we saved the cargo master and got salvage hundreds of pounds i tell you divided amongst us by law ah those times are gone a parcel of sneaks get together and subscribe to build a steamtug when a ship gets on the sands now out goes the tug night and day alike and brings her safe into harbour and takes the bread out of our mouths shamefulthats what i call itshameful  the last words of the boatmans lament fell lower lower lower on mr ronalds earshe lost them altogetherhe lost the view of the seahe lost the sense of the wind blowing over him suddenly he was roused as if from a deep sleep on one side the man from broadstairs was shaking him by the collar i say master cheer up whats come to you on the other side a compassionate lady was offering her smellingbottle i am afraid sir you have fainted he struggled to his feet and vacantly thanked the lady the man from broadstairswith an eye to salvagetook charge of the human wreck and towed him to the nearest publichouse a chop and a glass of brandyandwater said this good samaritan of the nineteenth century thats what you want im peckish myself and ill keep you company  he was perfectly passive in the hands of any one who would take charge of him he submitted as if he had been the boatmans dog and had heard the whistle  it could only be truly said that he had come to himself when there had been time enough for him to feel the reanimating influence of the food and drink then he got to his feet and looked with incredulous wonder at the companion of his meal the man from broadstairs opened his greasy lips and was silenced by the sudden appearance of a gold coin between mr ronalds finger and thumb dont speak to me pay the bill and bring me the change outside when the boatman joined him he was reading a letter walking to and fro and speaking at intervals to himself god help me have i lost my senses i dont know what to do next he referred to the letter again if you dont believe me ask mrs turner number 1 slains row ramsgate he put the letter back in his pocket and rallied suddenly slains row he said turning to the boatman take me there directly and keep the change for yourself  the boatmans gratitude was apparently beyond expression in words he slapped his pocket cheerfully and that was all leading the way inland he went downhill and uphill againthen turned aside towards the eastern extremity of the town  farnaby still following with the woman behind him stopped when the boatman diverged towards the east and looked up at the name of the street ive got my instructions he said i know where hes going step out well get there before him by another way  mr ronald and his guide reached a row of poor little houses with poor little gardens in front of them and behind them the back windows looked out on downs and fields lying on either side of the road to broadstairs it was a lost and lonely spot the guide stopped and put a question with inquisitive respect what number sir mr ronald had sufficiently recovered himself to keep his own counsel that will do he said you can leave me the boatman waited a moment mr ronald looked at him the boatman was slow to understand that his leadership had gone from him youre sure you dont want me any more he said quite sure mr ronald answered the man from broadstairs retiredwith his salvage to comfort him  number 1 was at the farther extremity of the row of houses when mr ronald rang the bell the spies were already posted the woman loitered on the road within view of the door farnaby was out of sight round the corner watching the house over the low wooden palings of the back garden  a lazylooking man in his shirt sleeves opened the door mrs turner at home he repeated well shes at home but shes too busy to see anybody whats your pleasure mr ronald declined to accept excuses or to answer questions i must see mrs turner directly he said on important business his tone and manner had their effect on the lazy man what name he asked mr ronald declined to mention his name give my message he said i wont detain mrs turner more than a minute the man hesitatedand opened the door of the front parlour an old woman was fast asleep on a ragged little sofa the man gave up the front parlour and tried the back parlour next it was empty please to wait here he saidand went away to deliver his message  the parlour was a miserably furnished room through the open window the patch of back garden was barely visible under fluttering rows of linen hanging out on lines to dry a pack of dirty cards and some plain needlework littered the bare little table a cheap american clock ticked with stern and steady activity on the mantelpiece the smell of onions was in the air a torn newspaper with stains of beer on it lay on the floor there was some sinister influence in the place which affected mr ronald painfully he felt himself trembling and sat down on one of the rickety chairs the minutes followed one another wearily he heard a trampling of feet in the room abovethen a door opened and closedthen the rustle of a womans dress on the stairs in a moment more the handle of the parlour door was turned he rose in anticipation of mrs turners appearance the door opened he found himself face to face with his wife  vi  john farnaby posted at the garden paling suddenly lifted his head and looked towards the open window of the back parlour he reflected for a momentand then joined his female companion on the road in front of the house  i want you at the back garden he said come along  how much longer am i to be kept kicking my heels in this wretched hole the woman asked sulkily  as much longer as i pleaseif you want to go back to london with the other half of the money he showed it to her as he spoke she followed him without another word  arrived at the paling farnaby pointed to the window and to the back garden door which was left ajar speak softly he whispered do you hear voices in the house  i dont hear what theyre talking about if thats what you mean  i dont hear either now mind what i tell youi have reasons of my own for getting a little nearer to that window sit down under the paling so that you cant be seen from the house if you hear a row you may take it for granted that i am found out in that case go back to london by the next train and meet me at the terminus at two oclock tomorrow afternoon if nothing happens wait where you are till you hear from me or see me again  he laid his hand on the low paling and vaulted over it the linen hanging up in the garden to dry offered him a means of concealment if any one happened to look out of the window of which he skilfully availed himself the dustbin was at the side of the house situated at a right angle to the parlour window he was safe behind the bin provided no one appeared on the path which connected the patch of garden at the back with the patch in front here running the risk he waited and listened  the first voice that reached his ears was the voice of mrs ronald she was speaking with a firmness of tone that astonished him  hear me to the end benjamin she said i have a right to ask as much as that of my husband and i do ask it if i had been bent on nothing but saving the reputation of our miserable girl you would have a right to blame me for keeping you ignorant of the calamity that has fallen on us  there the voice of her husband interposed sternly calamity say disgrace everlasting disgrace  mrs ronald did not notice the interruption sadly and patiently she went on  but i had a harder trial still to face she said i had to save her in spite of herself from the wretch who has brought this infamy on us he has acted throughout in cold blood it is his interest to marry her and from first to last he has plotted to force the marriage on us for gods sake dont speak loud she is in the room above us if she hears you it will be the death of her dont suppose i am talking at random i have looked at his letters to her i have got the confession of the servantgirl such a confession emma is his victim body and soul i know it i know that she sent him money my money from this place i know that the servant at her instigation informed him by telegraph of the birth of the child oh benjamin dont curse the poor helpless infantsuch a sweet little girl dont think of it i dont think of it show me the letter that brought you here i want to see the letter ah i can tell you who wrote it he wrote it in his own interests always with his own interests in view dont you see it for yourself if i succeed in keeping this shame and misery a secret from everybodyif i take emma away to some place abroad on pretence of her healththere is an end of his hope of becoming your soninlaw there is an end of his being taken into the business yes he the lowlived vagabond who puts up the shopshutters he looks forward to being taken into partnership and succeeding you when you die isnt his object in writing that letter as plain to you now as the heaven above us his one chance is to set your temper in a flame to provoke the scandal of a discoveryand to force the marriage on us as the only remedy left am i wrong in making any sacrifice rather than bind our girl for life our own flesh and blood to such a man as that surely you can feel for me and forgive me now how could i own the truth to you before i left london knowing you as i do how could i expect you to be patient to go into hiding to pass under a false nameto do all the degrading things that must be done if we are to keep emma out of this mans way no i know no more than you do where farnaby is to be found hush there is the doorbell its the doctors time for his visit i tell you again i dont knowon my sacred word of honour i dont know where farnaby is oh be quiet be quiet theres the doctor going upstairs dont let the doctor hear you  so far she had succeeded in composing her husband but the fury which she had innocently roused in him in her eagerness to justify herself now broke beyond all control you lie he cried furiously if you know everything else about it you know where farnaby is ill be the death of him if i swing for it on the gallows where is he where is he  a shriek from the upper room silenced him before mrs ronald could speak again his daughter had heard him his daughter had recognized his voice  a cry of terror from her mother echoed the cry from above the sound of the opening and closing of the door followed instantly then there was a momentary silence then mrs ronalds voice was heard from the upper room calling to the nurse asleep in the front parlour the nurses gruff tones were just audible answering from the parlour door there was another interval of silence broken by another voicea strangers voicespeaking at the open window close by  follow me upstairs sir directly the voice said in peremptory tones as your daughters medical attendant i tell you in the plainest terms that you have seriously frightened her in her critical condition i decline to answer for her life unless you make the attempt at least to undo the mischief you have done whether you mean it or not soothe her with kind words say you have forgiven her no i have nothing to do with your domestic troubles i have only my patient to think of i dont care what she asks of you you must give way to her now if she falls into convulsions she will dieand her death will be at your door  so with feebler and feebler interruptions from mr ronald the doctor spoke it ended plainly in his being obeyed the departing footsteps of the men were the next sounds to be heard after that there was a pause of silencea long pause broken by mrs ronald calling again from the upper regions take the child into the back parlour nurse and wait till i come to you its cooler there at this time of the day  the wailing of an infant and the gruff complaining of the nurse were the next sounds that reached farnaby in his hiding place the nurse was grumbling to herself over the grievance of having been awakened from her sleep after being up all night a person wants rest theres no rest for anybody in this house my heads as heavy as lead and every bone in me has got an ache in it  before long the renewed silence indicated that she had succeeded in hushing the child to sleep farnaby forgot the restraints of caution for the first time his face flushed with excitement he ventured nearer to the window in his eagerness to find out what might happen next after no long interval the next sound camea sound of heavy breathing which told him that the drowsy nurse was falling asleep again the windowsill was within reach of his hands he waited until the heavy breathing deepened to snoring then he drew himself up by the windowsill and looked into the room  the nurse was fast asleep in an armchair and the child was fast asleep on her lap  he dropped softly to the ground again taking off his shoes and putting them in his pockets he ascended the two or three steps which led to the halfopen back garden door arrived in the passage he could just hear them talking upstairs they were no doubt still absorbed in their troubles he had only the servant to dread the splashing of water in the kitchen informed him that she was safely occupied in washing slowly and softly he opened the back parlour door and stole across the room to the nurses chair  one of her hands still rested on the child the serious risk was the risk of waking her if he lost his presence of mind and hurried it  he glanced at the american clock on the mantelpiece the result relieved him it was not so late as he had feared he knelt down to steady himself as nearly as possible on a level with the nurses knees by a hairs breadth at a time he got both hands under the child by a hairs breadth at a time he drew the child away from her leaving her hand resting on her lap by degrees so gradual that the lightest sleeper could not have felt the change that done barring accidents all was done keeping the child resting easily on his left arm he had his right hand free to shut the door again arrived at the garden steps a slight change passed over the sleeping infants facethe delicate little creature shivered as it felt the full flow of the open air he softly laid over its face a corner of the woollen shawl in which it was wrapped the child reposed as quietly on his arm as if it had still been on the nurses lap  in a minute more he was at the paling the woman rose to receive him with the first smile that had crossed her face since they had left london  so youve got the baby she said well you are a deep one  take it he answered irritably we havent a moment to lose  only stopping to put on his shoes he led the way towards the more central part of the town the first person he met directed him to the railway station it was close by in five minutes more the woman and the baby were safe in the train to london  theres the other half of the money he said handing it to her through the carriage window  the woman eyed the child in her arms with a frowning expression of doubt all very well as long as it lasts she said and what after that  of course i shall call and see you he answered  she looked hard at him and expressed the whole value she set on that assurance in four words of course you will  the train started for london farnaby watched it as it left the platform with a look of unfeigned relief there he thought to himself emmas reputation is safe enough now when we are married we mustnt have a lovechild in the way of our prospects in life  leaving the station he stopped at the refreshment room and drank a glass of brandyandwater something to screw me up he thought for what is to come what was to come after he had got rid of the child had been carefully considered by him on the journey to ramsgate emmas husbandthatistobehe had reasoned it outwill naturally be the first person emma wants to see when the loss of the baby has upset the house if old ronald has a grain of affection left in him he must let her marry me after that  acting on this view of his position he took the way that led back to slains row and rang the doorbell as became a visitor who had no reasons for concealment now  the household was doubtless already disorganized by the discovery of the childs disappearance neither master nor servant was active in answering the bell farnaby submitted to be kept waiting with perfect composure there are occasions on which a handsome man is bound to put his personal advantages to their best use he took out his pocketcomb and touched up the arrangement of his whiskers with a skilled and gentle hand approaching footsteps made themselves heard along the passage at last farnaby put back his comb and buttoned his coat briskly now for it he said as the door was opened at last     the story     book the first amelius among the socialists    chapter 1  sixteen years after the date of mr ronalds disastrous discovery at ramsgatethat is to say in the year 1872the steamship aquila left the port of new york bound for liverpool  it was the month of september the passengerlist of the aquila had comparatively few names inscribed on it in the autumn season the voyage from america to england but for the remunerative value of the cargo would prove to be for the most part a profitless voyage to shipowners the flow of passengers at that time of year sets steadily the other way americans are returning from europe to their own country tourists have delayed the voyage until the fierce august heat of the united states has subsided and the delicious indian summer is ready to welcome them at bed and board the passengers by the aquila on her homeward voyage had plenty of room and the choicest morsels for everybody alike on the well spread dinnertable  the wind was favourable the weather was lovely cheerfulness and goodhumour pervaded the ship from stem to stern the courteous captain did the honours of the cabintable with the air of a gentleman who was receiving friends in his own house the handsome doctor promenaded the deck arminarm with ladies in course of rapid recovery from the first gastric consequences of travelling by sea the excellent chief engineer musical in his leisure moments to his fingers ends played the fiddle in his cabin accompanied on the flute by that young apollo of the atlantic trade the stewards mate only on the third morning of the voyage was the harmony on board the aquila disturbed by a passing moment of discorddue to an unexpected addition to the ranks of the passengers in the shape of a lost bird  it was merely a weary little landbird blown out of its course as the learned in such matters supposed and it perched on one of the yards to rest and recover itself after its long flight  the instant the creature was discovered the insatiable anglosaxon delight in killing birds from the majestic eagle to the contemptible sparrow displayed itself in its full frenzy the crew ran about the decks the passengers rushed into their cabins eager to seize the first gun and to have the first shot an old quartermaster of the aquila was the enviable man who first found the means of destruction ready to his hand he lifted the gun to his shoulder he had his finger on the trigger when he was suddenly pounced upon by one of the passengersa young slim sunburnt active manwho snatched away the gun discharged it over the side of the vessel and turned furiously on the quartermaster you wretch would you kill the poor weary bird that trusts our hospitality and only asks us to give it a rest that little harmless thing is as much one of gods creatures as you are im ashamed of youim horrified at youyouve got birdmurder in your face i hate the sight of you  the quartermastera large grave fat man slow alike in his bodily and his mental movementslistened to this extraordinary remonstrance with a fixed stare of amazement and an open mouth from which the unspat tobaccojuice tricked in little brown streams when the impetuous young gentleman paused not for want of words merely for want of breath the quartermaster turned about and addressed himself to the audience gathered round gentlemen he said with a roman brevity this young fellow is mad  the captains voice checked the general outbreak of laughter that will do quartermaster let it be understood that nobody is to shoot the birdand let me suggest to you sir that you might have expressed your sentiments quite as effectually in less violent language  addressed in those terms the impetuous young man burst into another fit of excitement youre quite right sir i deserve every word you have said to me i feel i have disgraced myself he ran after the quartermaster and seized him by both hands i beg your pardon i beg your pardon with all my heart you would have served me right if you had thrown me overboard after the language i used to you pray excuse my quick temper pray forgive me what do you say let bygones be bygones thats a capital way of putting it youre a thorough good fellow if i can ever be of the smallest use to you theres my card and address in london let me know it i entreat you let me know it he returned in a violent hurry to the captain ive made it up with the quartermaster sir he forgives me he bears no malice allow me to congratulate you on having such a good christian in your ship i wish i was like him excuse me ladies and gentlemen for the disturbance i have made it shant happen againi promise you that  the male travellers in general looked at each other and seemed to agree with the quartermasters opinion of their fellowpassenger the women touched by his evident sincerity and charmed with his handsome blushing eager face agreed that he was quite right to save the poor bird and that it would be all the better for the weaker part of creation generally if other men were more like him while the various opinions were still in course of expression the sound of the luncheon bell cleared the deck of the passengers with two exceptions one was the impetuous young man the other was a middleaged traveller with a grizzled beard and a penetrating eye who had silently observed the proceedings and who now took the opportunity of introducing himself to the hero of the moment  are you not going to take any luncheon he asked  no sir among the people i have lived with we dont eat at intervals of three or four hours all day long  will you excuse me pursued the other if i own i should like to know what people you have been living with my name is hethcote i was associated at one time of my life with a college devoted to the training of young men from what i have seen and heard this morning i fancy you have not been educated on any of the recognized systems that are popular at the present day am i right  the excitable young man suddenly became the picture of resignation and answered in a formula of words as if he was repeating a lesson  i am claudeameliusgoldenheart aged twentyone son and only child of the late claude goldenheart of shedfield heath buckinghamshire england i have been brought up by the primitive christian socialists at tadmor community state of illinois i have inherited an income of five hundred a year and i am now with the approval of the community going to london to see life  mr hethcote received this copious flow of information in some doubt whether he had been made the victim of coarse raillery or whether he had merely heard a quaint statement of facts  claudeameliusgoldenheart saw that he had produced an unfavourable impression and hastened to set himself right  excuse me sir he said i am not making game of you as you seem to suppose we are taught to be courteous to everybody in our community the truth is there seems to be something odd about me im sure i dont know what which makes people whom i meet on my travels curious to know who i am if youll please to remember its a long way from illinois to new york and curious strangers are not scarce on the journey when one is obliged to keep on saying the same thing over and over again a form saves a deal of trouble i have made a form for myselfwhich is respectfully at the disposal of any person who does me the honour to wish for my acquaintance will that do sir very well then shake hands to show youre satisfied  mr hethcote shook hands more than satisfied he found it impossible to resist the bright honest brown eyes the simple winning cordial manner of the young fellow with the quaint formula and the strange name come mr goldenheart he said leading the way to a seat on deck let us sit down comfortably and have a talk  anything you like sirbut dont call me mr goldenheart  why not  well it sounds formal and besides youre old enough to be my father its my duty to call you misteror sir as we say to our elders at tadmor i have left all my friends behind me at the communityand i feel lonely out here on this big ocean among strangers do me a kindness sir call me by my christian name and give me a friendly slap on the back if you find we get along smoothly in the course of the day  which of your names shall it be mr hethcote asked humouring this odd lad claude  no not claude the primitive christians said claude was a finicking french name call me amelius and i shall begin to feel at home again if youre in a hurry cut it down to three letters as they did at tadmor and call me mel  very good said mr hethcote now my friend amelius or mel i am going to speak out plainly as you do the primitive christian socialists must have great confidence in their system of education to turn you adrift in the world without a companion to look after you  youve hit it sir amelius answered coolly they have unlimited confidence in their system of education and im a proof of it  you have relations in london i suppose mr hethcote proceeded  for the first time the face of amelius showed a shadow of sadness on it  i have relations he said but i have promised never to claim their hospitality they are hard and worldly and they will make you hard and worldly too thats what my father said to me on his deathbed he took off his hat when he mentioned his fathers death and came to a sudden pausewith his head bent down like a man absorbed in thought in less than a minute he put on his hat again and looked up with his bright winning smile we say a little prayer for the loved ones who are gone when we speak of them he explained but we dont say it out loud for fear of seeming to parade our religious convictions we hate cant in our community  i cordially agree with the community amelius but my good fellow have you really no friend to welcome you when you get to london  amelius answered the question mysteriously wait a little he saidand took a letter from the breastpocket of his coat mr hethcote watching him observed that he looked at the address with unfeigned pride and pleasure  one of our brethren at the community has given me this he announced its a letter of introduction sir to a remarkable mana man who is an example to all the rest of us he has risen by dint of integrity and perseverance from the position of a poor porter in a shop to be one of the most respected mercantile characters in the city of london  with this explanation amelius handed his letter to mr hethcote it was addressed as follows           to john farnaby esquire          messrs ronald  farnaby          stationers          aldersgate street london    chapter 2  mr hethcote looked at the address on the letter with an expression of surprise which did not escape the notice of amelius do you know mr farnaby he asked  i have some acquaintance with him was the answer given with a certain appearance of constraint  amelius went on eagerly with his questions what sort of man is he do you think he will be prejudiced against me because i have been brought up in tadmor  i must be a little better acquainted amelius with you and tadmor before i can answer your question suppose you tell me how you became one of the socialists to begin with  i was only a little boy mr hethcote at that time  very good even little boys have memories is there any objection to your telling me what you can remember  amelius answered rather sadly with his eyes bent on the deck i remember something happening which threw a gloom over us at home in england i heard that my mother was concerned in it when i grew older i never presumed to ask my father what it was and he never offered to tell me i only know this that he forgave her some wrong she had done him and let her go on living at homeand that relations and friends all blamed him and fell away from him from that time not long afterwards while i was at school my mother died i was sent for to follow her funeral with my father when we got back and were alone together he took me on his knee and kissed me which will you do amelius he said stay in england with your uncle and aunt or come with me all the way to america and never go back to england again take time to think of it i wanted no time to think of it i said go with you papa he frightened me by bursting out crying it was the first time i had ever seen him in tears i can understand it now he had been cut to the heart and had borne it like a martyr and his boy was his one friend left well by the end of the week we were on board the ship and there we met a benevolent gentleman with a long gray beard who bade my father welcome and presented me with a cake in my ignorance i thought he was the captain nothing of the sort he was the first socialist i had ever seen and it was he who had persuaded my father to leave england  mr hethcotes opinions of socialists began to show themselves a little sourly in mr hethcotes smile and how did you get on with this benevolent gentleman he asked after converting your father did he convert youwith the cake  amelius smiled do him justice sir he didnt trust to the cake he waited till we were in sight of the american landand then he preached me a little sermon on our arrival entirely for my own use  a sermon mr hethcote repeated very little religion in it i suspect  very little indeed sir amelius answered only as much religion as there is in the new testament i was not quite old enough to understand him easilyso he wrote down his discourse on the flyleaf of a storybook i had with me and gave it to me to read when i was tired of the stories stories were scarce with me in those days and when i had exhausted my little stock rather than read nothing i read my sermonread it so often that i think i can remember every word of it now my dear little boy the christian religion as christ taught it has long ceased to be the religion of the christian world a selfish and cruel pretence is set up in its place your own father is one example of the truth of this saying of mine he has fulfilled the first and foremost duty of a true christianthe duty of forgiving an injury for this he stands disgraced in the estimation of all his friends they have renounced and abandoned him he forgives them and seeks peace and good company in the new world among christians like himself you will not repent leaving home with him you will be one of a loving family and when you are old enough you will be free to decide for yourself what your future life shall be that was all i knew about the socialists when we reached tadmor after our long journey  mr hethcotes prejudices made their appearance again a barren sort of place he said judging by the name  barren what can you be thinking of a prettier place i never saw and never expect to see again a clear winding river running into a little blue lake a broad hillside all laid out in flowergardens and shaded by splendid trees on the top of the hill the buildings of the community some of brick and some of wood so covered with creepers and so encircled with verandahs that i cant tell you to this day what style of architecture they were built in more trees behind the housesand on the other side of the hill cornfields nothing but cornfields rolling away and away in great yellow plains till they reached the golden sky and the setting sun and were seen no more that was our first view of tadmor when the stagecoach dropped us at the town  mr hethcote still held out and what about the people who live in this earthly paradise he asked male and female saintseh  oh dear no sir the very opposite of saints they eat and drink like their neighbours they never think of wearing dirty horsehair when they can get clean linen and when they are tempted to misconduct themselves they find a better way out of it than knotting a cord and thrashing their own backs saints they all ran out together to bid us welcome like a lot of schoolchildren the first thing they did was to kiss us and the next thing was to give us a mug of wine of their own making saints oh mr hethcote what will you accuse us of being next i declare your suspicions of the poor socialists keep cropping up again as fast as i cut them down may i make a guess sir without offending you from one or two things i have noticed i strongly suspect youre a british clergyman  mr hethcote was conquered at last he burst out laughing you have discovered me he said travelling in a coloured cravat and a shooting jacket i confess i should like to know how  its easily explained sir visitors of all sorts are welcome at tadmor we have a large experience of them in the travelling season they all come with their own private suspicion of us lurking about the corners of their eyes they see everything we have to show them and eat and drink at our table and join in our amusements and get as pleasant and friendly with us as can be the time comes to say goodbyeand then we find them out if a guest who has been laughing and enjoying himself all day suddenly becomes serious when he takes his leave and shows that little lurking devil of suspicion again about the corners of his eyesits ten chances to one that hes a clergyman no offence mr hethcote i acknowledge with pleasure that the corners of your eyes are clear again youre not a very clerical clergyman sir after alli dont despair of converting you yet  go on with your story amelius youre the queerest fellow i have met with for many a long day past  im a little doubtful about going on with my story sir i have told you how i got to tadmor and what it looks like and what sort of people live in the place if i am to get on beyond that i must jump to the time when i was old enough to learn the rules of the community  welland what then  well mr hethcote some of the rules might offend you  try  all right sir dont blame me im not ashamed of the rules and now if i am to speak i must speak seriously on a serious subject i must begin with our religious principles we find our christianity in the spirit of the new testamentnot in the letter we have three good reasons for objecting to pin our faith on the words alone in that book first because we are not sure that the english translation is always to be depended on as accurate and honest secondly because we know that since the invention of printing there is not a copy of the book in existence which is free from errors of the press and that before the invention of printing those errors in manuscript copies must as a matter of course have been far more serious and far more numerous thirdly because there is plain internal evidence to say nothing of discoveries actually made in the present day of interpolations and corruptions introduced into the manuscript copies as they succeeded each other in ancient times these drawbacks are of no importance however in our estimation we find in the spirit of the book the most simple and most perfect system of religion and morality that humanity has ever receivedand with that we are content to reverence god and to love our neighbour as ourselves if we had only those two commandments to guide us we should have enough the whole collection of doctrines as they are called we reject at once without even stopping to discuss them we apply to them the test suggested by christ himself by their fruits ye shall know them the fruits of doctrines in the past to quote three instances only have been the spanish inquisition the massacre of st bartholomew and the thirty years warand the fruits in the present are dissension bigotry and opposition to useful reforms away with doctrines in the interests of christianity away with them we are to love our enemies we are to forgive injuries we are to help the needy we are to be pitiful and courteous slow to judge others and ashamed to exalt ourselves that teaching doesnt lead to tortures massacres and wars to envy hatred and maliceand for that reason it stands revealed to us as the teaching that we can trust there is our religion sir as we find it in the rules of the community  very well amelius i notice in passing that the community is in one respect like the popethe community is infallible we wont dwell on that you have stated your principles as to the application of them next nobody has a right to be rich among you of course  put it the other way mr hethcote all men have a right to be richprovided they dont make other people poor as a part of the process we dont trouble ourselves much about money thats the truth we are farmers carpenters weavers and printers and what we earn ask our neighbours if we dont earn it honestly goes into the common fund a man who comes to us with money puts it into the fund and so makes things easy for the next man who comes with empty pockets while they are with us they all live in the same comfort and have their equal share in the same profitsdeducting the sum in reverse for sudden calls and bad times if they leave us the man who has brought money with him has his undisputed right to take it away again and the man who has brought none bids us goodbye all the richer for his equal share in the profits which he has personally earned the only fuss at our place about money that i can remember was the fuss about my five hundred a year i wanted to hand it over to the fund it was my own mindinherited from my mothers property on my coming of age the elders wouldnt hear of it the council wouldnt hear of it the general vote of the community wouldnt hear of it we agreed with his father that he should decide for himself when he grew to manhoodthat was how they put it let him go back to the old world and let him be free to choose by the test of his own experience what his future life shall be how do you think it will end mr hethcote shall i return to the community or shall i stop in london  mr hethcote answered without a moments hesitation you will stop in london  ill bet you two to one sir he goes back to the community  in those words a third voice speaking in a strong new england accent insinuated itself into the conversation from behind amelius and mr hethcote looking round discovered a long lean grave strangerwith his face overshadowed by a huge felt hat have you been listening to our conversation mr hethcote asked haughtily  i have been listening answered the grave stranger with considerable interest this young man i find opens a new chapter to me in the book of humanity do you accept my bet sir my name is rufus dingwell and my home is at coolspring mass you do not bet i express my regret and have the pleasure of taking a seat alongside of you what is your name sir hethcote we have one of that name at coolspring he is much respected mr claude a goldenheart you are no stranger to meno sir i procured your name from the steward when the little difficulty occurred just now about the bird your name considerably surprised me  why amelius asked  well sirnot to say that your surname being goldenheart reminds one unexpectedly of the pilgrims progressi happen to be already acquainted with you by reputation  amelius looked puzzled by reputation he said what does that mean  it means sir that you occupy a prominent position in a recent number of our popular journal entitled the coolspring democrat the late romantic incident which caused the withdrawal of miss mellicent from your community has produced a species of social commotion at coolspring among our ladies the tone of sentiment sir is universally favourable to you when i left i do assure you you were a popular character among us the name of claude a goldenheart was so to speak in everybodys mouth  amelius listened to this with the colour suddenly deepening on his face and with every appearance of heartfelt annoyance and regret there is no such thing as keeping a secret in america he said irritably some spy must have got among us none of our people would have exposed the poor lady to public comment how would you like it mr dingwell if the newspaper published the private sorrows of your wife or your daughter  rufus dingwell answered with the straightforward sincerity of feeling which is one of the indisputable virtues of his nation i had not thought of it in that light sir he said you have been good enough to credit me with a wife or a daughter i do not possess either of those ladies but your argument hits me notwithstandinghits me hard i tell you he looked at mr hethcote who sat silently and stiffly disapproving of all this familiarity and applied himself in perfect innocence and good faith to making things pleasant in that quarter you are a stranger sir said rufus and you will doubtless wish to peruse the article which is the subject of conversation he took a newspaper slip from his pocketbook and offered it to the astonished englishman i shall be glad to hear your sentiments sir on the view propounded by our mutual friend claude a goldenheart  before mr hethcote could reply amelius interposed in his own headlong way give it to me i want to read it first  he snatched at the newspaper slip rufus checked him with grave composure i am of a cool temperament myself sir but that dont prevent me from admiring heat in others short of boiling pointmind that with this hint the wise new englander permitted amelius to take possession of the printed slip  mr hethcote finding an opportunity of saying a word at last asserted himself a little haughtily i beg you will both of you understand that i decline to read anything which relates to another persons private affairs  neither the one nor the other of his companions paid the slightest heed to this announcement amelius was reading the newspaper extract and placid rufus was watching him in another moment he crumpled up the slip and threw it indignantly on the deck its as full of lies as it can hold he burst out  its all over the united states by this time rufus remarked and i dont doubt we shall find the english papers have copied it when we get to liverpool if you will take my advice sir you will cultivate a sagacious insensibility to the comments of the press  do you think i care for myself amelius asked indignantly its the poor woman i am thinking of what can i do to clear her character  well sir suggested rufus in your place i should have a notification circulated through the ship announcing a lecture on the subject weather permitting in the course of the afternoon thats the way we should do it at coolspring  amelius listened without conviction its certainly useless to make a secret of the matter now he said but i dont see my way to making it more public still he paused and looked at mr hethcote it so happens sir he resumed that this unfortunate affair is an example of some of the rules of our community which i had not had time to speak of when mr dingwell here joined us it will be a relief to me to contradict these abominable falsehoods to somebody and i should like if you dont mind to hear what you think of my conduct from your own point of view it might prepare me he added smiling rather uneasily for what i may find in the english newspapers  with these words of introduction he told his sad storyjocosely described in the newspaper heading as miss mellicent and goldenheart among the socialists at tadmor   chapter 3  nearly six months since said amelius we had notice by letter of the arrival of an unmarried english lady who wished to become a member of our community you will understand my motive in keeping her family name a secret even the newspaper has grace enough only to mention her by her christian name i dont want to cheat you out of your interest so i will own at once that miss mellicent was not beautiful and not young when she came to us she was thirtyeight years old and time and trial had set their marks on her face plainly enough for anybody to see notwithstanding this we all thought her an interesting woman it might have been the sweetness of her voice or perhaps it was something in her expression that took our fancy there i cant explain it i can only say there were young women and pretty women at tadmor who failed to win us as miss mellicent did contradictory enough isnt it  mr hethcote said he understood the contradiction rufus put an appropriate question do you possess a photograph of this lady sir  no said amelius i wish i did well we received her on her arrival in the common roomcalled so because we all assemble there every evening when the work of the day is done sometimes we have the reading of a poem or a novel sometimes debates on the social and political questions of the time in england and america sometimes music or dancing or cards or billiards to amuse us when a new member arrives we have the ceremonies of introduction i was close by the elder brother thats the name we give to the chief of the community when two of the women led miss mellicent in hes a hearty old fellow who lived the first part of his life on his own clearing in one of the western forests to this day he cant talk long without showing in one way or another that his old familiarity with the trees still keeps its place in his memory he looked hard at miss mellicent under his shaggy old white eyebrows and i heard him whisper to himself ah dear me another of the fallen leaves i knew what he meant the people who have drawn blanks in the lottery of lifethe people who have toiled hard after happiness and have gathered nothing but disappointment and sorrow the friendless and the lonely the wounded and the lostthese are the people whom our good elder brother calls the fallen leaves i like the saying myself its a tender way of speaking of our poor fellowcreatures who are down in the world  he paused for a moment looking out thoughtfully over the vast void of sea and sky a passing shadow of sadness clouded his bright young face the two elder men looked at him in silence feeling in widely different ways the same compassionate interest what was the life that lay before him andgod help himwhat would he do with it  where did i leave off he asked rousing himself suddenly  you left miss mellicent sir in the common roomthe venerable citizen with the white eyebrows being suitably engaged in moralizing on her in those terms the everready rufus set the story going again  quite right amelius resumed there she was poor thing a little thin timid creature in a white dress with a black scarf over her shoulders trembling and wondering in a room full of strangers the elder brother took her by the hand and kissed her on the forehead and bade her heartily welcome in the name of the community then the women followed his example and the men all shook hands with her and then our chief put the three questions which he is bound to address to all new arrivals when they join us do you come here of your own free will do you bring with you a written recommendation from one of our brethren which satisfies us that we do no wrong to ourselves or to others in receiving you do you understand that you are not bound to us by vows and that you are free to leave us again if the life here is not agreeable to you matters being settled so far the reading of the rules and the penalties imposed for breaking them came next some of the rules you know already others of smaller importance i neednt trouble you with as for the penalties if you incur the lighter ones you are subject to public rebuke or to isolation for a time from the social life of the community if you incur the heavier ones you are either sent out into the world again for a given period to return or not as you please or you are struck off the list of members and expelled for good and all suppose these preliminaries agreed to by miss mellicent with silent submission and let us go on to the close of the ceremonythe reading of the rules which settle the questions of love and marriage  aha said mr hethcote we are coming to the difficulties of the community at last  are we also coming to miss mellicent sir rufus inquired as a citizen of a free country in which i can love in one state marry in another and be divorced in a third i am not interested in your rulesi am interested in your lady  the two are inseparable in this case amelius answered gravely if i am to speak of miss mellicent i must speak of the rules you will soon see why our community becomes a despotism gentlemen in dealing with love and marriage for example it positively prohibits any member afflicted with hereditary disease from marrying at all and it reserves to itself in the case of every proposed marriage among us the right of permitting or forbidding it in council we cant even fall in love with each other without being bound under penalties to report it to the elder brother who in his turn communicates it to the monthly council who in their turn decide whether the courtship may go on or not thats not the worst of it even yet in some caseswhere we havent the slightest intention of falling in love with each otherthe governing body takes the initiative you two will do well to marry we see it if you dont just think of it will you you may laugh some of our happiest marriages have been made in that way our governors in council act on an established principle here it is in a nutshell the results of experience in the matter of marriage all over the world show that a really wise choice of a husband or a wife is an exception to the rule and that husbands and wives in general would be happier together if their marriages were managed for them by competent advisers on either side laws laid down on such lines as these and others equally strict which i have not mentioned yet were not put in force mr hethcote as you suppose without serious difficultiesdifficulties which threatened the very existence of the community but that was before my time when i grew up i found the husbands and wives about me content to acknowledge that the rules fulfilled the purpose with which they had been madethe greatest happiness of the greatest number it all looks very absurd i dare say from your point of view but these queer regulations of ours answer the christian testby their fruits ye shall know them our married people dont live on separate sides of the house our children are all healthy wifebeating is unknown among us and the practice in our divorce court wouldnt keep the most moderate lawyer on bread and cheese can you say as much for the success of the marriage laws in europe i leave you gentlemen to form your own opinions  mr hethcote declined to express an opinion rufus declined to resign his interest in the lady and what did miss mellicent say to it he inquired  she said something that startled us all amelius replied when the elder brother began to read the first words relating to love and marriage in the book of rules she turned deadly pale and rose up in her place with a sudden burst of courage or desperationi dont know which must you read that to me she asked i have nothing to do with love or marriage the elder brother laid aside his book of rules if you are afflicted with an hereditary malady he said the doctor from the town will examine you and report to us she answered i have no hereditary malady the elder brother took up his book again in due course of time my dear the council will decide for you whether you are to love and marry or not and he read the rules she sat down again and hid her face in her hands and never moved or spoke until he had done the regular questions followed had she anything to say in the way of objection nothing in that case would she sign the rules yes when the time came for supper she excused herself just like a child i feel very tired may i go to bed the unmarried women in the same dormitory with her anticipated some romantic confession when she grew used to her new friends they proved to be wrong my life has been one long disappointment was all she said you will do me a kindness if you will take me as i am and not ask me to talk about myself there was nothing sulky or ungracious in the expression of her wish to keep her own secret a kinder and sweeter womannever thinking of herself always considerate of othersnever lived an accidental discovery made me her chief friend among the men it turned out that her childhood had been passed where my childhood had been passed at shedfield heath in buckinghamshire she was never weary of consulting my boyish recollections and comparing them with her own i love the place she used to say the only happy time of my life was the time passed there on my sacred word of honour this was the sort of talk that passed between us for week after week what other talk could pass between a man whose one and twentieth birthday was then near at hand and a woman who was close on forty what could i do when the poor broken disappointed creature met me on the hill or by the river and said you are going out for a walk may i come with you i never attempted to intrude myself into her confidence i never even asked her why she had joined the community you see what is coming dont you i never saw it i didnt know what it meant when some of the younger women meeting us together looked at me not at her and smiled maliciously my stupid eyes were opened at last by the woman who slept in the next bed to her in the dormitorya woman old enough to be my mother who took care of me when i was a child at tadmor she stopped me one morning on my way to fish in the river amelius she said dont go to the fishinghouse mellicent is waiting for you i stared at her in astonishment she held up her finger at me take care you foolish boy you are drifting into a false position as fast as you can have you no suspicion of what is going on i looked all round me in search of what was going on nothing out of the common was to be seen anywhere what can you possibly mean i asked you will only laugh at me if i tell you she said i promised not to laugh she too looked all round her as if she was afraid of somebody being near enough to hear us and then she let out the secret amelius ask for a holidayand leave us for a while mellicent is in love with you     chapter 4  amelius looked at his companions in some doubt whether they would preserve their gravity at this critical point in his story they both showed him that his apprehensions were well founded he was a little hurt and he instantly revealed it i own to my shame that i burst out laughing myself he said but you two gentlemen are older and wiser than i am i didnt expect to find you just as ready to laugh at poor miss mellicent as i was  mr hethcote declined to be reminded of his duties as a middleaged gentleman in this backhanded manner gently amelius you cant expect to persuade us that a laughable thing is not a thing to be laughed at a woman close on forty who falls in love with a young fellow of twentyone  is a laughable circumstance rufus interposed whereas a man of forty who fancies a young woman of twentyone is all in the order of nature the men have settled it so but why the women are to give up so much sooner than the men is a question sir on which i have long wished to hear the sentiments of the women themselves  mr hethcote dismissed the sentiments of the women with a wave of his hand let us hear the rest of it amelius of course you went on to the fishinghouse and of course you found miss mellicent there  she came to the door to meet me much as usual amelius resumed and suddenly checked herself in the act of shaking hands with me i can only suppose she saw something in my face that startled her how it happened i cant say but i felt my good spirits forsake me the moment i found myself in her presence i doubt if she had ever seen me so serious before have i offended you she asked of course i denied it but i failed to satisfy her she began to tremble has somebody said something against me are you weary of my company those were the next questions it was useless to say no some perverse distrust of me or some despair of herself overpowered her on a sudden she sank down on the floor of the fishinghouse and began to crynot a good hearty burst of tears a silent miserable resigned sort of crying as if she had lost all claim to be pitied and all right to feel wounded or hurt i was so distressed that i thought of nothing but consoling her i meant well and i acted like a fool a sensible man would have lifted her up i suppose and left her to herself i lifted her up and put my arm round her waist she looked at me as i did it for just a moment i declare she became twenty years younger she blushed as i have never seen a woman blush before or sincethe colour flowed all over her neck as well as her face before i could say a word she caught hold of my hand and of all the confusing things in the world kissed it no she cried dont despise me dont laugh at me wait and hear what my life has been and then you will understand why a little kindness overpowers me she looked round the corner of the fishinghouse suspiciously i dont want anybody else to hear us she said all the pride isnt beaten out of me yet come to the lake and row me about in the boat i took her out in the boat nobody could hear us certainly but she forgot and i forgot that anybody might see us and that appearances on the lake might lead to false conclusions on shore  mr hethcote and rufus exchanged significant looks they had not forgotten the rules of the community when two of its members showed a preference for each others society  amelius proceeded well there we were on the lake i paddled with the oars and she opened her whole heart to me her troubles had begun in a very common way with her mothers death and her fathers second marriage she had a brother and a sisterthe sister married a german merchant settled in new york the brother comfortably established as a sheepfarmer in australia so you see she was alone at home at the mercy of the stepmother i dont understand these cases myself but people who do tell me that there are generally faults on both sides to make matters worse they were a poor family the one rich relative being a sister of the first wife who disapproved of the widower marrying again and never entered the house afterwards well the stepmother had a sharp tongue and mellicent was the first person to feel the sting of it she was reproached with being an encumbrance on her father when she ought to be doing something for herself there was no need to repeat those harsh words the next day she answered an advertisement before the week was over she was earning her bread as a daily governess  here rufus stopped the narrative having an interesting question to put might i inquire sir what her salary was  thirty pounds a year amelius replied she was out teaching from nine oclock to twoand then went home again  there seems to be nothing to complain of in that as salaries go mr hethcote remarked  she made no complaint amelius rejoined she was satisfied with her salary but she wasnt satisfied with her life the meek little woman grew downright angry when she spoke of it i had no reason to complain of my employers she said i was civilly treated and punctually paid but i never made friends of them i tried to make friends of the children and sometimes i thought i had succeededbut oh dear when they were idle and i was obliged to keep them to their lessons i soon found how little hold i had on the love that i wanted them to give me we see children in books who are perfect little angels never envious or greedy or sulky or deceitful always the same sweet pious tender grateful innocent creaturesand it has been my misfortune never to meet with them go where i might it is a hard world amelius the world that i have lived in i dont think there are such miserable lives anywhere as the lives led by the poor middle classes in england from years end to years end the one dreadful struggle to keep up appearances and the heartbreaking monotony of an existence without change we lived in the back street of a cheap suburb i declare to you we had but one amusement in the whole long weary yearthe annual concert the clergyman got up in aid of his schools the rest of the year it was all teaching for the first half of the day and needlework for the young family for the other half my father had religious scruples he prohibited theatres he prohibited dancing and light reading he even prohibited looking in at the shopwindows because we had no money to spare and they tempted us to buy he went to business in the morning and came back at night and fell asleep after dinner and woke up and read prayersand next day to business and back and sleeping and waking and reading prayersand no break in it week after week month after month except on sunday which was always the same sunday the same church the same service the same dinner the same book of sermons in the evening even when we had a fortnight once a year at the seaside we always went to the same place and lodged in the same cheap house the few friends we had led just the same lives and were beaten down flat by just the same monotony all the women seemed to submit to it contentedly except my miserable self i wanted so little only a change now and then only a little sympathy when i was weary and sick at heart only somebody whom i could love and serve and be rewarded with a smile and a kind word in return mothers shook their heads and daughters laughed at me have we time to be sentimental havent we enough to do darning and mending and turning our dresses and making the joint last as long as possible and keeping the children clean and doing the washing at homeand tea and sugar rising and my husband grumbling every week when i have to ask him for the housemoney oh no more of it no more of it people meant for better things all ground down to the same sordid and selfish levelis that a pleasant sight to contemplate i shudder when i think of the last twenty years of my life thats what she complained of mr hethcote in the solitary middle of the lake with nobody but me to hear her  in my country sir rufus remarked the lecture bureau would have provided for her amusement on economical terms and i reckon if a married life would fix her she might have tried it among us by way of a change  thats the saddest part of the story said amelius there came a time only two years ago when her prospects changed for the better her rich aunt her mothers sister died andwhat do you thinkleft her a legacy of six thousand pounds there was a gleam of sunshine in her life the poor teacher was an heiress in a small way with her fortune at her own disposal they had something like a festival at home for the first time presents to everybody and kissings and congratulations and new dresses at last and more than that another wonderful event happened before long a gentleman made his appearance in the family circle with an interesting object in viewa gentleman who had called at the house in which she happened to be employed as teacher at the time and had seen her occupied with her pupils he had kept it to himself to be sure but he had secretly admired her from that momentand now it had come out she had never had a lover before mind that and he was a remarkably handsome man dressed beautifully and sang and played and was so humble and devoted with it all do you think it wonderful that she said yes when he proposed to marry her i dont think it wonderful at all for the first few weeks of the courtship the sunshine was brighter than ever then the clouds began to rise anonymous letters came describing the handsome gentleman seen under his fair surface as nothing less than a scoundrel she tore up the letters indignantlyshe was too delicate even to show them to him signed letters came next addressed to her father by an uncle and an aunt both containing one and the same warning if your daughter insists on having him tell her to take care of her money a few days later a visitor arriveda brother who spoke out more plainly still as an honourable man he could not hear of what was going on without making the painful confession that his brother was forbidden to enter his house that said he washed his hands of all further responsibility you two know the world you will guess how it ended quarrels in the household the poor middleaged woman living in her fools paradise blindly true to her lover convinced that he was foully wronged frantic when he declared that he would not connect himself with a family which suspected him ah i have no patience when i think of it and i almost wish i had never begun to tell the story do you know what he did she was free of course at her age to decide for herself there was no controlling her the wedding day was fixed her father had declared he would not sanction it and her stepmother kept him to his word she went alone to the church to meet her promised husband he never appeared he deserted her mercilessly deserted herafter she had sacrificed her own relations to himon her weddingday she was taken home insensible and had a brain fever the doctors declined to answer for her life her father thought it time to look to her bankers passbook out of her six thousand pounds she had privately given no less than four thousand to the scoundrel who had deceived and forsaken her not a month afterwards he married a young girlwith a fortune of course we read of such things in newspapers and books but to have them brought home to one after living ones own life among honest peoplei tell you it stupefied me  he said no more below them in the cabin voices were laughing and talking to a cheerful accompaniment of clattering knives and forks around them spread the exultant glory of sea and sky all that they heard all that they saw was cruelty out of harmony with the miserable story which had just reached its end with one accord the three men rose and paced the deck feeling physically the same need of some movement to lighten their spirits with one accord they waited a little before the narrative was resumed    chapter 5  mr hethcote was the first to speak again  i can understand the poor creatures motive in joining your community he said to a person of any sensibility her position among such relatives as you describe must have been simply unendurable after what had happened how did she hear of tadmor and the socialists  she had read one of our books amelius answered and she had her married sister at new york to go to there were moments after her recovery she confessed it to me frankly when the thought of suicide was in her mind her religious scruples saved her she was kindly received by her sister and her sisters husband they proposed to keep her with them to teach their children no the new life offered to her was too like the old lifeshe was broken in body and mind she had no courage to face it we have a resident agent in new york and he arranged for her journey to tadmor there is a gleam of brightness at any rate in this part of her story she blessed the day poor soul when she joined us never before had she found herself among such kindhearted unselfish simple people never before he abruptly checked himself and looked a little confused  obliging rufus finished the sentence for him never before had she known a young man with such natural gifts of fascination as cag dont you be too modest sir it doesnt pay i assure you in the nineteenth century  amelius was not as ready with his laugh as usual i wish i could drop it at the point we have reached now he said but she has left tadmor and in justice to her after the scandals in the newspaper i must tell you how she left it and why the mischief began when i was helping her out of the boat two of our young women met us on the bank of the lake and asked me how i got on with my fishing they didnt mean any harmthey were only in their customary good spirits still there was no mistaking their looks and tones when they put the question miss mellicent in her confusion made matters worse she coloured up and snatched her hand out of mine and ran back to the house by herself the girls enjoying their own foolish joke congratulated me on my prospects i must have been out of sorts in some wayupset perhaps by what i had heard in the boat anyhow i lost my temper and i made matters worse next i said some angry words and left them the same evening i found a letter in my room for your sake i must not be seen alone with you again it is hard to lose the comfort of your sympathy but i must submit think of me as kindly as i think of you it has done me good to open my heart to you only those lines signed by mellicents initials i was rash enough to keep the letter instead of destroying it all might have ended well nevertheless if she had only held to her resolution but unluckily my twentyfirst birthday was close at hand and there was talk of keeping it as a festival in the community i was up with sunrise when the day came having some farming work to look after and wanting to get it over in good time my shortest way back to breakfast was through a wood in the wood i met her  alone mr hethcote asked  rufus expressed his opinion of the wisdom of putting this question with his customary plainness of language when theres a rash thing to be done by a man and a woman together sir philosophers have remarked that its always the woman who leads the way of course she was alone  she had a little present for me on my birthday amelius explaineda purse of her own making and she was afraid of the ridicule of the young women if she gave it to me openly you have my hearts dearest wishes for your happiness think of me sometimes amelius when you open your purse if you had been in my place could you have told her to go away when she said that and put her gift into your hand not if she had been looking at you at the momentill swear you couldnt have done it  the lean yellow face of rufus dingwell relaxed for the first time into a broad grin there are further particulars sir stated in the newspaper he said slily  damn the newspaper amelius answered  rufus bowed serenely courteous with the air of a man who accepted a british oath as an unwilling compliment paid by the old country to the american press the newspaper report states sir that she kissed you  its a lie amelius shouted  perhaps its an error of the press rufus persisted perhaps you kissed her  never mind what i did said amelius savagely  mr hethcote felt it necessary to interfere he addressed rufus in his most magnificent manner in england mr dingwell a gentleman is not in the habit of disclosing theseertheseer er  these kissings in a wood suggested rufus in my country sir we do not regard kissing in or out of a wood in the light of a shameful proceeding quite the contrary i do assure you  amelius recovered his temper the discussion was becoming too ridiculous to be endured by the unfortunate person who was the object of it  dont let us make mountains out of molehills he said i did kiss herthere a woman pressing the prettiest little purse you ever saw into your hand and wishing you many happy returns of the day with the tears in her eyes i should like to know what else was to be done but to kiss her ah yes smooth out your newspaper report and have another look at it she did rest her head on my shoulder poor soul and she did say oh amelius i thought my heart was turned to stone feel how you have made it beat when i remembered what she had told me in the boat i declare to god i almost burst out crying myselfit was so innocent and so pitiful  rufus held out his hand with true american cordiality i do assure you sir i meant no harm he said the right grit is in you and no mistakeand there goes the newspaper he rolled up the slip and flung it overboard  mr hethcote nodded his entire approval of this proceeding amelius went on with his story  im near the end now he said if i had known it would have taken so long to tellnever mind we got out of the wood at last mr rufus and left it without a suspicion that we had been watched i was prudent enough when it was too late you will say to suggest to her that we had better be careful for the future instead of taking it seriously she laughed have you altered your mind since you wrote to me i asked to be sure i have she said when i wrote to you i forgot the difference between your age and mine nothing that we do will be taken seriously i am afraid of their laughing at me amelius but i am afraid of nothing else i did my best to undeceive her i told her plainly that people unequally matched in yearswomen older than men as well as men older than womenwere not uncommonly married among us the council only looked to their being well suited in other ways and declined to trouble itself about the question of age i dont think i produced much effect she seemed for once in her life poor thing to be too happy to look beyond the passing moment besides there was the birthday festival to keep her mind from dwelling on doubts and fears that were not agreeable to her and the next day there was another event to occupy our attentionthe arrival of the lawyers letter from london with the announcement of my inheritance on coming of age it was settled as you know that i was to go out into the world and to judge for myself but the date of my departure was not fixed two days later the storm that had been gathering for weeks past burst on uswe were cited to appear before the council to answer for an infraction of the rules everything that i have confessed to you and some things besides that i have kept to myself lay formally inscribed on a sheet of paper placed on the council tableand pinned to the sheet of paper was mellicents letter to me found in my room i took the whole blame on myself and insisted on being confronted with the unknown person who had informed against us the council met this by a questionis the information in any particular false neither of us could deny that it was in every particular true hearing this the council decided that there was no need on our own showing to confront us with the informer from that day to this i have never known who the spy was neither mellicent nor i had an enemy in the community the girls who had seen us on the lake and some other members who had met us together only gave their evidence on compulsionand even then they prevaricated they were so fond of us and so sorry for us after waiting a day the governing body pronounced their judgment their duty was prescribed to them by the rules we were sentenced to six months absence from the community to return or not as we pleased a hard sentence gentlemenwhatever we may think of itto homeless and friendless people to the fallen leaves that had drifted to tadmor in my case it had been already arranged that i was to leave after what had happened my departure was made compulsory in fourandtwenty hours and i was forbidden to return until the date of my sentence had expired in mellicents case they were still more strict they would not trust her to travel by herself a female member of the community was appointed to accompany her to the house of her married sister at new york she was ordered to be ready for the journey by sunrise the next morning we both understood of course that the object of this was to prevent our travelling together they might have saved themselves the trouble of putting obstacles in our way  so far as you were concerned i suppose said mr hethcote  so far as she was concerned also amelius answered  how did she take it sir rufus inquired  with a composure that astonished us all said amelius we had anticipated tears and entreaties for mercy she stood up perfectly calm far calmer than i was with her head turned towards me and her eyes resting quietly on my face if you can imagine a woman whose whole being was absorbed in looking into the future seeing what no mortal creature about her saw sustained by hopes that no mortal creature about her could shareyou may see her as i did when she heard her sentence pronounced the members of the community accustomed to take leave of an erring brother or sister with loving and merciful words were all more or less distressed as they bade her farewell most of the women were in tears as they kissed her they said the same kind words to her over and over again we are heartily sorry for you dear we shall all be glad to welcome you back they sang our customary hymn at partingand broke down before they got to the end it was she who consoled them not once through all that melancholy ceremony did she lose her strange composure her rapt mysterious look i was the last to say farewell and i own i couldnt trust myself to speak she held my hand in hers for a moment her face lighted up softly with a radiant smilethen the strange preoccupied expression flowed over her again like shadow over a light her eyes still looking into mine seemed to look beyond me she spoke low in sad steady tones be comforted amelius the end is not yet she put her hands on my head and drew it down to her you will come back to me she whisperedand kissed me on the forehead before them all when i looked up again she was gone i have neither seen her nor heard from her since its all told gentlemenand some of it has distressed me in the telling let me go away for a minute by myself and look at the sea      book the second amelius in london    chapter 1  oh rufus dingwell it is such a rainy day and the london street which i look out on from my hotel window presents such a dirty and such a miserable view do you know i hardly feel like the same amelius who promised to write to you when you left the steamer at queenstown my spirits are sinking i begin to feel old am i in the right state of mind to tell you what are my first impressions of london perhaps i may alter my opinion at present this is between ourselves i dont like london or london peopleexcepting two ladies who in very different ways have interested and charmed me  who are the ladies i must tell you what i heard about them from mr hethcote before i present them to you on my own responsibility  after you left us i found the last day of the voyage to liverpool dull enough mr hethcote did not seem to feel it in the same way on the contrary he grew more familiar and confidential in his talk with me he has some of the english stiffness you see and your american pace was a little too fast for him on our last night on board we had some more conversation about the farnabys you were not interested enough in the subject to attend to what he said about them while you were with us but if you are to be introduced to the ladies you must be interested now let me first inform you that mr and mrs farnaby have no children and let me add that they have adopted the daughter and orphan child of mrs farnabys sister this sister it seems died many years ago surviving her husband for a few months only to complete the story of the past death has also taken old mr ronald the founder of the stationers business and his wife mrs farnabys mother dry facts thesei dont deny it but there is something more interesting to follow i have next to tell you how mr hethcote first became acquainted with mrs farnaby now rufus we are coming to something romantic at last  it is some time since mr hethcote ceased to perform his clerical duties owing to a malady in the throat which made it painful for him to take his place in the readingdesk or the pulpit his last curacy attached him to a church at the westend of london and here one sunday evening after he had preached the sermon a lady in trouble came to him in the vestry for spiritual advice and consolation she was a regular attendant at the church and something which he had said in that evenings sermon had deeply affected her mr hethcote spoke with her afterwards on many occasions at home he felt a sincere interest in her but he disliked her husband and when he gave up his curacy he ceased to pay visits to the house as to what mrs farnabys troubles were i can tell you nothing mr hethcote spoke very gravely and sadly when he told me that the subject of his conversations with her must be kept a secret i doubt whether you and mr farnaby will get on well together he said to me but i shall be astonished if you are not favourably impressed by his wife and her niece  this was all i knew when i presented my letter of introduction to mr farnaby at his place of business  it was a grand stone building with great plateglass windowsall renewed and improved they told me since old mr ronalds time my letter and my card went into an office at the back and i followed them after a while a lean hard middleaged man buttoned up tight in a black frockcoat received me holding my written introduction open in his hand he had a ruddy complexion not commonly seen in londoners so far as my experience goes his irongray hair and whiskers especially the whiskers were in wonderfully fine orderas carefully oiled and combed as if he had just come out of a barbers shop i had been in the morning to the zoological gardens his eyes when he lifted them from the letter to me reminded me of the eyes of the eaglesglassy and cruel i have a fault that i cant cure myself of i like people or dislike them at first sight without knowing in either case whether they deserve it or not in the one moment when our eyes met i felt the devil in me in plain english i hated mr farnaby  good morning sir he began in a loud harsh rasping voice the letter you bring me takes me by surprise  i thought the writer was an old friend of yours i said  an old friend of mine mr farnaby answered whose errors i deplore when he joined your community i looked upon him as a lost man i am surprised at his writing to me  it is quite likely i was wrong knowing nothing of the usages of society in england i thought this reception of me downright rude i had laid my hat on a chair i took it up in my hand again and delivered a parting shot at the brute with the oily whiskers  if i had known what you now tell me i said i should not have troubled you by presenting that letter good morning  this didnt in the least offend him a curious smile broke out on his face it widened his eyes and it twitched up his mouth at one corner he held out his hand to stop me i waited in case he felt bound to make an apology he did nothing of the sorthe only made a remark  you are young and hasty he said i may lament my friends extravagances without failing on that account in what is due to an old friendship you are probably not aware that we have no sympathy in england with socialists  i hit him back again in that case sir a little socialism in england would do you no harm we consider it a part of our duty as christians to feel sympathy with all men who are honest in their convictionsno matter how mistaken in our opinion the convictions may be i rather thought i had him there and i took up my hat again to get off with the honours of victory while i had the chance  i am sincerely ashamed of myself rufus in telling you all this i ought to have given him back the soft answer that turneth away wrathmy conduct was a disgrace to my community what evil influence was at work in me was it the air of london or was it a possession of the devil  he stopped me for the second timenot in the least disconcerted by what i had said to him his inbred conviction of his own superiority to a young adventurer like me was really something magnificent to witness he did me justicethe philistinepharisee did me justice will you believe it he made his remarks next on my good points as if i had been a young bull at a prize cattle show  excuse me for noticing it he said your manners are perfectly gentlemanlike and you speak english without any accent and yet you have been brought up in america what does it mean  i grew worse and worsei got downright sulky now  i suppose it means i answered that some of us in america cultivate ourselves as well as our land we have our books and music though you seem to think we only have our axes and spades englishmen dont claim a monopoly of good manners at tadmor we see no difference between an american gentleman and an english gentleman and as for speaking english with an accent the americans accuse us of doing that  he smiled again how very absurd he said with a superb compassion for the benighted americans by this time i suspect he began to feel that he had had enough of me he got rid of me with an invitation  i shall be glad to receive you at my private residence and introduce you to my wife and her nieceour adopted daughter there is the address we have a few friends to dinner on saturday next at seven will you give us the pleasure of your company  we are all aware that there is a distinction between civility and cordiality but i myself never knew how wide that distinction might be until mr farnaby invited me to dinner if i had not been curious after what mr hethcote had told me to see mrs farnaby and her niece i should certainly have slipped out of the engagement as it was i promised to dine with oilywhiskers  he put his hand into mine at parting it felt as moistly cold as a dead fish after getting out again into the street i turned into the first tavern i passed and ordered a drink shall i tell you what else i did i went into the lavatory and washed mr farnaby off my hand nbif i had behaved in this way at tadmor i should have been punished with the lighter penaltytaking my meals by myself and being forbidden to enter the common room for eight and forty hours i feel i am getting wickeder and wickeder in londoni have half a mind to join you in ireland what does tom moore say of his countrymenhe ought to know i suppose for though they love women and golden store sir knight they love honour and virtue more they must have been all socialists in tom moores time just the place for me   i have been obliged to wait a little a dense fog has descended on us by way of variety with a stinking coal fire with the gas lit and the curtains drawn at halfpast eleven in the forenoon i feel that i am in my own country again at last patience my friendpatience i am coming to the ladies  entering mr farnabys private residence on the appointed day i became acquainted with one more of the innumerable insincerities of modern english life when a man asks you to dine with him at seven oclock in other countries he means what he says in england he means halfpast seven and sometimes a quarter to eight at seven oclock i was the only person in mr farnabys drawingroom at ten minutes past seven mr farnaby made his appearance i had a good mind to take his place in the middle of the hearthrug and say farnaby i am glad to see you but i looked at his whiskers and they said to me as plainly as words could speak better not  in five minutes more mrs farnaby joined us  i wish i was a practised authoror no i would rather for the moment be a competent portraitpainter and send you mrs farnabys likeness enclosed how i am to describe her in words i really dont know my dear fellow she almost frightened me i never before saw such a woman i never expect to see such a woman again there was nothing in her figure or in her way of moving that produced this impression on meshe is little and fat and walks with a firm heavy step like the step of a man her face is what i want to make you see as plainly as i saw it myself it was her face that startled me  so far as i can pretend to judge she must have been pretty in a healthy way when she was young i declare i hardly know whether she is not pretty now she certainly has no marks or wrinkles her hair either has no gray in it or is too light to show the gray she has preserved her fair complexion perhaps with art to assist iti cant say as for her lipsi am not speaking disrespectfully i am only describing them truly when i say that they invite kisses in spite of her in two words though she has been married as i know from what one of the guests told me after dinner for sixteen years she would be still an irresistible little woman but for the one startling drawback of her eyes dont mistake me in themselves they are large wellopened blue eyes and may at one time have been the chief attraction in her face but now there is an expression of suffering in themlong unsolaced suffering as i believeso despairing and so dreadful that she really made my heart ache when i looked at her i will swear to it that woman lives in some secret hell of her own making and longs for the release of death and is so inveterately full of bodily life and strength that she may carry her burden with her to the utmost verge of life i am digging the pen into the paper i feel this so strongly and i am so wretchedly incompetent to express my feeling can you imagine a diseased mind imprisoned in a healthy body i dont care what doctors or books may sayit is that and nothing else nothing else will solve the mystery of the smooth face the fleshy figure the firm step the muscular grip of her hand when she gives it to youand the soul in torment that looks at you all the while out of her eyes it is useless to tell me that such a contradiction as this cannot exist i have seen the woman and she does exist  oh yes i can fancy you grinning over my letteri can hear you saying to yourself where did he pick up his experience i wonder i have no experiencei only have something that serves me instead of it and i dont know what the elder brother at tadmor used to say it was sympathy but he is a sentimentalist  well mr farnaby presented me to his wifeand then walked away as if he was sick of us both and looked out of the window  for some reason or other mrs farnaby seemed to be surprised for the moment by my personal appearance her husband had very likely not told her how young i was she got over her momentary astonishment and signing to me to sit by her on the sofa said the necessary words of welcomeevidently thinking something else all the time the strange miserable eyes looked over my shoulder instead of looking at me  mr farnaby tells me you have been living in america  the tone in which she spoke was curiously quiet and monotonous i have heard such tones in the far west from lonely settlers without a neighbouring soul to speak to has mrs farnaby no neighbouring soul to speak to except at dinner parties  you are an englishman are you not she went on  i said yes and cast about in my mind for something to say to her she saved me the trouble by making me the victim of a complete series of questions this as i afterwards discovered was her way of finding conversation for strangers have you ever met with absentminded people to whom it is a relief to ask questions mechanically without feeling the slightest interest in the answers  she began where did you live in america  at tadmor in the state of illinois  what sort of place is tadmor  i described the place as well as i could under the circumstances  what made you go to tadmor  it was impossible to reply to this without speaking of the community feeling that the subject was not in the least likely to interest her i spoke as briefly as i could to my astonishment i evidently began to interest her from that moment the series of questions went onbut now she not only listened she was eager for the answers  are there any women among you  nearly as many women as men  another change over the weary misery of her eyes there flashed a bright look of interest which completely transformed them her articulation even quickened when she put her next question  are any of the women friendless creatures who came to you from england  yes some of them  i thought of mellicent as i spoke was this new interest that i had so innocently aroused an interest in mellicent her next question only added to my perplexity her next question proved that my guess had completely failed to hit the mark  are there any young women among them  mr farnaby standing with his back to us thus far suddenly turned and looked at her when she inquired if there were young women among us  oh yes i said mere girls  she pressed so near to me that her knees touched mine how old she asked eagerly  mr farnaby left the window walked close up to the sofa and deliberately interrupted us  nasty muggy weather isnt it he said i suppose the climate of america  mrs farnaby deliberately interrupted her husband how old she repeated in a louder tone  i was bound of course to answer the lady of the house some girls from eighteen to twenty and some younger  how much younger  oh from sixteen to seventeen  she grew more and more excited she positively laid her hand on my arm in her eagerness to secure my attention all to herself american girls or english she resumed her fat firm fingers closing on me with a tremulous grasp  shall you be in town in november said mr farnaby purposely interrupting us again if you would like to see the lord mayors show  mrs farnaby impatiently shook me by the arm american girls or english she reiterated more obstinately than ever  mr farnaby gave her one look if he could have put her on the blazing fire and have burnt her up in an instant by an effort of will i believe he would have made the effort he saw that i was observing him and turned quickly from his wife to me his ruddy face was pale with suppressed rage my early arrival had given mrs farnaby an opportunity of speaking to me which he had not anticipated in inviting me to dinner come and see my pictures he said  his wife still held me fast whether he liked it or not i had again no choice but to answer her some american girls and some english i said  her eyes opened wider and wider in unutterable expectation she suddenly advanced her face so close to mine that i felt her hot breath on my cheeks as the next words burst their way through her lips  born in england  no born at tadmor  she dropped my arm the light died out of her eyes in an instant in some inconceivable way i had utterly destroyed some secret expectation that she had fixed on me she actually left me on the sofa and took a chair on the opposite side of the fireplace mr farnaby turning paler and paler stepped up to her as she changed her place i rose to look at the pictures on the wall nearest to me you remarked the extraordinary keenness of my sense of hearing while we were fellow passengers on the steamship when he stooped over her and whispered in her ear i heard himthough nearly the whole breadth of the room was between us you hellcatthat was what mr farnaby said to his wife  the clock on the mantelpiece struck the halfhour after seven in quick succession the guests at the dinner now entered the room  i was so staggered by the extraordinary scene of married life which i had just witnessed that the guests produced only a very faint impression upon me my mind was absorbed in trying to find the true meaning of what i had seen and heard was mrs farnaby a little mad i dismissed that idea as soon as it occurred to me nothing that i had observed in her justified it the truer conclusion appeared to be that she was deeply interested in some absent and possibly lost young creature whose age judging by actions and tones which had sufficiently revealed that part of the secret to me could not be more than sixteen or seventeen years how long had she cherished the hope of seeing the girl or hearing of her it must have been anyhow a hope very deeply rooted for she had been perfectly incapable of controlling herself when i had accidentally roused it as for her husband there could be no doubt that the subject was not merely distasteful to him but so absolutely infuriating that he could not even keep his temper in the presence of a third person invited to his house had he injured the girl in any way was he responsible for her disappearance did his wife know it or only suspect it who was the girl what was the secret of mrs farnabys extraordinary interest in hermrs farnaby whose marriage was childless whose interest one would have thought should be naturally concentrated on her adopted daughter her sisters orphan child in conjectures such as these i completely lost myself let me hear what your ingenuity can make of the puzzle and let me return to mr farnabys dinner waiting on mr farnabys table  the servant threw open the drawingroom door and the most honoured guest present led mrs farnaby to the diningroom i roused myself to some observation of what was going on about me no ladies had been invited and the men were all of a certain age i looked in vain for the charming niece was she not well enough to appear at the dinnerparty i ventured on putting the question to mr farnaby  you will find her at the teatable when we return to the drawingroom girls are out of place at dinnerparties so he answered menot very graciously  as i stepped out on the landing i looked up i dont know why unless i was the unconscious object of magnetic attraction anyhow i had my reward a bright young face peeped over the balusters of the upper staircase and modestly withdrew itself again in a violent hurry everybody but mr farnaby and myself had disappeared in the diningroom was she having a peep at the young socialist   another interruption to my letter caused by another change in the weather the fog has vanished the waiter is turning off the gas and letting in the drabcoloured daylight i ask him if it is still raining he smiles and rubs his hands and says it looks like clearing up soon sir this mans head is gray he has been all his life a waiter in londonand he can still see the cheerful side of things what native strength of mind cast away on a vocation that is unworthy of it  welland now about the farnaby dinner i feel a tightness in the lower part of my waistcoat rufus when i think of the dinner there was such a quantity of it and mr farnaby was so tyrannically resolute in forcing his luxuries down the throats of his guests his eye was on me if i let my plate go away before it was emptyhis eye said i have paid for this magnificent dinner and i mean to see you eat it our printed list of the dishes as they succeeded each other also informed us of the varieties of wine which it was imperatively necessary to drink with each dish i got into difficulties early in the proceedings the taste of sherry for instance is absolutely nauseous to me and rhine wine turns into vinegar ten minutes after it has passed my lips i asked for the wine that i could drink out of its turn you should have seen mr farnabys face when i violated the rules of his dinnertable it was the one amusing incident of the feastthe one thing that alleviated the dreary and mysterious spectacle of mrs farnaby there she sat with her mind hundreds of miles away from everything that was going on about her entangling the two guests on her right hand and on her left in a network of vacant questions just as she had entangled me i discovered that one of these gentlemen was a barrister and the other a shipowner by the answers which mrs farnaby absently extracted from them on the subject of their respective vocations in life and while she questioned incessantly she ate incessantly her vigorous body insisted on being fed she would have emptied her wineglass i suspect as readily as she plied her knife and forkbut i discovered that a certain system of restraint was established in the matter of wine at intervals mr farnaby just looked at the butlerand the butler and his bottle on those occasions deliberately passed her by not the slightest visible change was produced in her by the eating and drinking she was equal to any demands that any dinner could make on her there was no flush in her face no change in her spirits when she rose in obedience to english custom and retired to the drawingroom  left together over their wine the men began to talk politics  i listened at the outset expecting to get some information our readings in modern history at tadmor had informed us of the dominant political position of the middle classes in england since the time of the first reform bill mr farnabys guests represented the respectable mediocrity of social position the professional and commercial average of the nation they all talked glibly enoughi and an old gentleman who sat next to me being the only listeners i had spent the morning lazily in the smokingroom of the hotel reading the days newspapers and what did i hear now when the politicians set in for their discussion i heard the leading articles of the days newspapers translated into bald chat and coolly addressed by one man to another as if they were his own individual views on public affairs this absurd imposture positively went the round of the table received and respected by everybody with a stolid solemnity of makebelieve which it was downright shameful to see not a man present said i saw that today in the times or the telegraph not a man present had an opinion of his own or if he had an opinion ventured to express it or if he knew nothing of the subject was honest enough to say so one enormous sham and everybody in a conspiracy to take it for the real thing that is an accurate description of the state of political feeling among the representative men at mr farnabys dinner i am not judging rashly by one example only i have been taken to clubs and public festivals only to hear over and over again what i heard in mr farnabys diningroom does it need any great foresight to see that such a state of things as this cannot last much longer in a country which has not done with reforming itself yet the time is coming in england when the people who have opinions of their own will be heard and when parliament will be forced to open the door to them  this is a nice outbreak of republican freedom what does my longsuffering friend think of itwaiting all the time to be presented to mr farnabys niece everything in its place rufus the niece followed the politics at the time and she shall follow them now  you shall hear first what my next neighbour said of hera quaint old fellow a retired doctor if i remember correctly he seemed to be as weary of the secondhand newspaper talk as i was he quite sparkled and cheered up when i introduced the subject of miss regina have i mentioned her name yet if not here it is for you in fullmiss regina mildmay  i call her the brown girl said the old gentleman brown hair brown eyes and a brown skin no not a brunette not dark enough for thata warm delicate brown wait till you see it takes after her father i should tell you he was a finelooking man in his time foreign blood in his veins by his mothers side miss regina gets her queer name by being christened after his mother never mind her name shes a charming person lets drink her health  we drank her health remembering that he had called her the brown girl i said i supposed she was still quite young  better than young the doctor answered in the prime of life i call her a girl by habit wait till you see her  has she a good figure sir  ha youre like the turks are you a nicelooking woman doesnt content youyou must have her wellmade too we can accommodate you sir we are slim and tall with a swing of our hips and we walk like a goddess wait and see how her head is put on her shouldersi say no more proud not she a simple unaffected kindhearted creature always the same i never saw her out of temper in my life i never heard her speak ill of anybody the man who gets her will be a man to be envied i can tell you  is she engaged to be married  no she has had plenty of offers but she doesnt seem to care for anything of that sortso far devotes herself to mrs farnaby and keeps up her schoolfriendships a splendid creature with the vital thermometer at temperate hearta calm meditative equable person pass me the olives only think the man who discovered olives is unknown no statue of him erected in any part of the civilized earth i know few more remarkable instances of human ingratitude  i risked a bold questionbut not on the subject of olives isnt miss reginas life rather a dull one in this house  the doctor cautiously lowered his voice it would be dull enough to some women reginas early life has been a hard one her mother was mr ronalds eldest daughter the old brute never forgave her for marrying against his wishes mrs ronald did all she could secretly to help the young wife in disgrace but old ronald had sole command of the money and kept it to himself from reginas earliest childhood there was always distress at home her father harassed by creditors trying one scheme after another and failing in all her mother and herself half starvedwith their very bedclothes sometimes at the pawnbrokers i attended them in their illnesses and though they hid their wretchedness from everybody else proud as lucifer both of them they couldnt hide it from me fancy the change to this house i dont say that living here in clover is enough for such a person as regina i only say it has its influence she is one of those young women sir who delight in sacrificing themselves to othersshe is devoted for instance to mrs farnaby i only hope mrs farnaby is worthy of it not that it matters to regina what she does she does out of her own sweetness of disposition she brightens this household i can tell you farnaby did a wise thing in his own domestic interests when he adopted her as his daughter she thinks she can never be grateful enough to himthe good creaturethough she has repaid him a hundredfold hell find that out one of these days when a husband takes her away dont suppose that i want to disparage our hosthes an old friend of mine but hes a little too apt to take the good things that fall to his lot as if they were nothing but a just recognition of his own merits i have told him that to his face often enough to have a right to say it of him when he doesnt hear me do you smoke i wish they would drop their politics and take to tobacco i say farnaby i want a cigar  this broad hint produced an adjournment to the smokingroom the doctor leading the way i began to wonder how much longer my introduction to miss regina was to be delayed it was not to come until i had seen a new side of my hosts character and had found myself promoted to a place of my own in mr farnabys estimation  as we rose from table one of the guests spoke to me of a visit that he had recently paid to the part of buckinghamshire which i come from i was shown a remarkably picturesque old house on the heath he said they told me it had been inhabited for centuries by the family of the goldenhearts are you in any way related to them i answered that i was very nearly related having been born in the houseand there as i suppose the matter ended being the youngest man of the party i waited of course until the rest of the gentlemen had passed out to the smokingroom mr farnaby and i were left together to my astonishment he put his arm cordially into mine and led me out of the diningroom with the genial familiarity of an old friend  ill give you such a cigar he said as you cant buy for money in all london you have enjoyed yourself i hope now we know what wine you like you wont have to ask the butler for it next time drop in any day and take potluck with us he came to a standstill in the hall his brassy rasping voice assumed a new tonea sort of parody of respect have you been to your family place he asked since your return to england  he had evidently heard the few words exchanged between his friend and myself it seemed odd that he should take any interest in a place belonging to people who were strangers to him however his question was easily answered i had only to inform him that my father had sold the house when he left england  oh dear im sorry to hear that he said those old family places ought to be kept up the greatness of england sir strikes its roots in the old families of england they may be rich or they may be poorthat dont matter an old family is an old family its sad to see their hearths and homes sold to wealthy manufacturers who dont know who their own grandfathers were would you allow me to ask what is the family motto of the goldenhearts  shall i own the truth the bottles circulated freely at mr farnabys tablei began to wonder whether he was quite sober i said i was sorry to disappoint him but i really did not know what my family motto was  he was unaffectedly shocked i think i saw a ring on your finger he said as soon as he recovered himself he lifted my left hand in his own coldfishy paw the one ring i wear is of plain gold it belonged to my father and it has his initials inscribed on the signet  good gracious you havent got your coatofarms on your seal cried mr farnaby my dear sir i am old enough to be your father and i must take the freedom of remonstrating with you your coatofarms and your motto are no doubt at the heralds officewhy dont you apply for them shall i go there for you i will do it with pleasure you shouldnt be careless about these thingsyou shouldnt indeed  i listened in speechless astonishment was he ironically expressing his contempt for old families we got into the smokingroom at last and my friend the doctor enlightened me privately in a corner every word mr farnaby had said had been spoken in earnest this man who owes his rise from the lowest social position entirely to himselfwho judging by his own experience has every reason to despise the poor pride of ancestryactually feels a sincerely servile admiration for the accident of birth oh poor human nature as somebody says how cordially i agree with somebody  we went up to the drawingroom and i was introduced to the brown girl at last what impression did she produce on me  do you know rufus there is some perverse reluctance in me to go on with this inordinately long letter just when i have arrived at the most interesting part of it i cant account for my own state of mind i only know that it is so the difficulty of describing the young lady doesnt perplex me like the difficulty of describing mrs farnaby i can see her now as vividly as if she was present in the room i even remember and this is astonishing in a man the dress that she wore and yet i shrink from writing about her as if there was something wrong in it do me a kindness good friend and let me send off all these sheets of paper the idle work of an idle morning just as they are when i write next i promise to be ashamed of my own capricious state of mind and to paint the portrait of miss regina at full length  in the mean while dont run away with the idea that she has made a disagreeable impression upon me good heavens it is far from that you have had the old doctors opinion of her very well multiply this opinion by tenand you have mine   notea strange indorsement appears on this letter dated several months after the period at which it was receivedah poor amelius he had better have gone back to miss mellicent and put up with the little drawback of her age what a bright lovable fellow he was goodbye to goldenheart  these lines are not signed they are known however to be in the handwriting of rufus dingwell    chapter 2  i particularly want you to come and lunch with us dearest cecilia the day after tomorrow dont say to yourself the farnabys house is dull and regina is too slow for me and dont think about the long drive for the horses from your place to london this letter has an interest of its own my deari have got something new for you what do you think of a young man who is clever and handsome and agreeableand wonder of wonders quite unlike any other young englishman you ever saw in your life you are to meet him at luncheon and you are to get used to his strange name beforehand for which purpose i enclose his card  he made his first appearance at our house at dinner yesterday evening  when he was presented to me at the teatable he was not to be put off with a bowhe insisted on shaking hands where i have been he explained we help a first introduction with a little cordiality he looked into his teacup after he said that with the air of a man who could say something more if he had a little encouragement of course i encouraged him i suppose shaking hands is much the same form in america that bowing is in england i said as suggestively as i could  he looked up directly and shook his head we have too many forms in this country he said the virtue of hospitality for instance seems to have become a form in england in america when a new acquaintance says come and see me he means it when he says it here in nine cases out of ten he looks unaffectedly astonished if you are fool enough to take him at his word i hate insincerity miss reginaand now i have returned to my own country i find insincerity one of the established institutions of english society can we do anything for you ask them to do something for youand you will see what it means thank you for such a pleasant evening get into the carriage with them when they go homeand you will find that it means what a bore ah mr soandso allow me to congratulate you on your new appointment mr soandso passes out of hearingand you discover what the congratulations mean corrupt old brute he has got the price of his vote at the last division oh mr blank what a charming book you have written mr blank passes out of hearingand you ask what his book is about to tell you the truth i havent read it hush hes received at court one must say these things the other day a friend took me to a grand dinner at the lord mayors i accompanied him first to his club many distinguished guests met there before going to the dinner heavens how they spoke of the lord mayor one of them didnt know his name and didnt want to know it another wasnt certain whether he was a tallowchandler or a buttonmaker a third who had met with him somewhere described him as a damned ass a fourth said oh dont be hard on him hes only a vulgar old cockney without an h in his whole composition a chorus of general agreement followed as the dinnerhour approached what a bore i whispered to my friend why do they go he answered you see one must do this sort of thing and when we got to the mansion house they did that sort of thing with a vengeance when the speechmaking set in these very men who had been all expressing their profound contempt for the lord mayor behind his back now flattered him to his face in such a shamelessly servile way with such a meanly complete insensibility to their own baseness that i did really and literally turn sick i slipped out into the fresh air and fumigated myself after the company i had kept with a cigar no no its useless to excuse these things i could quote dozens of other instances that have come under my own observation by saying that they are trifles when trifles make themselves habits of yours or of mine they become a part of your character or mine we have an inveterately false and vicious system of society in england if you want to trace one of the causes look back to the little organized insincerities of english life  of course you understand cecilia that this was not all said at one burst as i have written it here some of it came out in the way of answers to my inquiries and some of it was spoken in the intervals of laughing talking and teadrinking but i want to show you how very different this young man is from the young men whom we are in the habit of meeting and so i huddle his talk together in one sample as papa farnaby would call it  my dear he is decidedly handsome i mean our delightful amelius his face has a bright eager look indescribably refreshing as a contrast to the stolid composure of the ordinary young englishman his smile is charming he moves as gracefullywith as little selfconsciousnessas my italian greyhound he has been brought up among the strangest people in america and would you believe it he is actually a socialist dont be alarmed he shocked us all dreadfully by declaring that his socialism was entirely learnt out of the new testament i have looked at the new testament since he mentioned some of his principles to me and do you know i declare it is true  oh i forgotthe young socialist plays and sings when we asked him to go to the piano he got up and began directly i dont do it well enough he said to want a great deal of pressing he sang old english songs with great taste and sweetness one of the gentlemen of our party evidently disliking him spoke rather rudely i thought a socialist who sings and plays he said is a harmless socialist indeed i begin to feel that my balance is safe at my bankers and that london wont be set on fire with petroleum this time he got his answer i can tell you why should we set london on fire london takes a regular percentage of your income from you sir whether you like it or not on sound socialist principles you are the man who has got the money and socialism saysyou must and shall help the man who has got none that is exactly what your own poor law says to you every time the collector leaves the paper at your house wasnt it cleverand it was doubly severe because it was goodhumouredly said  between ourselves cecilia i think he is struck with me when i walked about the room his bright eyes followed me everywhere and when i took a chair by somebody else not feeling it quite right to keep him all to myself he invariably contrived to find a seat on the other side of me his voice too had a certain tone addressed to me and to no other person in the room judge for yourself when you come here but dont jump to conclusions if you please oh noi am not going to fall in love with him it isnt in me to fall in love with anybody do you remember what the last man whom i refused said of me she has a machine on the left side of her that pumps blood through her body but she has no heart i pity the woman who marries that man  one thing more my dear this curious amelius seems to notice trifles which escape men in general just as we do towards the close of the evening poor mamma farnaby fell into one of her vacant states half asleep and half awake on the sofa in the back drawingroom your aunt interests me he whispered she must have suffered some terrible sorrow at some past time in her life fancy a man seeing that he dropped some hints which showed that he was puzzling his brains to discover how i got on with her and whether i was in her confidence or not he even went the length of asking what sort of life i led with the uncle and aunt who have adopted me my dear it was done so delicately with such irresistible sympathy and such a charming air of respect that i was quite startled when i remembered in the wakeful hours of the night how freely i had spoken to him not that i have betrayed any secrets for as you know i am as ignorant as everybody else of what the early troubles of my poor dear aunt may have been but i did tell him how i came into the house a helpless little orphan girl and how generously these two good relatives adopted me and how happy it made me to find that i could really do something to cheer their sad childless lives i wish i was half as good as you are he said i cant understand how you became fond of mrs farnaby perhaps it began in sympathy and compassion just think of that from a young englishman he went on confessing his perplexities as if we had known one another from childhood i am a little surprised to see mrs farnaby present at parties of this sort i should have thought she would have stayed in her own room thats just what she objects to do i answered she says people will report that her husband is ashamed of her or that she is not fit to be seen in society if she doesnt appear at the partiesand she is determined not to be misrepresented in that way can you understand my talking to him with so little reserve it is a specimen cecilia of the odd manner in which my impulses carry me away in this mans company he is so nice and gentleand yet so manly i shall be curious to see if you can resist him with your superior firmness and knowledge of the world  but the strangest incident of all i have not told you yetfeeling some hesitation about the best way of describing it so as to interest you in what has deeply interested me i must tell it as plainly as i can and leave it to speak for itself  who do you think has invited amelius goldenheart to luncheon not papa farnaby who only invites him to dinner not i it is needless to say who is it then mamma farnaby herself he has actually so interested her that she has been thinking of him and dreaming of him in his absence  i heard her last night poor thing talking and grinding her teeth in her sleep and i went into her room to try if i could quiet her in the usual way by putting my cool hand on her forehead and pressing it gently the old doctor says its magnetism which is ridiculous well it didnt succeed this time she went on muttering and making that dreadful sound with her teeth occasionally a word was spoken clearly enough to be intelligible i could make no connected sense of what i heard but i could positively discover thisthat she was dreaming of our guest from america  i said nothing about it of course when i went upstairs with her cup of tea this morning what do you think was the first thing she asked for pen ink and paper her next request was that i would write mr goldenhearts address on an envelope are you going to write to him i asked yes she said i want to speak to him while john is out of the way at business secrets i said turning it off with a laugh she answered speaking gravely and earnestly yes secrets the letter was written and sent to his hotel inviting him to lunch with us on the first day when he was disengaged he has replied appointing the day after tomorrow by way of trying to penetrate the mystery i inquired if she wished me to appear at the luncheon she considered with herself before she answered that i want him to be amused and put in a good humour she said before i speak to him you must lunch with usand ask cecilia she stopped and considered once more mind one thing she went on your uncle is to know nothing about it if you tell him i will never speak to you again  is this not extraordinary whatever her dream may have been it has evidently produced a strong impression on her i firmly believe she means to take him away with her to her own room when the luncheon is over dearest cecilia you must help me to stop this i have never been trusted with her secrets they may for all i know be innocent secrets enough poor soul but it is surely in the highest degree undesirable that she should take into her confidence a young man who is only an acquaintance of ours she will either make herself ridiculous or do something worse if mr farnaby finds it out i really tremble for what may happen  for the sake of old friendship dont leave me to face this difficulty by myself a line only one line dearest to say that you will not fail me     book the third mrs farnabys foot    chapter 1  it is an afternoon concert and modern german music was largely represented on the programme the patient english people sat in closelypacked rows listening to the pretentious instrumental noises which were impudently offered to them as a substitute for melody while these docile victims of the worst of all quackeries musical quackery were still toiling through their first hour of endurance a passing ripple of interest stirred the stagnant surface of the audience caused by the sudden rising of a lady overcome by the heat she was quickly led out of the concertroom after whispering a word of explanation to two young ladies seated at her side by a gentleman who made a fourth member of the party left by themselves the young ladies looked at each other whispered to each other half rose from their places became confusedly conscious that the wandering attention of the audience was fixed on them and decided at last on following their companions out of the hall  but the lady who had preceded them had some reason of her own for not waiting to recover herself in the vestibule when the gentleman in charge of her asked if he should get a glass of water she answered sharply get a caband be quick about it  the cab was found in a moment the gentleman got in after her by the ladys invitation are you better now he asked  i have never had anything the matter with me she replied quietly tell the man to drive faster  having obeyed his instructions the gentleman otherwise amelius began to look a little puzzled the lady mrs farnaby herself perceived his condition of mind and favoured him with an explanation  i had my own motive for asking you to luncheon today she began in that steady downright way of speaking that was peculiar to her i wanted to have a word with you privately my niece reginadont be surprised at my calling her my niece when you have heard mr farnaby call her his daughter she is my niece adopting her is a mere phrase it doesnt alter facts it doesnt make her mr farnabys child or mine does it  she had ended with a question but she seemed to want no answer to it her face was turned towards the cabwindow instead of towards amelius he was one of those rare people who are capable of remaining silent when they have nothing to say mrs farnaby went on  my niece regina is a good creature in her way but she suspects people she has some reason of her own for trying to prevent me from taking you into my confidence and her friend cecilia is helping her yes yes the concert was the obstacle which they had arranged to put in my way you were obliged to go after telling them you wanted to hear the music and i couldnt complain because they had got a fourth ticket for me i made up my mind what to do and i have done it nothing wonderful in my being taken ill with the heat nothing wonderful in your doing your duty as a gentleman and looking after meand what is the consequence here we are together on our way to my room in spite of them not so bad for a poor helpless creature like me is it  inwardly wondering what it all meant and what she could possibly want with him amelius suggested that the young ladies might leave the concertroom and not finding them in the vestibule might follow them back to the house  mrs farnaby turned her head from the window and looked him in the face for the first time i have been a match for them so far she said leave it to me and you will find i can be a match for them still  after saying this she watched the puzzled face of amelius with a moments steady scrutiny her full lips relaxed into a faint smile her head sank slowly on her bosom i wonder whether he thinks i am a little crazy she said quietly to herself some women in my place would have gone mad years ago perhaps it might have been better for me she looked up again at amelius i believe you are a goodtempered fellow she went on are you in your usual temper now did you enjoy your lunch has the lively company of the young ladies put you in a good humour with women generally i want you to be in a particularly good humour with me  she spoke quite gravely amelius a little to his own astonishment found himself answering gravely on his side assuring her in the most conventional terms that he was entirely at her service something in her manner affected him disagreeably if he had followed his impulse he would have jumped out of the cab and have recovered his liberty and his lightheartedness at one and the same moment by running away at the top of his speed  the driver turned into the street in which mr farnabys house was situated mrs farnaby stopped him and got out at some little distance from the door you think the young ones will follow us back she said to amelius it doesnt matter the servants will have nothing to tell them if they do she checked him in the act of knocking when they reached the house door its teatime downstairs she whispered looking at her watch you and i are going into the house without letting the servants know anything about it now do you understand  she produced from her pocket a steel ring with several keys attached to it a duplicate of mr farnabys key she explained as she chose one and opened the street door sometimes when i find myself waking in the small hours of the morning i cant endure my bed i must go out and walk my key lets me in again just as it lets us in now without disturbing anybody you had better say nothing about it to mr farnaby not that it matters much for i should refuse to give up my key if he asked me but youre a goodnatured fellowand you dont want to make bad blood between man and wife do you step softly and follow me  amelius hesitated there was something repellent to him in entering another mans house under these clandestine conditions all right whispered mrs farnaby perfectly understanding him consult your dignity go out again and knock at the door and ask if i am at home i only wanted to prevent a fuss and an interruption when regina comes back if the servants dont know we are here they will tell her we havent returneddont you see  it would have been absurd to contest the matter after this amelius followed her submissively to the farther end of the hall there she opened the door of a long narrow room built out at the back of the house  this is my den she said signing to amelius to pass in while we are here nobody will disturb us she laid aside her bonnet and shawl and pointed to a box of cigars on the table take one she resumed i smoke too when nobody sees me thats one of the reasons i dare say why regina wished to keep you out of my room i find smoking composes me what do you say  she lit a cigar and handed the matches to amelius finding that he stood fairly committed to the adventure he resigned himself to circumstances with his customary facility he too lit a cigar and took a chair by the fire and looked about him with an impenetrable composure worthy of rufus dingwell himself  the room bore no sort of resemblance to a boudoir a faded old turkey carpet was spread on the floor the common mahogany table had no covering the chintz on the chairs was of a truly venerable age some of the furniture made the place look like a room occupied by a man dumbbells and clubs of the sort used in athletic exercises hung over the bare mantelpiece a large ugly oaken structure with closed doors something between a cabinet and a wardrobe rose on one side to the ceiling a turning lathe stood against the opposite wall above the lathe were hung in a row four prints in dingy old frames of black wood which especially attracted the attention of amelius mostly foreign prints they were all discoloured by time and they all strangely represented different aspects of the same subjectinfants parted from their parents by desertion or robbery the young moses was there in his ark of bulrushes on the river bank good st francis appeared next roaming the streets and rescuing forsaken children in the wintry night a third print showed the foundling hospital of old paris with the turning cage in the wall and the bell to ring when the infant was placed in it the next and last subject was the stealing of a child from the lap of its slumbering nurse by a gipsy woman these sadly suggestive subjects were the only ornaments on the walls no traces of books or music were visible no needlework of any sort was to be seen no elegant trifles no china or flowers or delicate lacework or sparkling jewelrynothing absolutely nothing suggestive of a womans presence appeared in any part of mrs farnabys room  i have got several things to say to you she began but one thing must be settled first give me your sacred word of honour that you will not repeat to any mortal creature what i am going to tell you now she reclined in her chair and drew in a mouthful of smoke and puffed it out again and waited for his reply  young and unsuspicious as he was this unscrupulous method of taking his confidence by storm startled amelius his natural tact and good sense told him plainly that mrs farnaby was asking too much  dont be angry with me maam he said i must remind you that you are going to tell me your secrets without any wish to intrude on them on my part  she interrupted him there what does that matter she asked coolly  amelius was obstinate he went on with what he had to say i should like to know he proceeded that i am doing no wrong to anybody before i give you my promise  you will be doing a kindness to a miserable creature she answered as quietly as ever and you will be doing no wrong to yourself or to anybody else if you promise that is all i can say your cigar is out take a light  amelius took a light with the doglike docility of a man in a state of blank amazement she waited watching him composedly until his cigar was in working order again  well she asked will you promise now  amelius gave her his promise  on your sacred word of honour she persisted  amelius repeated the formula she reclined in her chair once more i want to speak to you as if i was speaking to an old friend she explained i suppose i may call you amelius  certainly  well amelius i must tell you first that i committed a sin many long years ago i have suffered the punishment i am suffering it still ever since i was a young woman i have had a heavy burden of misery on my heart i am not reconciled to it i cannot submit to it yet i never shall be reconciled to it i never shall submit to it if i live to be a hundred do you wish me to enter into particulars or will you have mercy on me and be satisfied with what i have told you so far  it was not said entreatingly or tenderly or humbly she spoke with a savage selfcontained resignation in her manner and in her voice amelius forgot his cigar againand again she reminded him of it he answered her as his own generous impulsive temperament urged him he said tell me nothing that causes you a moments pain tell me only how i can help you she handed him the box of matches she said your cigar is out again  he laid down his cigar in his brief span of life he had seen no human misery that expressed itself in this way excuse me he answered i wont smoke just now  she laid her cigar aside like amelius and crossed her arms over her bosom and looked at him with the first softening gleam of tenderness that he had seen in her face my friend she said yours will be a sad lifei pity you the world will wound that sensitive heart of yours the world will trample on that generous nature one of these days perhaps you will be a wretch like me no more of that get up i have something to show you  rising herself she led the way to the large oaken press and took her bunch of keys out of her pocket again  about this old sorrow of mine she resumed do me justice amelius at the outset i havent treated it as some women treat their sorrowsi havent nursed it and petted it and made the most of it to myself and to others no i have tried every means of relief every possible pursuit that could occupy my mind one example of what i say will do as well as a hundred see it for yourself  she put the key in the lock it resisted her first efforts to open it with a contemptuous burst of impatience and a sudden exertion of her rare strength she tore open the two doors of the press behind the door on the left appeared a row of open shelves the opposite compartment behind the door on the right was filled by drawers with brass handles she shut the left door angrily banging it to as if the opening of it had disclosed something which she did not wish to be seen by the merest chance amelius had looked that way first in the one instant in which it was possible to see anything he had noticed carefully laid out on one of the shelves a babys long linen frock and cap turned yellow by the lapse of time  the halftold story of the past was more than half told now the treasured relics of the infant threw their little glimmer of light on the motive which had chosen the subjects of the prints on the wall a child deserted and lost a child who by bare possibility might be living still  she turned towards amelius suddenly there is nothing to interest you on that side she said look at the drawers here open them for yourself she drew back as she spoke and pointed to the uppermost of the row of drawers a narrow slip of paper was pasted on it bearing this inscriptiondead consolations  amelius opened the drawer it was full of books look at them she said amelius obeying her discovered dictionaries grammars exercises poems novels and historiesall in the german language  a foreign language tried as a relief said mrs farnaby speaking quietly behind him month after month of hard studyall forgotten now the old sorrow came back in spite of it a dead consolation open the next drawer  the next drawer revealed watercolours and drawing materials huddled together in a corner and a heap of poor little conventional landscapes filling up the rest of the space as works of art they were wretched in the last degree monuments of industry and application miserably and completely thrown away  i had no talent for that pursuit as you see said mrs farnaby but i persevered with it week after week month after month i thought to myself i hate it so it costs me such dreadful trouble it so worries and persecutes and humiliates me that this surely must keep my mind occupied and my thoughts away from myself no the old sorrow stared me in the face again on the paper that i was spoiling through the colours that i couldnt learn to use another dead consolation shut it up  she herself opened a third and a fourth drawer in one there appeared a copy of euclid and a slate with the problems still traced on it the other contained a microscope and the treatises relating to its use always the same effort she said shutting the door of the press as she spoke and always the same result you have had enough of it and so have i she turned and pointed to the lathe in the corner and to the clubs and dumbbells over the mantelpiece i can look at them patiently she went on they give me bodily relief i work at the lathe till my back aches i swing the clubs till im ready to drop with fatigue and then i lie down on the rug there and sleep it off and forget myself for an hour or two come back to the fire again you have seen my dead consolations you must hear about my living consolation next in justice to mr farnabyah how i hate him  she spoke those last vehement words to herself but with such intense bitterness of contempt that the tones were quite loud enough to be heard amelius looked furtively towards the door was there no hope that regina and her friend might return and interrupt them after what he had seen and heard could he hope to console mrs farnaby he could only wonder what object she could possibly have in view in taking him into her confidence am i always to be in a mess with women he thought to himself first poor mellicent and now this one what next he lit his cigar again the brotherhood of smokers and they alone will understand what a refuge it was to him at that moment  give me a light said mrs farnaby recalled to the remembrance of her own cigar i want to know one thing before i go on amelius i watched those bright eyes of yours at luncheontime did they tell me the truth youre not in love with my niece are you  amelius took his cigar out of his mouth and looked at her  out with it boldly she said  amelius let it out to a certain extent i admire her very much he answered  ah mrs farnaby remarked you dont know her as well as i do  the disdainful indifference of her tone irritated amelius he was still young enough to believe in the existence of gratitude and mrs farnaby had spoken ungratefully besides he was fond enough of regina already to feel offended when she was referred to slightingly  i am surprised to hear what you say of her he burst out she is quite devoted to you  oh yes said mrs farnaby carelessly she is devoted to me of courseshe is the living consolation i told you of just now that was mr farnabys notion in adopting her mr farnaby thought to himself heres a readymade daughter for my wifethats all this tiresome woman wants to comfort her now we shall do do you know what i call that i call it reasoning like an idiot a man may be very clever at his businessand may be a contemptible fool in other respects another womans child a consolation to me pah it makes me sick to think of it i have one merit amelius i dont cant its my duty to take care of my sisters child and i do my duty willingly reginas a good sort of creaturei dont dispute it but shes like all those tall darkish women theres no backbone in her no dash a kind feeble goodygoody sugarish disposition and a deal of quiet obstinacy at the bottom of it i can tell you oh yes i do her justice i dont deny that shes devoted to me as you say but i am making a clean breast of it now and you ought to know and you shall know that mr farnabys living consolation is no more a consolation to me than the things you have seen in the drawers there now weve done with regina no theres one thing more to be cleared up when you say you admire her what do you mean do you mean to marry her  for once in his life amelius stood on his dignity i have too much respect for the young lady to answer your question he said loftily  because if you do mrs farnaby proceeded i mean to put every possible obstacle in your way in short i mean to prevent it  this plain declaration staggered amelius he confessed the truth by implication in one word  why he asked sharply  wait a little and recover your temper she answered  there was a pause they sat on either side of the fireplace and eyed each other attentively  now are you ready mrs farnaby resumed here is my reason if you marry regina or marry anybody you will settle down somewhere and lead a dull life  well said amelius and why not if i like it  because i want you to remain a roving bachelor here today and gone tomorrowtravelling all over the world and seeing everything and everybody  what good will that do to you mrs farnaby  she rose from her own side of the fireplace crossed to the side on which amelius was sitting and standing before him placed her hands heavily on his shoulders her eyes grew radiant with a sudden interest and animation as they looked down on him riveted on his face  i am still waiting my friend for the living consolation that may yet come to me she said and hear this amelius after all the years that have passed you may be the man who brings it to me  in the momentary silence that followed they heard a double knock at the housedoor  regina said mrs farnaby  as the name passed her lips she sprang to the door of the room and turned the key in the lock    chapter 2  amelius rose impulsively from his chair  mrs farnaby turned at the same moment and signed to him to resume his seat you have given me your promise she whispered all i ask of you is to be silent she softly drew the key out of the door and showed it to him you cant get out she said unless you take the key from me by force  whatever amelius might think of the situation in which he now found himself the one thing that he could honourably do was to say nothing and submit to it he remained quietly by the fire no imaginable consideration he mentally resolved should induce him to consent to a second confidential interview in mrs farnabys room  the servant opened the housedoor reginas voice was heard in the hall  has my aunt come in  no miss  have you heard nothing of her  nothing miss  has mr goldenheart been here  no miss  very extraordinary what can have become of them cecilia  the voice of the other lady was heard in answer we have probably missed them on leaving the concert room dont alarm yourself regina i must go back under any circumstances the carriage will be waiting for me if i see anything of your aunt i will say that you are expecting her at home  one moment cecilia thomas you neednt wait is it really true that you dont like mr goldenheart  what has it come to that already ill try to like him regina goodbye again  the closing of the street door told that the ladies had separated the sound was followed in another moment by the opening and closing of the diningroom door mrs farnaby returned to her chair at the fireplace  regina has gone into the diningroom to wait for us she said i see you dont like your position here and i wont keep you more than a few minutes longer you are of course at a loss to understand what i was saying to you when the knock at the door interrupted us sit down again for five minutes it fidgets me to see you standing there looking at your boots i told you i had one consolation still possibly left judge for yourself what the hope of it is to me when i own to you that i should long since have put an end to my life without it dont think i am talking nonsense i mean what i say it is one of my misfortunes that i have no religious scruples to restrain me there was a time when i believed that religion might comfort me i once opened my heart to a clergymana worthy person who did his best to help me all useless my heart was too hard i suppose it doesnt matterexcept to give you one more proof that i am thoroughly in earnest patience patience i am coming to the point i asked you some odd questions on the day when you first dined here you have forgotten all about them of course  i remember them perfectly well amelius answered  you remember them that looks as if you had thought about them afterwards come tell me plainly what you did think  amelius told her plainly she became more and more interested more and more excited as he went on  quite right she exclaimed starting to her feet and walking swiftly backwards and forwards in the room there is a lost girl whom i want to find and she is between sixteen and seventeen years old as you thought mind i have no reasonnot the shadow of a reasonfor believing that she is still a living creature i have only my own stupid obstinate conviction rooted here she pressed both hands fiercely on her heart so that nothing can tear it out of me i have lived in that beliefoh dont ask me how long it is so far so miserably far to look back she stopped in the middle of the room her breath came and went in quick heavy gasps the first tears that had softened the hard wretchedness in her eyes rose in them now and transfigured them with the divine beauty of maternal love i wont distress you she said stamping on the floor as she struggled with the hysterical passion that was raging in her give me a minute and ill force it down again  she dropped into a chair threw her arms heavily on the table and laid her head on them amelius thought of the childs frock and cap hidden in the cabinet all that was manly and noble in his nature felt for the unhappy woman whose secret was dimly revealed to him now the little selfish sense of annoyance at the awkward situation in which she had placed him vanished to return no more he approached her and put his hand gently on her shoulder i am truly sorry for you he said tell me how i can help you and i will do it with all my heart  do you really mean that she roughly dashed the tears from her eyes and rose as she put the question holding him with one hand she parted the hair back from his forehead with the other i must see your whole face she saidyour face will tell me yes you do mean it the world hasnt spoilt you yet do you believe in dreams  amelius looked at her startled by the sudden transition she deliberately repeated her question  i ask you seriously she said do you believe in dreams  amelius answered seriously on his side i cant honestly say that i do  ah she exclaimed like me i dont believe in dreams eitheri wish i did but its not in me to believe in superstitions im too hardand im sorry for it i have seen people who were comforted by their superstitions happy people possessed of faith dont you even believe that dreams are sometimes fulfilled by chance  nobody can deny that amelius replied the instances of it are too many but for one dream fulfilled by a coincidence there are  a hundred at least that are not fulfilled mrs farnaby interposed very well i calculate on that see how little hope can live on there is just the barest possibility that what i dreamed of you the other night may come to pass its a poor chance but it has encouraged me to take you into my confidence and ask you to help me  this strange confessionthis sad revelation of despair still unconsciously deceiving itself under the disguise of hopeonly strengthened the compassionate sympathy which amelius already felt for her what did you dream about me he asked gently  its nothing to tell she replied i was in a room that was quite strange to me and the door opened and you came in leading a young girl by the hand you said be happy at last here she is my heart knew her instantly though my eyes had never seen her since the first days of her life and i woke myself crying for joy wait its not all told yet i went to sleep again and dreamed it again and woke and lay awake for awhile and slept once more and dreamed it for the third time ah if i could only feel some peoples confidence in three times no it produced an impression on meand that was all i got as far as thinking to myself there is just a chance i havent a creature in the world to help me i may as well speak to him o you neednt remind me that there is a rational explanation of my dream i have read it all up in the encyclopaedia in the library one of the ideas of wise men is that we think of something consciously or unconsciously in the daytime and then reproduce it in a dream thats my case i daresay when you were first introduced to me and when i heard where you had been brought up i thought directly that she might have been one among the many forlorn creatures who had drifted to your community and that i might find her through you say that thought went to my bed with meand we have the explanation of my dream never mind there is my one poor chance in a hundred still left you will remember me amelius if you should meet with her wont you  the implied confession of her own intractable character without religious faith to ennoble it without even imagination to refine itthe unconscious disclosure of the one tender and loving instinct in her nature still piteously struggling for existence with no sympathy to sustain it with no light to guide itwould have touched the heart of any man not incurably depraved amelius spoke with the fervour of his young enthusiasm i would go to the uttermost ends of the earth if i thought i could do you any good but oh it sounds so hopeless  she shook her head and smiled faintly  dont say that you are free you have money you will travel about in the world and amuse yourself in a week you will see more than stayathome people see in a year how do we know what the future has in store for us i have my own idea she may be lost in the labyrinth of london or she may be hundreds of thousands of miles away amuse yourself ameliusamuse yourself tomorrow or ten years hence you might meet with her  in sheer mercy to the poor creature amelius refused to encourage her delusion even supposing such a thing could happen he objected how am i to know the lost girl you cant describe her to me you have not seen her since she was a child do you know anything of what happened at the timei mean at the time when she was lost  i know nothing  absolutely nothing  absolutely nothing  have you never felt a suspicion of how it happened  her face changed she frowned as she looked at him not till weeks and months had passed she said not till it was too late i was ill at the time when my mind got clear again i began to suspect one particular personlittle by little you know noticing trifles and thinking about them afterwards she stopped evidently restraining herself on the point of saying more  amelius tried to lead her on did you suspect the person he began  i suspected him of casting the child helpless on the world mrs farnaby interposed with a sudden burst of fury dont ask me any more about it or i shall break out and shock you she clenched her fists as she said the words its well for that man she muttered between her teeth that i have never got beyond suspecting and never found out the truth why did you turn my mind that way you shouldnt have done it help me back again to what we were saying a minute ago you made some objection you said  i said amelius reminded her that even if i did meet with the missing girl i couldnt possibly know it and i must say more than thati dont see how you yourself could be sure of recognizing her if she stood before you at this moment  he spoke very gently fearing to irritate her she showed no sign of irritationshe looked at him and listened to him attentively  are you setting a trap for me she asked no she cried before amelius could answer i am not mean enough to distrust youi forgot myself you have innocently said something that rankles in my mind i cant leave it where you have left it i dont like to be told that i shouldnt recognize her give me time to think i must clear this up  she consulted her own thoughts keeping her eyes fixed on amelius  i am going to speak plainly she announced with a sudden appearance of resolution listen to this when i banged to the door of that big cupboard of mine it was because i didnt want you to see something on the shelves did you see anything in spite of me  the question was not an easy one to answer amelius hesitated mrs farnaby insisted on a reply  did you see anything she reiterated  amelius owned that he had seen something  she turned away from him and looked into the fire her firm full tones sank so low when she spoke next that he could barely hear them  was it something belonging to a child  yes  was it a babys frock and cap answer me we have gone too far to go back i dont want apologies or explanationsi want yes or no  yes  there was an interval of silence she never moved she still looked into firelooked as if all her past life was pictured there in the burning coals  do you despise me she asked at last very quietly  as god hears me i am only sorry for you amelius answered  another woman would have melted into tears this woman still looked into the fireand that was all what a good fellow she said to herself what a good fellow he is  there was another pause she turned towards him again as abruptly as she had turned away  i had hoped to spare you and to spare myself she said if the miserable truth has come out it is through no curiosity of yours and god knows against every wish of mine i dont know if you really felt like a friend towards me beforeyou must be my friend now dont speak i know i can trust you one last word amelius about my lost child you doubt whether i should recognize her if she stood before me now that might be quite true if i had only my own poor hopes and anxieties to guide me but i have something else to guide meand after what has passed between us you may as well know what it is it might even by accident guide you dont alarm yourself its nothing distressing this time how can i explain it she went on pausing and speaking in some perplexity to herself it would be easier to show itand why not she addressed herself to amelius once more im a strange creature she resumed first i worry you about my own affairsthen i puzzle youthen i make you sorry for meand now would you think it i am going to amuse you amelius are you an admirer of pretty feet  amelius had heard of men in books who had found reason to doubt whether their own ears were not deceiving them for the first time he began to understand those men and to sympathize with them he admitted in a certain bewildered way that he was an admirer of pretty feetand waited for what was to come next  when a woman has a pretty hand mrs farnaby proceeded she is ready enough to show it when she goes out to a ball she favours you with a view of her bosom and a part of her back now tell me if there is no impropriety in a naked bosomwhere is the impropriety in a naked foot  amelius agreed like a man in a dream  where indeed he remarkedand waited again for what was to come next  look out of the window said mrs farnaby  amelius obeyed the window had been opened for a few inches at the top no doubt to ventilate the room the dull view of the courtyard was varied by the stables at the farther end and by the kitchen skylight rising in the middle of the open space as amelius looked out he observed that some person at that moment in the kitchen required apparently a large supply of fresh air the swinging window on the side of the skylight which was nearest to him was invisibly and noiselessly pulled open from below the similar window on the other side being already wide open also judging by appearance the inhabitants of the kitchen possessed a merit which is exceedingly rare among domestic servantsthey understood the laws of ventilation and appreciated the blessing of fresh air  that will do said mrs farnaby you can turn round now  amelius turned mrs farnabys boots and stockings were on the hearthrug and one of mrs farnabys feet was placed ready for inspection on the chair which he had just left look at my right foot first she said speaking gravely and composedly in her ordinary tone  it was well worth looking ata foot equally beautiful in form and in colour the instep arched and high the ankle at once delicate and strong the toes tinged with rosecolour at the tips in brief it was a foot to be photographed to be cast in plaster to be fondled and kissed amelius attempted to express his admiration but was not allowed to get beyond the first two or three words no mrs farnaby explained this is not vanitysimply information you have seen my right foot and you have noticed that there is nothing the matter with it very well now look at my left foot  she put her left foot up on the chair look between the third toe and the fourth she said  following his instructions amelius discovered that the beauty of the foot was spoilt in this case by a singular defect the two toes were bound together by a flexible web or membrane which held them to each other as high as the insertion of the nail on either side  do you wonder mrs farnaby asked why i show you the fault in my foot amelius my poor darling was born with my deformityand i want you to know exactly what it is because neither you nor i can say what reason for remembering it there may not be in the future she stopped as if to give him an opportunity of speaking a man shallow and flippant by nature might have seen the disclosure in a grotesque aspect amelius was sad and silent i like you better and better she went on you are not like the common run of men nine out of ten of them would have turned what i have just told you into a jokenine out of ten would have said am i to ask every girl i meet to show me her left foot you are above that you understand me have i no means of recognizing my own child now  she smiled and took her foot off the chairthen after a moments thought she pointed to it again  keep this as strictly secret as you keep everything else she said in the past days when i used to employ people privately to help me to find her it was my only defence against being imposed upon rogues and vagabonds thought of other marks and signsbut not one of them could guess at such a mark as that have you got your pocketbook amelius in case we are separated at some later time i want to write the name and address in it of a person whom we can trust i persist you see in providing for the future theres the one chance in a hundred that my dream may come trueand you have so many years before you and so many girls to meet with in that time  she handed back the pocketbook which amelius had given to her after having inscribed a mans name and address on one of the blank leaves  he was my fathers lawyer she explained and he and his son are both men to be trusted suppose i am ill for instanceno thats absurd i never had a days illness in my life suppose i am dead killed perhaps by some accident or perhaps by my own hand the lawyers have my written instructions in the case of my child being found then againi am such an unaccountable womani may go away somewhere all by myself never mind the lawyers shall have my address and my positive orders though they keep it a secret from all the world besides to tell it to you i dont ask your pardon amelius for troubling you the chances are so terribly against me it is all but impossible that i shall ever see youas i saw you in my dreamcoming into the room leading my girl by the hand odd isnt it this is how i veer about between hope and despair well it may amuse you to remember it one of these days years hence when i am at rest in mother earth and when you are a middle aged married man you may tell your wife how strangely you once became the forlorn hope of the most wretched woman that ever livedand you may say to each other as you sit by your snug fireside perhaps that poor lost daughter is still living somewhere and wondering who her mother was no i wont let you see the tears in my eyes againill let you go at last  she led the way to the doora creature to be pitied if ever there was a pitiable creature yet a woman whose whole nature was maternal who was nothing if not a mother and who had lived through sixteen years of barren life in the hopeless anticipation of recovering her lost child  goodbye and thank you she said i want to be left by myself my dear with that little frock and cap which you found out in spite of me go and tell my niece its all rightand dont be stupid enough to fall in love with a girl who has no love to give you in return she pushed amelius into the hall here he is regina she called out i have done with him  before amelius could speak she had shut herself into her room he advanced along the hall and met regina at the door of the diningroom    chapter 3  the young lady spoke first  mr goldenheart she said with the coldest possible politeness perhaps you will be good enough to explain what this means  she turned back into the diningroom amelius followed her in silence here i am in another scrape with a woman he thought to himself are men in general as unlucky as i am i wonder  you neednt close the door said regina maliciously everybody in the house is welcome to hear what i have to say to you  amelius made a mistake at the outsethe tried what a little humility would do to help him there is probably no instance on record in which humility on the part of a man has ever really found its way to the indulgence of an irritated woman the best and the worst of them alike have at least one virtue in commonthey secretly despise a man who is not bold enough to defend himself when they are angry with him  i hope i have not offended you amelius ventured to say  she tossed her head contemptuously oh dear no i am not offended only a little surprised at your being so very ready to oblige my aunt  in the short experience of her which had fallen to the lot of amelius she had never looked so charmingly as she looked now the nervous irritability under which she was suffering brightened her face with the animation which was wanting in it at ordinary times her soft brown eyes sparkled her smooth dusky cheeks glowed with a warm red flush her tall supple figure asserted its full dignity robed in a superb dress of silken purple and black lace which set off her personal attractions to the utmost advantage she not only roused the admiration of ameliusshe unconsciously gave him back the selfpossession which he had for the moment completely lost he was man enough to feel the humiliation of being despised by the one woman in the world whose love he longed to win and he answered with a sudden firmness of tone and look that startled her  you had better speak more plainly still miss regina he said you may as well blame me at once for the misfortune of being a man  she drew back a step i dont understand you she answered  do i owe no forbearance to a woman who asks a favour of me amelius went on if a man had asked me to steal into the house on tiptoe i should have saidwell i should have said something i had better not repeat if a man had stood between me and the door when you came back i should have taken him by the collar and pulled him out of my way could i do that if you please with mrs farnaby  regina saw the weak point of this defence with a womans quickness of perception i cant offer any opinion she said especially when you lay all the blame on my aunt  amelius opened his lips to protestand thought better of it he wisely went straight on with what he had still to say  if you will let me finish he resumed you will understand me a little better than that whatever blame there may be miss regina i am quite ready to take on myself i merely wanted to remind you that i was put in an awkward position and that i couldnt civilly find a way out of it as for your aunt i will only say this i know of hardly any sacrifice that i would not submit to if i could be of the smallest service to her after what i heard while i was in her room  regina interrupted him at that point i suppose its a secret between you she said  yes its a secret amelius proceeded as you say but one thing i may tell you without breaking my promise mrs farnaby haswell has filled me with kindly feeling towards her she has a claim poor soul to my truest sympathy and i shall remember her claim and i shall be faithful to what i feel towards her as long as i live  it was not very elegantly expressed but the tone was the tone of true feeling in his voice trembled his colour rose he stood before her speaking with perfect simplicity straight from his heartand the womans heart felt it instantly this was the man whose ridicule she had dreaded if her aunts rash confidence struck him in an absurd light she sat down in silence with a grave sad face reproaching herself for the wrong which her too ready distrust had inflicted on him longing to ask his pardon and yet hesitating to say the simple words  he approached her chair and placing his hand on the back of it said gently do you think a little better of me now  she had taken off her gloves she silently folded and refolded them in her lap  your good opinion is very precious to me amelius pleaded bending a little nearer to her i cant tell you how sorry i should be he stopped and put it more strongly i shall never have courage enough to enter the house again if i have made you think meanly of me  a woman who cared nothing for him would have easily answered this the calm heart of regina began to flutter something warned her not to trust herself to speak little as he suspected it amelius had troubled the tranquil temperament of this woman he had found his way to those secret reserves of tendernessplacid and deepof which she was hardly conscious herself until his influence had enlightened her she was afraid to look up at him her eyes would have told him the truth she lifted her long finely shaped dusky hand and offered it to him as the best answer that she could make  amelius took it looked at it and ventured on his first familiarity with herhe kissed it she only said dont very faintly  the queen would let me kiss her hand if i went to court amelius reminded her with a pleasant inner conviction of his wonderful readiness at finding an excuse  she smiled in spite of herself would the queen let you hold it she asked gently releasing her hand and looking at him as she drew it away the peace was made without another word of explanation amelius took a chair at her side im quite happy now you have forgiven me he said you dont know how i admire youand how anxious i am to please you if i only knew how  he drew his chair a little nearer his eyes told her plainly that his language would soon become warmer still if she gave him the smallest encouragement this was one reason for changing the subject but there was another reason more cogent still her first painful sense of having treated him unjustly had ceased to make itself keenly felt the lower emotions had their opportunity of asserting themselves curiosity irresistible curiosity took possession of her mind and urged her to penetrate the mystery of the interview between amelius and her aunt  will you think me very indiscreet she began slyly if i made a little confession to you  amelius was only too eager to hear the confession it would pave the way for something of the same sort on his part  i understand my aunt making the heat in the concertroom a pretence for taking you away with her regina proceeded but what astonishes me is that she should have admitted you to her confidence after so short an acquaintance you are stillwhat shall i sayyou are still a new friend of ours  how long will it be before i become an old friend amelius asked i mean he added with artful emphasis an old friend of yours  confused by the question regina passed it over without notice i am mrs farnabys adopted daughter she resumed i have been with her since i was a little girland yet she has never told me any of her secrets pray dont suppose that i am tempting you to break faith with my aunt i am quite incapable of such conduct as that  amelius saw his way to a thoroughly commonplace compliment which possessed the charm of complete novelty so far as his experience was concerned he would actually have told her that she was incapable of doing anything which was not perfectly becoming to a charming person if she had only given him time she was too eager in the pursuit of her own object to give him time i should like to know she went on whether my aunt has been influenced in any way by a dream that she had about you  amelius started has she told you of her dream he asked with some appearance of alarm  regina blushed and hesitated my room is next to my aunts she explained we keep the door between us open i am often in and out when she is disturbed in her sleep she was talking in her sleep and i heard your namenothing more perhaps i ought not to have mentioned it perhaps i ought not to expect you to answer me  there is no harm in my answering you said amelius the dream really had something to do with her trusting me you may not think quite so unfavourably of her conduct now you know that  it doesnt matter what i think regina replied constrainedly if my aunts secrets have interested youwhat right have i to object i am sure i shall say nothing though i am not in my aunts confidence nor in your confidence you will find i can keep a secret  she folded up her gloves for the twentieth time at least and gave amelius his opportunity of retiring by rising from her chair he made a last effort to recover the ground that he had lost without betraying mrs farnabys trust in him  i am sure you can keep a secret he said i should like to give you one of my secrets to keeponly i mustnt take the liberty i suppose just yet  she new perfectly well what he wanted to say her heart began to quicken its beat she was at a loss how to answer after an awkward silence she made an attempt to dismiss him dont let me detain you she said if you have any engagement  amelius silently looked round him for his hat on a table behind him a monthly magazine lay open exhibiting one of those melancholy modern illustrations which present the english art of our day in its laziest and lowest state of degradation a vacuous young giant in flowing trousers stood in a garden and stared at a plump young giantess with enormous eyes and rotund hips vacantly boring holes in the grass with the point of her parasol perfectly incapable of explaining itself this imbecile production put its trust in the printer whose charitable types helped it at the bottom of the page with the title of love at first sight on those remarkable words amelius seized with the desperation of the drowning man catching at the proverbial straw they offered him a chance of pleading his cause this time with a happy indirectness of allusion at which not even a young ladys susceptibility could take offence  do you believe in that he said pointing to the illustration  regina declined to understand him in what she asked  in love at first sight  it would be speaking with inexcusable rudeness to say plainly that she told him a lie let the milder form of expression be that she modestly concealed the truth i dont know anything about it she said  i do amelius remarked smartly  she persisted in looking at the illustration was there an infection of imbecility in that fatal work she was too simple to understand him even yet you dowhat she inquired innocently  i know what love at first sight is amelius burst out  regina turned over the leaves of the magazine ah she said you have read the story  i havent read the story amelius answered i know what i felt myselfon being introduced to a young lady  she looked up at him with a sly smile a young lady in america she asked  in england miss regina he tried to take her handbut she kept it out of his reach in london he went on drifting back into his customary plainness of speech in this very street he resumed seizing her hand before she was aware of him too much bewildered to know what else to do regina took refuge desperately in shaking hands with him goodbye mr goldenheart she saidand gave him his dismissal for the second time  amelius submitted to his fate there was something in her eyes which warned him that he had ventured far enough for that day  may i call again soon he asked piteously  no answered a voice at the door which they both recognizedthe voice of mrs farnaby  yes regina whispered to him as her aunt entered the room mrs farnabys interference following on the earlier events of the day had touched the young ladys usually placable temper in a tender placeand amelius reaped the benefit of it  mrs farnaby walked straight up to him put her hand in his arm and led him out into the hall  i had my suspicions she said and i find they have not misled me twice already i have warned you to let my niece alone for the third and last time i tell you that she is as cold as ice she will trifle with you as long as it flatters her vanity and she will throw you over as she has thrown other men over have your fling you foolish fellow before you marry anybody pay no more visits to this house unless they are visits to me i shall expect to hear from you she paused and pointed to a statue which was one of the ornaments in the hall look at that bronze woman with the clock in her hand thats regina be off with yougoodbye  amelius found himself in the street regina was looking out at the diningroom window he kissed his hand to her she smiled and bowed damn the other men amelius said to himself ill call on her tomorrow    chapter 4  returning to his hotel he found three letters waiting for him on the sittingroom table  the first letter that he opened was from his landlord and contained his bill for the past week as he looked at the sum total amelius presented to perfection the aspect of a serious young man he took pen ink and paper and made some elaborate calculations money that he had too generously lent or too freely given away appeared in his statement of expenses as well as money that he had spent on himself the result may be plainly stated in his own words goodbye to the hotel i must go into lodgings  having arrived at this wise decision he opened the second letter it proved to be written by the lawyers who had already communicated with him at tadmor on the subject of his inheritance   dear sir  the enclosed insufficiently addressed as you will perceive only reached us this day we beg to remain etc   amelius opened the letter enclosed and turned to the signature for information the name instantly took him back to the community the writer was mellicent  her letter began abruptly in these terms  do you remember what i said to you when we parted at tadmor i said be comforted amelius the end is not yet and i said again you will come back to me  i remind you of this my frienddirecting to your lawyers whose names i remember when their letter to you was publicly read in the common room once or twice a year i shall continue to remind you of those parting words of mine there will be a time perhaps when you will thank me for doing so  in the mean while light your pipe with my letters my letters dont matter if i can comfort you and reconcile you to your lifeyears hence when you too my amelius may be one of the fallen leaves like methen i shall not have lived and suffered in vain my last days on earth will be the happiest days that i have ever seen  be pleased not to answer these lines or any other written words of mine that may follow so long as you are prosperous and happy with that part of your life i have nothing to do you will find friends wherever you goamong the women especially your generous nature shows itself frankly in your face your manly gentleness and sweetness speak in every tone of your voice we poor women feel drawn towards you by an attraction which we are not able to resist have you fallen in love already with some beautiful english girl oh be careful and prudent be sure before you set your heart on her that she is worthy of you so many women are cruel and deceitful some of them will make you believe you have won their love when you have only flattered their vanity and some are poor weak creatures whose minds are set on their own interests and who may let bad advisers guide them when you are not by for your own sake take care  i am living with my sister at new york the days and weeks glide by me quietly you are in my thoughts and my prayers i have nothing to complain of i wait and hope when the time of my banishment from the community has expired i shall go back to tadmor and there you will find me amelius the first to welcome you when your spirits are sinking under the burden of life and your heart turns again to the friends of your early days  goodbye my deargoodbye   amelius laid the letter aside touched and saddened by the artless devotion to him which it expressed he was conscious also of a feeling of uneasy surprise when he read the lines which referred to his possible entanglement with some beautiful english girl here with widely different motives was mrs farnabys warning repeated by a stranger writing from another quarter of the globe it was an odd coincidence to say the least of it after thinking for a while he turned abruptly to the third letter that was waiting for him he was not at ease his mind felt the need of relief  the third letter was from rufus dingwell announcing the close of his tour in ireland and his intention of shortly joining amelius in london the excellent american expressed with his customary absence of reserve his fervent admiration of irish hospitality irish beauty and irish whisky green erin wants but one thing more rufus predicted to be a paradise on earthit wants the day to come when we shall send an american minister to the irish republic laughing over this quaint outbreak amelius turned from the first page to the second as his eyes fell on the next paragraph a sudden change passed over him he let the letter drop on the floor  one last word the american wrote about that nice long bright letter of yours i have read it with strict attention and thought over it considerably afterwards dont be riled friend amelius if i tell you in plain words that your account of the farnabys doesnt make me happyquite the contrary i do assure you my back is set up sir against that family you will do well to drop them and above all things mind what you are about with the brown miss who has found her way to your favourable opinion in such an almighty hurry do me a favour my good boy just wait till i have seen her will you  mrs farnaby mellicent rufusall three strangers to each other and all three agreed nevertheless in trying to part him from the beautiful young englishwoman i dont care amelius thought to himself they may say what they pleaseill marry regina if she will have me     book the fourth love and money    chapter 1  in an interval of no more than three weeks what events may not present themselves what changes may not take place behold amelius on the first drizzling day of november established in respectable lodgings at a moderate weekly rent he stands before his small fireside and warms his back with an englishmans severe sense of enjoyment the cheap lookingglass on the mantelpiece reflects the head and shoulders of a new amelius his habits are changed his social position is in course of development already he is a strict economist before long he expects to become a married man  it is good to be economical it is perhaps better still to be the accepted husband of a handsome young woman but for all that a man in a state of moral improvement with prospects which his less favoured fellow creatures may reasonably envy is still a man subject to the mischievous mercy of circumstances and capable of feeling it keenly the face of the new amelius wore an expression of anxiety and more remarkable yet the temper of the new amelius was out of order  for the first time in his life he found himself considering trivial questions of sixpences and small favours of discount for cash paymentsan irritating state of things in itself there were more serious anxieties however to trouble him than these he had no reason to complain of the beloved object herself not twelve hours since he had said to regina with a voice that faltered and a heart that beat wildly are you fond enough of me to let me marry you and she had answered placidly with a heart that would have satisfied the most exacting stethoscope in the medical profession yes if you like there was a moment of rapture when she submitted for the first time to be kissed and when she consented on being gently reminded that it was expected of her to return the kissonce and no more but there was also an attendant train of serious considerations which followed on the heels of amelius when the kissing was over and when he had said goodbye for the day  he had two women for enemies both resolutely against him in the matter of his marriage  reginas correspondent and bosom friend cecilia who had begun by disliking him without knowing why persisted in maintaining her unfavourable opinion of the new friend of the farnabys she was a young married woman and she had an influence over regina which promised when the fit opportunity came to make itself felt the second and by far the more powerful hostile influence was the influence of mrs farnaby nothing could exceed the half sisterly half motherly goodwill with which she received amelius on those rare occasions when they happened to meet unembarrassed by the presence of a third person in the room without actually reverting to what had passed between them during their memorable interview mrs farnaby asked questions plainly showing that the forlorn hope which she associated with amelius was a hope still firmly rooted in her mind have you been much about london lately have you met with any girls who have taken your fancy are you getting tired of staying in the same place and are you going to travel soon inquiries such as these she was sooner or later sure to make when they were alone but if regina happened to enter the room or if amelius contrived to find his way to her in some other part of the house mrs farnaby deliberately shortened the interview and silenced the loversstill as resolute as ever to keep amelius exposed to the adventurous freedom of a bachelors life for the last week his only opportunities of speaking to regina had been obtained for him secretly by the wellrewarded devotion of her maid and he had now the prospect before him of asking mr farnaby for the hand of his adopted daughter with the certainty of the influence of two women being used against himeven if he succeeded in obtaining a favourable reception for his proposal from the master of the house  under such circumstances as thesealone on a rainy november day in a lodging on the dreary eastward side of the tottenham court roadeven amelius bore the aspect of a melancholy man he was angry with his cigar because it refused to light freely he was angry with the poor deaf servantofallwork who entered the room after one thumping knock at the door and made in muffled tones the barbarous announcement heres somebody awantin to see yer  who the devil is somebody amelius shouted  somebody is a citizen of the united states answered rufus quietly entering the room and hes sorry to find claude a goldenhearts temperature at boilingpoint already  he had not altered in the slightest degree since he had left the steamship at queenstown irish hospitality had not fattened him the change from sea to land had not suggested to him the slightest alteration in his dress he still wore the huge felt hat in which he had first presented himself to notice on the deck of the vessel the maidofallwork raised her eyes to the face of the long lean stranger overshadowed by the broadbrimmed hat in reverent amazement my love to you miss said rufus with his customary grave cordiality ill shut the door having dismissed the maid with that gentle hint he shook hands heartily with amelius well i call this a juicy morning he said just as if they had met at the cabin breakfasttable as usual  for the moment at least amelius brightened at the sight of his fellowtraveller i am really glad to see you he said its lonely in these new quarters before one gets used to them  rufus relieved himself of his hat and great coat and silently looked about the room im big in the bones he remarked surveying the rickety lodginghouse furniture with some suspicion and im a trifle heavier than i look i shant break one of these chairs if i sit down on it shall i passing round the table littered with books and letters in search of the nearest chair he accidentally brushed against a sheet of paper with writing on it memorandum of friends in london to be informed of my change of address he read looking at the paper as he picked it up with the friendly freedom that characterized him you have made pretty good use of your time my son since i took my leave of you in queenstown harbour i call this a reasonable long list of acquaintances made by a young stranger in london  i met with an old friend of my family at the hotel amelius explained he was a great loss to my poor father when he got an appointment in india and now he has returned he has been equally kind to me i am indebted to his introduction for most of the names on that list  yes said rufus in the interrogative tone of a man who was waiting to hear more im listening though i may not look like it git along  amelius looked at his visitor wondering in what precise direction he was to git along  im no friend to partial information rufus proceeded i like to round it off complete as it were in my own mind there are names on this list that you havent accounted for yet who provided you sir with the balance of your new friends  amelius answered not very willingly i met them at mr farnabys house  rufus looked up from the list with the air of a man surprised by disagreeable information and unwilling to receive it too readily how he exclaimed using the old english equivalent often heard in america for the modern what  i met them at mr farnabys amelius repeated  did you happen to receive a letter of my writing dated dublin rufus asked  yes  do you set any particular value on my advice  certainly  and you cultivate social relations with farnaby and family notwithstanding  i have motives for being friendly with them whichwhich i havent had time to explain to you yet  rufus stretched out his long legs on the floor and fixed his shrewd grave eyes steadily on amelius  my friend he said quietly in respect of personal appearance and pleasing elasticity of spirits i find you altered for the worse i do it may be liver or it may be love i reckon now i think of it youre too young yet for liver its the brown missthats what tis i hate that girl sir by instinct  a nice way of talking of a young lady you never saw amelius broke out  rufus smiled grimly go ahead he said if you can get vent in quarrelling with me go ahead my son  he looked round the room again with his hands in his pockets whistling descending to the table in due course of time his quick eye detected a photograph placed on the open writing desk which amelius had been using earlier in the day before it was possible to stop him the photograph was in his hand i believe ive got her likeness he announced i do assure you i take pleasure in making her acquaintance in this sort of way well now i declare shes a columnar creature yes sir i do justice to your native produceyour fine fleshy beeffed english girl but i tell you this after a child or two that sort runs to fat and you find you have married more of her than you bargained for to what lengths may you have proceeded amelius with this splendid and spanking person  amelius was just on the verge of taking offence speak of her respectfully he said if you expect me to answer you  rufus stared in astonishment im paying her all manner of compliments he protested and youre not satisfied yet my friend i still find something about you on this occasion which reminds me of meat cut against the grain youre almost nastyyou are the air of london i reckon isnt at all the thing for you well it dont matter to me i like you afloat or ashore i like you do you want to know what i should do in your place if i found myself steering a little too nigh to the brown miss i shouldwell to put it in one word i should scatter wheres the harm ill ask you if you try another girl or two before you make your mind up i shall be proud to introduce you to our slim and snaky sort at coolspring yes i mean what i say and ill go back with you across the pond referring in this disrespectful manner to the atlantic ocean rufus offered his hand in token of unalterable devotion and goodwill  who could resist such a man as this amelius always in extremes wrung his hand with an impetuous sense of shame ive been sulky he said ive been rude i ought to be ashamed of myselfand i am theres only one excuse for me rufus i love her with all my heart and soul and im engaged to be married to her and yet if you understand my way of putting it imin short im in a mess  with this characteristic preface he described his position as exactly as he could having due regard to the necessary reserve on the subject of mrs farnaby rufus listened with the closest attention from beginning to end making no attempt to disguise the unfavourable impression which the announcement of the marriageengagement had made on him when he spoke next instead of looking at amelius as usual he held his head down and looked gloomily at his boots  well he said youve gone ahead this time and thats a fact she didnt raise any difficulties that a man could ride off ondid she  she was all that was sweet and kind amelius answered with enthusiasm  she was all that was sweet and kind rufus absently repeated still intent on the solid spectacle of his own boots and how about uncle farnaby perhaps hes sweet and kind likewise or perhaps he cuts up rough possibleis it not sir  i dont know i havent spoken to him yet  rufus suddenly looked up a faint gleam of hope irradiated his long lank face mercy be praised theres a last chance for you he remarked uncle farnaby may say no  it doesnt matter what he says amelius rejoined shes old enough to choose for herself he cant stop the marriage  rufus lifted one wiry yellow forefinger in a state of perpendicular protest he cannot stop the marriage the sagacious new englander admitted but he can stop the money my son find out how you stand with him before another day is over your head  i cant go to him this evening said amelius he dines out  where is he now  at his place of business  fix him at his place of business right away cried rufus springing with sudden energy to his feet  i dont think he would like it amelius objected hes not a very pleasant fellow anywhere but hes particularly disagreeable at his place of business  rufus walked to the window and looked out the objections to mr farnaby appeared to fail so far in interesting him  to put it plainly amelius went on theres something about him that i cant endure andthough hes very civil to me in his wayi dont think he has ever got over the discovery that i am a christian socialist  rufus abruptly turned round from the window and became attentive again so you told him thatdid you he said  of course amelius rejoined sharply do you suppose i am ashamed of the principles in which i have been brought up  you dont care i reckon if all the world knows your principles persisted rufus deliberately leading him on  care amelius reiterated i only wish i had all the world to listen to me they should hear of my principles with no bated breath i promise you  there was a pause rufus turned back again to the window when farnabys at home where does he live he asked suddenlystill keeping his face towards the street  amelius mentioned the address you dont mean that you are going to call there he inquired with some anxiety  well i reckoned i might catch him before dinnertime you seem to be sort of feared to speak to him yourself im your friend ameliusand ill speak for you  the bare idea of the interview struck amelius with terror no no he said im much obliged to you rufus but in a matter of this sort i shouldnt like to transfer the responsibility to my friend ill speak to mr farnaby in a day or two  rufus was evidently not satisfied with this i do suppose now he suggested youre not the only man moving in this metropolis who fancies miss regina query my son if you put off farnaby much longer he paused and looked at amelius ah he said i reckon i neednt enlarge further there is another man well its the same in my country i dont know what he does with you he always turns up with us just at the time when you least want to see him  there was another manan older and a richer man than amelius equally assiduous in his attentions to the aunt and to the niece submissively polite to his favoured young rival he was the sort of person in age and in temperament who would be perfectly capable of advancing his own interests by means of the hostile influence of mrs farnaby who could say what the result might be if by some unlucky accident he made the attempt before amelius had secured for himself the support of the master of the house in his present condition of nervous irritability he was ready to believe in any coincidence of the disastrous sort the wealthy rival was a man of business a near city neighbour of mr farnaby they might be together at that moment and reginas fidelity to her lover might be put to a harder test than she was prepared to endure amelius remembered the gentle conciliatory smile too gentle by half with which his placid mistress had received his first kissesand without stopping to weigh conclusions snatched up his hat wait here for me rufus like a good fellow im off to the stationers shop with those parting words he hurried out of the room  left by himself rufus began to rummage the pockets of his frockcoata long loose and dingy garment which had become friendly and comfortable to him by dint of ancient use producing a handful of correspondence he selected the largest envelope of all shook out on the table several smaller letters enclosed picked one out of the number and read the concluding paragraph only with the closest attention  i enclose letters of introduction to the secretaries of literary institutions in london and in some of the principal cities of england if you feel disposed to lecture yourself or if you can persuade friends and citizens known to you to do so i believe it may be in your power to advance in this way the interests of our bureau please take notice that the more advanced institutions which are ready to countenance and welcome free thought in religion politics and morals are marked on the envelopes with a cross in red ink the envelopes without a mark are addressed to platforms on which the customary british prejudices remain rampant and in which the charge for places reaches a higher figure than can be as yet obtained in the sanctuaries of free thought  rufus laid down the letter and choosing one among the envelopes marked in red ink looked at the introduction enclosed if the right sort of invitation reached amelius from this institution he thought the boy would lecture on christian socialism with all his heart and soul i wonder what the brown miss and her uncle would say to that  he smiled to himself and put the letter back in the envelope and considered the subject for a while below the odd rough surface he was a man in ten thousand no more singlehearted and more affectionate creature ever breathed the breath of life he had not been understood in his own little circle there had been a want of sympathy with him and even a want of knowledge of him at home amelius popular with everybody had touched the great heart of this man he perceived the peril that lay hidden under the strange and lonely position of his fellowvoyagerso innocent in the ways of the world so young and so easily impressed his fondness for amelius it is hardly too much to say was the fondness of a father for a son with a sigh he shook his head and gathered up his letters and put them back in his pockets no not yet he decided the poor boy really loves her and the girl may be good enough to make the happiness of his life he got up and walked about the room suddenly he stopped struck by a new idea why shouldnt i judge for myself he thought ive got the addressi reckon ill look in on the farnabys in a friendly way  he sat down at the desk and wrote a line in the event of amelius being the first to return to the lodgings   dear boy  i dont find her photograph tells me quite so much as i want to know i have a mind to see the living original being your friend you know its only civil to pay my respects to the family expect my unbiased opinion when i come back  yours  rufus   having enclosed and addressed these lines he took up his greatcoatand checked himself in the act of putting it on the brown miss was a british miss a strange new englander had better be careful of his personal appearance before he ventured into her presence urged by this cautious motive he approached the lookingglass and surveyed himself critically  i doubt i might be the better it occurred to him if i brushed my hair and smelt a little of perfume yes ill make a toilet wheres the boys bedroom i wonder  he observed a second door in the sittingroom and opened it at hazard fortune had befriended him so far he found himself in his young friends bedchamber  the toilet of amelius simple as it was had its mysteries for rufus he was at a loss among the perfumes they were all contained in a modest little dressing case without labels of any sort to describe the contents of the pots and bottles he examined them one after another and stopped at some recently invented french shavingcream it smells lovely he said assuming it to be some rare pomatum just what i want it seems for my head he rubbed the shaving cream into his bristly irongray hair until his arms ached when he had next sprinkled his handkerchief and himself profusely first with rose water and then to make quite sure with eaudecologne used as a climax he felt that he was in a position to appeal agreeably to the senses of the softer sex in five minutes more he was on his way to mr farnabys private residence    chapter 2  the rain that had begun with the morning still poured on steadily in the afternoon after one look out of the window regina decided on passing the rest of the day luxuriously in the company of a novel by her own fireside with her feet on the tender and her head on the soft cushion of her favourite easychair she opened the book having read the first chapter and part of the second she was just lazily turning over the leaves in search of a love scene when her languid interest in the novel was suddenly diverted to an incident in real life the sittingroom door was gently opened and her maid appeared in a state of modest confusion  if you please miss heres a strange gentleman who comes from mr goldenheart he wishes particularly to say  she paused and looked behind her a faint and curious smell of mingled soap and scent entered the room followed closely by a tall calm shabbilydressed man who laid a wiry yellow hand on the maids shoulder and stopped her effectually before she could say a word more  dont you think of troubling yourself to git through with it my dear im here and ill finish for you addressing the maid in these encouraging terms the stranger advanced to regina and actually attempted to shake hands with her regina roseand looked at him it was a look that ought to have daunted the boldest man living it produced no sort of effect on this man he still held out his hand his lean face broadened with a pleasant smile my name is rufus dingwell he said i come from coolspring mass and amelius is my introduction to yourself and family  regina silently acknowledged this information by a frigid bow and addressed herself to the maid waiting at the door dont leave the room phoebe  rufus inwardly wondering what phoebe was wanted for proceeded to express the cordial sentiments proper to the occasion i have heard about you miss and i take pleasure in making your acquaintance  the unwritten laws of politeness obliged regina to say something i have not heard mr goldenheart mention your name she remarked are you an old friend of his  rufus explained with genial alacrity we crossed the pond together miss i like the boy hes bright and spry he refreshes mehe does we go ahead with most things in my country and friendships one of them how do you find yourself wont you shake hands he took her hand without waiting to be repelled this time and shook it with the heartiest goodwill  regina shuddered faintly she summoned assistance in case of further familiarity phoebe tell my aunt  rufus added a message on his own account and say this my dear i sincerely desire to make the acquaintance of miss reginas aunt and any other members of the family circle  phoebe left the room smiling such an amusing visitor as this was a rare person in mr farnabys house rufus looked after her with unconcealed approval the maid appeared to be more to his taste than the mistress well thats a pretty creature i do declare he said to regina reminds me of our american girlsslim in the waist and carries her head nicely how old may she be now  regina expressed her opinion of this familiar question by pointing with silent dignity to a chair  thank you miss not that one said rufus you see im long in the legs and if i once got down as low as that i reckon i should have to restore the balance by putting my feet up on the grate and thats not manners in great britainand quite right too  he picked out the highest chair he could find and admired the workmanship as he drew it up to the fireplace most sumptuous and elegant he said the style of the renaysance as they call it regina observed with dismay that he had not got his hat in his hand like other visitors he had left it no doubt in the hall he looked as if he had dropped in to spend the day and stay to dinner  well miss ive seen your photograph he resumed and i dont much approve of it now i see you my sentiments are not altogether favourable to that art i delivered a lecture on photographic portraiture at coolspring and i described it briefly as justice without mercy the audience took the idea they larfed they did larfin reminds me of amelius do you object to his being a christian socialist miss  the young ladys look when she answered the question was not lost on rufus he registered it mentally in case of need amelius will soon get over all that nonsense she said when he has been a little longer in london  possible rufus admitted the boy is fond of you yes he loves you i have noticed him and i can certify to that i may also remark that he wants a deal of love in return no doubt miss you have observed that circumstance yourself  regina resented this last inquiry as an outrage on propriety what next will he say she thought to herself i must put this presuming man in his proper place she darted another annihilating look at him as she spoke in her turn may i ask mrmr  dingwell said rufus prompting her  may i ask mr dingwell if you have favoured me by calling here at the request of mr goldenheart  genial and simpleminded as he was eagerly as he desired to appreciate at her full value the young lady who was one day to be the wife of amelius rufus felt the tone in which those words were spoken it was not easy to stimulate his modest sense of what was fairly due to him into asserting itself but the cold distrust the deliberate distance of reginas manner exhausted the longsuffering indulgence of this singularly patient man the lord in his mercy preserve amelius from marrying you he thought as he rose from his chair and advanced with a certain simple dignity to take leave of her  it did not occur to me miss to pay my respects to you till amelius and i had parted company he said please to excuse me i should have been welcome in my country with no better introduction than being as i may say his friend and wellwisher if i have made a mistake  he stopped regina had suddenly changed colour instead of looking at him she was looking over his shoulder apparently at something behind him he turned to see what it was a lady short and stout with strange wild sorrowful eyes had noiselessly entered the room while he was speaking she was waiting as it seemed until he had finished what he had to say when they confronted each other she moved to meet him with a firm heavy step and with her hand held out in token of welcome  you may feel equally sure sir of a friendly reception here she said in her steady selfpossessed way i am this young ladys aunt and i am glad to see the friend of amelius in my house before rufus could answer she turned to regina i waited she went on to give you an opportunity of explaining yourself to this gentleman i am afraid he has mistaken your coldness of manner for intentional rudeness  the colour rushed back into reginas faceshe vibrated for a moment between anger and tears but the better nature in her broke its way through the constitutional shyness and restraint which habitually kept it down i meant no harm sir she said raising her large beautiful eyes submissively to rufus i am not used to receiving strangers and you did ask me some very strange questions she added with a sudden burst of selfassertion strangers are not in the habit of saying such things in england she looked at mrs farnaby listening with impenetrable composure and stopped in confusion her aunt would not scruple to speak to the stranger about amelius in her presencethere was no knowing what she might not have to endure she turned again to rufus excuse me she said if i leave you with my aunti have an engagement with that trivial apology she made her escape from the room  she has no engagement mrs farnaby briefly remarked as the door closed sit down sir  for once even rufus was not as his ease i can hit it off maam with most people he said i wonder what ive done to offend your niece  my niece with many good qualities is a narrowminded young woman mrs farnaby explained you are not like the men she is accustomed to see she doesnt understand youyou are not a commonplace gentleman for instance mrs farnaby continued with the matteroffact gravity of a woman innately inaccessible to a sense of humour you have got something strange on your hair it seems to be melting and it smells like soap no its no use taking out your handkerchiefyour handkerchief wont mop it up ill get a towel she opened an inner door which disclosed a little passage and a bathroom beyond it im the strongest person in the house she resumed returning with a towel in her hand as gravely as ever sit still and dont make apologies if any of us can rub you dry im the woman she set to work with the towel as if she had been rufuss mother making him presentable in the days of his boyhood giddy under the violence of the rubbing staggered by the contrast between the cold reception accorded to him by the niece and the more than friendly welcome offered by the aunt rufus submitted to circumstances in docile and silent bewilderment there youll do till you get homenobody can laugh at you now mrs farnaby announced youre an absentminded man i suppose you wanted to wash your head and you forgot the warm water and the towel was that how it happened sir  i thank you with all my heart maam i took it for pomatum rufus answered would you object to shaking hands again this cordial welcome of yours reminds me i do assure you of home since i left new england ive never met with the like of you i do suppose now it was my hair that set miss reginas back up im not quite easy in my mind maam about your niece im sort of feared of what she may say of me to amelius i meant no harm lord knows  the secret of mrs farnabys extraordinary alacrity in the use of the towel began slowly to show itself now the tone of her american guest had already become the friendly and familiar tone which it had been her object to establish with a little management he might be made an invaluable ally in the great work of hindering the marriage of amelius  you are very fond of your young friend she began quietly  that is so maam  and he has told you that he has taken a liking to my niece  and shown me her likeness rufus added  and shown you her likeness and you thought you would come here and see for yourself what sort of girl she was  naturally rufus admitted  mrs farnaby revealed without further hesitation the object that she had in view amelius is little more than a lad still she said he has got all his life before him it would be a sad thing if he married a girl who didnt make him happy she turned in her chair and pointed to the door by which regina had left them between ourselves she resumed dropping her voice to a whisper do you believe my niece will make him happy  rufus hesitated  im above family prejudices mrs farnaby proceeded you neednt be afraid of offending me speak out  rufus would have spoken out to any other woman in the universe this woman had preserved him from ridiculethis woman had rubbed his head dry he prevaricated  i dont suppose i understand the ladies in this country he said  but mrs farnaby was not to be trifled with if amelius was your son and if he asked you to consent to his marriage with my niece she rejoined would you say yes  this was too much for rufus not if he went down on both his knees to ask me he answered  mrs farnaby was satisfied at last and owned it without reserve my own opinion she said exactly expressed dont be surprised didnt i tell you i had no family prejudices do you know if he has spoken to my husband yet  rufus looked at his watch i reckon hes just about done it by this time  mrs farnaby paused and reflected for a moment she had already attempted to prejudice her husband against amelius and had received an answer which mr farnaby considered to be final mr goldenheart honours us if he seeks our alliance he is the representative of an old english family under these circumstances it was quite possible that the proposals of amelius had been accepted mrs farnaby was not the less determined that the marriage should never take place and not the less eager to secure the assistance of her new ally when will amelius tell you about it she asked  when i go back to his lodgings maam  go back at onceand bear this in mind as you go if you can find out any likely way of parting these two young people in their own best interests depend on one thingif i can help you i will im as fond of amelius as you are ask him if i havent done my best to keep him away from my niece ask him if i havent expressed my opinion that shes not the right wife for him come and see me again as soon as you like im fond of americans good morning  rufus attempted to express his sense of gratitude in his own briefly eloquent way he was not allowed a hearing with one and the same action mrs farnaby patted him on the shoulder and pushed him out of the room  if that woman was an american citizen rufus reflected on his way through the streets shed be the first female president of the united states his admiration of mrs farnabys energy and resolution expressed in these strong terms acknowledged but one limit highly as he approved of her there was nevertheless an unfathomable something in the womans eyes that disturbed and daunted him     chapter 3  rufus found his friend at the lodgings prostrate on the sofa smoking furiously before a word had passed between them it was plain to the new englander that something had gone wrong  well he asked and what does farnaby say  damn farnaby  rufus was secretly conscious of an immense sense of relief i call that a stiff way of putting it he quietly remarked but the meanings clear farnaby has said no  amelius jumped off the sofa and planted himself defiantly on the hearthrug  youre wrong for once he said with a bitter laugh the exasperating part of it is that farnaby has said neither yes nor no the oilywhiskered bruteyou havent seen him yet have youbegan by saying yes a man like me the heir of a fine old english family honoured him by making proposals he could wish no more brilliant prospect for his dear adopted child she would fill the high position that was offered to her and fill it worthily that was the fawning way in which he talked to me at first he squeezed my hand in his horrid cold shiny paw till i give you my word of honour i felt as if i was going to be sick wait a little you havent heard the worst of it yet he soon altered his toneit began with his asking me if i had considered the question of settlements i didnt know what he meant he had to put it in plain english he wanted to hear what my property was oh thats soon settled i said ive got five hundred a year and regina is welcome to every farthing of it he fell back in his chair as if i had shot him he turnedit was worse than pale he positively turned green at first he wouldnt believe me he declared i must be joking i set him right about that immediately his next change was a proud impudence have you not observed sir in what style regina is accustomed to live in my house five hundred a year good heavens with strict economy five hundred a year might pay her milliners bill and the keep of her horse and carriage who is to pay for everything elsethe establishment the dinnerparties and balls the tour abroad the children the nurses the doctor i tell you this mr goldenheart im willing to make a sacrifice to you as a born gentleman which i would certainly not consent to in the case of any selfmade man enlarge your income sir to no more than four times five hundred pounds and i guarantee a yearly allowance to regina of half as much again besides the fortune which she will inherit at my death that will make your income three thousand a year to start with i know something of domestic expenses and i tell you positively you cant do it on a farthing less that was his language rufus the insolence of his tone i cant attempt to describe if i hadnt thought of regina i should have behaved in a manner unworthy of a christiani believe i should have taken my walkingcane and given him a sound thrashing  rufus neither expressed surprise nor offered advice he was lost in meditation on the wealth of mr farnaby a stationers business seems to eventuate in a lively profit in this country he said  a stationers business amelius repeated disdainfully farnaby has half a dozen irons in the fire besides that hes got a newspaper and a patent medicine and a new bank and i dont know what else one of his own friends said to me nobody knows whether farnaby is rich or poor he is going to do one of two thingshe is going to die worth millions or to die bankrupt oh if i can only live to see the day when socialism will put that sort of man in his right place  try a republic on our model first said rufus when farnaby talks of the style his young woman is accustomed to live in what does he mean  he means amelius answered smartly a carriage to drive out in champagne on the table and a footman to answer the door  farnabys ideas sir have crossed the water and landed in new york rufus remarked well and what did you say to him on your side  i gave it to him i can tell you thats all ostentation i said why cant regina and i begin life modestly what do we want with a carriage to drive out in and champagne on the table and a footman to answer the door we want to love each other and be happy there are thousands of as good gentlemen as i am in england with wives and families who would ask for nothing better than an income of five hundred a year the fact is mr farnaby youre positively saturated with the love of money get your new testament and read what christ says of rich people what do you think he did when i put it in that unanswerable way he held up his hand and looked horrified i cant allow profanity in my office says he i have my new testament read to me in church sir every sunday thats the sort of christian rufus who is the average product of modern times he was as obstinate as a mule he wouldnt give way a single inch his adopted daughter he said was accustomed to live in a certain style in that same style she should live when she was married so long as he had a voice in the matter of course if she chose to set his wishes and feelings at defiance in return for all that he had done for her she was old enough to take her own way in that case he would tell me as plainly as he meant to tell her that she must not look to a single farthing of his money to help her and not expect to find her name down in his will he felt the honour of a family alliance with me as sincerely as ever but he must abide by the conditions that he had stated on those terms he would be proud to give me the hand of regina at the altar and proud to feel that he had done his duty by his adopted child i let him go on till he had run himself outand then i asked quietly if he could tell me the way to increase my income to two thousand a year how do you think he answered me  perhaps he offered to utilise your capital in his business rufus guessed  not he he considered business quite beneath me my duty to myself as a gentleman was to adopt a profession on reflection it turned out that there was but one likely profession to try in my casethe law i might be called to the bar and with luck i might get remunerative work to do in eight or ten years time that i declare to you was the prospect he set before me if i chose to take his advice i asked if he was joking certainly not i was only oneandtwenty years old he reminded me i had plenty of time to sparei should still marry young if i married at thirty i took up my hat and gave him a bit of my mind at parting if you really mean anything i said you mean that regina is to pine and fade and be a middleaged woman and that i am to resist the temptations that beset a young man in london and lead the life of a monk for the next ten yearsand all for what for a carriage to ride out in champagne on the table and a footman to answer the door keep your money mr farnaby regina and i will do without itwhat are you laughing at i dont think you could have put it more strongly yourself  rufus suddenly recovered his gravity i tell you this amelius he replied you afford as we say in my country meaty fruit for reflectionyou do  what do you mean by that  well i reckon you remember when we were aboard the boat you gave us a narrative of what happened in that community of yours which i can truly characterise as a combination of native eloquence and chastening good sense i put the question to myself sir what has become of that wellinformed and discreet young christian now he has changed the sphere to england and mixed with the farnabys its not to be denied that i see him before me in the flesh when i look across the table here but its equally true that i miss him altogether in the spirit  amelius sat down again on the sofa in plain words he said you think i have behaved like a fool in this matter  rufus crossed his long legs and nodded his head in silent approval instead of taking offence amelius considered a little  it didnt strike me before he said but now you mention it i can understand that i appear to be a simple sort of fellow in what is called society here and the reason i suspect is that its not the society in which i have been accustomed to mix the farnabys are new to me rufus when it comes to a question of my life at tadmor of what i saw and learnt and felt in the communitythen i can think and speak like a reasonable being because i am thinking and speaking of what i know thoroughly well hang it make some allowance for the difference of circumstances besides im in love and that alters a manand i have heard some people say not always for the better anyhow ive done it with farnaby and it cant be undone there will be no peace for me now till i have spoken to regina i have read the note you left for me did you see her when you called at the house  the quiet tone in which the question was put surprised rufus he had fully expected after reginas reception of him to be called to account for the liberty that he had taken amelius was too completely absorbed by his present anxieties to consider trivial questions of etiquette hearing that rufus had seen regina he never even asked for his friends opinion of her his mind was full of the obstacles that might be interposed to his seeing her again  farnaby is sure after what has passed between us to keep her out of my way if he can amelius said and mrs farnaby to my certain knowledge will help him they dont suspect you couldnt you call againyoure old enough to be her fatherand make some excuse to take her out with you for a walk  the answer of rufus to this was roman in its brevity he pointed to the window and said look at the rain  then i must try her maid once more said amelius resignedly he took his hat and umbrella dont leave me old fellow he resumed as he opened the door this is the turningpoint of my life im sorely in need of a friend  do you think she will marry you against the will of her uncle and aunt rufus asked  i am certain of it amelius answered with that he left the room  rufus looked after him sadly sympathy and sorrow were expressed in every line of his rugged face my poor boy how will he bear it if she says no what will become of him if she says yes he rubbed his hand irritably across his forehead like a man whose own thoughts were repellent to him in a moment more he plunged into his pockets and drew out again the letters introducing him to the secretaries of public institutions if theres salvation for amelius he said i reckon i shall find it here    chapter 4  the medium of correspondence between amelius and reginas maid was an old woman who kept a shop for the sale of newspapers and periodicals in a bystreet not far from mr farnabys house from this place his letters were delivered to the maid under cover of the morning newspapersand here he found the answers waiting for him later in the day if rufus could only have taken her out for a walk i might have seen regina this afternoon thought amelius as it is i may have to wait till tomorrow or later still and then theres the sovereign to phoebe he sighed as he thought of the fee sovereigns were becoming scarce in our young socialists purse  arriving in sight of the newsvendors shop amelius noticed a man leaving it who walked away towards the farther end of the street when he entered the shop himself a minute afterwards the woman took up a letter from the counter a young man has just left this for you she said  amelius recognised the maids handwriting on the address the man whom he had seen leaving the shop was phoebes messenger  he opened the letter her mistress phoebe explained was too much flurried to be able to write the master had astonished the whole household by appearing among them at least three hours before the time at which he was accustomed to leave his place of business he had found mrs ormond otherwise reginas friend and correspondent cecilia paying a visit to his niece and had asked to speak with her in private before she took leave the result was an invitation to regina from mrs ormond to stay for a little while at her house in the neighbourhood of harrow the ladies were to leave london together in mrs ormonds carriage that afternoon under stress of strong persuasion on the part of her uncle and aunt as well as her friend regina had ended in giving way but she had not forgotten the interests of amelius she was willing to see him privately on the next day provided he left london by the train which reached harrow soon after eleven in the forenoon if it happened to rain then he must put off his journey until the first fine day arriving in any case at the same hour the place at which he was to wait was described to him and with these instructions the letter ended  the rapidity with which mr farnaby had carried out his resolution to separate the lovers placed the weakness of reginas character before amelius in a new and startling light why had she not stood on her privileges as a woman who had arrived at years of discretion and refused to leave london until she had first heard what her lover had to say amelius had left his american friend feeling sure that reginas decision would be in his favour when she was called upon to choose between the man who was ready to marry her and the man who was nothing but her uncle by courtesy for the first time he now felt that his own confident anticipations might by bare possibility deceive him he returned to his lodgings in such a state of depression that compassionate rufus insisted on taking him out to dinner and hurried him off afterwards to the play thoroughly prostrated amelius submitted to the genial influence of his friend he had not even energy enough to feel surprised when rufus stopped on their way to the tavern at a dingy building adorned with a grecian portico and left a letter and a card in charge of a servant at the sidedoor  the next day by a happy interposition of fortune proved to be a day without rain amelius followed his instructions to the letter a little watery sunshine showed itself as he left the station at harrow his mind was still in such a state of doubt and disturbance that it drew from superstition a faint encouragement to hope he hailed the feeble november sunlight as a good omen  mr and mrs ormonds place of residence stood alone surrounded by its own grounds a wooden fence separated the property on one side from a muddy little byroad leading to a neighbouring farm at a wicketgate in this fence giving admission to a shrubbery situated at some distance from the house amelius now waited for the appearance of the maid  after a delay of a few minutes only the faithful phoebe approached the gate with a key in her hand where is she amelius asked as the girl opened the gate for him  waiting for you in the shrubbery stop sir i have something to say to you first  amelius took out his purse and produced the fee even he had observed that phoebe was perhaps a little too eager to get her money  thank you sir please to look at your watch you mustnt be with miss regina a moment longer than a quarter of an hour  why not  this is the time sir when mrs ormond is engaged every day with her cook and housekeeper in a quarter of an hour the orders will be givenand mrs ormond will join miss regina for a walk in the grounds you will be the ruin of me sir if she finds you here with that warning the maid led the way along the winding paths of the shrubbery  i must thank you for your letter phoebe said amelius as he followed her bytheby who was your messenger  phoebes answer was no answer at all only a young man sir she said  in plain words your sweetheart i suppose  phoebes expressive silence was her only reply she turned a corner and pointed to her mistress standing alone before the entrance of a damp and deserted summerhouse  regina put her handkerchief to her eyes when the maid had discreetly retired oh she said softly i am afraid this is very wrong  amelius removed the handkerchief by the exercise of a little gentle force and administered comfort under the form of a kiss having opened the proceedings in this way he put his first question why did you leave london  how could i help it said regina feebly they were all against me what else could i do  it occurred to amelius that she might at her age have asserted a will of her own he kept his idea however to himself and giving her his arm led her slowly along the path of the shrubbery you have heard i suppose what mr farnaby expects of me he said  yes dear  i call it worse than mercenaryi call it downright brutal  oh amelius dont talk so  amelius came suddenly to a standstill does that mean you agree with him he asked  dont be angry with me dear i only meant there was some excuse for him  what excuse  well you see he has a high idea of your family and he thought you were rich people andi know you didnt mean it ameliusbut still you did disappoint him  amelius dropped her arm this mildlypersistent defence of mr farnaby exasperated him  perhaps i have disappointed you he said   oh no no oh how cruel you are the ready tears showed themselves again in her magnificent eyesgentle considerate tears that raised no storm in her bosom and produced no unbecoming results in her face dont be hard on me she said appealing to him helplessly like a charming overgrown child  some men might have still resisted her but amelius was not one of them he took her hand and pressed it tenderly  regina he said do you love me  you know i do  he put his arm round her waist he concentrated the passion that was in him into a look and poured the look into her eyes do you love me as dearly as i love you he whispered  she felt it with all the little passion that was in her after a moment of hesitation she put one arm timidly round his neck and bending her grand head laid it on his bosom her finelyrounded supple muscular figure trembled as if she had been the most fragile woman living dear amelius she murmured inaudibly he tried to speak to herhis voice failed him she had in perfect innocence fired his young blood he drew her closer and closer to him he lifted her head with a masterful resolution which she was not able to resist and pressed his kisses in hot and breathless succession on her lips his vehemence frightened her she tore herself out of his arms with a sudden exertion of strength that took him completely by surprise i didnt think you would have been rude to me with that mild reproach she turned away and took the path which led from the shrubbery to the house amelius followed her entreating that she would accept his excuses and grant him a few minutes more he modestly laid all the blame on her beautylamented that he had not resolution enough to resist the charm of it when did that commonplace compliment ever fail to produce its effect regina smiled with the weakly complacent goodnature which was only saved from being contemptible by its association with her personal attractions will you promise to behave she stipulated and amelius not very eagerly promised  shall we go into the summerhouse he suggested  its very damp at this time of year regina answered with placid good sense perhaps we might catch coldwe had better walk about  they walked accordingly i wanted to speak to you about our marriage amelius resumed  she sighed softly we have some time to wait she said before we can think of that  he passed this reply over without notice you know he went on that i have an income of five hundred a year  yes dear  there are hundreds of thousands of respectable artisans regina with large families who live comfortably on less than half my income  do they dear  and many gentlemen are not better off curates for instance do you see what i am coming to my darling  no dear  could you live with me in a cottage in the country with a nice garden and one little maid to wait on us and two or three new dresses in a year  regina lifted her fine eyes in sober ecstasy to the sky it sounds very tempting she remarked in the sweetest tones of her voice  and it could all be done amelius proceeded on five hundred a year  could it dear  i have calculated itallowing the necessary marginand i am sure of what i say and i have done something else i have asked about the marriage license i can easily find lodgings in the neighbourhood we might be married at harrow in a fortnight  regina started her eyes opened widely and rested on amelius with an expression of incredulous wonder married in a fortnight she repeated what would my uncle and aunt say  my angel our happiness doesnt depend on your uncle and auntour happiness depends on ourselves nobody has any power to control us i am a man and you are a woman and we have a right to be married whenever we like amelius pronounced this last oracular sentence with his head held high and a pleasant inner persuasion of the convincing manner in which he had stated his case  without my uncle to give me away regina exclaimed without my aunt with no bridesmaids and no friends and no weddingbreakfast oh amelius what can you be thinking of she drew back a step and looked at him in helpless consternation  for the moment and the moment only amelius lost all patience with her if you really loved me he said bitterly you wouldnt think of the bridesmaids and the breakfast regina had her answer ready in her pocketshe took out her handkerchief before she could lift it to her eyes amelius recovered himself no no he said i didnt mean thati am sure you love metake my arm again do you know regina i doubt whether your uncle has told you everything that passed between us are you really aware of the hard terms that he insists on he expects me to increase my five hundred a year to two thousand before he will sanction our marriage  yes dear he told me that  i have as much chance of earning fifteen hundred a year regina as i have of being made king of england did he tell you that  he doesnt agree with you dearhe thinks you might earn it with your abilities in ten years  this time it was the turn of amelius to look at regina in helpless consternation ten years he repeated do you coolly contemplate waiting ten years before we are married good heavens is it possible that you are thinking of the money that you cant live without carriages and footmen and ostentation and grandeur  he stopped for once even regina showed that she had spirit enough to be angry you ought to be ashamed of yourself to speak to me in that way she broke out indignantly if you have no better opinion of me than that i wont marry you at allno not if you had fifty thousand a year sir tomorrow am i to have no sense of duty to my uncleto the good man who has been a second father to me do you think i am ungrateful enough to set his wishes at defiance oh yes i know you dont like him i know that a great many people dont like him that doesnt make any difference to me but for dear uncle farnaby i might have gone to the workhouse i might have been a starving needlewoman a poor persecuted maidofallwork am i to forget that because you have no patience and only think of yourself oh i wish i had never met with you i wish i had never been fool enough to be as fond of you as i am with that confession she turned her back on him and took refuge in her handkerchief once more  amelius stood looking at her in silent despair after the tone in which she had spoken of her obligations to her uncle it was useless to anticipate any satisfactory result from the exertion of his influence over regina recalling what he had seen and heard in mrs farnabys room amelius could not doubt that the motive of pacifying his wife was the motive which had first led farnaby to receive regina into his house was it unreasonable or unjust to infer that the orphan child must have been mainly indebted to mrs farnabys sense of duty to the memory of her sister for the parental protection afforded to her from that time forth it would have been useless and worse than useless to place before regina such considerations as these her exaggerated idea of the gratitude that she owed to her uncle was beyond the limited reach of reason nothing was to be gained by opposition and no sensible course was left but to say some peacemaking words and submit  i beg your pardon regina if i have offended you you have sadly disappointed me i havent deliberately misjudged you i can say no more  she turned round quickly and looked at him there was an ominous change to resignation in his voice there was a dogged submission in his manner that alarmed her she had never yet seen him under the perilouslypatient aspect in which he now presented himself after his apology had been made  i forgive you amelius with all my heart she saidand timidly held out her hand  he took it raised it silently to his lips and dropped it again  she suddenly turned pale all the love that she had in her to give to a man she had given to amelius her heart sank she asked herself in blank terror if she had lost him  i am afraid it is i who have offended you she said dont be angry with me amelius dont make me more unhappy than i am  i am not in the least angry he answered still in the quiet subdued way that terrified her you cant expect me regina to contemplate a ten years engagement cheerfully  she took his hand and held it in both her own handsheld it as if his love for her was there and she was determined not to let it go  if you will only leave it to me she pleaded the engagement shant be so long as that try my uncle with a little kindness and respect amelius instead of saying hard words to him or let me try him if you are too proud to give way may i say that you had no intention of offending him and that you are willing to leave the future to me  certainly said amelius if you think it will be of the slightest use his tone added plainly i dont believe in your uncle mind as you do  she still persisted it will be of the greatest use she went on he will let me go home again and he will not object to your coming to see me he doesnt like to be despised and set at defiancewho does be patient amelius and i will persuade him to expect less money from youonly what you may earn dear with your talents long before ten years have passed she waited for a word of reply which might show that she had encouraged him a little he only smiled you talk of loving me she said drawing back from him with a look of reproach and you dont even believe what i say to you she stopped and looked behind her with a faint cry of alarm hurried footsteps were audible on the other side of the evergreens that screened them amelius stepped back to a turn in the path and discovered phoebe  dont stay a moment longer sir cried the girl ive been to the houseand mrs ormond isnt thereand nobody knows where she is get out by the gate sir while you have the chance  amelius returned to regina i mustnt get the girl into a scrape he said you know where to write to me goodbye  regina made a sign to the maid to retire amelius had never taken leave of her as he was taking leave of her now she forgot the fervent embrace and the daring kissesshe was desperate at the bare idea of losing him oh amelius dont doubt that i love you say you believe i love you kiss me before you go  he kissed herbut ah not as he had kissed her before he said the words she wanted him to saybut only to please her not with all his heart she let him go reproaches would be wasted at that moment  phoebe found her pale and immovable rooted to the spot on which they had parted dear dear me miss whats gone wrong  and her mistress answered wildly in words that had never before passed her placid lips o phoebe i wish i was dead   such was the impression left on the mind of regina by the interview in the shrubbery  the impression left on the mind of amelius was stated in equally strong language later in the day his american friend asked innocently for news and was answered in these terms  find something to occupy my mind rufus or i shall throw the whole thing over and go to the devil  the wise man from new england was too wise to trouble amelius with questions under these circumstances is that so was all he said then he put his hand in his pocket and producing a letter laid it quietly on the table  for me amelius asked  you wanted something to occupy your mind the wily rufus answered there tis  amelius read the letter it was dated hampden institution the secretary invited amelius in highly complimentary terms to lecture in the hall of the institution on christian socialism as taught and practised in the community at tadmor he was offered twothirds of the profits derived from the sale of places and was left free to appoint his own evening at a weeks notice and to issue his own advertisements minor details were reserved to be discussed with the secretary when the lecturer had consented to the arrangement proposed to him  having finished the letter amelius looked at his friend this is your doing he said  rufus admitted it with his customary candour he had a letter of introduction to the secretary and he had called by appointment that morning the institution wanted something new to attract the members and the public having no present intention of lecturing himself he had thought of amelius and had spoken his thought i mentioned rufus added slyly that i didnt reckon you would mount the platform but hes a sanguine creature that secretaryand he said hed try  why should i say no amelius asked a little irritably the secretary pays me a compliment and offers me an opportunity of spreading our principles perhaps he added more quietly after a moments reflection you thought i might not be equal to the occasionand in that case i dont say you were wrong  rufus shook his head if you had passed your life in this decrepit little island he replied i might have doubted you likely enough but tadmors situated in the united states if they dont practise the boys in the art of orating dont you tell me theres an american citizen with a voice in that society guess again my son you wont well then twas uncle farnaby i had in my mind i said to myselfnot to the secretaryamelius is bound to consider uncle farnaby oh my what would uncle farnaby say  the hot temper of amelius took fire instantly what the devil do i care for farnabys opinions he burst out if theres a man in england who wants the principles of christian socialism beaten into his thick head its farnaby are you going to see the secretary again  i might look in rufus answered in the course of the evening  tell him ill give the lecturewith my compliments and thanks if i can only succeed pursued amelius hearing himself with the new idea i may make a name as a lecturer and a name means money and money means beating farnaby with his own weapons its an opening for me rufus at the crisis of my life  that is so rufus admitted i may as well look up the secretary  why shouldnt i go with you amelius suggested  why not rufus agreed  they left the house together     book the fifth the fatal lecture    chapter 1  late that night amelius sat alone in his room making notes for the lecture which he had now formally engaged himself to deliver in a weeks time  thanks to his american education as rufus had supposed he had not been without practice in the art of public speaking he had learnt to face his fellowcreatures in the act of oratory and to hear the sound of his own voice in a silent assembly without trembling from head to foot english newspapers were regularly sent to tadmor and english politics were frequently discussed in the little parliament of the community the prospect of addressing a new audience with their sympathies probably against him at the outset had its terrors undoubtedly but the more formidable consideration to the mind of amelius was presented by the limits imposed on him in the matter of time the lecture was to be succeeded at the request of a clerical member of the institution by a public discussion and the secretarys experience suggested that the lecturer would do well to reduce his address within the compass of an hour socialism is a large subject to be squeezed into that small space amelius had objected and the secretary sighed and answered they wont listen any longer  making notes from time to time of the points on which it was most desirable to insist and on the relative positions which they should occupy in his lecture the memory of amelius became more and more absorbed in recalling the scenes in which his early life had been passed  he laid down his pen as the clock of the nearest church struck the first dark hour of the morning and let his thoughts take him back again without interruption or restraint to the hills and vales of tadmor once more the kind old elder brother taught him the noble lessons of christianity as they came from the inspired teachers own lips once more he took his turn of healthy work in the garden and the field once more the voices of his companions joined with him in the evening songs and the timid little figure of mellicent stood at his side content to hold the musicbook and listen how poor how corrupt did the life look that he was leading now by comparison with the life that he had led in those earlier and happier days how shamefully he had forgotten the simple precepts of christian humility christian sympathy and christian selfrestraint in which his teachers had trusted as the safeguards that were to preserve him from the foul contact of the world within the last two days only he had refused to make merciful allowance for the errors of a man whose life had been wasted in the sordid struggle upward from poverty to wealth and worse yet he had cruelly distressed the poor girl who loved him at the prompting of those selfish passions which it was his first and foremost duty to restrain the bare remembrance of it was unendurable to him in his present frame of mind with his customary impetuosity he snatched up the pen to make atonement before he went to rest that night he wrote in few words to mr farnaby declaring that he regretted having spoken impatiently and contemptuously at the interview between them and expressing the hope that their experience of each other in the time to come might perhaps lead to acceptable concessions on either side his letter to regina was written it is needless to say in warmer terms and at much greater length it was the honest outpouring of his love and his penitence when the letters were safe in their envelopes he was not satisfied even yet no matter what the hour might be there was no ease of mind for amelius until he had actually posted his letters he stole downstairs and softly unbolted the door and hurried away to the nearest letterbox when he had let himself in again with his latchkey his mind was relieved at last now he thought as he lit his bedroom candle i can go to sleep  a visit from rufus was the first event of the day  the two set to work together to draw out the necessary advertisement of the lecture it was well calculated to attract attention in certain quarters the announcement addressed itself in capital letters to all honest people who were poor and discontented come and hear the remedy which christian socialism provides for your troubles explained to you by a friend and a brother and pay no more than sixpence for the place that you occupy the necessary information as to time and place followed this appeal including the offer of reserved seats at higher prices by advice of the secretary the advertisement was not sent to any journal having its circulation among the wealthier classes of society it appeared prominently in one daily paper and in two weekly papers the three possessing an aggregate sale of four hundred thousand copies assume only five readers to each copy cried sanguine amelius and we appeal to an audience of two millions what a magnificent publicity  there was one inevitable result of magnificent publicity which amelius failed to consider his advertisements were certain to bring people together who might otherwise never have met in the great world of london under one roof all over england scotland and ireland he invited unknown guests to pass the evening with him in such circumstances recognitions may take place between persons who have lost sight of each other for years conversations may be held which might otherwise never have been exchanged and results may follow for which the hero of the evening may be innocently responsible because two or three among his audience happen to be sitting to hear him on the same bench a man who opens his doors and invites the public indiscriminately to come in runs the risk of playing with inflammable materials and can never be sure at what time or in what direction they may explode  rufus himself took the fair copies of the advertisement to the nearest agent amelius stayed at home to think over his lecture  he was interrupted by the arrival of mr farnabys answer to his letter the man of the oily whiskers wrote courteously and guardedly he was evidently flattered and pleased by the advance that had been made to him and he was quite willing under the circumstances to give the lovers opportunities of meeting at his house at the same time he limited the number of the opportunities once a week for the present my dear sir regina will doubtless write to you when she returns to london  regina wrote by return of post the next morning amelius received a letter from her which enchanted him she had never loved him as she loved him now she longed to see him again she had prevailed on mrs ormond to let her shorten her visit and to intercede for her with the authorities at home they were to return together to london on the afternoon of the next day amelius would be sure to find her if he arranged to call in time for fiveoclock tea  towards four oclock on the next day while amelius was putting the finishing touches to his dress he was informed that a young person wished to see him the visitor proved to be phoebe with her handkerchief to her eyes indulging in grief in humble imitation of her young mistresss gentle method of proceeding on similar occasions  good god cried amelius has anything happened to regina  no sir phoebe murmured behind the handkerchief miss regina is at home and well  then what are you crying about  phoebe forgot her mistresss gentle method she answered with an explosion of sobs im ruined sir  what do you mean by being ruined whos done it  youve done it sir  amelius started his relations with phoebe had been purely and entirely of the pecuniary sort she was a showy pretty girl with a smart little figurebut with some undeniably bad lines which only observant physiognomists remarked about her eyebrows and her mouth amelius was not a physiognomist but he was in love with regina which at his age implied faithful love it is only men over forty who can court the mistress with reserves of admiration to spare for the maid  sit down said amelius and tell me in two words what you mean  phoebe sat down and dried her eyes i have been infamously treated sir by mrs farnaby she beganand stopped overpowered by the bare remembrance of her wrongs she was angry enough at that moment to be off her guard the vindictive nature that was in the girl found its way outward and showed itself in her face amelius perceived the change and began to doubt whether phoebe was quite worthy of the place which she had hitherto held in his estimation  surely there must be some mistake he said what opportunity has mrs farnaby had of illtreating you you have only just got back to london  i beg your pardon sir we got back sooner than we expected mrs ormond had business in town and she left miss regina at her own door nearly two hours since  well  well sir i had hardly taken off my bonnet and shawl when i was sent for by mrs farnaby have you unpacked your box yet says she i told her i hadnt had time to do so you neednt trouble yourself to unpack says she you are no longer in miss reginas service there are your wageswith a months wages besides in place of the customary warning im only a poor girl sir but i up and spoke to her as plain as she spoke to me i want to know i says why i am sent away in this uncivil manner i couldnt possibly repeat what she said my blood boils when i think of it phoebe declared with melodramatic vehemence somebody has found us out sir somebody has told mrs farnaby of your private meeting with miss regina in the shrubbery and the money you kindly gave me i believe mrs ormond is at the bottom of it you remember nobody knew where she was when i thought she was in the house speaking to the cook thats guesswork i allow so far what is certain is that i have been spoken to as if i was the lowest creature that walks the streets mrs farnaby refuses to give me a character sir she actually said she would call in the police if i didnt leave the house in half an hour how am i to get another place without a character im a ruined girl thats what i amand all through you  threatened at this point with an illustrative outburst of sobbing amelius was simple enough to try the consoling influence of a sovereign why dont you speak to miss regina he asked you know she will help you  she has done all she can sir i have nothing to say against miss reginashes a good creature she came into the room and begged and prayed and took all the blame on herself mrs farnaby wouldnt hear a word im mistress here she says you had better go back to your room ah mr amelius i can tell you mrs farnaby is your enemy as well as mine youll never marry her niece if she can stop it mark my words sir thats the secret of the vile manner in which she has used me my conscience is clear thank god ive tried to serve the cause of true loveand im not ashamed of it never mind my turn is to come im only a poor servant sent adrift in the world without a character wait a little you see if i am not even and better than even with mrs farnaby before long i know what i know i am not going to say any more than that she shall rue the day cried phoebe relapsing into melodrama again when she turned me out of the house like a thief  come come said amelius sharply you mustnt speak in that way  phoebe had got her money she could afford to be independent she rose from her chair the insolence which is the almost invariable accompaniment of a sense of injury among englishwomen of her class expressed itself in her answer to amelius i speak as i think sir i have some spirit in me i am not a woman to be trodden underfootand so mrs farnaby shall find before she is many days older  phoebe phoebe you are talking like a heathen if mrs farnaby has behaved to you with unjust severity set her an example of moderation on your side its your duty as a christian to forgive injuries  phoebe burst out laughing heeheehee thank you sir for a sermon as well as a sovereign you have been most kind indeed she changed suddenly from irony to anger i never was called a heathen before considering what i have done for you i think you might at least have been civil good afternoon sir she lifted her saucy little snubnose and walked with dignity out of the room  for the moment amelius was amused as he heard the housedoor closed he turned laughing to the window for a last look at phoebe in the character of an injured christian in an instant the smile left his lipshe drew back from the window with a start  a man had been waiting for phoebe in the street at the moment when amelius looked out she had just taken his arm he glanced back at the house as they walked away together amelius immediately recognised in phoebes companion and sweetheart a vagabond irishman nicknamed jervy whose face he had last seen at tadmor employed as one of the agents of the community in transacting their business with the neighbouring town he had been dismissed for misconduct and had been unwisely taken back again at the intercession of a respectable person who believed in his promises of amendment amelius had suspected this man of being the spy who officiously informed against mellicent and himself but having discovered no evidence to justify his suspicions he had remained silent on the subject it was now quite plain to him that jervys appearance in london could only be attributed to a second dismissal from the service of the community for some offence sufficiently serious to oblige him to take refuge in england a more disreputable person it was hardly possible for phoebe to have become acquainted with in her present vindictive mood he would be emphatically a dangerous companion and counsellor amelius felt this so strongly that he determined to follow them on the chance of finding out where jervy lived unhappily he had only arrived at this resolution after a lapse of a minute or two he ran into the street but it was too late not a trace of them was to be discovered pursuing his way to mr farnabys house he decided on mentioning what had happened to regina her aunt had not acted wisely in refusing to let the maid refer to her for a character she would do well to set herself right with phoebe in this particular before it was too late    chapter 2  mrs farnaby stood at the door of her own room and looked at her niece with an air of contemptuous curiosity  well you and your lover have had a fine time of it together i suppose what do you want here  amelius wishes particularly to speak to you aunt  tell him to save himself the trouble he may reconcile your uncle to his marriagehe wont reconcile me  its not about that aunt its about phoebe  does he want me to take phoebe back again  at that moment amelius appeared in the hall and answered the question himself i want to give you a word of warning he said  mrs farnaby smiled grimly that excites my curiosity she replied come in i dont want you she added dismissing her niece at the door so youre willing to wait ten years for regina she continued when amelius was alone with her im disappointed in you youre a poor weak creature after all what about that young hussy phoebe  amelius told her unreservedly all that had passed between the discarded maid and himself not forgetting before he concluded to caution her on the subject of the maids companion i dont know what that man may not do to mislead phoebe he said if i were you i wouldnt drive her into a corner  mrs farnaby eyed him scornfully from head to foot you used to have the spirit of a man in you she answered keeping company with regina has made you a milksop already if you want to know what i think of phoebe and her sweetheart she stopped and snapped her fingers there she said thats what i think now go back to regina i can tell you one thingshe will never be your wife  amelius looked at her in quiet surprise it seems odd he remarked that you should treat me as you do after what you said to me the last time i was in this room you expect me to help you in the dearest wish of your lifeand you do everything you can to thwart the dearest wish of my life a man cant keep his temper under continual provocation suppose i refuse to help you  mrs farnaby looked at him with the most exasperating composure i defy you to do it she answered  you defy me to do it amelius exclaimed  do you take me for a fool mrs farnaby went on do you think i dont know you better than you know yourself she stepped up close to him her voice sank suddenly to low and tender tones if that last unlikely chance should turn out in my favour she went on if you really did meet with my poor girl one of these days and knew that you had met with herdo you mean to say you could be cruel enough no matter how badly i behaved to you to tell me nothing about it is that the heart i can feel beating under my hand is that the christianity you learnt at tadmor pooh pooh you foolish boy go back to regina and tell her you have tried to frighten me and you find it wont do  the next day was saturday the advertisement of the lecture appeared in the newspapers rufus confessed that he had been extravagant enough in the case of the two weekly journals to occupy half a page the public he explained have got a nasty way of overlooking advertisements of a modest and retiring character hit em in the eyes when they open the paper or you dont hit em at all  among the members of the public attracted by the new announcement mrs farnaby was one she honoured amelius with a visit at his lodgings i called you a poor weak creature yesterday these were her first words on entering the room i talked like a fool youre a splendid fellow i respect your courage and i shall attend your lecture never mind what mr farnaby and regina say reginas poor little conventional soul is shaken i dare say you neednt expect to have my niece among your audience but farnaby is a humbug as usual he affects to be horrified he talks big about breaking off the match in his own self hes bursting with curiosity to know how you will get through with it i tell you thishe will sneak into the hall and stand at the back where nobody can see him i shall go with him and when youre on the platform ill hold up my handkerchief like this then youll know hes there hit him hard ameliushit him hard where is your friend rufus just gone away i like that american give him my love and tell him to come and see me she left the room as abruptly as she had entered it amelius looked after her in amazement mrs farnaby was not like herself mrs farnaby was in good spirits  reginas opinion of the lecture arrived by post  every other word in her letter was underlined half the sentences began with oh regina was shocked astonished ashamed alarmed what would amelius do next why had he deceived her and left her to find it out in the papers he had undone all the good effect of those charming letters to her father and herself he had no idea of the disgust and abhorrence which respectable people would feel at his odious socialism was she never to know another happy moment and was amelius to be the cause of it and so on and so on  mr farnabys protest followed delivered by mr farnaby himself he kept his gloves on when he called he was solemn and pathetic he remonstrated in the character of one of the ancestors of amelius he pitied the ancient family mouldering in the silent grave he would abstain from deciding in a hurry but his daughters feelings were outraged and he feared it might be his duty to break off the match amelius with perfect good temper offered him a free admission and asked him to hear the lecture and decide for himself whether there was any harm in it mr farnaby turned his head away from the ticket as if it was something indecent sad sad that was his only farewell to the gentlemansocialist  on the sunday being the only day in london on which a man can use his brains without being interrupted by street music amelius rehearsed his lecture on the monday he paid his weekly visit to regina  she was reportedwhether truly or not it was impossible for him to discoverto have gone out in the carriage with mrs ormond amelius wrote to her in soothing and affectionate terms suggesting as he had suggested to her father that she should wait to hear the lecture before she condemned it in the mean time he entreated her to remember that they had promised to be true to one another in time and eternitysocialism notwithstanding  the answer came back by private messenger the tone was serious reginas principles forbade her to attend a socialist lecture she hoped amelius was in earnest in writing as he did about time and eternity the subject was very awful to a rightlyconstituted mind on the next page some mitigation of this severity followed in a postscript regina would wait at home to see amelius the day after his regrettable appearance in public  the evening of tuesday was the evening of the lecture  rufus posted himself at the tickettakers office in the interests of amelius even sixpences do sometimes stick to a mans fingers on their way from the public to the moneybox he remarked the sixpences did indeed flow in rapidly the advertisements had so far produced their effect but the reserved seats sold very slowly the members of the institution who were admitted for nothing arrived in large numbers and secured the best places towards eight oclock the hour at which the lecture was to begin the sixpenny audience was still pouring in rufus recognised phoebe among the late arrivals escorted by a person in the dress of a gentleman who was palpably a blackguard nevertheless a short stout lady followed who warily shook hands with rufus and said let me introduce you to mr farnaby mr farnabys mouth and chin were shrouded in a wrapper his hat was over his eyebrows rufus observed that he looked as if he was ashamed of himself a gaunt dirty savage old woman miserably dressed offered her sixpence to the moneytaker while the two gentlemen were shaking hands the example it is needless to say being set by rufus the old woman looked attentively at all that was visible of mr farnabythat is to say at his eyes and his whiskersby the gaslamp hanging in the corridor she instantly drew back though she had got her ticket waited until mr farnaby had paid for his wife and himself and then followed close behind them into the hall  and why not the advertisements addressed this wretched old creature as one of the poor and discontented public sixteen years ago john farnaby had put his own child into that womans hands at ramsgate and had never seen either of them since    chapter 3  entering the hall mr farnaby discovered without difficulty the position of modest retirement of which he was in search  the cheap seats were situated as usual on that part of the floor of the building which was farthest from the platform a gallery at this end of the hall threw its shadow over the hindermost benches and the gangway by which they were approached in the sheltering obscurity thus produced mr farnaby took his place standing in the corner formed by the angle it which the two walls of the building met with his dutiful wife at his side  still following them unnoticed in the crowd the old woman stopped at the extremity of the hindermost bench looked close at a smartlydressed young man who occupied the last seat at the end and who paid marked attention to a pretty girl sitting by him and whispered in his ear now then jervy cant you make room for mother sowler  the man started and looked round you here he exclaimed with an oath  before he could say more phoebe whispered to him on the other side what a horrid old creature how did you ever come to know her  at the same moment mrs sowler reiterated her request in more peremptory language do you hear jervydo you hear sit a little closer  jervy apparently had his reasons for treating the expression of mrs sowlers wishes with deference shabby as she was making abundant apologies he asked his neighbours to favour him by sitting a little nearer to each other and so contrive to leave a morsel of vacant space at the edge of the bench  phoebe making room under protest began to whisper again what does she mean by calling you jervy she looks like a beggar tell her your name is jervis  the reply she received did not encourage her to say more hold your tongue i have reasons for being civil to heryou be civil too  he turned to mrs sowler with the readiest submission to circumstances under the surface of his showy looks and his vulgar facility of manner there lay hidden a substance of callous villainy and impenetrable cunning he had in him the materials out of which the clever murderers are made who baffle the police if he could have done it with impunity he would have destroyed without remorse the squalid old creature who sat by him and who knew enough of his past career in england to send him to penal servitude for life as it was he spoke to her with a spurious condescension and good humour why it must be ten years mrs sowler since i last saw you what have you been doing  the woman frowned at him as she answered cant you look at me and see starving she eyed his gaudy watch and chain greedily money dont seem to be scarce with you have you made your fortune in america  he laid his hand on her arm and pressed it warningly hush he said under his breath well talk about that after the lecture his bright shifty black eyes turned furtively towards phoebeand mrs sowler noticed it the girls savings in service had paid for his jewelry and his fine clothes she silently resented his rudeness in telling her to hold her tongue sitting sullen with her impudent little nose in the air jervy tried to include her indirectly in his conversation with his shabby old friend this young lady he said knows mr goldenheart she feels sure hell break down and weve come here to see the fun i dont hold with socialism myselfi am for what my favourite newspaper calls the altar and the throne in short my politics are conservative  your politics are in your girls pocket muttered mrs sowler how long will her money last  jervy turned a deaf ear to the interruption and what has brought you here he went on in his most ingratiating way did you see the advertisement in the papers  mrs sowler answered loud enough to be heard above the hum of talking in the sixpenny places i was having a drop of gin and i saw the paper at the publichouse im one of the discontented poor i hate rich people and im ready to pay my sixpence to hear them abused  hear hear said a man near who looked like a shoemaker  i hope hell give it to the aristocracy added one of the shoemakers neighbours apparently a groom out of place  im sick of the aristocracy cried a woman with a fiery face and a crushed bonnet its them as swallows up the money what business have they with their palaces and their parks when my husbands out of work and my children hungry at home  the acquiescent shoemaker listened with admiration very well put he said very well put  these expressions of popular feeling reached the respectable ears of mr farnaby do you hear those wretches he said to his wife  mrs farnaby seized the welcome opportunity of irritating him poor things she answered in their place we should talk as they do  you had better go into the reserved seats rejoined her husband turning from her with a look of disgust theres plenty of room why do you stop here  i couldnt think of leaving you my dear how did you like my american friend  i am astonished at your taking the liberty of introducing him to me you knew perfectly well that i was here incognito what do i care about a wandering american  mrs farnaby persisted as maliciously as ever ah but you see i like him the wandering american is my ally  your ally what do you mean  good heavens how dull you are dont you know that i object to my nieces marriage engagement i was quite delighted when i heard of this lecture because its an obstacle in the way it disgusts regina and it disgusts youand my dear american is the man who first brought it about hush heres amelius how well he looks so graceful and so gentlemanlike cried mrs farnaby signalling with her handkerchief to show amelius their position in the hall i declare im ready to become a socialist before he opens his lips  the personal appearance of amelius took the audience completely by surprise a man who is young and handsome is not the order of man who is habitually associated in the popular mind with the idea of a lecture after a moment of silence there was a spontaneous burst of applause it was renewed when amelius first placing on his table a little book announced his intention of delivering the lecture extempore the absence of the inevitable manuscript was in itself an act of mercy that cheered the public at starting  the orator of the evening began  ladies and gentlemen thoughtful people accustomed to watch the signs of the times in this country and among the other nations of europe are so far as i know agreed in the conclusion that serious changes are likely to take place in present forms of government and in existing systems of society before the century in which we live has reached its end in plain words the next revolution is not so unlikely and not so far off as it pleases the higher and wealthier classes among european populations to suppose i am one of those who believe that the coming convulsion will take the form this time of a social revolution and that the man at the head of it will not be a military or a political manbut a great citizen sprung from the people and devoted heart and soul to the peoples cause within the limits assigned to me tonight it is impossible that i should speak to you of government and society among other nations even if i possessed the necessary knowledge and experience to venture on so vast a subject all that i can now attempt to do is first to point out some of the causes which are paving the way for a coming change in the social and political condition of this country and secondly to satisfy you that the only trustworthy remedy for existing abuses is to be found in the system which christian socialism extracts from this little book on my tablethe book which you all know under the name of the new testament before however i enter on my task i feel it a duty to say one preliminary word on the subject of my claim to address you such as it is i am most unwilling to speak of myselfbut my position here forces me to do so i am a stranger to all of you and i am a very young man let me tell you then briefly what my life has been and where i have been brought upand then decide for yourselves whether it is worth your while to favour me with your attention or not  a very good opening remarked the shoemaker  a nicelooking fellow said the fieryfaced woman i should like to kiss him  hes too civil by half grumbled mrs sowler i wish i had my sixpence back in my pocket  give him time whispered jervy and hell warm up i say phoebe he doesnt begin like a man who is going to break down i dont expect there will be much to laugh at tonight  what an admirable speaker said mrs farnaby to her husband fancy such a man as that being married to such an idiot as regina  theres always a chance for him returned mr farnaby savagely as long as hes not married to such a woman as you  in the mean time amelius had claimed national kindred with his audience as an englishman and had rapidly sketched his life at tadmor in its most noteworthy points this done he put the question whether they would hear him his frankness and freshness had already won the public they answered by a general shout of applause  very well amelius proceeded now let us get on suppose we take a glance we have no time to do more at the present state of our religious system first what is the public aspect of the thing called christianity in the england of our day a hundred different sects all at variance with each other an established church rent in every direction by incessant wranglingdisputes about black gowns or white about having candlesticks on tables or off tables about bowing to the east or bowing to the west about which doctrine collects the most respectable support and possesses the largest sum of money the doctrine in my church or the doctrine in your church or the doctrine in the church over the way look up if you like from this multitudinous and incessant squabbling among the rank and file to the high regions in which the right reverend representatives of state religion sit apart are they christians if they are show me the bishop who dare assert his christianity in the house of lords when the ministry of the day happens to see its advantage in engaging in a war where is that bishop and how many supporters does he count among his own order do you blame me for using intemperate languagelanguage which i cannot justify take a fair test and try me by that the result of the christianity of the new testament is to make men true humane gentle modest strictly scrupulous and strictly considerate in their dealings with their neighbours does the christianity of the churches and the sects produce these results among us look at the staple of the country at the occupation which employs the largest number of englishmen of all degreeslook at our commerce what is its social aspect judged by the morality which is in this book in my hand let those organised systems of imposture masquerading under the disguise of banks and companies answer the questionthere is no need for me to answer it you know what respectable names are associated year after year with the shameless falsification of accounts and the merciless ruin of thousands on thousands of victims you know how our poor indian customer finds his cottonprint dress a sham that falls to pieces how the savage who deals honestly with us for his weapon finds his gun a delusion that bursts how the halfstarved needlewoman who buys her reel of thread finds printed on the label a false statement of the number of yards that she buys you know that in the markets of europe foreign goods are fast taking the place of english goods because the foreigner is the most honest manufacturer of the twoand lastly you know what is worse than all that these cruel and wicked deceptions and many more like them are regarded on the highest commercial authority as forms of competition and justifiable proceedings in trade do you believe in the honourable accumulation of wealth by men who hold such opinions and perpetrate such impostures as these i dont do you find any brighter and purer prospect when you look down from the man who deceives you and me on the great scale to the man who deceives us on the small i dont everything we eat drink and wear is a more or less adulterated commodity and that very adulteration is sold to us by the tradesmen at such outrageous prices that we are obliged to protect ourselves on the socialist principle by setting up cooperative shops of our own wait and hear me out before you applaud dont mistake the plain purpose of what i am saying to you and dont suppose that i am blind to the brighter side of the dark picture that i have drawn look within the limits of private life and you will find true christians thank god among clergymen and laymen alike you will find men and women who deserve to be called in the highest sense of the word disciples of christ but my business is not with private lifemy business is with the present public aspect of the religion morals and politics of this country and again i say it that aspect presents one wide field of corruption and abuse and reveals a callous and shocking insensibility on the part of the nation at large to the spectacle of its own demoralisation and disgrace  there amelius paused and took his first drink of water  reserved seats at public performances seem by some curious affinity to be occupied by reserved persons the select public seated nearest to the orator preserved discreet silence but the hearty applause from the sixpenny places made ample amends there was enough of the lecturers own vehemence and impetuosity in this opening attacksustained as it undeniably was by a sound foundation of truthto appeal strongly to the majority of his audience mrs sowler began to think that her sixpence had been well laid out after all and mrs farnaby pointed the direct application to her husband of all the hardest hits at commerce by nodding her head at him as they were delivered  amelius went on  the next thing we have to discover is this will our present system of government supply us with peaceable means for the reform of the abuses which i have already noticed not forgetting that other enormous abuse represented by our intolerable national expenditure increasing with every year unless you insist on it i do not propose to waste our precious time by saying anything about the house of lords for three good reasons in the first place that assembly is not elected by the people and it has therefore no right of existence in a really free country in the second place out of its four hundred and eightyfive members no less than one hundred and eightyfour directly profit by the expenditure of the public money being in the annual receipt under one pretence or another of more than half a million sterling in the third place if the assembly of the commons has in it the will as well as the capacity to lead the way in the needful reforms the assembly of the lords has no alternative but to follow or to raise the revolution which it only escaped by a hairsbreadth some forty years since what do you say shall we waste our time in speaking of the house of lords  loud cries from the sixpenny benches answered no the ostler and the fieryfaced woman being the most vociferous of all here and there certain dissentient individuals raised a little hissled by jervy in the interests of the altar and the throne  amelius resumed  well will the house of commons help us to get purer christianity and cheaper government by lawful and sufficient process of reform let me again remind you that this assembly has the powerif it has the will is it so constituted at present as to have the will there is the question the number of members is a little over six hundred and fifty out of this muster one fifth only represent or pretend to represent the trading interests of the country as for the members charged with the interests of the working class they are more easily counted stillthey are two in number then in heavens name you will ask what interest does the majority of members in this assembly represent there is but one answerthe military and aristocratic interest in these days of the decay of representative institutions the house of commons has become a complete misnomer the commons are not represented modern members belong to classes of the community which have really no interest in providing for popular needs and lightening popular burdens in one word there is no sort of hope for us in the house of commons and whose fault is this i own it with shame and sorrowit is emphatically the fault of the people yes i say to you plainly it is the disgrace and the peril of england that the people themselves have elected the representative assembly which ignores the peoples wants you voters in town and county alike have had every conceivable freedom and encouragement secured to you in the exercise of your sacred trustand there is the modern house of commons to prove that you are thoroughly unworthy of it  these bold words produced an outbreak of disapprobation from the audience which for the moment completely overpowered the speakers voice they were prepared to listen with inexhaustible patience to the enumeration of their virtues and their wrongsbut they had not paid sixpence each to be informed of the vicious and contemptible part which they play in modern politics they yelled and groaned and hissedand felt that their handsome young lecturer had insulted them  amelius waited quietly until the disturbance had worn itself out  i am sorry i have made you angry with me he said smiling the blame for this little disturbance really rests with the public speakers who are afraid of you and who flatter youespecially if you belong to the working classes you are not accustomed to have the truth told you to your faces why my good friends the people in this country who are unworthy of the great trust which the wise and generous english constitution places in their hands are so numerous that they can be divided into distinct classes there is the highlyeducated class which despairs and holds aloof there is the class beneathwithout selfrespect and therefore without public spiritwhich can be bribed indirectly by the gift of a place by the concession of a lease even by an invitation to a party at a great house which includes the wives and the daughters and there is the lower class stillmercenary corrupt shameless to the marrow of its boneswhich sells itself and its liberties for money and drink when i began this discourse and adverted to great changes that are to come i spoke of them as revolutionary changes am i an alarmist do i unjustly ignore the capacity for peaceable reformation which has preserved modern england from revolutions thus far god forbid that i should deny the truth or that i should alarm you without need but history tells me if i look no farther back than to the first french revolution that there are social and political corruptions which strike their roots in a nation so widely and so deeply that no force short of the force of a revolutionary convulsion can tear them up and cast them away and i do personally fear and older and wiser men than i agree with me that the corruptions at which i have only been able to hint in this brief address are fast extending themselvesin england as well as in europe generallybeyond the reach of that lawful and bloodless reform which has served us so well in past years whether i am mistaken in this view and i hope with all my heart it may be so or whether events yet in the future will prove that i am right the remedy in either case the one sure foundation on which a permanent complete and worthy reformation can be builtwhether it prevents a convulsion or whether it follows a convulsionis only to be found within the covers of this book do not i entreat you suffer yourselves to be persuaded by those purblind philosophers who assert that the divine virtue of christianity is a virtue which is wearing out with the lapse of time it is the abuse and corruption of christianity that is wearing outas all falsities and all impostures must and do wear out never since christ and his apostles first showed men the way to be better and happier have the nations stood in sorer need of a return to that teaching in its pristine purity and simplicity than now never more certainly than at this critical time was it the interest as well as the duty of mankind to turn a deaf ear to the turmoil of false teachers and to trust in that allwise and allmerciful voice which only ceased to exalt console and purify humanity when it expired in darkness under the torture of the cross are these the wild words of an enthusiast is this the dream of an earthly paradise in which it is sheer folly to believe i can tell you of one existing community one among others which numbers some hundreds of persons and which has found prosperity and happiness by reducing the whole art and mystery of government to the simple solution set forth in the new testamentfear god and love thy neighbour as thyself  by these gradations amelius arrived at the second of the two parts into which he had divided his address  he now repeated at greater length and with a more careful choice of language the statement of the religious and social principles of the community at tadmor which he had already addressed to his two fellowtravellers on the voyage to england while he confined himself to plain narrative describing a mode of life which was entirely new to his hearers he held the attention of the audience but when he began to argue the question of applying christian socialism to the government of large populations as well as smallwhen he inquired logically whether what he had proved to be good for some hundreds of persons was not also good for some thousands and conceding that for some hundreds of thousands and so on until he had arrived by dint of sheer argument at the conclusion that what had succeeded at tadmor must necessarily succeed on a fair trial in londonthen the public interest began to flag people remembered their coughs and colds and talked in whispers and looked about them with a vague feeling of relief in staring at each other mrs sowler hitherto content with furtively glancing at mr farnaby from time to time now began to look at him more boldly as he stood in his corner with his eyes fixed sternly on the platform at the other end of the hall he too began to feel that the lecture was changing its tone it was no longer the daring outbreak which he had come to hear as his sufficient justification if necessary for forbidding amelius to enter his house i have had enough of it he said suddenly turning to his wife let us go  if mrs farnaby could have been forewarned that she was standing in that assembly of strangers not as one of themselves but as a woman with a formidable danger hanging over her heador if she had only happened to look towards phoebe and had felt a passing reluctance to submit herself to the possibly insolent notice of a discharged servantshe might have gone out with her husband and might have so escaped the peril that had been lying in wait for her from the fatal moment when she first entered the hall as it was she refused to move you forget the public discussion she said wait and see what sort of fight amelius makes of it when the lecture is over  she spoke loud enough to be heard by some of the people seated nearest to her phoebe critically examining the dresses of the few ladies in the reserved seats twisted round on the bench and noticed for the first time the presence of mr and mrs farnaby in their dim corner look she whispered to jervy theres the wretch who turned me out of her house without a character and her husband with her  jervy looked round in his turn a little doubtful of the accuracy of his sweethearts information surely they wouldnt come to the sixpenny places he said are you certain its mr and mrs farnaby  he spoke in cautiouslylowered tones but mrs sowler had seen him look back at the lady and gentleman in the corner and was listening attentively to catch the first words that fell from his lips  which is mr farnaby she asked  the man in the corner there with the white silk wrapper over his mouth and his hat down to his eyebrows  mrs sowler looked round for a momentto make sure that jervys man and her man were one and the same  farnaby she muttered to herself in the tone of a person who heard the name for the first time she considered a little and leaning across jervy addressed herself to his companion my dear she whispered did that gentleman ever go by the name of morgan and have his letters addressed to the george and dragon in tooleystreet  phoebe lifted her eyebrows with a look of contemptuous surprise which was an answer in itself fancy the great mr farnaby going by an assumed name and having his letters addressed to a publichouse she said to jervy  mrs sowler asked no more questions she relapsed into muttering to herself under her breath his whiskers have turned gray to be surebut i know his eyes again ill take my oath to it theres no mistaking his eyes she suddenly appealed to jervy is mr farnaby rich she asked  rolling in riches was the answer  where does he live  jervy was cautious how he replied to that he consulted phoebe shall i tell her  phoebe answered petulantly im turned out of the house i dont care what you tell her  jervy again addressed the old woman still keeping his information in reserve why do you want to know where he lives  he owes me money said mrs sowler  jervy looked hard at her and emitted a long low whistle expressive of blank amazement the persons near annoyed by the incessant whispering looked round irritably and insisted on silence jervy ventured nevertheless on a last interruption you seem to be tired of this he remarked to phoebe lets go and get some oysters she rose directly jervy tapped mrs sowler on the shoulder as they passed her come and have some supper he said ill stand treat  the three were necessarily noticed by their neighbours as they passed out mrs farnaby discovered phoebewhen it was too late mr farnaby happened to look first at the old woman sixteen years of squalid poverty effectually disguised her in that dim light he only looked away again and said to his wife impatiently let us go too  mrs farnaby was still obstinate you can go if you like she said i shall stay here    chapter 4  three dozen oysters breadandbutter and bottled stout a private room and a good fire issuing these instructions on his arrival at the tavern jervy was surprised by a sudden act of interference on the part of his venerable guest mrs sowler actually took it on herself to order her own supper  nothing cold to eat or drink for me she said morning and night waking and sleeping i cant keep myself warm see for yourself jervy how ive lost flesh since you first knew me a steak broiling hot from the gridiron and ginandwater hotter stillthats the supper for me  take the order waiter said jervy resignedly and let us see the private room  the tavern was of the oldfashioned english sort which scorns to learn a lesson of brightness and elegance from france the private room can only be described as a museum for the exhibition of dirt in all its varieties behind the bars of the rusty little grate a dying fire was drawing its last breath mrs sowler clamoured for wood and coals revived the fire with her own hands and seated herself shivering as close to the fender as the chair would go after a while the composing effect of the heat began to make its influence felt the head of the halfstarved wretch sank a species of stupor overcame herhalf faintness and half sleep  phoebe and her sweetheart sat together waiting the appearance of the supper on a little sofa at the other end of the room having certain objects to gain jervy put his arm round her waist and looked and spoke in his most insinuating manner  try and put up with mother sowler for an hour or two he said my sweet girl i know she isnt fit company for you but how can i turn my back on an old friend  thats just what surprises me phoebe answered i dont understand such a person being a friend of yours  always ready with the necessary lie whenever the occasion called for it jervy invented a pathetic little story in two short parts first part mrs sowler rich and respected a widow inhabiting a villaresidence and riding in her carriage second part a villainous lawyer misplaced confidence reckless investments death of the villain ruin of mrs sowler dont talk about her misfortunes when she wakes jervy concluded or shell burst out crying to a dead certainty only tell me dear phoebe would you turn your back on a forlorn old creature because she has outlived all her other friends and hasnt a farthing left in the world poor as i am i can help her to a supper at any rate  phoebe expressed her admiration of these noble sentiments by an inexpensive ebullition of tenderness which failed to fulfill jervys private anticipations he had aimed straight at her purseand he had only hit her heart he tried a broad hint next i wonder whether i shall have a shilling or two left to give mrs sowler when i have paid for the supper he sighed and pulled out some small change and looked at it in eloquent silence phoebe was hit in the right place at last she handed him her purse what is mine will be yours when we are married she said why not now jervy expressed his sense of obligation with the promptitude of a grateful man he repeated those precious words my sweet girl phoebe laid her head on his shoulderand let him kiss her and enjoyed it in silent ecstasy with halfclosed eyes the scoundrel waited and watched her until she was completely under his influence then and not till then he risked the gradual revelation of the purpose which had induced him to withdraw from the hall before the proceedings of the evening had reached their end  did you hear what mrs sowler said to me just before we left the lecture he asked  no dear  you remember that she asked me to tell her farnabys address  oh yes and she wanted to know if he had ever gone by the name of morgan ridiculouswasnt it  im not so sure of that my dear she told me in so many words that farnaby owed her money he didnt make his fortune all at once i suppose how do we know what he might have done in his young days or how he might have humbugged a feeble woman wait till our friend there at the fire has warmed her old bones with some hot grogand ill find out something more about farnabys debt  why dear what is it to you  jervy reflected for a moment and decided that the time had come to speak more plainly  in the first place he said it would only be an act of common humanity on my part to help mrs sowler to get her money you see that dont you very well now i am no socialist as you are aware quite the contrary at the same time i am a remarkably just man and i own i was struck by what mr goldenheart said about the uses to which wealthy people are put by the rules at tadmor the man who has got the money is bound by the express law of christian morality to use it in assisting the man who has got none those were his words as nearly as i can remember them he put it still more strongly afterwards he said a man who hoards up a large fortune from a purely selfish motiveeither because he is a miser or because he looks only to the aggrandisement of his own family after his deathis in either case an essentially unchristian person who stands in manifest need of enlightenment and control by christian law and then if you remember some of the people murmured and mr goldenheart stopped them by reading a line from the new testament which said exactly what he had been sayingonly in fewer words now my dear girl farnaby seems to me to be one of the many people pointed at in this young gentlemans lecture judging by looks i should say he was a hard man  thats just what he ishard as iron looks at his servants as if they were dirt under his feet and never speaks a kind word to them from one years end to another  suppose i guess again hes not particularly freehanded with his moneyis he  he he will spend anything on himself and his grandeur but he never gave away a halfpenny in his life  jervy pointed to the fireplace with a burst of virtuous indignation and theres that poor old soul starving for want of the money he owes her damn it i agree with the socialists its a virtue to make that sort of man bleed look at you and me we are the very people he ought to helpwe might be married at once if we only knew where to find a little money ive seen a deal of the world phoebe and my experience tells me theres something about that debt of farnabys which he doesnt want to have known why shouldnt we screw a few fivepound notes for ourselves out of the rich misers fears  phoebe was cautious its against the lawaint it she said  trust me to keep clear of the law jervy answered i wont stir in the matter till i know for certain that he darent take the police into his confidence it will be all easy enough when we are once sure of that you have been long enough in the family to find out farnabys weak side would it do if we got at him to begin with through his wife  phoebe suddenly reddened to the roots of her hair dont talk to me about his wife she broke out fiercely ive got a day of reckoning to come with that lady she looked at jervy and checked herself he was watching her with an eager curiosity which not even his ready cunning was quick enough to conceal  i wouldnt intrude on your little secrets darling for the world he said in his most persuasive tones but if you want advice you know that i am heart and soul at your service  phoebe looked across the room at mrs sowler still nodding over the fire  never mind now she said i dont think its a matter for a man to advise aboutits between mrs farnaby and me do what you like with her husband i dont care hes a brute and i hate him but theres one thing i insist oni wont have miss regina frightened or annoyed mind that shes a good creature there read the letter she wrote to me yesterday and judge for yourself  jervy looked at the letter it was not very long he resignedly took upon himself the burden of reading it   dear phoebe  dont be downhearted i am your friend always and i will help you to get another place i am sorry to say that it was indeed mrs ormond who found us out that day she had her suspicions and she watched us and told my aunt this she owned to me with her own lips she said i would do anything my dear to save you from an illassorted marriage i am very wretched about it because i can never look on her as my friend again my aunt as you know is of mrs ormonds way of thinking you must make allowances for her hot temper remember out of your kindness towards me you had been secretly helping forward the very thing which she was most anxious to prevent that made her very angry but never fear she will come round in time if you dont want to spend your little savings while you are waiting for another situation let me know a share of my pocketmoney is always at your service  your friend  regina   very nice indeed said jervy handing the letter back and yawning as he did it and convenient too if we run short of money ah heres the waiter with the supper at last now mrs sowler theres a time for everythingits time to wake up  he lifted the old woman off her chair and settled her before the table like a child the sight of the hot food and drink roused her to a tigerish activity she devoured the meat with her eyes as well as her teeth she drank the hot ginandwater in fierce gulps and set down the glass with audible gasps of relief another one she cried and i shall begin to feel warm again  jervy watching her from the opposite side of the table with phoebe close by him as usual had his own motives for encouraging her to talk by the easy means of encouraging her to drink he sent for another glass of the hot grog phoebe daintily picking up her oysters with her fork affected to be shocked at mrs sowlers coarse method of eating and drinking she kept her eyes on her plate and only consented to taste malt liquor under modest protest when jervy lit a cigar after finishing his supper she reminded him in an impressively genteel manner of the consideration which he owed to the presence of an elderly lady i like it myself dear she said mincingly but perhaps mrs sowler objects to the smell  mrs sowler burst into a hoarse laugh do i look as if i was likely to be squeamish about smells she asked with the savage contempt for her own poverty which was one of the dangerous elements in her character see the place i live in young woman and then talk about smells if you like  this was indelicate phoebe picked a last oyster out of its shell and kept her eyes modestly fixed on her plate observing that the second glass of ginandwater was fast becoming empty jervy risked the first advances on his way to mrs sowlers confidence  about that debt of farnabys he began is it a debt of long standing  mrs sowler was on her guard in other words mrs sowlers head was only assailable by hot grog when hot grog was administered in large quantities she said it was a debt of long standing and she said no more  has it been standing seven years  mrs sowler emptied her glass and looked hard at jervy across the table my memory isnt good for much at my time of life she gave him that answer and she gave him no more  jervy yielded with his best grace try a third glass he said theres luck you know in odd numbers  mrs sowler met this advance in the spirit in which it was made she was obliging enough to consult her memory even before the third glass made its appearance seven years did you say she repeated more than twice seven years jervy what do you think of that  jervy wasted no time in thinking he went on with his questions  are you quite sure that the man i pointed out to you at the lecture is the same man who went by the name of morgan and had his letters addressed to the publichouse  quite sure id swear to him anywhereonly by his eyes  and have you never yet asked him to pay the debt  how could i ask him when i never knew what his name was till you told me tonight  what amount of money does he owe you  whether mrs sowler had her mind prophetically fixed on a fourth glass of grog or whether she thought it time to begin asking questions on her own account is not easy to say whatever her motive might be she slyly shook her head and winked at jervy the moneys my business she remarked you tell me where he livesand ill make him pay me  jervy was equal to the occasion you wont do anything of the sort he said  mrs sowler laughed defiantly so you think my fine fellow  i dont think at all old ladyim certain in the first place farnaby dont owe you the debt by law after seven years in the second place just look at yourself in the glass there do you think the servants will let you in when you knock at farnabys door you want a clever fellow to help youor youll never recover that debt  mrs sowler was accessible to reason even halfway through her third glass of grog when reason was presented to her in convincing terms she came to the point at once how much do you want she asked  nothing jervy answered i dont look to you to pay my commission  mrs sowler reflected a littleand understood him say that again she insisted in the presence of your young woman as witness  jervy touched his young womans hand under the table warning her to make no objection and to leave it to him having declared for the second time that he would not take a farthing from mrs sowler he went on with his inquiries  im acting in your interests mother sowler he said and youll be the loser if you dont answer my questions patiently and tell me the truth i want to go back to the debt what is it for  for six weeks keep of a child at ten shillings a week  phoebe looked up from her plate  whose child jervy asked noticing the sudden movement  morgans childthe same man you said was farnaby  do you know who the mother was  i wish i did i should have got the money out of her long ago  jervy stole a look at phoebe she had turned pale she was listening with her eyes riveted on mrs sowlers ugly face  how long ago was it jervy went on  better than sixteen years  did farnaby himself give you the child  with his own hands over the gardenpaling of a house at ramsgate he saw me and the child into the train for london i had ten pounds from him and no more he promised to see me and settle everything in a months time i have never set eyes on him from that day till i saw him paying his money this evening at the door of the hall  jervy stole another look at phoebe she was still perfectly unconscious that he was observing her her attention was completely absorbed by mrs sowlers replies speculating on the possible result jervy abandoned the question of the debt and devoted his next inquiries to the subject of the child  i promise you every farthing of your money mother sowler he said with interest added to it how old was the child when farnaby gave it to you  old not a week old i should say  not a week old jervy repeated with his eye on phoebe dear dear me a newborn baby one may say  the girls excitement was fast getting beyond control she leaned across the table in her eagerness to hear more  and how long was this poor child under your care jervy went on  how can i tell you at this distance of time for some months i should say this im certain ofi kept it for six good weeks after the ten pounds he gave me were spent and then she stopped and looked at phoebe  and then you got rid of it  mrs sowler felt for jervys foot under the table and gave it a significant kick i have done nothing to be ashamed of miss she said addressing her answer defiantly to phoebe being too poor to keep the little dear myself i placed it under the care of a good lady who adopted it  phoebe could restrain herself no longer she burst out with the next question before jervy could open his lips  do you know where the lady is now  no said mrs sowler shortly i dont  do you know where to find the child  mrs sowler slowly stirred up the remains of her grog i know no more than you do any more questions miss  phoebes excitement completely blinded her to the evident signs of a change in mrs sowlers temper for the worse she went on headlong  have you never seen the child since you gave her to the lady  mrs sowler set down her glass just as she was raising it to her lips jervy paused thunderstruck in the act of lighting a second cigar  her mrs sowler repeated slowly her eyes fixed on phoebe with a lowering expression of suspicion and surprise her she turned to jervy did you ask me if the child was a girl or a boy  i never even thought of it jervy replied  did i happen to say it myself without being asked  jervy deliberately abandoned phoebe to the implacable old wretch before whom she had betrayed herself it was the only likely way of forcing the girl to confess everything no he answered you never said it without being asked  mrs sowler turned once more to phoebe how do you know the child was a girl she inquired  phoebe trembled and said nothing she sat with her head down and her hands fast clasped together resting on her lap  might i ask if you please mrs sowler proceeded with a ferocious assumption of courtesy how old you are miss youre young enough and pretty enough not to mind answering to your age im sure  even jervys villainous experience of the world failed to forewarn him of what was coming phoebe it is needless to say instantly fell into the trap  twentyfour she replied next birthday  and the child was put into my hands sixteen years ago said mrs sowler take sixteen from twentyfour and eight remains im more surprised than ever miss at your knowing it to be a girl it couldnt have been your childcould it  phoebe started to her feet in a state of fury do you hear that she cried appealing to jervy how dare you bring me here to be insulted by that drunken wretch  mrs sowler rose on her side the old savage snatched up her empty glassintending to throw it at phoebe at the same moment the ready jervy caught her by the arm dragged her out of the room and shut the door behind them  there was a bench on the landing outside he pushed mrs sowler down on the bench with one hand and took phoebes purse out of his pocket with the other heres a pound he said towards the recovery of that debt of yours go home quietly and meet me at the door of this house tomorrow evening at six  mrs sowler opening her lips to protest suddenly closed them again fascinated by the sight of the gold she clutched the coin and became friendly and familiar in a moment help me downstairs deary she said and put me into a cab im afraid of the night air  one word more before i put you into a cab said jervy what did you really do with the child  mrs sowler grinned hideously and whispered her reply in the strictest confidence  sold her to moll davies for fiveandsixpence  who was moll davis  a cadger  and you really know nothing now of moll davis or the child  should i want you to help me if i did mrs sowler asked contemptuously they may be both dead and buried for all i know to the contrary  jervy put her into the cab without further delay now for the other one he said to himself as he hurried back to the private room    chapter 5  some men would have found it no easy task to console phoebe under the circumstances jervy had the immense advantage of not feeling the slightest sympathy for her he was in full command of his large resources of fluent assurance and ready flattery in less than five minutes phoebes tears were dried and her lover had his arm round her waist again in the character of a cherished and forgiven man  now my angel he said phoebe sighed tenderly he had never called her his angel before tell me all about it in confidence only let me know the facts and i shall see my way to protecting you against any annoyance from mrs sowler in the future you have made a very extraordinary discovery come closer to me my dear girl did it happen in farnabys house  i heard it in the kitchen said phoebe  jervy started did any one else hear it he asked  no they were all in the housekeepers room looking at the indian curiosities which her son in canada had sent to her i had left my bird on the dresserand i ran into the kitchen to put the cage in a safe place being afraid of the cat one of the swinging windows in the skylight was open and i heard voices in the back room above which is mrs farnabys room  whose voices did you hear  mrs farnabys voice and mr goldenhearts  mrs farnaby jervy repeated in surprise are you sure it was mrs  of course i am do you think i dont know that horrid womans voice she was saying a most extraordinary thing when i first heard hershe was asking if there was anything wrong in showing her naked foot and a man answered and the voice was mr goldenhearts you would have felt curious to hear more if you had been in my place wouldnt you i opened the second window in the kitchen so as to make sure of not missing anything and what do you think i heard her say  you mean mrs farnaby  yes i heard her say look at my right footyou see theres nothing the matter with it and then after a while she said look at my left footlook between the third toe and the fourth did you ever hear of such a audacious thing for a married woman to say to a young man  go on go on what did he say  nothing i suppose he was looking at her foot  her left foot  yes her left foot was nothing to be proud of i can tell you by her own account she has some horrid deformity in it between the third toe and the fourth no i didnt hear her say what the deformity was i only heard her call it soand she said her poor darling was born with the same fault and that was her defence against being imposed upon by roguesi remember the very wordsin the past days when i employed people to find her yes she said her i heard it plainly and she talked afterwards of her poor lost daughter who might be still living somewhere and wondering who her mother was naturally enough when i heard that hateful old drunkard talking about a child given to her by mr farnaby i put two and two together dear me how strangely you look whats wrong with you  im only very much interestedthats all but theres one thing i dont understand what had mr goldenheart to do with all this  didnt i tell you  no  well then i tell you now mrs farnaby is not only a heartless wretch who turns a poor girl out of her situation and refuses to give her a charactershes a fool besides that precious exhibition of her nasty foot was to inform mr goldenheart of something she wanted him to know if he happened to meet with a girl in his walks or his travels and if he found that she had the same deformity in the same foot then he might know for certain  all right i understand but why mr goldenheart  because she had a dream that mr goldenheart had found the lost girl and because she thought there was one chance in a hundred that her dream might come true did you ever hear of such a fool before from what i could make out i believe she actually cried about it and that same woman turns me into the street to be ruined for all she knows or cares mind this i would have kept her secretit was no business of mine after allif she had behaved decently to me as it is i mean to be even with her and what i heard down in the kitchen is more than enough to help me to it ill expose her somehowi dont quite know how but that will come with time you will keep the secret dear im sure we are soon to have all our secrets in common when we are man and wife aint we why youre not listening to me what is the matter with you  jervy suddenly looked up his soft insinuating manner had vanished he spoke roughly and impatiently  i want to know something has farnabys wife got money of her own  phoebes mind was still disturbed by the change in her lover you speak as if you were angry with me she said  jervy recovered his insinuating tones with some difficulty my dear girl i love you how can i be angry with you youve set me thinkingand it bothers me a little thats all do you happen to know if mrs farnaby has got money of her own  phoebe answered this time ive heard miss regina say that mrs farnabys father was a rich man she said  what was his name  ronald  do you know when he died  no  jervy fell into thought again biting his nails in great perplexity after a moment or two an idea came to him the tombstone will tell me he exclaimed speaking to himself he turned to phoebe before she could express her surprise and asked if she knew where mr ronald was buried  yes said phoebe ive heard that in highgate cemetery but why do you want to know  jervy looked at his watch its getting late he said ill see you safe home  but i want to know  put on your bonnet and wait till we are out in the street  jervy paid the bill with all needful remembrance of the waiter he was generous he was polite but he was apparently in no hurry to favour phoebe with the explanation that he had promised they had left the tavern for some minutesand he was still rude enough to remain absorbed in his own reflections phoebes patience gave way  i have told you everything she said reproachfully i dont call it fair dealing to keep me in the dark after that  he roused himself directly my dear girl you entirely mistake me  the reply was as ready as usual but it was spoken rather absently only that moment he had decided on informing phoebe to some extent at least of the purpose which he was then meditating he would infinitely have preferred using mrs sowler as his sole accomplice but he knew the girl too well to run that risk if he refused to satisfy her curiosity she would be deterred by no scruples of delicacy from privately watching him and she might say something either by word of month or by writing to the kind young mistress who was in correspondence with her which might lead to disastrous results it was of the last importance to him so far to associate phoebe with his projected enterprise as to give her an interest of her own in keeping his secrets  i have not the least wish he resumed to conceal any thing from you so far as i can see my way at present you shall see it too reserving in this dexterous manner the freedom of lying whenever he found it necessary to depart from the truth he smiled encouragingly and waited to be questioned  phoebe repeated the inquiry she had made at the tavern why do you want to know where mr ronald is buried she asked bluntly  mr ronalds tombstone my dear will tell me the date of mr ronalds death jervy rejoined when i have got the date i shall go to a place near st pauls called doctors commons i shall pay a shilling fee and i shall have the privilege of looking at mr ronalds will  and what good will that do you  very properly put phoebe even shillings are not to be wasted in our position but my shilling will buy two sixpennyworths of information i shall find out what sum of money mr ronald has left to his daughter and i shall know for certain whether mrs farnabys husband has any power over it or not  well said phoebe not much interested so farand what then  jervy looked about him they were in a crowded thoroughfare at the time he preserved a discreet silence until they had arrived at the first turning which led down a quiet street  what i have to tell you he said must not be accidentally heard by anybody here my dear we are all but out of the worldand here i can speak to you safely i promise you two good things you shall bring mrs farnaby to that day of reckoning and we will find money enough to marry on comfortably as soon as you like  phoebes languid interest in the subject began to revive she insisted on having a clearer explanation than this do you mean to get the money out of mr farnaby she inquired  i will have nothing to do with mr farnabyunless i find that his wifes money is not at her own disposal what you heard in the kitchen has altered all my plans wait a minuteand you will see what i am driving at how much do you think mrs farnaby would give me if i found that lost daughter of hers  phoebe suddenly stood still and looked at the sordid scoundrel who was tempting her in blank amazement  but nobody knows where the daughter is she objected  you and i know that the daughter has a deformity in her left foot jervy replied and you and i know exactly in what part of the foot it is theres not only money to be made out of that knowledgebut money made easily without the slightest risk suppose i managed the matter by correspondence without appearing in it personally dont you think mrs farnaby would open her purse beforehand if i mentioned the exact position of that little deformity as a proof that i was to be depended on  phoebe was unable or unwilling to draw the obvious conclusion even now  but what would you do she said when mrs farnaby insisted on seeing her daughter  there was something in the girls tonehalf fearful half suspiciouswhich warned jervy that he was treading on dangerous ground he knew perfectly well what he proposed to do in the case that had been so plainly put him it was the simplest thing in the world he had only to make an appointment with mrs farnaby for a meeting on a future day and to take to flight in the interval leaving a polite note behind him to say that it was all a mistake and that he regretted being too poor to return the money having thus far acknowledged the design he had in view could he still venture on answering his companion without reserve phoebe was vain phoebe was vindictive and more promising still phoebe was a fool but she was not yet capable of consenting to an act of the vilest infamy in cold blood jervy looked at herand saw that the foreseen necessity for lying had come at last  thats just the difficulty he said thats just where i dont see my way plainly yet can you advise me  phoebe started and drew back from him i advise you she exclaimed it frightens me to think of it if you make her believe she is going to see her daughter and if she finds out that you have robbed and deceived her i can tell you thiswith her furious temperyou would drive her mad  jervys reply was a model of wellacted indignation dont talk of anything so horrible he exclaimed if you believe me capable of such cruelty as that go to mrs farnaby and warn her at once  its too bad to speak to me in that way phoebe rejoined with the frank impetuosity of an offended woman you know i would die rather than get you into trouble beg my pardon directlyor i wont walk another step with you  jervy made the necessary apologies with all possible humility he had gained his endhe could now postpone any further discussion of the subject without arousing phoebes distrust let us say no more about it for the present he suggested we will think it over and talk of pleasanter things in the mean time kiss me my dear girl theres nobody looking  so he made peace with his sweetheart and secured to himself at the same time the full liberty of future action of which he stood in need if phoebe asked any more questions the necessary answer was obvious to the meanest capacity he had merely to say the matter is beset with difficulties which i didnt see at firsti have given it up  their nearest way back to phoebes lodgings took them through the street which led to the hampden institution passing along the opposite side of the road they saw the private door opened two men stepped out a third man inside called after one of them mr goldenheart you have left the statement of receipts in the waitingroom never mind amelius answered the nights receipts are so small that i would rather not be reminded of them again in my country a third voice remarked if he had lectured as he has lectured tonight i reckon id have given him three hundred dollars gold sixty pounds english currency and have made my own profit by the transaction the british nation has lost its taste sir for intellectual recreation i wish you good evening  jervy hurried phoebe out of the way just as the two gentlemen were crossing the street he had not forgotten events at tadmorand he was by no means eager to renew his former acquaintance with amelius    chapter 6  rufus and his young friend walked together silently as far as a large square here they stopped having reached the point at which it was necessary to take different directions on their way home  ive a word of advice my son for your private ear said the new englander the barometer behind your waistcoat points to a downhearted state of the moral atmosphere come along to home with meyou want a whisky cocktail badly  no thank you my dear fellow amelius answered a little sadly i own im downhearted as you say you see i expected this lecture to be a new opening for me personally as you know i dont care two straws about money but my marriage depends on my adding to my income and the first attempt ive made to do it has ended in a total failure im all abroad again when i look to the futureand im afraid im fool enough to let it weigh on my spirits no the cocktail isnt the right remedy for me i dont get the exercise and fresh air here that i used to get at tadmor my head burns after all that talking tonight a good long walk will put me right and nothing else will  rufus at once offered to accompany him amelius shook his head did you ever walk a mile in your life when you could ride he asked goodhumouredly i mean to be on my legs for four or five hours i should only have to send you home in a cab thank you old fellow for the brotherly interest you take in me ill breakfast with you tomorrow at your hotel good night  some curious prevision of evil seemed to trouble the mind of the good new englander he held amelius fast by the hand he said very earnestly it goes against the grit with me to see you wandering off by yourself at this time of nightit does i tell you do me a favour for once my bright boygo right away to bed  amelius laughed and released his hand i shouldnt sleep if i did go to bed breakfast tomorrow at ten oclock goodnight again  he started on his walk at a pace which set pursuit on the part of rufus at defiance the american stood watching him until he was lost to sight in the darkness what a grip that young fellow has got on me in no more than a few months rufus thought as he slowly turned away in the direction of his hotel lord send the poor boy may keep clear of mischief this night  meanwhile amelius walked on swiftly straight before him careless in what direction he turned his steps so long as he felt the cool air and kept moving  his thoughts were not at first occupied with the doubtful question of his marriage the lecture was still the uppermost subject in his mind he had reserved for the conclusion of his address the justification of his view of the future afforded by the widespread and frightful poverty among the millions of the population of london alone on this melancholy theme he had spoken with the eloquence of true feeling and had produced a strong impression even on those members of the audience who were most resolutely opposed to the opinions which he advocated without any undue exercise of selfesteem he could look back on the close of his lecture with the conviction that he had really done justice to himself and to his cause the retrospect of the public discussion that had followed failed to give him the same pleasure his warm temper his vehemently sincere belief in the truth of his own convictions placed him at a serious disadvantage towards the more selfrestrained speakers all older than himself who rose one after another to combat his views more than once he had lost his temper and had been obliged to make his apologies more than once he had been indebted to the ready help of rufus who had taken part in the battle of words with the generous purpose of covering his retreat no he thought to himself with bitter humility im not fit for public discussions if they put me into parliament tomorrow i should only get called to order and do nothing  he reached the bank of the thames at the eastward end of the strand  walking straight on as absently as ever he crossed waterloo bridge and followed the broad street that lay before him on the other side he was thinking of the future again regina was in his mind now the one prospect that he could see of a tranquil and happy lifewith duties as well as pleasures duties that might rouse him to find the vocation for which he was fitwas the prospect of his marriage what was the obstacle that stood in his way the vile obstacle of money the contemptible spirit of ostentation which forbade him to live humbly on his own sufficient little income and insisted that he should purchase domestic happiness at the price of the tawdry splendour of a rich tradesman and his friends and regina who was free to follow her own better impulsesregina whose heart acknowledged him as its masterbowed before the golden image which was the tutelary deity of her uncles household and said resignedly love must wait  still walking blindly on he was roused on a sudden to a sense of passing events crossing a sidestreet at the moment a man caught him roughly by the arm and saved him from being run over the man had a broom in his hand he was a crossingsweeper i think ive earned my penny sir he said  amelius gave him halfacrown the man shouldered his broom and tossed up the money in a transport of delight heres something to go home with he cried as he caught the halfcrown again  have you got a family at home amelius asked  only one sir said the man the others are all dead shes as good a girl and as pretty a girl as ever put on a petticoatthough i say it that shouldnt thank you kindly sir good night  amelius looked after the poor fellow happy at least for that night if i had only been lucky enough to fall in love with the crossingsweepers daughter he thought bitterly she would have married me when i asked her  he looked along the street it curved away in the distance with no visible limit to it arrived at the next sidestreet on his left amelius turned down it weary of walking longer in the same direction whither it might lead him he neither knew nor cared in his present humour it was a pleasurable sensation to feel himself lost in london  the short street suddenly widened a blaze of flaring gaslight dazzled his eyes he heard all round him the shouting of innumerable voices for the first time since he had been in london he found himself in one of the streetmarkets of the poor  on either side of the road the barrows of the costermongersthe wandering tradesmen of the highwaywere drawn up in rows and every man was advertising his wares by means of the cheap publicity of his own voice fish and vegetables pottery and writingpaper lookingglasses saucepans and coloured printsall appealed together to the scantily filled purses of the crowds who thronged the pavement one lusty vagabond stood up in a rickety donkeycart kneedeep in apples selling a great wooden measure full for a penny and yelling louder than all the rest never was such apples sold in the public streets before sweet as flowers and sound as a bell who says the poor aint looked after cried the fellow with ferocious irony when they can have such applesauce as this to their loin of pork heres nobby apples heres a pennorth for your money sold again hullo you you look hungry catch theres an apple for nothing just to taste be in time be in time before theyre all sold amelius moved forward a few steps and was half deafened by rival butchers shouting buy buy buy to audiences of ragged women who fingered the meat doubtfully with longing eyes a little fartherand there was a blind man selling staylaces and singing a psalm and beyond him again a brokendown soldier playing god save the queen on a tin flageolet the one silent person in this sordid carnival was a lascar beggar with a printed placard round his neck addressed to the charitable public he held a tallow candle to illuminate the copious narrative of his misfortunes and the one reader he obtained was a fat man who scratched his head and remarked to amelius that he didnt like foreigners starving boys and girls lurked among the costermongers barrows and begged piteously on pretence of selling cigarlights and comic songs furious women stood at the doors of publichouses and railed on their drunken husbands for spending the housemoney in gin a thicker crowd towards the middle of the street poured in and out at the door of a cookshop here the people presented a less terrible spectaclethey were even touching to see these were the patient poor who bought hot morsels of sheeps heart and liver at a penny an ounce with lamentable little mouthfuls of peaspudding greens and potatoes at a halfpenny each pale children in corners supped on penny basins of soup and looked with hungry admiration at their enviable neighbours who could afford to buy stewed eels for twopence everywhere there was the same noble resignation to their hard fate in old and young alike no impatience no complaints in this wretched place the language of true gratitude was still to be heard thanking the goodnatured cook for a little spoonful of gravy thrown in for nothingand here humble mercy that had its one superfluous halfpenny to spare gave that halfpenny to utter destitution and gave it with right goodwill amelius spent all his shillings and sixpences in doubling and trebling the poor little pennyworths of foodand left the place with tears in his eyes  he was near the end of the street by this time the sight of the misery about him and the sense of his own utter inability to remedy it weighed heavily on his spirits he thought of the peaceful and prosperous life at tadmor were his happy brethren of the community and these miserable people about him creatures of the same allmerciful god the terrible doubts which come to all thinking menthe doubts which are not to be stifled by crying oh fie in a pulpitrose darkly in his mind he quickened his pace let me let out of it he said to himself let me get out of it     book the sixth filia dolorosa    chapter 1  amelius found it no easy matter to pass quickly through the people loitering and gossiping about him there was greater freedom for a rapid walker in the road he was on the point of stepping off the pavement when a voice behind hima sweet soft voice though it spoke very faintlysaid are you goodnatured sir  he turned and found himself face to face with one of the saddest sisterhood on earththe sisterhood of the streets  his heart ached as he looked at her she was so poor and so young the lost creature had to all appearance barely passed the boundary between childhood and girlhoodshe could hardly be more than fifteen or sixteen years old her eyes of the purest and loveliest blue rested on amelius with a vacantly patient look like the eyes of a suffering child the soft oval outline of her face would have been perfect if the cheeks had been filled out they were wasted and hollow and sadly pale her delicate lips had none of the rosy colour of youth and her finely modelled chin was disfigured by a piece of plaster covering some injury she was little and thin her worn and scanty clothing showed her frail youthful figure still waiting for its perfection of growth her pretty little bare hands were reddened by the raw night air she trembled as amelius looked at her in silence with compassionate wonder but for the words in which she had accosted him it would have been impossible to associate her with the lamentable life that she led the appearance of the girl was artlessly virginal and innocent she looked as if she had passed through the contamination of the streets without being touched by it without fearing it or feeling it or understanding it robed in pure white with her gentle blue eyes raised to heaven a painter might have shown her on his canvas as a saint or an angel and the critical world would have said here is the true idealraphael himself might have painted this  you look very pale said amelius are you ill  no sironly hungry  her eyes half closed she reeled from sheer weakness as she said the words amelius held her up and looked round him they were close to a stall at which coffee and slices of breadandbutter were sold he ordered some coffee to be poured out and offered her the food she thanked him and tried to eat i cant help it sir she said faintly the bread dropped from her hand her weary head sank on his shoulder  two young womenolder members of the sad sisterhoodwere passing at the moment shes too far gone sir to eat said one of them i know what would do her good if you dont mind going into a publichouse  where is it said amelius be quick  one of the women led the way the other helped amelius to support the girl they entered the crowded publichouse in less than a minute the first woman had forced her way through the drunken customers at the bar and had returned with a glass of portwine and cloves the girl revived as the stimulant passed her lips she opened her innocent blue eyes again in vague surprise i shant die this time she said quietly  a corner of the place was not occupied a small empty cask stood there amelius made the poor creature sit down and rest a little he had only gold in his purse and when the woman had paid for the wine he offered her some of the change she declined to take it ive got a shilling or two sir she said and i can take care of myself give it to simple sally  youll save her a beating sir for one night at least said the other woman we call her simple sally because shes a little soft poor soulhasnt grown up you know in her mind since she was a child give her some of your change sir and youll be doing a kind thing  all that is most unselfish all that is most divinely compassionate and selfsacrificing in a womans nature was as beautiful and as undefiled as ever in these womenthe outcasts of the hard highway  amelius turned to the girl her head had sunk on her bosom she was half asleep she looked up as he approached her  would you have been beaten tonight he asked if you had not met with me  father always beats me sir said simple sally if i dont bring money home he threw a knife at me last night it didnt hurt muchit only cut me here said the girl pointing to the plaster on her chin  one of the women touched amelius on the shoulder and whispered to him hes no more her father sir than i am shes a helpless creatureand he takes advantage of her if i only had a place to take her to he should never set eyes on her again show the gentleman your bosom sally  she opened her poor threadbare little shawl over the lovely girlish breast still only growing to the rounded beauty of womanhood there was a hideous blueblack bruise simple sally smiled and said that did hurt me sir id rather have the knife  some of the nearest drinkers at the bar looked round and laughed amelius tenderly drew the shawl over the girls cold bosom for gods sake let us get away from this place he said  the influence of the cool night air completed simple sallys recovery she was able to eat now amelius proposed retracing his steps to the provisionshop and giving her the best food that the place afforded she preferred the breadandbutter at the coffeestall those thick slices piled up on the plate tempted her as a luxury on trying the luxury one slice satisfied her i thought i was hungry enough to eat the whole plateful said the girl turning away from the stall in the vacantly submissive manner which it saddened amelius to see he bought more of the breadandbutter on the chance that her appetite might revive while he was wrapping it in a morsel of paper one of her elder companions touched him and whispered there he is sir amelius looked at her the brute who calls himself her father the woman explained impatiently  amelius turned and saw simple sally with her arm in the grasp of a halfdrunken ruffian one of the swarming wild beasts of low london dirtied down from head to foot to the colour of the street mudthe living danger and disgrace of english civilization as amelius eyed him he drew the girl away a step or two youve got a gentleman this time he said to her i shall expect gold tonight or else he finished the sentence by lifting his monstrous fist and shaking it in her face cautiously as he had lowered his tones in speaking the words had reached the keenly sensitive ears of amelius urged by his hot temper he sprang forward in another moment he would have knocked the brute downbut for the timely interference of the arm of the law clad in a policemans greatcoat dont get yourself into trouble sir said the man goodhumouredly now you hellfire thats the nice name they know him by sir in these parts be off with you the wild beast on two legs cowered at the voice of authority like the wild beast on four he was lost to sight at the dark end of the street in a moment  i saw him threaten her with his fist said amelius his eyes still aflame with indignation he has bruised her frightfully on the breast is there no protection for the poor creature  well sir the policeman answered you can summon him if you like i dare say hed get a months hard labour but dont you see it would be all the worse for her when he came out of prison  the policemans view of the girls position was beyond dispute amelius turned to her gently she was shivering with cold or terror perhaps with both tell me he said is that man really your father  lord bless you sir interposed the policeman astonished at the gentlemans simplicity simple sally hasnt got father or motherhave you my girl  she paid no heed to the policeman the sorrow and sympathy plainly visible in amelius filled her with a childish interest and surprise she dimly understood that it was sorrow and sympathy for her the bare idea of distressing this new friend so unimaginably kind and considerate seemed to frighten her dont fret about me sir she said timidly i dont mind having no father nor mother i dont mind being beaten she appealed to the nearest of her two womenfriends we get used to everything dont we jenny  amelius could bear no more its enough to break ones heart to hear you and see you he burst outand suddenly turned his head aside his generous nature was touched to the quick he could only control himself by an effort of resolution that shook him body and soul i cant and wont let that unfortunate creature go back to be beaten and starved he said passionately addressing himself to the policeman oh look at her how helpless and how young  the policeman stared these were strange words to him but all true emotion carries with it among all true people its own title to respect he spoke to amelius with marked respect  its a hard case sir no doubt he said the girls a quiet welldisposed creatureand the other two there are the same theyre of the sort that keep to themselves and dont drink they all of them do well enough as long as they dont let the liquor overcome them half the time its the mens fault when they do drink perhaps the workhouse might take her in for the night whats this youve got girl in your hand money  amelius hastened to say that he had given her the money the workhouse he repeated the very sound of it is horrible  make your mind easy sir said the policeman they wont take her in at the workhouse with money in her hand  in sheer despair amelius asked helplessly if there was no hotel near the policeman pointed to simple sallys threadbare and scanty clothes and left them to answer the question for themselves theres a place they call a coffeehouse he said with the air of a man who thought he had better provoke as little further inquiry on that subject as possible  too completely preoccupied or too innocent in the ways of london to understand the man amelius decided on trying the coffeehouse a suspicious old woman met them at the door and spied the policeman in the background without waiting for any inquiries she said all full for tonightand shut the door in their faces  is there no other place said amelius  theres a lodginghouse the policeman answered more doubtfully than ever its getting late sir and im afraid youll find em packed like herrings in a barrel come and see for yourself  he led the way into a wretchedly lighted bystreet and knocked with his foot on a trapdoor in the pavement the door was pushed open from below by a sturdy boy with a dirty nightcap on his head  any of em wanted tonight sir asked the sturdy boy the moment he saw the policeman  what does he mean said amelius  theres a sprinkling of thieves among them sir the policeman explained stand out of the way jacob and let the gentleman look in  he produced his lantern and directed the light downwards as he spoke amelius looked in the policemans figure of speech likening the lodgers to herrings in a barrel accurately described the scene on the floor of a kitchen men women and children lay all huddled together in closely packed rows ghastly faces rose terrified out of the seething obscurity when the light of the lantern fell on them the stench drove amelius back sickened and shuddering  hows the sore place on your head jacob the policeman inquired this is a civil boy he explained to amelius and i like to encourage him  im getting better sir as fast as i can said the boy  good night jacob  good night sir the trapdoor felland the lodginghouse disappeared like the vision of a frightful dream  there was a moment of silence among the little group on the pavement it was not easy to solve the question of what to do next there seems to be some difficulty the policeman remarked about housing this girl for the night  why shouldnt we take her along with us one of the women suggested she wont mind sleeping three in a bed i know  what are you thinking of the other woman remonstrated when he finds she dont come home our place will be the first place he looks for her in  amelius settled the difficulty in his own headlong way ill take care of her for the night he said sally will you trust yourself with me  she put her hand in his with the air of a child who was ready to go home her wan face brightened for the first time thank you sir she said ill go anywhere along with you  the policeman smiled the two women looked thunderstruck before they had recovered themselves amelius forced them to take some money from him and cordially shook hands with them youre good creatures he said in his eager hearty way im sincerely sorry for you now mr policeman show me where to find a caband take that for the trouble i am giving you youre a humane man and a credit to the force  in five minutes more amelius was on the way to his lodgings with simple sally by his side the act of reckless imprudence which he was committing was nothing but an act of christian duty to his mind not the slightest misgiving troubled him i shall provide for her in some way he thought to himself cheerfully he looked at her the weary outcast was asleep already in her corner of the cab from time to time she still shivered even in her sleep amelius took off his greatcoat and covered her with it how some of his friends at the club would have laughed if they had seen him at that moment  he was obliged to wake her when the cab stopped his key admitted them to the house he lit his candle in the hall and led her up the stairs youll soon be asleep again sally he whispered  she looked round the little sittingroom with drowsy admiration what a pretty place to live in she said  are you hungry again amelius asked  she shook her head and took off her shabby bonnet her pretty lightbrown hair fell about her face and her shoulders i think im too tired sir to be hungry might i take the sofapillow and lay down on the hearthrug  amelius opened the door of his bedroom you are to pass the night more comfortably than that he answered there is a bed for you here  she followed him in and looked round the bedroom with renewed admiration of everything that she saw at the sight of the hairbrushes and the comb she clapped her hands in ecstasy oh how different from mine she exclaimed is the comb tortoiseshell sir like one sees in the shopwindows the bath and the towels attracted her next she stood looking at them with longing eyes completely forgetful of the wonderful comb ive often peeped into the ironmongers shops she said and thought i should be the happiest girl in the world if i had such a bath as that a little pitcher is all i have got of my own and they swear at me when i want it filled more than once in all my life i have never had as much water as i should like she paused and thought for a moment the forlorn vacant look appeared again and dimmed the beauty of her blue eyes it will be hard to go back after seeing all these pretty things she said to herselfand sighed with that inborn submission to her fate so melancholy to see in a creature so young  you shall never go back again to that dreadful life amelius interposed never speak of it never think of it any more oh dont look at me like that  she was listening with an expression of pain and with both her hands lifted to her head there was something so wonderful in the idea which he had suggested to her that her mind was not able to take it all in at once you make my head giddy she said im such a poor stupid girli feel out of myself like when a gentleman like you sets me thinking of new things would you mind saying it again sir  ill say it tomorrow morning amelius rejoined kindly you are tired sallygo to rest  she roused herself and looked at the bed is that your bed sir  its your bed tonight said amelius i shall sleep on the sofa in the next room  her eyes rested on him for a moment in speechless surprise she looked back again at the bed are you going to leave me by myself she asked wonderingly not the faintest suggestion of immodestynothing that the most profligate man living could have interpreted impurelyshowed itself in her look or manner as she said those words  amelius thought of what one of her womenfriends had told him she hasnt grown up you know in her mind since she was a child there were other senses in the poor victim that were still undeveloped besides the mental sense he was at a loss how to answer her with the respect which was due to that allatoning ignorance his silence amazed and frightened her  have i said anything to make you angry with me she asked  amelius hesitated no longer my poor girl he said i pity you from the bottom of my heart sleep well simple sallysleep well he left her hurriedly and shut the door between them  she followed him as far as the closed door and stood there alone trying to understand him and trying all in vain after a while she found courage enough to whisper through the door if you please sir she stopped startled by her own boldness he never heard her he was standing at the window looking out thoughtfully at the night feeling less confident of the future already she still stood at the door wretched in the firm persuasion that she had offended him once she lifted her hand to knock at the door and let it drop again at her side a second time she made the effort and desperately summoned the resolution to knock he opened the door directly  im very sorry if i said anything wrong she began faintly her breath coming and going in quick hysteric gasps please forgive me and wish me good night amelius took her hand he said good night with the utmost gentleness but he said it sorrowfully she was not quite comforted yet would you mind sir she paused awkwardly afraid to go on there was something so completely childlike in the artless perplexity of her eyes that amelius smiled the change in his expression gave her back her courage in an instant her pale delicate lips reflected his smile prettily would you mind giving me a kiss sir she said amelius kissed her let the man who can honestly say he would have done otherwise blame him he shut the door between them once more she was quite happy now he heard her singing to herself as she got ready for bed  once in the wakeful watches of the night she startled him he heard a cry of pain or terror in the bedroom what is it he asked through the door what has frightened you there was no answer after a minute or two the cry was repeated he opened the door and looked in she was sleeping and dreaming as she slept one little thin white arm was lifted in the air and waved restlessly to and fro over her head dont kill me she murmured in low moaning tonesoh dont kill me amelius took her arm gently and laid it back on the coverlet of the bed his touch seemed to exercise some calming influence over her she sighed and turned her head on the pillow a faint flush rose on her wasted cheeks and passed away againshe sank quietly into dreamless sleep  amelius returned to his sofa and fell into a broken slumber the hours of the night passed the sad light of the november morning dawned mistily through the uncurtained window and woke him  he started up and looked at the bedroom door now what is to be done that was his first thought on waking he was beginning to feel his responsibilities at last   chapter 2  the landlady of the lodgings decided what was to be done  you will be so good sir as to leave my apartments immediately she said to amelius i make no claim to the weeks rent in consideration of the short notice this is a respectable house and it shall be kept respectable at any sacrifice  amelius explained and protested he appealed to the landladys sense of justice and sense of duty as a christian woman  the reasoning which would have been irresistible at tadmor was reasoning completely thrown away in london the landlady remained as impenetrable as the egyptian sphinx if that creature in the bedroom is not out of my house in an hours time i shall send for the police having answered her lodgers arguments in those terms she left the room and banged the door after her  thank you sir for being so kind to me ill go away directlyand then perhaps the lady will forgive you  amelius looked round simple sally had heard it all she was dressed in her wretched clothes and was standing at the open bedroom door crying  wait a little said amelius wiping her eyes with his own handkerchief and we will go away together i want to get you some better clothes and i dont exactly know how to set about it dont cry my deardont cry  the deaf maidofallwork came in as he spoke she too was in tears amelius had been good to her in many little waysand she was the guilty person who had led to the discovery in the bedroom if you had only told me sir she said pentitently id have kep it secret but there i went in with your ot water as usual and o lor i was that startled i dropped the jug and run downstairs again  amelius stopped the further progress of the apology i dont blame you maria he said im in a difficulty help me out of it and you will do me a kindness  maria partially heard him and no more afraid of reaching the landladys ears as well as the maids ears if he raised his voice he asked if she could read writing yes she could read writing if it was plain amelius immediately reduced the expression of his necessities to writing in large text maria was delighted she knew the nearest shop at which readymade outer clothing for women could be obtained and nothing was wanted as a certain guide to an ignorant man but two pieces of string with one piece she measured simple sallys height and with the other she took the slender girth of the girls waistwhile amelius opened his writingdesk and supplied himself with the last sum of spare money that he possessed he had just closed the desk again when the voice of the merciless landlady was heard calling imperatively for maria  the maidofallwork handed the two indicative strings to amelius theyll elp you at the shop she saidand shuffled out of the room  amelius turned to simple sally i am going to get you some new clothes he began  the girl stopped him there she was incapable of listening to a word more every trace of sorrow vanished from her face in an instant she clapped her hands oh she cried new clothes clean clothes let me go with you  even amelius saw that it was impossible to take her out in the streets with him in broad daylight dressed as she was then no no he said wait here till you get your new things i wont be half an hour gone lock yourself in if youre afraid and open the door to nobody till i come back  sally hesitated she began to look frightened  think of the new dress and the pretty bonnet suggested amelius speaking unconsciously in the tone in which he might have promised a toy to a child  he had taken the right way with her her face brightened again ill do anything you tell me she said  he put the key in her hand and was out in the street directly  amelius possessed one valuable moral quality which is exceedingly rare among englishmen he was not in the least ashamed of putting himself in a ridiculous position when he was conscious that his own motives justified him the smiling and tittering of the shopwomen when he stated the nature of his errand and produced his two pieces of string failed to annoy him in the smallest degree he laughed too funny isnt it he said a man like me buying gowns and the rest of it she cant come herselfand youll advise me like good creatures wont you they advised their handsome young customer to such good purpose that he was in possession of a gray walking costume a black cloth jacket a plain lavendercoloured bonnet a pair of black gloves and a paper of pins in little more than ten minutes time the nearest trunkmaker supplied a travellingbox to hold all these treasures and a passing cab took amelius back to his lodgings just as the halfhour was out but one event had happened during his absence the landlady had knocked at the door had called through it in a terrible voice half an hour more and had retired again without waiting for an answer  amelius carried the box into the bedroom be as quick as you can sally he saidand left her alone to enjoy the full rapture of discovering the new clothes  when she opened the door and showed herself the change was so wonderful that amelius was literally unable to speak to her joy flushed her pale cheeks and diffused its tender radiance over her pure blue eyes a more charming little creature in that momentary transfiguration of pride and delight no mans eyes ever looked on she ran across the room to amelius and threw her arms round his neck let me be your servant she cried i want to live with you all my life jump me up im wildi want to fly through the window she caught sight of herself in the lookingglass and suddenly became composed and serious oh she said with the quaintest mixture of awe and astonishment was there ever such another bonnet as this do look at itdo please look at it  amelius goodnaturedly approached to look at it at the same moment the sittingroom door was opened without any preliminary ceremony of knockingand rufus walked into the room its half after ten he said and the breakfast is spoiling as fast as it can  before amelius could make his excuses for having completely forgotten his engagement rufus discovered sally no woman young or old high in rank or low in rank ever found the new englander unprepared with his own characteristic acknowledgment of the debt of courtesy which he owed to the sex with his customary vast strides he marched up to sally and insisted on shaking hands with her how do you find yourself miss i take pleasure in making your acquaintance the girl turned to amelius with wideeyed wonder and doubt go into the next room sally for a minute or two he said this gentleman is a friend of mine and i have something to say to him  thats an active little girl said rufus looking after her as she ran to the friendly shelter of the bedroom reminds me of one of our girls at coolspringshe does well now and who may sally be  amelius answered the question as usual without the slightest reserve rufus waited in impenetrable silence until he had completed his narrativethen took him gently by the arm and led him to the window with his hands in his pockets and his long legs planted wide apart on his big feet the american carefully studied the face of his young friend under the strongest light that could fall on it  no said rufus speaking quietly to himself the boy is not raving mad so far as i can see he has every appearance on him of meaning what he says and this is what comes of the community of tadmor is it well civil and religious liberty is dearly purchased sometimes in the united statesand thats a fact  amelius turned away to pack his portmanteau i dont understand you he said  i dont suppose you do rufus remarked i am at a similar loss myself to understand you my store of sensible remarks is copious on most occasionsbut im darned if i aint dried up in the face of this might i venture to ask what that venerable chief christian at tadmor would say to the predicament in which i find my young socialist this morning  what would he say amelius repeated just what he said when mellicent first came among us ah dear me another of the fallen leaves i wish i had the dear old man here to help me he would know how to restore that poor starved outraged beaten creature to the happy place on gods earth which god intended her to fill  rufus abruptly took him by the hand you mean that he said  what else could i mean amelius rejoined sharply  bring her right away to breakfast at the hotel cried rufus with every appearance of feeling infinitely relieved i dont say i can supply you with the venerable chief christianbut i can find a woman to fix you who is as nigh to being an angel barring the wings as any shecreature since the time of mother eve he knocked at the bedroom door turning a deaf ear to every appeal for further information which amelius could address to him breakfast is waiting miss he called out and im bound to tell you that the temper of the cook at our hotel is a long way on the wrong side of uncertain well amelius this is the age of exhibition if theres ever an exhibition of ignorance in the business of packing a portmanteau you run for the gold medaland a unanimous jury will vote it i reckon to a young man from tadmor clear out will you and leave it to me  he pulled off his coat and conquered the difficulties of packing in a hurry as if he had done nothing else all his life the landlady herself appearing with pitiless punctuality exactly at the expiration of the hour smoothed her horrid front in the polite and placable presence of rufus he insisted on shaking hands with her he took pleasure in making her acquaintance she reminded him he did assure her of the lady of the captaingeneral of the coolspring branch of the st vitus commandery and he would take the liberty to inquire whether they were related or not under cover of this fashionable conversation simple sally was taken out of the room by amelius without attracting notice she insisted on carrying her threadbare old clothes away with her in the box which had contained the new dress i want to look at them sometimes she said and think how much better off i am now rufus was the last to take his departure he persisted in talking to the landlady all the way down the stairs and out to the street door  while amelius was waiting for his friend on the housesteps a young man driving by in a cab leaned out and looked at him the young man was jervy on his way from mr ronalds tombstone to doctors commons   chapter 3  with a rapid succession of events the morning had begun with a rapid succession of events the day went on  the breakfast being over rooms at the hotel were engaged by rufus for his two young friends after this the next thing to be done was to provide simple sally with certain necessary but invisible articles of clothing which amelius had never thought of a note to the nearest shop produced the speedy arrival of a smart lady accompanied by a boy and a large basket there was some difficulty in persuading sally to trust herself alone in her room with the stranger she was afraid poor soul of everybody but amelius even the good american failed to win her confidence the distrust implanted in her feeble mind by the terrible life that she had led was the instinctive distrust of a wild animal why must i go among other people she whispered piteously to amelius i only want to be with you it was as completely useless to reason with her as it would have been to explain the advantages of a comfortable cage to a newly caught bird there was but one way of inducing her to submit to the most gently exerted interference amelius had only to say do it sally to please me and sally sighed and did it  in her absence amelius reiterated his inquiries in relation to that unknown friend whom rufus had not scrupled to describe as an angelbarring the wings  the lady in question the american briefly explained was an englishwomanthe wife of one of his countrymen established in london as a merchant he had known them both intimately before their departure from the united states and the old friendship had been cordially renewed on his arrival in england associated with many other charitable institutions mrs payson was one of the managing committee of a home for friendless women especially adapted to receive poor girls in sallys melancholy position rufus offered to write a note to mrs payson inquiring at what hour she could receive his friend and himself and obtain permission for them to see the home amelius after some hesitation accepted the proposal the messenger had not been long despatched with the note before the smart person from the shop made her appearance once more reporting that the young ladys outfit had been perfectly arranged and presenting the inevitable result in the shape of a bill the last farthing of ready money in the possession of amelius proved to be insufficient to discharge the debt he accepted a loan from rufus until he could give his bankers the necessary order to sell out some of his money invested in the funds his answer when rufus protested against this course was characteristic of the teaching which he owed to the community my dear fellow i am bound to return the money you have lent to mein the interests of our poor brethren the next friend who borrows of you may not have the means of paying you back  after waiting for the return of simple sally and waiting in vain amelius sent a chambermaid to her room with a message to her rufus disapproved of this hasty proceeding why disturb the girl at her lookingglass asked the old bachelor with his quaintly humorous smile  sally came in with no bright pleasure in her eyes this time the girl looked worn and haggard she drew amelius away into a corner and whispered to him i get a pain sometimes where the bruise is she said and ive got it bad now she glanced with an odd furtive jealousy at rufus i kept away from you she explained because i didnt want him to know she stopped and put her hand on her bosom and clenched her teeth fast never mind she said cheerfully as the pang passed away again i can bear it  amelius acting on impulse as usual instantly ordered the most comfortable carriage that the hotel possessed he had heard terrible stories of the possible result of an injury to a womans bosom i shall take her to the best doctor in london he announced sally whispered to him againstill with her eye on rufus is he going with us she asked no said amelius one of us must stay here to receive a message rufus looked after them very gravely as the two left the room together  applying for information to the mistress of the hotel amelius obtained the address of a consulting surgeon of great celebrity while sally was getting ready to go out  why dont you like my good friend upstairs he said to the girl as they drove away from the house the answer came swift and straight from the heart of the daughter of eve because you like him amelius changed the subject he asked if she was still in pain she shook her head impatiently pain or no pain the uppermost idea in her mind was still that idea of being his servant which had already found expression in words before they left the lodgings will you let me keep my beautiful new dress for going out on sundays she asked the shabby old things will do when i am your servant i can black your boots and brush your clothes and keep your room tidyand i will try hard to learn if you will have me taught to cook amelius attempted to change the subject again he might as well have talked to her in an unknown tongue the glorious prospect of being his servant absorbed the whole of her attention im little and im stupid she went on but i do think i could learn to cook if i knew i was doing it for you she paused and looked at him anxiously do let me try she pleaded i havent had much pleasure in my lifeand i should like it so it was impossible to resist this you shall be as happy as i can make you sally amelius answered god knows it isnt much you ask for  something in those compassionate words set her thinking in another direction it was sad to see how slowly and painfully she realized the idea that had been suggested to her  i wonder whether you can make me happy she said i suppose i have been happy before thisbut i dont know when i dont remember a time when i was not hungry or cold wait a bit i do think i was happy once it was a long while ago and it took me a weary time to do itbut i did learn at last to play a tune on the fiddle the old man and his wife took it in turns to teach me somebody gave me to the old man and his wife i dont know who it was and i dont remember their names they were musicians in the fine streets they sang hymns and in the poor streets they sang comic songs it was cold to be sure standing barefoot on the pavementbut i got plenty of halfpence the people said i was so little it was a shame to send me out and so i got halfpence i had bread and apples for supper and a nice little corner under the staircase to sleep in do you know i do think i did enjoy myself at that time she concluded still a little doubtful whether those faint and faroff remembrances were really to be relied on  amelius tried to lead her to other recollections he asked her how old she was when she played the fiddle  i dont know she answered i dont know how old i am now i dont remember anything before the fiddle i cant call to mind how long it was firstbut there came a time when the old man and his wife got into trouble they went to prison and i never saw them afterwards i ran away with the fiddle to get the halfpence you know all to myself i think i should have got a deal of money if it hadnt been for the boys theyre so cruel the boys are they broke my fiddle i tried selling pencils after that but people didnt seem to want pencils they found me out begging i got took up and brought before the whatdoyoucallhimthe gentleman who sits in a high place you know behind a desk oh but i was frightened when they took me before the gentleman he looked very much puzzled he says bring her up here shes so small i can hardly see her he says good god what am i to do with this unfortunate child there was plenty of people about one of them says the workhouse ought to take her and a lady came in and she says ill take her sir if youll let me and he knew her and he let her she took me to a place they called a refugefor wandering children you know it was very strict at the refuge they did give us plenty to eat to be sure and they taught us lessons they told us about our father up in heaven i said a wrong thingi said i dont want him up in heaven i want him down here they were very much ashamed of me when i said that i was a bad girl i turned ungrateful after a time i ran away you see it was so strict and i was so used to the streets i met with a scotchman in the streets he wore a kilt and played the pipes he taught me to dance and dressed me up like a scotch girl he had a curious wife a sort of halfblack woman she used to dance tooon a bit of carpet you know so as not to spoil her fine shoes they taught me songs he taught me a scotch song and one day his wife said she was english i dont know how that was being a halfblack woman and i should learn an english song and they quarrelled about it and she had her way she taught me sally in our alley thats how i come to be called sally i hadnt any name of my owni always had nicknames sally was the last of them and sally has stuck to me i hope it isnt too common a name to please you oh what a fine house are we really going in will they let me in how stupid i am i forgot my beautiful clothes you wont tell them will you if they take me for a lady  the carriage had stopped at the great surgeons house the waitingroom was full of patients some of them were trying to read the books and newspapers on the table and some of them were looking at each other not only without the slightest sympathy but occasionally even with downright distrust and dislike amelius took up a newspaper and gave sally an illustrated book to amuse her while they waited to see the surgeon in their turn  two long hours passed before the servant summoned amelius to the consultingroom sally was wearily asleep in her chair he left her undisturbed having questions to put relating to the imperfectly developed state of her mind which could not be asked in her presence the surgeon listened with no ordinary interest to the young strangers simple and straightforward narrative of what had happened on the previous night you are very unlike other young men he said may i ask how you have been brought up the reply surprised him this opens quite a new view of socialism he said i thought your conduct highly imprudent at firstit seems to be the natural result of your teaching now let me see what i can do to help you  he was very grave and very gentle when sally was presented to him his opinion of the injury to her bosom relieved the anxiety of amelius there might be pain for some little time to come but there were no serious consequences to fear having written his prescription and having put several questions to sally the surgeon sent her back with marked kindness of manner to wait for amelius in the patients room  i have young daughters of my own he said when the door was closed and i cannot but feel for that unhappy creature when i contrast her life with theirs so far as i can see it the natural growth of her sensesher higher and her lower senses alikehas been stunted like the natural growth of her body by starvation terror exposure to cold and other influences inherent in the life that she has led with nourishing food pure air and above all kind and careful treatment i see no reason at her age why she should not develop into an intelligent and healthy young woman pardon me if i venture on giving you a word of advice at your time of life you will do well to place her at once under competent and proper care you may live to regret it if you are too confident in your own good motives in such a case as this come to me again if i can be of any use to you no he continued refusing to take his fee my help to that poor lost girl is help given freely he shook hands with ameliusa worthy member of the noble order to which he belonged  the surgeons parting advice following on the quaint protest of rufus had its effect on amelius he was silent and thoughtful when he got into the carriage again  simple sally looked at him with a vague sense of alarm her heart beat fast under the perpetually recurring fear that she had done something or said something to offend him was it bad behaviour in me she asked to fall asleep in the chair reassured so far she was still as anxious as ever to get at the truth after long hesitation and long previous thought she ventured to try another question the gentleman sent me out of the roomdid he say anything to set you against me  the gentleman said everything that was kind of you amelius replied and everything to make me hope that you will live to be a happy girl  she said nothing to that vague assurances were no assurances to hershe only looked at him with the dumb fidelity of a dog suddenly she dropped on her knees in the carriage hid her face in her hands and cried silently surprised and distressed he attempted to raise her and console her no she said obstinately something has happened to vex you and you wont tell me what it is do do do tell me what it is  my dear child said amelius i was only thinking anxiously about you in the time to come  she looked up at him quickly what have you forgotten already she exclaimed im to be your servant in the time to come she dried her eyes and took her place again joyously by his side you did frighten me she said and all for nothing but you didnt mean it did you  an older man might have had the courage to undeceive her amelius shrank from it he tried to lead her back to the melancholy storyso common and so terrible so pitiable in its utter absence of sentiment or romancethe story of her past life  no she answered with that quick insight where her feelings were concerned which was the only quick insight that she possessed i dont like making you sorry and you did look sorryyou didwhen i talked about it before the streets the streets the streets little girl or big girl its only the streets and always being hungry or cold and cruel men when it isnt cruel boys i want to be happy i want to enjoy my new clothes you tell me about your own self what makes you so kind i cant make it out try as i may i cant make it out  some time elapsed before they got back to the hotel amelius drove as far as the city to give the necessary instructions to his bankers  on returning to the sittingroom at last he discovered that his american friend was not alone a grayhaired lady with a bright benevolent face was talking earnestly to rufus the instant sally discovered the stranger she started back fled to the shelter of her bedchamber and locked herself in amelius entering the room after a little hesitation was presented to mrs payson  there was something in my old friends note said the lady smiling and turning to rufus which suggested to me that i should do well to answer it personally i am not too old yet to follow the impulse of the moment sometimes and i am very glad that i did so i have heard what is to me a very interesting story mr goldenheart i respect you and i will prove it by helping you with all my heart and soul to save that poor little girl who has just run away from me pray dont make excuses for her i should have run away too at her age we have arranged she continued looking again at rufus that i shall take you both to the home this afternoon if we can prevail on sally to go with us one serious obstacle in our way will be overcome tell me the number of her room i want to try if i cant make friends with her i have had some experience and i dont despair of bringing her back here hand in hand with the terrible person who has frightened her  the two men were left together amelius attempted to speak  keep it down said rufus no premature outbreak of opinion if you please yet awhile wait till she has fixed sally and shown us the paradise of the poor girls its within the london postal district and thats all i know about it well now and did you go to the doctor thunder whats come to the boy seems as though he had left his complexion in the carriage he looks i do declare as if he wanted medical tinkering himself  amelius explained that his past night had been a wakeful one and that the events of the day had not allowed him any opportunities of repose since the morning he said things have hurried so one on the top of the other that i am beginning to feel a little dazed and weary without a word of remark rufus produced the remedy the materials were ready on the sideboardhe made a cocktail  another asked the new englander after a reasonable lapse of time  amelius declined taking another he stretched himself on the sofa his good friend considerately took up a newspaper for the first time that day he had now the prospect of a quiet interval for rest and thought in less than a minute the delusive prospect vanished he started to his feet again disturbed by a new anxiety having leisure to think he had thought of regina good heavens he exclaimed shes waiting to see meand i never remembered it till this moment he looked at his watch it was five oclock what am i to do he said helplessly  rufus laid down the newspaper and considered the new difficulty in its various aspects  we are bound to go with mrs payson to the home he said and i tell you this amelius the matter of sally is not a matter to be played with its a thing thats got to be done in your place i should write politely to miss regina and put it off till tomorrow  in ninetynine cases out of a hundred a man who took rufus for his counsellor was a man who acted wisely in every sense of the word events however of which amelius and his friend were both ignorant alike had so ordered it that the americans wellmeant advice in this one exceptional case was the very worst advice that could have been given in an hour more jervy and mrs sowler were to meet at the tavern door the one last hope of protecting mrs farnaby from the abominable conspiracy of which she was the destined victim rested solely on the fulfilment by amelius of his engagement with regina for that day always ready to interfere with the progress of the courtship mrs farnaby would be especially eager to seize the first opportunity of speaking to her young socialist friend on the subject of his lecture in the course of the talk between them the idea which in the present disturbed state of his mind had not struck him yetthe idea that the outcast of the streets might by the barest conceivable possibility be identified with the lost daughterwould in one way or another be almost infallibly suggested to amelius and at the eleventh hour the conspiracy would be foiled if on the other hand the americans fatal advice was followed the next mornings post might bring a letter from jervy to mrs farnabywith this disastrous result at the first words spoken by amelius she would put an end to all further interest in the subject on his part by telling him that the lost girl had been found and found by another person  rufus pointed to the writingmaterials on a side table which he had himself used earlier in the day the needful excuse was unhappily quite easy to find a misunderstanding with his landlady had obliged amelius to leave his lodgings at an hours notice and had occupied him in trying to find a new residence for the rest of the day the note was written rufus who was nearest to the bell stretched out his hand to ring for the messenger amelius suddenly stopped him  she doesnt like me to disappoint her he said i neednt stay longi might get there and back in half an hour in a fast cab  his conscience was not quite easy the sense of having forgotten reginano matter how naturally and excusablyoppressed him with a feeling of selfreproach rufus raised no objection the hesitation of amelius was unquestionably creditable to him if you must do it my son he said do it right awayand well wait for you  amelius took up his hat the door opened as he approached it and mrs payson entered the room leading simple sally by the hand  we are all going together said the genial old lady to see my large family of daughters at the home we can have our talk in the carriage its an hours drive from this placeand i must be back again to dinner at halfpast seven  amelius and rufus looked at each other amelius thought of pleading an engagement and asking to be excused under the circumstances it was assuredly not a very gracious thing to do before he could make up his mind one way or the other sally stole to his side and put her hand on his arm mrs payson had done wonders in conquering the girls inveterate distrust of strangers and to a certain extent at least winning her confidence but no early influence could shake sallys doglike devotion to amelius her jealous instinct discovered something suspicious in his sudden silence you must go with us she said i wont go without you  certainly not mrs payson added i promised her that of course beforehand  rufus rang the bell and despatched the messenger to regina thats the one way out of it my son he whispered to amelius as they followed mrs payson and sally down the stairs of the hotel   they had just driven up to the gates of the home when jervy and his accomplice met at the tavern and entered on their consultation in a private room  in spite of her povertystricken appearance mrs sowler was not absolutely destitute in various underhand and wicked ways she contrived to put a few shillings in her pocket from week to week if she was half starved it was for the very ordinary reason among persons of her vicious class that she preferred spending her money on drink stating his business with her as reservedly and as cunningly as usual jervy found to his astonishment that even this squalid old creature presumed to bargain with him the two wretches were on the point of a quarrel which might have delayed the execution of the plot against mrs farnaby but for the vile selfcontrol which made jervy one of the most formidable criminals living he gave way on the question of moneyand from that moment he had mrs sowler absolutely at his disposal  meet me tomorrow morning to receive your instructions he said the time is ten sharp and the place is the powdermagazine in hyde park and mind this you must be decently dressedyou know where to hire the things if i smell you of spirits tomorrow morning i shall employ somebody else no not a farthing now you will have your moneyfirst instalment only mindtomorrow at ten  left by himself jervy sent for pen ink and paper using his left hand which was just as serviceable to him as his right he traced these lines  you are informed by an unknown friend that a certain lost young lady is now living in a foreign country and may be restored to her afflicted mother on receipt of a sufficient sum to pay expenses and to reward the writer of this letter who is undeservedly in distressed circumstances  are you madam the mother i ask the question in the strictest confidence knowing nothing certainly but that your husband was the person who put the young lady out to nurse in her infancy  i dont address your husband because his inhuman desertion of the poor baby does not incline me to trust him i run the risk of trusting youto a certain extentat starting shall i drop a hint which may help you to identify the child in your own mind it would be inexcusably foolish on my part to speak too plainly just yet the hint must be a vague one suppose i use a poetical expression and say that the young lady is enveloped in mystery from head to footespecially the foot  in the event of my addressing the right person i beg to offer a suggestion for a preliminary interview  if you will take a walk on the bridge over the serpentine river on kensington gardens side at halfpast ten oclock tomorrow morning holding a white handkerchief in your left hand you will meet the muchinjured woman who was deceived into taking charge of the infant child at ramsgate and will be satisfied so far that you are giving your confidence to persons who really deserve it  jervy addressed this infamous letter to mrs farnaby in an ordinary envelope marked private he posted it that night with his own hand    chapter 4  rufus i dont quite like the way you look at me you seem to think  give it tongue my son what do i seem to think  you think im forgetting regina you dont believe im just as fond of her as ever the fact is youre an old bachelor  that is so wheres the harm amelius  i dont understand  youre out there my bright boy i reckon i understand more than you think for the wisest thing you ever did in your life is what you did this evening when you committed sally to the care of those ladies at the home  good night rufus we shall quarrel if i stay here any longer  good night amelius we shant quarrel stay here as long as you like  the good deed had been done the sacrificealready a painful sacrificehad been made mrs payson was old enough to speak plainly as well as seriously to amelius of the absolute necessity of separating himself from simple sally without any needless delay you have seen for yourself she said that the plan on which this little household is ruled is the unvarying plan of patience and kindness so far as sally is concerned you can be quite sure that she will never hear a harsh word never meet with a hard look while she is under our care the lamentable neglect under which the poor creature has suffered will be tenderly remembered and atoned for here if we cant make her happy among us i promise that she shall leave the home if she wishes it in six weeks time as to yourself consider your position if you persist in taking her back with you our good friend rufus has told me that you are engaged to be married think of the misinterpretations to say the least of it to which you would subject yourselfthink of the reports which would sooner or later find their way to the young ladys ears and of the deplorable consequences that would follow i believe implicitly in the purity of your motives but remember who taught us to pray that we may not be led into temptationand complete the good work that you have begun by leaving sally among friends and sisters in this house  to any honourable man these were unanswerable words coming after what rufus and the surgeon had already said to him they left amelius no alternative but to yield he pleaded for leave to write to sally and to see her at a later interval when she might be reconciled to her new life mrs payson had just consented to both requests rufus had just heartily congratulated him on his decisionwhen the door was thrown violently open simple sally ran into the room followed by one of the womenattendants in a state of breathless surprise  she showed me a bedroom cried sally pointing indignantly to the woman and she asked if i should like to sleep there she turned to amelius and caught him by the hand to lead him away the ineradicable instinct of distrust had been once more roused in her by the too zealous attendant im not going to stay here she said im going away with you  amelius glanced at mrs payson sally tried to drag him to the door he did his best to reassure her by a smile he spoke confusedly some composing words but his honest face always accustomed to tell the truth told the truth now the poor lost creature whose feeble intelligence was so slow to discern so inapt to reflect looked at him with the hearts instantaneous perception and saw her doom she let go of his hand her head sank without word or cry she dropped on the floor at his feet  the attendant instantly raised her and placed her on a sofa mrs payson saw how resolutely amelius struggled to control himself and felt for him with all her heart turning aside for a moment she hastily wrote a few lines and returned to him go before we revive her she whispered and give what i have written to the coachman you shall suffer no anxiety that i can spare you said the excellent woman i will stay here myself tonight and reconcile her to the new life  she held out her hand amelius kissed it in silence rufus led him out not a word dropped from his lips on the long drive back to london  his mind was disturbed by other subjects besides the subject of sally he thought of his future darkened by the doubtful marriageengagement that was before him alone with rufus for the rest of the evening he petulantly misunderstood the sympathy with which the kindly american regarded him their bedrooms were next to each other rufus heard him walking restlessly to and fro and now and then talking to himself after a while these sounds ceased he was evidently worn out and was getting the rest that he needed at last  the next morning he received a few lines from mrs payson giving a favourable account of sally and promising further particulars in a day or two  encouraged by this good news revived by a long nights sleep he went towards noon to pay his postponed visit to regina at that early hour he could feel sure that his interview with her would not be interrupted by visitors she received him quietly and seriously pressing his hand with a warmer fondness than usual he had anticipated some complaint of his absence on the previous day and some severe allusion to his appearance in the capacity of a socialist lecturer reginas indulgence or reginas interest in circumstances of more pressing importance preserved a merciful silence on both subjects  it is a comfort to me to see you amelius she said i am in trouble about my uncle and i am weary of my own anxious thoughts something unpleasant has happened in mr farnabys business he goes to the city earlier and he returns much later than usual when he does come back he doesnt speak to mehe locks himself into his room and he looks worn and haggard when i make his breakfast for him in the morning you know that he is one of the directors of the new bank there was something about the bank in the newspaper yesterday which upset him dreadfully he put down his cup of coffeeand went away to the city without eating his breakfast i dont like to worry you about it amelius but my aunt seems to take no interest in her husbands affairsand it is really a relief to me to talk of my troubles to you i have kept the newspaper do look at what it says about the bank and tell me if you understand it  amelius read the passage pointed out to him he knew as little of banking business as regina so far as i can make it out he said theyre paying away money to their shareholders which they havent earned how do they do that i wonder  regina changed the subject in despair she asked amelius if he had found new lodgings hearing that he had not yet succeeded in the search for a residence she opened a drawer of her worktable and took out a card  the brother of one of my schoolfellows is going to be married she said he has a pretty bachelor cottage in the neighbourhood of the regents parkand he wants to sell it with the furniture just as it is i dont know whether you care to encumber yourself with a little house of your own his sister has asked me to distribute some of his cards with the address and the particulars it might be worth your while perhaps to look at the cottage when you pass that way  amelius took the card the small feminine restraints and gentlenesses of regina her quiet even voice her serene grace of movement had a pleasantly soothing effect on his mind after the anxieties of the last four and twenty hours he looked at her bending over her embroidery deftly and gracefully industriousand drew his chair closer to her she smiled softly over her work conscious that he was admiring her and placidly pleased to receive the tribute  i would buy the cottage at once said amelius if i thought you would come and live in it with me  she looked up gravely with her needle suspended in her hand  dont let us return to that she answered and went on again with her embroidery  why not amelius asked  she persisted in working as industriously as if she had been a poor needlewoman with serious reasons for being eager to get her money it is useless she replied to speak of what cannot be for some time to come  amelius stopped the progress of the embroidery by taking her hand her devotion to her work irritated him  look at me regina he said steadily controlling himself i want to propose that we shall give way a little on both sides i wont hurry you i will wait a reasonable time if i promise that surely you may yield a little in return money seems to be a hard taskmaster my darling after what you have told me about your uncle see how he suffers because he is bent on being rich and ask yourself if it isnt a warning to us not to follow his example would you like to see me too wretched to speak to you or to eat my breakfastand all for the sake of a little outward show come come let us think of ourselves why should we waste the best days of our life apart when we are both free to be happy together i have another good friend besides rufusthe good friend of my father before me he knows all sorts of great people and he will help me to some employment in six months time i might have a little salary to add to my income say the sweetest words my darling that ever fell from your lipssay you will marry me in six months  it was not in a womans nature to be insensible to such pleading as this she all but yielded i should like to say it dear she answered with a little fluttering sigh  say it then amelius suggested tenderly  she took refuge again in her embroidery if you would only give me a little time she suggested i might say it  time for what my own love  time to wait dear till my uncle is not quite so anxious as he is now  dont talk of your uncle regina you know as well as i do what he would say good heavens why cant you decide for yourself no i dont want to hear over again about what you owe to mr farnabyi heard enough of it on that day in the shrubbery oh my dear girl do have some feeling for me do for once have a will of your own  those last words were an offence to her selfesteem i think its very rude to tell me i have no will of my own she said and very hard to press in this way when you know i am in trouble the inevitable handkerchief appeared adding emphasis to the protestand the becoming tears showed themselves modestly in reginas magnificent eyes  amelius started out of his chair and walked away to the window that last reference to mr farnabys pecuniary cares was more than he had patience to endure she cant even forget her uncle and his bank he thought when i am speaking to her of our marriage  he kept his face hidden from her at the window by some subtle process of association which he was unable to trace the image of simple sally rose in his mind an irresistible influence forced him to think of hernot as the poor starved degraded halfwitted creature of the streets but as the grateful girl who had asked for no happier future than to be his servant who had dropped senseless at his feet at the bare prospect of parting with him his sense of selfrespect his loyalty to his betrothed wife resolutely resisted the unworthy conclusion to which his own thoughts were leading him he turned back again to regina he spoke so loudly and so vehemently that the gathering flow of her tears was suspended in surprise youre right youre quite right my dear i ought to give you time of course i try to control my hasty temper but i dont always succeedjust at first pray forgive me it shall be exactly as you wish  regina forgave him with a gentle and ladylike astonishment at the excitable manner in which he made his excuses she even neglected her embroidery and put her face up to him to be kissed you are so nice dear she said when you are not violent and unreasonable it is such a pity you were brought up in america wont you stay to lunch  happily for amelius the footman appeared at this critical moment with a message my mistress wishes particularly to see you sir before you go  this was the first occasion in the experience of the lovers on which mrs farnaby had expressed her wishes through the medium of a servant instead of appearing personally the curiosity of regina was mildly excited what a very odd message she said what does it mean my aunt went out earlier than usual this morning and i have not seen her since i wonder whether she is going to consult you about my uncles affairs  ill go and see said amelius  and stay to lunch regina reiterated  not today my dear  tomorrow then  yes tomorrow so he escaped as he opened the door he looked back and kissed his hand regina raised her head for a moment and smiled charmingly she was hard at work again over her embroidery    chapter 5  the door of mrs farnabys groundfloor room at the back of the house was partially open she was on the watch for amelius  come in she cried the moment he appeared in the hall she pulled him into the room and shut the door with a bang her face was flushed her eyes were wild i have something to tell you you dear good fellow she burst out excitedlysomething in confidence between you and me she paused and looked at him with sudden anxiety and alarm whats the matter with you she asked  the sight of the room the reference to a secret the prospect of another private conference forced back the mind of amelius in one breathless instant to his first memorable interview with mrs farnaby the mothers piteously hopeful words in speaking of her lost daughter rang in his ears again as if they had just fallen from her lips she may be lost in the labyrinth of london tomorrow or ten years hence you might meet with her there were a hundred chances against ita thousand ten thousand chances against it the startling possibility flashed across his brain nevertheless like a sudden flow of daylight across the dark have i met with her at the first chance  wait he cried i have something to say before you speak to me dont deceive yourself with vain hopes promise me that before i begin  she waved her hand derisively hopes she repeated i have done with hopes i have done with fearsi have got to certainties at last  he was too eager to heed anything that she said to him his whole soul was absorbed in the coming disclosure two nights since he went on i was wandering about london and i met  she burst out laughing go on she cried with a wild derisive gaiety  amelius stopped perplexed and startled what are you laughing at he asked  go on she repeated i defy you to surprise me out with it whom did you meet  amelius proceeded doubtfully by a word at a time i met a poor girl in the streets he said steadily watching her  she changed completely at those words she looked at him with an aspect of stern reproach no more of it she interposed i have not waited all these miserable years for such a horrible end as that her face suddenly brightened a radiant effusion of tenderness and triumph flowed over it and made it young and happy again amelius she said listen to this my dream has come truemy girl is found thanks to you though you dont know it  amelius looked at her was she speaking of something that had really happened or had she been dreaming again  absorbed in her own happiness she made no remark on his silence i have seen the woman she went on this bright blessed morning i have seen the woman who took her away in the first days of her poor little life the wretch swears she was not to blame i tried to forgive her perhaps i almost did forgive her in the joy of hearing what she had to tell me i should never have heard it amelius if you had not given that glorious lecture the woman was one of your audience she would never have spoken of those past days she would never have thought of me  at those words mrs farnaby abruptly stopped and turned her face away from amelius after waiting a little finding her still silent still immovable he ventured on putting a question  are you sure you are not deceived he asked i remember you told me that rogues had tried to impose on you in past times when you employed people to find her  i have proof that i am not being imposed upon mrs farnaby answered still keeping her face hidden from him one of them knows of the fault in her foot  one of them amelius repeated how many of them are there  two the old woman and a young man  what are their names  they wont tell me their names yet  isnt that a little suspicious  one of them knows mrs farnaby reiterated of the fault in her foot  may i ask which of them knows the old woman i suppose  no the young man  thats strange isnt it have you seen the young man  i know nothing of him except the little that the woman told me he has written me a letter  may i look at it  i darent let you look at it  amelius said no more if he had felt the smallest suspicion that the disclosure volunteered by mrs farnaby at their first interview had been overheard by the unknown person who had opened the swinging window in the kitchen he might have recalled phoebes vindictive language at his lodgings and the doubts suggested to him by his discovery of the vagabond waiting for her in the street as it was he was simply puzzled the one plain conclusion to his mind was unhappily the natural conclusion after what he had heardthat mrs farnaby had no sort of interest in the discovery of simple sally and that he need trouble himself with no further anxiety in that matter strange as mrs farnabys mysterious revelation seemed her correspondents knowledge of the fault in the foot was circumstance in his favour beyond dispute amelius still wondered inwardly how it was that the woman who had taken charge of the child had failed to discover what appeared to be known to another person if he had been aware that mrs sowlers occupation at the time was the occupation of a babyfarmer and that she had many other deserted children pining under her charge he might have easily understood that she was the last person in the world to trouble herself with a minute examination of any one of the unfortunate little creatures abandoned to her drunken and merciless neglect jervy had satisfied himself before he trusted her with his instructions that she knew no more than the veriest stranger of any peculiarity in one or the other of the childs feet  interpreting mrs farnabys last reply to him as an intimation that their interview was at an end amelius took up his hat to go  i hope with all my heart he said that what has begun so well will end well if there is any service that i can do for you  she drew nearer to him and put her hand gently on his shoulder dont think that i distrust you she said very earnestly i am unwilling to shock youthat is all even this great joy has a dark side to it my miserable married life casts its shadow on everything that happens to me keep secret from everybody the little that i have told youyou will ruin me if you say one word of it to any living creature i ought not to have opened my heart to youbut how could i help it when the happiness that is coming to me has come through you when you say goodbye to me today amelius you say goodbye to me for the last time in this house i am going away dont ask me whythat is one more among the things which i darent tell you you shall hear from me or see mei promise that give me some safe address to write to some place where there are no inquisitive women who may open my letter in your absence  she handed him her pocketbook amelius wrote down in it the address of his club  she took his hand think of me kindly she said and once more dont be afraid of my being deceived there is a hard part of me still left which keeps me on my guard the old woman tried this morning to make me talk to her about that little fault we know of in my childs foot but i thought to myself if you had taken a proper interest in my poor baby while she was with you you must sooner or later have found it out not a word passed my lips no no dont be anxious when you think of me i am as sharp as they are i mean to find out how the man who wrote to me discovered what he knows he shall satisfy me i promise you when i see him or hear from him next all this is between ourselves strictly sacredly between ourselves say nothingi know i can trust you goodbye and forgive me for having been so often in your way with regina i shall never be in your way again marry her if you think she is good enough for you i have no more interest now in your being a roving bachelor meeting with girls here there and everywhere you shall know how it goes on oh i am so happy  she burst into tears and signed to amelius with a wild gesture of treaty to leave her  he pressed her hand in silence and went out  almost as the door closed on him the variable woman changed again for a while she walked rapidly to and fro talking to herself the course of her tears ceased her lips closed firmly her eyes assumed an expression of savage resolve she sat down at the table and opened her desk ill read it once more she said to herself before i seal it up  she took from her desk a letter of her own writing and spread it out before her with her elbows on the table and her hands clasped fiercely in her hair she read these lines addressed to her husband   john farnabyi have always suspected that you had something to do with the disappearance of our child i know for certain now that you deliberately cast your infant daughter on the mercy of the world and condemned your wife to a life of wretchedness  dont suppose that i have been deceived i have spoken with the woman who waited by the gardenpaling at ramsgate and who took the child from your hands she saw you with me at the lecture and she is absolutely sure that you are the man  thanks to the meeting at the lecturehall i am at last on the trace of my lost daughter this morning i heard the womans story she kept the child on the chance of its being reclaimed until she could afford to keep it no longer she met with a person who was willing to adopt it and who took it away with her to a foreign country not mentioned to me yet in that country my daughter is still living and will be restored to me on conditions which will be communicated in a few days time  some of this story may be true and some of it may be false the woman may be lying to serve her own interests with me of one thing i am suremy girl is identified by means known to me of which there can be no doubt and she must be still living because the interest of the persons treating with me is an interest in her life  when you receive this letter on your return from business tonight i shall have left you and left you for ever the bare thought of even looking at you again fills me with horror i have my own income and i mean to take my own way in your best interests i warn you make no attempt to trace me i declare solemnly that rather than let your deserted daughter be polluted by the sight of you i would kill you with my own hand and die for it on the scaffold if she ever asks for her father i will do you one service for the honour of human nature i will tell her that her father is dead it will not be all a falsehood i repudiate you and your nameyou are dead to me from this time forth  i sign myself by my fathers name  emma ronald   she had said herself that she was unwilling to shock amelius this was the reason  after thinking a little she sealed and directed the letter this done she unlocked the wooden press which had once contained the babys frock and cap and those other memorials of the past which she called her dead consolations after satisfying herself that the press was empty she wrote on a card to be called for by a messenger from my bankersand tied the card to a tin box in a corner secured by a padlock she lifted the box and placed it in front of the press so that it might be easily visible to any one entering the room the safe keeping of her treasures provided for she took the sealed letter and ascending the stairs placed it on the table in her husbands dressingroom she hurried out again the instant after as if the sight of the place were intolerable to her  passing to the other end of the corridor she entered her own bedchamber and put on her bonnet and cloak a leather handbag was on the bed she took it up and looked round the large luxurious room with a shudder of disgust what she had suffered within those four walls no human creature knew but herself she hurried out as she had hurried out of her husbands dressingroom  her niece was still in the drawingroom as she reached the door she hesitated and stopped the girl was a good girl in her own dull placid wayand her sisters daughter too a last little act of kindness would perhaps be a welcome act to remember she opened the door so suddenly that regina started with a small cry of alarm oh aunt how you frighten one are you going out yes im going out was the short answer come here give me a kiss regina looked up in wideeyed astonishment mrs farnaby stamped impatiently on the floor regina rose gracefully bewildered my dear aunt how very odd she saidand gave the kiss demanded with a serenely surprised elevation of her finely shaped eyebrows yes said mrs farnaby thats itone of my oddities go back to your work goodbye  she left the room as abruptly as she had entered it with her firm heavy step she descended to the hall passed out at the house door and closed it behind hernever to return to it again    chapter 6  amelius left mrs farnaby troubled by emotions of confusion and alarm which he was the last man living to endure patiently her extraordinary story of the discovered daughter the still more startling assertion of her solution to leave the house the absence of any plain explanation the burden of secrecy imposed on himall combined together to irritate his sensitive nerves i hate mysteries he thought and ever since i landed in england i seem fated to be mixed up in them does she really mean to leave her husband and her niece what will farnaby do what will become of regina  to think of regina was to think of the new repulse of which he had been made the subject again he had appealed to her love for him and again she had refused to marry him at his own time  he was especially perplexed and angry when he reflected on the unassailably strong influence which her uncle appeared to have over her all reginas sympathy was with mr farnaby and his troubles amelius might have understood her a little better if she had told him what had passed between her uncle and herself on the night of mr farnabys return in a state of indignation from the lecture in terror of the engagement being broken off she had been forced to confess that she was too fond of amelius to prevail on herself to part with him if he attempted a second exposition of his socialist principles on the platform she owned that it might be impossible to receive him again as a suitor but she pleaded hard for the granting of a pardon to the first offence in the interests of her own tranquillity if not in mercy to amelius mr farnaby already troubled by his commercial anxieties had listened more amiably and also more absently than usual and had granted her petition with the ready indulgence of a preoccupied man it had been decided between them that the offence of the lecture should be passed over in discreet silence reginas gratitude for this concession inspired her sympathy with her uncle in his present state of suspense she had been sorely tempted to tell amelius what had happened but the natural reserve of her characterfortified in this instance by the defensive pride which makes a woman unwilling before marriage to confess her weakness unreservedly to the man who has caused ithad sealed her lips when he is a little less violent and a little more humble she thought perhaps i may tell him  so it fell out that amelius took his way through the streets a mystified and an angry man  arrived in sight of the hotel he stopped and looked about him  it was impossible to disguise from himself that a lurking sense of regret was making itself felt in his present frame of mind when he thought of simple sally in all probability he would have quarrelled with any man who had accused him of actually lamenting the girls absence and wanting her back again he happened to recollect her artless blue eyes with their vague patient look and her quaint childish questions put so openly in so sweet a voiceand that was all was there anything reprehensible if you please in an act of remembrance comforting himself with these considerations he moved on again a step or twoand stopped once more in his present humour he shrank from facing rufus the american read him like a book the american would ask irritating questions he turned his back on the hotel and looked at his watch as he took it out his finger and thumb touched something else in his waistcoatpocket it was the card that regina had given to himthe card of the cottage to let he had nothing to do and nowhere to go why not look at the cottage if it proved to be not worth seeing the zoological gardens were in the neighbourhoodand there are periods in a mans life when he finds the society that walks on four feet a welcome relief from the society that walks on two  it was a fairly fine day he turned northward towards the regents park  the cottage was in a byroad just outside the park a cottage in the strictest sense of the word a sittingroom a library and a bedroomall of small proportionsand under them a kitchen and two more rooms represented the whole of the little dwelling from top to bottom it was simply and prettily furnished and it was completely surrounded by its own tiny plot of gardenground the library especially was a perfect little retreat looking out on the back garden peaceful and shady and adorned with bookcases of old carved oak  amelius had hardly looked round the room before his inflammable brain was on fire with a new idea other idle men in trouble had found the solace and the occupation of their lives in books why should he not be one of them why not plunge into study in this delightful retirementand perhaps one day astonish regina and mr farnaby by bursting on the world as the writer of a famous book exactly as amelius two days since had seen himself in the future a public lecturer in receipt of glorious feesso he now saw himself the celebrated scholar and writer of a new era to come the woman who showed the cottage happened to mention that a gentleman had already looked over it that morning and had seemed to like it amelius instantly gave her a shilling and said i take it on the spot the wondering woman referred him to the houseagents address and kept at a safe distance from the excitable stranger as she let him out in less than another hour amelius had taken the cottage and had returned to the hotel with a new interest in life and a new surprise for rufus  as usual in cases of emergency the american wasted no time in talking he went out at once to see the cottage and to make his own inquiries of the agent the result amply proved that amelius had not been imposed upon if he repented of his bargain the gentleman who had first seen the cottage was ready to take it off his hands at a moments notice  going back to the hotel rufus found amelius resolute to move into his new abode and eager for the coming life of study and retirement knowing perfectly well beforehand how this latter project would end the american tried the efficacy of a little worldly temptation he had arranged he said to have a good time of it in paris and he proposed that amelius should be his companion the suggestion produced not the slightest effect amelius talked as if he was a confirmed recluse in the decline of life thank you he said with the most amazing gravity i prefer the company of my books and the seclusion of my study this declaration was followed by more sellingout of money in the funds and by a visit to a bookseller which left a handsome pecuniary result inscribed on the right side of the ledger  on the next day amelius presented himself towards two oclock at mr farnabys house he was not so selfishly absorbed in his own projects as to forget mrs farnaby on the contrary he was honestly anxious for news of her  a certain middleaged man of business has been briefly referred to in these pages as one of reginas faithful admirers patiently submitting to the triumph of his favoured young rival this gentleman issuing from his carriage with his cardcase ready in his hand met amelius at the door with a face which announced plainly that a catastrophe had happened you have heard the sad news no doubt he said in a rich bass voice attuned to sadly courteous tones the servant opened the door before amelius could answer after a contest of politeness the middleaged gentleman consented to make his inquiries first how is mr farnaby no better and miss regina very poorly oh dear dear me say i called if you please he handed in two cards with a severe enjoyment of the melancholy occasion and the rich bass sounds of his own voice very sad is it not he said addressing his youthful rival with an air of paternal indulgence good morning he bowed with melancholy grace and got into his carriage  amelius looked after the prosperous merchant as the prancing horses drew him away after all he thought bitterly she might be happier with that rich prig than she could be with me he stepped into the hall and spoke to the servant the man had his message ready miss regina would see mr goldenheart if he would be so good as to wait in the dinningroom  regina appeared pale and scared her eyes inflamed with weeping oh amelius can you tell me what this dreadful misfortune means why has she left us when she sent for you yesterday what did she say  in his position amelius could make but one answer your aunt said she thought of going away but he added with perfect truth she refused to tell me why or where she was going i am quite as much at a loss to understand her as you are what does your uncle propose to do  mr farnabys conduct as described by regina thickened the mysteryhe proposed to do nothing  he had been found on the hearthrug in his dressingroom having apparently been seized with a fit in the act of burning some paper the ashes were discovered close by him just inside the fender on his recovery his first anxiety was to know if a letter had been burnt satisfied on this point he had ordered the servants to assemble round his bed and had peremptorily forbidden them to open the door to their mistress if she ever returned at any future time to the house reginas questions and remonstrances when she was left alone with him were answered once for all in these pitiless termsif you wish to deserve the fatherly interest that i take in you do as i do forget that such a person as your aunt ever existed we shall quarrel if you ever mention her name in my hearing again this said he had instantly changed the subject instructing regina to write an excuse to mr melton otherwise the middleaged rival with whom he had been engaged to dine that evening relating this latter event reginas everready gratitude overflowed in the direction of mr melton he was so kind he left his guests in the evening and came and sat with my uncle for nearly an hour amelius made no remark on this he led the conversation back to the subject of mrs farnaby she once spoke to me of her lawyers he said do they know nothing about her  the answer to this question showed that the sternly final decision of mr farnaby was matched by equal resolution on the part of his wife  one of the partners in the legal firm had called that morning to see regina on a matter of business mrs farnaby had appeared at the office on the previous day and had briefly expressed her wish to make a small annual provision for her niece in case of future need declining to enter into any explanation she had waited until the necessary document had been drawn out had requested that regina might be informed of the circumstance and had then taken her departure in absolute silence hearing that she had left her husband the lawyer like every one else was completely at a loss to understand what it meant  and what does the doctor say amelius asked next  my uncle is to be kept perfectly quiet regina answered and is not to return to business for some time to come mr melton with his usual kindness has undertaken to look after his affairs for him otherwise my uncle in his present state of anxiety about the bank would never have consented to obey the doctors orders when he can safely travel he is recommended to go abroad for the winter and get well again in some warmer climate he refuses to leave his businessand the doctor refuses to take the responsibility there is to be a consultation of physicians tomorrow oh amelius i was really fond of my aunti am heartbroken at this dreadful change  there was a momentary silence if mr melton had been present he would have said a few neatly sympathetic words amelius knew no more than a savage of the art of conventional consolation tadmor had made him familiar with the social and political questions of the time and had taught him to speak in public but tadmor rich in books and newspapers was a powerless training institution in the matter of small talk  suppose mr farnaby is obliged to go abroad he suggested after waiting a little what will you do  regina looked at him with an air of melancholy surprise i shall do my duty of course she answered gravely i shall accompany my dear uncle if he wishes it she glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece it is time he took his medicine she resumed you will excuse me i am sure she shook hands not very warmlyand hastened out of the room  amelius left the house with a conviction which disheartened himthe conviction that he had never understood regina and that he was not likely to understand her in the future he turned for relief to the consideration of mr farnabys strange conduct under the domestic disaster which had befallen him  recalling what he had observed for himself and what he had heard from mrs farnaby when she had first taken him into her confidence he inferred that the subject of the lost child had not only been a subject of estrangement between the husband and wife but that the husband was in some way the person blamable for it assuming this theory to be the right one there would be serious obstacles to the meeting of the mother and child in the mothers home the departure of mrs farnaby was in that case no longer unintelligibleand mr farnabys otherwise inexplicable conduct had the light of a motive thrown on it which might not unnaturally influence a hardhearted man weary alike of his wife and his wifes troubles arriving at this conclusion by a far shorter process than is here indicated amelius pursued the subject no further at the time when he had first visited the farnabys rufus had advised him to withdraw from closer intercourse with them while he had the chance in his present mood he was almost in danger of acknowledging to himself that rufus had proved to be right  he lunched with his american friend at the hotel before the meal was over mrs payson called to say a few cheering words about sally  it was not to be denied that the girl remained persistently silent and reserved in other respects the report was highly favourable she was obedient to the rules of the house she was always ready with any little services that she could render to her companions and she was so eager to improve herself by means of her readinglessons and writinglessons that it was not easy to induce her to lay aside her book and her slate when the teacher offered her some small reward for her good conduct and asked what she would like the sad little face brightened and the faithful creatures answer was always the samei should like to know what he is doing now alas for sallyhe meant amelius  you must wait a little longer before you write to her mrs payson concluded and you must not think of seeing her for some time to come i know you will help us by consenting to thisfor sallys sake  amelius bowed in silence he would not have confessed what he felt at that moment to any living soulit is doubtful if he even confessed it to himself mrs payson observing him with a womans keen sympathy relented a little i might give her a message the good lady suggestedjust to say you are glad to hear she is behaving so well  will you give her this amelius asked  he took from his pocket a little photograph of the cottage which he had noticed on the houseagents desk and had taken away with him it is my cottage now he explained in tones that faltered a little i am going to live there sally might like to see it  sally shall see it mrs payson agreedif you will only let me take this away first she pointed to the address of the cottage printed under the photograph past experience in the home made her reluctant to trust sally with the address in london at which amelius was to be found  rufus produced a huge complex knife out of the depths of which a pair of scissors burst on touching a spring mrs payson cut off the address and placed the photograph in her pocketbook now she said sally will be happy and no harm can come of it  ive known you maam nigh on twenty years rufus remarked i do assure you thats the first rash observation i ever heard from your lips     book the seventh the vanishing hopes    chapter 1  two days later amelius moved into his cottage  he had provided himself with a new servant as easily as he had provided himself with a new abode a foreign waiter at the hotela grayhaired frenchman of the old school reputed to be the most illtempered servant in the househad felt the genial influence of amelius with the receptive readiness of his race here was a young englishman who spoke to him as easily and pleasantly as if he was speaking to a friendwho heard him relate his little grievances and never took advantage of that circumstance to turn him into ridiculewho said kindly i hope you dont mind my calling you by your nickname when he ventured to explain that his christian name was theophile and that his english fellow servants had facetiously altered and shortened it to toff to suit their insular convenience for the first time sir he had hastened to add i feel it an honour to be toff when you speak to me asking everybody whom he met if they could recommend a servant to him amelius had put the question when toff came in one morning with the hot water the old frenchman made a low bow expressive of devotion i know of but one man sir whom i can safely recommend he answeredtake me amelius was delighted he had only one objection to make i dont want to keep two servants he said while toff was helping him on with his dressinggown why should you keep two servants sir the frenchman inquired amelius answered i cant ask you to make the beds why not said toffand made the bed then and there in five minutes he ran out of the room and came back with one of the chambermaids brooms judge for yourself sircan i sweep a carpet he placed a chair for amelius permit me to save you the trouble of shaving yourself are you satisfied very good i am equally capable of cutting your hair and attending to your corns if you suffer sir from that inconvenience will you allow me to propose something which you have not had yet for your breakfast in half an hour more he brought in the new dish oeufs a la tripe an elementary specimen sir of what i can do for you as a cook be pleased to taste it amelius ate it all up on the spot and toff applied the moral with the neatest choice of language thank you sir for a gratifying expression of approval one more specimen of my poor capabilities and i have done it is barely possiblegod forbidthat you may fall ill honour me by reading that document he handed a written paper to amelius dated some years since in paris and signed in an english name i testify with gratitude and pleasure that theophile leblond has nursed me through a long illness with an intelligence and devotion which i cannot too highly praise may you never employ me sir in that capacity said toff i have only to add that i am not so old as i look and that my political opinions have changed in later life from redrepublican to moderateliberal i also confess if necessary that i still have an ardent admiration for the fair sex he laid his hand on his heart and waited to be engaged  so the household at the cottage was modestly limited to amelius and toff  rufus remained for another week in london to watch the new experiment he had made careful inquiries into the frenchmans character and had found that the complaints of his temper really amounted to thisthat he gave himself the airs of a gentleman and didnt understand a joke on the question of honesty and sobriety the testimony of the proprietor of the hotel left rufus nothing to desire greatly to his surprise amelius showed no disposition to grow weary of his quiet life or to take refuge in perilous amusements from the sober society of his books he was regular in his inquiries at mr farnabys house he took long walks by himself he never mentioned sallys name he lost his interest in going to the theatre and he never appeared in the smokingroom of the club some men observing the remarkable change which had passed over his excitable temperament would have hailed it as a good sign for the future the new englander looked below the surface and was not so easily deceived my bright boys soul is discouraged and cast down was the conclusion that he drew theres darkness in him where there once was light and whats worse than all he caves in and keeps it to himself after vainly trying to induce amelius to open his heart rufus at last went to paris with a mind that was ill at ease  on the day of the americans departure the march of events was resumed and the unnaturally quiet life of amelius began to be disturbed again  making his customary inquiries in the forenoon at mr farnabys door he found the household in a state of agitation a second council of physicians had been held in consequence of the appearance of some alarming symptoms in the case of the patient on this occasion the medical men told him plainly that he would sacrifice his life to his obstinacy if he persisted in remaining in london and returning to his business by good fortune the affairs of the bank had greatly benefited through the powerful interposition of mr melton with the improved prospects mr farnaby at his nieces entreaty submitted to the doctors advice he was to start on the first stage of his journey the next morning and at his own earnest desire regina was to go with him i hate strangers and foreigners and i dont like being alone if you dont go with me i shall stay where i amand die so mr farnaby put it to his adopted daughter in his rasping voice and with his hard frown  i am grieved dear amelius to go away from you regina said but what can i do it would have been so nice if you could have gone with us i did hint something of the sort but  her downcast face finished the sentence amelius felt the bare idea of being mr farnabys travelling companion make his blood run cold and mr farnaby on his side reciprocated the sentiment i will write constantly dear regina resumed and you will write back wont you say you love me and promise to come tomorrow morning before we go  she kissed him affectionatelyand the instant after checked the responsive outburst of tenderness in amelius by that utter want of tact which in spite of the popular delusion to the contrary is so much more common in women than in men my uncle is so particular about packing his linen she said nobody can please him but me i must ask you to let me run upstairs again  amelius went out into the street with his head down and his lips fast closed he was not far from mrs paysons house why shouldnt i call he thought to himself his conscience added and hear some news of sally  there was good news the girl was brightening mentally and physicallyshe was in a fair way if she only remained in the home to be simple sally no longer amelius asked if she had got the photograph of the cottage mrs payson laughed sleeps with it under her pillow poor child she said and looks at it fifty times a day thirty years since with infinitely less experience to guide her the worthy matron would have followed her instincts and would have hesitated to tell amelius quite so much about the photograph but some of a womans finer sensibilities do get blunted with the advance of age and the accumulation of wisdom  instead of pursuing the subject of sallys progress amelius to mrs paysons surprise made a clumsy excuse and abruptly took his leave  he felt the need of being alone he was conscious of a vague distrust of himself which degraded him in his own estimation was he like characters he had read of in books the victim of a fatality the slightest circumstances conspired to heighten his interest in sallyjust at the time when regina had once more disappointed him he was as firmly convinced as if he had been the strictest moralist living that it was an insult to regina and an insult to his own selfrespect to set the lost creature whom he had rescued in any light of comparison with the young lady who was one day to be his wife and yet try as he might to drive her out sally kept her place in his thoughts there was apparently some innate depravity in him if a lookingglass had been handed to him at that moment he would have been ashamed to look himself in the face  after walking until he was weary he went to his club  the porter gave him a letter as he crossed the hall mrs farnaby had kept her promise and had written to him the smokingroom was deserted at that time of day he opened his letter in solitude looked at it crumpled it up impatiently and put it into his pocket not even mrs farnaby could interest him at that critical moment his own affairs absorbed him the one idea in his mind after what he had heard about sally was the idea of making a last effort to hasten the date of his marriage before mr farnaby left england if i can only feel sure of regina  his thoughts went no further than that he walked up and down the empty smokingroom anxious and irritable dissatisfied with himself despairing of the future i can but try it he suddenly decidedand turned at once to the table to write a letter  death had been busy with the members of his family in the long interval that had passed since he and his father left england his nearest surviving relative was his unclehis fathers younger brotherwho occupied a post of high importance in the foreign office to this gentleman he now wrote announcing his arrival in england and his anxiety to qualify himself for employment in a government office be so good as to grant me an interview he concluded and i hope to satisfy you that i am not unworthy of your kindness if you will exert your influence in my favour  he sent away his letter at once by a private messenger with instructions to wait for an answer  it was not without doubt and even pain that he had opened communication with a man whose harsh treatment of his father it was impossible for him to forget what could the son expect there was but one hope time might have inclined the younger brother to make atonement to the memory of the elder by a favourable reception of his nephews request  his fathers last words of caution his own boyish promise not to claim kindred with his relations in england were vividly present to the mind of amelius while he waited for the return of the messenger his one justification was in the motives that animated him circumstances which his father had never anticipated rendered it an act of duty towards himself to make the trial at least of what his family interest could do for him there could be no sort of doubt that a man of mr farnabys character would yield if amelius could announce that he had the promise of an appointment under governmentwith the powerful influence of a near relation to accelerate his promotion he sat idly drawing lines on the blottingpaper at one moment regretting that he had sent his letter at another comforting himself in the belief that if his father had been living to advise him his father would have approved of the course that he had taken  the messenger returned with these lines of reply  under any ordinary circumstances i should have used my influence to help you on in the world but when you not only hold the most abominable political opinions but actually proclaim those opinions in public i am amazed at your audacity in writing to me there must be no more communication between us while you are a socialist you are a stranger to me  amelius accepted this new rebuff with ominous composure he sat quietly smoking in the deserted room with his uncles letter in his hand  among the other disastrous results of the lecture some of the newspapers had briefly reported it preoccupied by his anxieties amelius had forgotten this when he wrote to his relative just like me he thought as he threw the letter into the fire his last hopes floated up the chimney with the tiny puff of smoke from the burnt paper there was now no other chance of shortening the marriage engagement left to try he had already applied to the good friend whom he had mentioned to regina the answer kindly written in this case had not been very encouraging  i have other claims to consider all that i can do i will do dont be disheartenedi only ask you to wait  amelius rose to go homeand sat down again his natural energy seemed to have deserted himit required an effort to leave the club he took up the newspapers and threw them aside one after another not one of the unfortunate writers and reporters could please him on that inauspicious day it was only while he was lighting his second cigar that he remembered mrs farnabys unread letter to him by this time he was more than weary of his own affairs he read the letter  i find the people who have my happiness at their mercy both dilatory and greedy mrs farnaby wrote but the little that i can persuade them to tell me is very favourable to my hopes i am still to my annoyance only in personal communication with the hateful old woman the young man either sends messages or writes to me through the post by this latter means he has accurately described not only in which of my childs feet the fault exists but the exact position which it occupies here you will agree with me is positive evidence that he is speaking the truth whoever he is  but for this reassuring circumstance i should feel inclined to be suspicious of some thingsof the obstinate manner for instance in which the young man keeps himself concealed also of his privately warning me not to trust the woman who is his own messenger and not to tell her on any account of the information which his letters convey to me i feel that i ought to be cautious with him on the question of moneyand yet in my eagerness to see my darling i am ready to give him all that he asks for in this uncertain state of mind i am restrained strangely enough by the old woman herself she warns me that he is the sort of man if he once gets the money to spare himself the trouble of earning it it is the one hold i have over him she saysso i control the burning impatience that consumes me as well as i can  no i must not attempt to describe my own state of mind when i tell you that i am actually afraid of dying before i can give my sweet love the first kiss you will understand and pity me when night comes i feel sometimes half mad  i send you my present address in the hope that you will write and cheer me a little i must not ask you to come and see me yet i am not fit for itand besides i am under a promise in the present state of the negotiations to shut the door on my friends it is easy enough to do that i have no friend amelius but you  try to feel compassionately towards me my kindhearted boy for so many long years my heart has had nothing to feed on but the one hope that is now being realized at last no sympathy between my husband and me on the contrary a horrid unacknowledged enmity which has always kept us apart my father and mother in their time both wretched about my marriage and with good reason my only sister dying in povertywhat a life for a childless woman dont let us dwell on it any longer  goodbye for the present amelius i beg you will not think i am always wretched when i want to be happy i look to the coming time  this melancholy letter added to the depression that weighed on the spirits of amelius it inspired him with vague fears for mrs farnaby in her own interests he would have felt himself tempted to consult rufus without mentioning names if the american had been in london as things were he put the letter back in his pocket with a sigh even mrs farnaby in her sad moments had a consoling prospect to contemplate everybody but me amelius thought  his reflections were interrupted by the appearance of an idle young member of the club with whom he was acquainted the newcomer remarked that he looked out of spirits and suggested that they should dine together and amuse themselves somewhere in the evening amelius accepted the proposal any man who offered him a refuge from himself was a friend to him on that day departing from his temperate habits he deliberately drank more than usual the wine excited him for the time and then left him more depressed than ever and the amusements of the evening produced the same result he returned to his cottage so completely disheartened that he regretted the day when he had left tadmor  but he kept his appointment the next morning to take leave of regina  the carriage was at the door with a luggageladen cab waiting behind it mr farnabys illtemper vented itself in predictions that they would be too late to catch the train his harsh voice alternating with reginas meek remonstrances reached the ears of amelius from the breakfastroom im not going to wait for the gentlemansocialist mr farnaby announced with his hardest sarcasm of tone dear uncle we have a quarter of an hour to spare we have nothing of the sort we want all that time to register the luggage the servants voice was heard next mr goldenheart miss mr farnaby instantly stepped into the hall goodbye he called to amelius through the open door of the diningroomand passed straight on to the carriage i shant wait regina he shouted from the doorstep let him go by himself said amelius indignantly as regina hurried into the room oh hush hush dear suppose he heard you no week shall pass without my writing to you promise you will write back amelius one more kiss oh my dear the servant interposed keeping discreetly out of sight i beg your pardon miss my master wishes to know whether you are going with him or not regina waited to hear no more she gave her lover a farewell look to remember her by and ran out  that innate depravity which amelius had lately discovered in his own nature let the forbidden thoughts loose in him again as he watched the departing carriage from the door if poor little sally had been in her place he made an effort of virtuous resolution and stopped there what a blackguard a man may be he penitently reflected without suspecting it himself  he descended the housesteps the discreet servant wished him good morning with a certain cheery respectthe man was delighted to have seen the last of his hard master for some months to come amelius stopped and turned round smiling grimly he was in such a reckless humour that he was even ready to divert his mind by astonishing a footman richard he said are you engaged to be married richard stared in blank surprise at the strange questionand modestly admitted that he was engaged to marry the housemaid next door soon asked amelius swinging his stick as soon as i have saved a little more money sir damn the money cried ameliusand struck his stick on the pavement and walked away with a last look at the house as if he hated the sight of it richard watched the departing young gentleman and shook his head ominously as he shut the door    chapter 2  amelius went straight back to the cottage with the one desperate purpose of reverting to the old plan and burying himself in his books surveying his wellfilled shelves with an impatience unworthy of a scholar humes history of england unhappily caught his eye he took down the first volume in less than half an hour he discovered that hume could do nothing for him wisely inspired he turned to the truer history next which men call fiction the writings of the one supreme genius who soars above all other novelists as shakespeare soars above all other dramatiststhe writings of walter scotthad their place of honour in his library the collection of the waverley novels at tadmor had not been complete enviable amelius had still to read rob roy he opened the book for the rest of the day he was in love with diana vernon and when he looked out once or twice at the garden to rest his eyes he saw andrew fairservice busy over the flowerbeds  he closed the last page of the noble story as toff came in to lay the cloth for dinner  the master at table and the servant behind his chair were accustomed to gossip pleasantly during meals amelius did his best to carry on the talk as usual but he was no longer in the delightful world of illusion which scott had opened to him the hard realities of his own everyday life had gathered round him again observing him with unobtrusive attention the frenchman soon perceived the absence of the easy humour and the excellent appetite which distinguished his young master at other times  may i venture to make a remark sir toff inquired after a long pause in the conversation  certainly  and may i take the liberty of expressing my sentiments freely  of course you may  dear sir you have a pretty little simple dinner today toff began forgive me for praising myself i am influenced by the natural pride of having cooked the dinner for soup you have croute au pot for meat you have tournedos a la sauce poivrade for pudding you have pommes au beurre all so niceand you hardly eat anything and your amiable conversation falls into a melancholy silence which fills me with regret is it you who are to blame for this no sir it is the life you lead i call it the life of a monk i call it the life of a hermiti say boldly it is the life of all others which is most unsympathetic to a young man like you pardon the warmth of my expressions i am eager to make my language the language of utmost delicacy may i quote a little song it is in an old old old french piece long since forgotten called les maris garcons there are two lines in that song i have often heard my good father sing them which i will venture to apply to your case amour delicatesse et gaite dun bon francais cest la devise sir you have naturally delicatesse and gaitebut the last has for some days been under a cloud what is wanted to remove that cloud lamour love as you say in english where is the charming woman who is the only ornament wanting to this sweet cottage why is she still invisible remedy that unhappy oversight sir you are here in a suburban paradise i consult my long experience and i implore you to invite eveha you smile your lost gaiety returns and you feel it as i do might i propose another glass of claret and the reappearance on the table of the tournedos a la poivrade  it was impossible to be melancholy in this mans company amelius sanctioned the return of the tournedos and tried the other glass of claret my good friend he said with something like a return of his old easy way you talk about charming women and your long experience lets hear what your experience has been  for the first time toff began to look a little confused  you have honoured me sir by calling me your good friend he said after that i am sure you will not send me away if i own the truth no my heart tells me i shall not appeal to your indulgence in vain dear sir in the holidays which you kindly give me i provide competent persons to take care of the house in my absence dont i one person if you remember was a most handsome engaging young man he is if you please my son by my first wifenow an angel in heaven another person who took care of the house on the next occasion was a little blackeyed boy a miracle of discretion for his age he is my son by my second wifenow another angel in heaven forgive me i have not done yet some few days since you thought you heard an infant crying downstairs like a miserable wretch i lied i declared it was the infant in the next house ah sir it was my own cherubim baby by my third wifean angel close by in the edgeware road established in a small milliner shop which will expand to great things byandby the intervals between my marriages are not worthy of your notice fugitive caprices sirfugitive caprices to sum it all up as you say in england it is not in me to resist the enchanting sex if my third angel dies i shall tear my hairbut i shall none the less take a fourth  take a dozen if you like said amelius why should you have kept all this from my knowledge  toff hung his head i think it was one of my foreign mistakes he pleaded the servants advertisements in your english newspapers frighten me how does the most meritorious manservant announce himself when he wants the best possible place he says he is without encumbrances gracious heaven what a dreadful word to describe the poor pretty harmless children i was afraid sir you might have some english objection to my encumbrances a young man a boy and a cherubimbaby not to speak of the sacred memories of two women and the charming occasional society of a third all inextricably enveloped in the life of one amorousmeritorious french personsurely there was reason for hesitation here no matter i bless my stars i know better now and i withdraw myself from further notice permit me to recall your attention to the roquefort cheese and a mouthful of potatosalad to correct the richness of him   the dinner was over at last amelius was alone again  it was a still evening not a breath of wind stirred among the trees in the garden no vehicles passed along the byroad in which the cottage stood now and then toff was audible downstairs singing french songs in a high cracked voice while he washed the plates and dishes and set everything in order for the night amelius looked at his bookshelvesand felt that after rob roy there was no more reading for him that evening the slow minutes followed one another wearily the deadly depression of the earlier hours of the day was stealthily fastening its hold on him again how might he best resist it his healthy outofdoor habits at tadmor suggested the only remedy that he could think of be his troubles what they might his one simple method of resisting them at all other times was his simple method now he went out for a walk  for two hours he rambled about the great northwestern suburb of london perhaps he felt the heavy oppressive weather or perhaps his good dinner had not agreed with him any way he was so thoroughly worn out that he was obliged to return to the cottage in a cab  toff opened the doorbut not with his customary alacrity amelius was too completely fatigued to notice any trifling circumstance otherwise he would certainly have perceived something odd in the old frenchmans withered face he looked at his master as he relieved him of his hat and coat with the strangest expression of interest and anxiety modified by a certain sardonic sense of amusement underlying the more serious emotions a nasty dull evening amelius said wearily and toff always eager to talk at other times only answered yes sirand retreated at once to the kitchen regions  the fire was bright the curtains were drawn the readinglamp with its ample green shade was on the tablea more comfortable room no man could have found to receive him after a long walk reclining at his ease in his chair amelius thought of ringing for some restorative brandyandwater while he was thinking he fell asleep and while he slept he dreamed  was it a dream  he certainly saw the librarynot fantastically transformed but just like what the room really was so far he might have been wide awake looking at the familiar objects round him but after a while an event happened which set the laws of reality at defiance simple sally miles away in the home made her appearance in the library nevertheless he saw the drawn curtains over the window parted from behind he saw the girl step out from them and stop looking at him timidly she was clothed in the plain dress that he had bought for her and she looked more charming in it than ever the beauty of health claimed kindred now in her pretty face with the beauty of youth the wan cheeks had begun to fill out and the pale lips were delicately suffused with their natural rosy red little by little her first fears seemed to subside she smiled and softly crossed the room and stood at his side after looking at him with a rapt expression of tenderness and delight she laid her hands on the arm of the chair and said in the quaintly quiet way which he remembered so well i want to kiss you she bent over him and kissed him with the innocent freedom of a child then she raised herself again and looked backwards and forwards between amelius and the lamp the firelight is the best she said darkness fell over the room as she spoke he saw her no more he heard her no more a blank interval followed there flowed over him the oblivion of perfect sleep his next conscious sensation was a feeling of coldhe shivered and woke  the impression of the dream was in his mind at the moment of waking he started as he raised himself in the chair was he dreaming still no he was certainly awake and as certainly the room was dark  he looked and looked it was not to be denied or explained away there was the fire burning low and leaving the room chillyand there just visible on the table in the flicker of the dying flame was the extinguished lamp  he mended the fire and put his hand on the bell to ring for toff and thought better of it what need had he of the lamplight he was too weary for reading he preferred going to sleep again and dreaming again of sally where was the harm in dreaming of the poor little soul so far away from him the happiest part of his life now was the part of it that was passed in sleep  as the fresh coals began to kindle feebly he looked again at the lamp it was odd to say the least of it that the light should have accidentally gone out exactly at the right time to realize the fanciful extinction of it in his dream how was it there was no smell of a burntout lamp he was too lazy or too tired to pursue the question let the mystery remain a mysteryand let him rest in peace he settled himself fretfully in his chair what a fool he was to bother his head about a lamp instead of closing his eyes and going to sleep again  the room began to recover its pleasant temperature he shifted the cushion in the chair so that it supported his head in perfect comfort and composed himself to rest but the capricious influences of sleep had deserted him he tried one position after another and all in vain it was a mere mockery even to shut his eyes he resigned himself to circumstances and stretched out his legs and looked at the companionable fire  of late he had thought more frequently than usual of his past days in the community his mind went back again now to that bygone time the clock on the mantelpiece struck nine they were all at supper at tadmortalking over the events of the day he saw himself again at the long wooden table with shy little mellicent in the chair next to him and his favourite dog at his feet waiting to be fed where was mellicent now it was a sad letter that she had written to him with the strange fixed idea that he was to return to her one day there was something very winning and lovable about the poor creature who had lived such a hard life at home and had suffered so keenly it was a comfort to think that she would go back to the community what happier destiny could she hope for would she take care of his dog for him when she went back they had all promised to be kind to his pet animals in his absence but the dog was fond of mellicent he would be happier with mellicent than with the rest of them and his little tame fawn and his birdshow were they doing he had not even written to inquire after them he had been cruelly forgetful of those harmless dumb loving friends in his present solitude in his dreary doubts of the future what would he not give to feel the dog nestling in his bosom and the fawns little rough tongue licking his hand his heart ached as he thought of it a choking hysterical sensation oppressed his breathing he tried to rise and ring for lights and rouse his manhood to endure and resist it was not to be done where was his courage where was the cheerfulness which had never failed him at other time he sank back in the chair and hid his face in his hands for shame at his own weakness and burst out crying  the touch of soft persuasive fingers suddenly thrilled through him  his hands were gently drawn away from his face a familiar voice sweet and low said oh dont cry dimly through his tears he saw the wellremembered little figure standing between him and the fire in his unendurable loneliness he had longed for his dog he had longed for his fawn there was the martyred creature from the streets whom he had rescued from nameless horror waiting to be his companion servant friend there was the childvictim of cold and hunger still only feeling her way to womanhood innocent of all other aspirations so long as she might fill the place which had once been occupied by the dog and the fawn  amelius looked at her with a momentary doubt whether he was waking or sleeping good god he cried am i dreaming again  no she said simply you are awake this time let me dry your eyes i know where you put your handkerchief she perched on his knee and wiped away the tears and smoothed his hair over his forehead i was frightened to show myself till i heard you crying she confessed then i thought come he cant be angry with me nowand i crept out from behind the curtains there the old man let me in i cant live without seeing you ive tried till i could try no longer i owned it to the old man when he opened the door i said i only want to look at him wont you let me in and he says god bless me heres eve come already i dont know what he meanthe let me in thats all i care about hes a funny old foreigner send him away im to be your servant now why were you crying ive cried often enough about you no that cant bei cant expect you to cry about me i can only expect you to scold me i know im a bad girl  she cast one doubtful look at him and hung her headwaiting to be scolded amelius lost all control over himself he took her in his arms and kissed her again and again you are a dear good grateful little creature he burst outand suddenly stopped aware too late of the act of imprudence which he had committed he put her away from him he tried to ask severe questions and to administer merited reproof even if he had succeeded sally was too happy to listen to him its all right now she cried im never never never to go back to the home oh im so happy lets light the lamp again  she found the matchbox on the chimneypiece in a minute more the room was bright amelius sat looking at her perfectly incapable of deciding what he ought to say or do next to complete his bewilderment the voice of the attentive old frenchman made itself heard through the door in discreetly confidential tones  i have prepared an appetising little supper sir said toff be pleased to ring when you and the young lady are ready    chapter 3  toffs interference proved to have its use the announcement of the little supperplainly implying simple sallys reception at the cottagereminded amelius of his responsibilities he at once stepped out into the passage and closed the door behind him  the old frenchman was waiting to be reprimanded or thanked as the case might be with his head down his shoulders shrugged up to his ears and the palms of his hands spread out appealingly on either side of hima model of mute resignation to circumstances  do you know that you have put me in a very awkward position amelius began  toff lifted one of his hands to his heart you are aware of my weakness sir when that charming little creature presented herself at the door sinking with fatigue i could no more resist her than i could take a hopskipandjump over the roof of this cottage if i have done wrong take no account of the proud fidelity with which i have served youtell me to pack up and go but dont ask me to assume a position of severity towards that enchanting miss it is not in my heart to do it said toff lifting his eyes with tearful solemnity to an imaginary heaven on my sacred word of honour as a frenchman i would die rather than do it  dont talk nonsense amelius rejoined a little impatiently i dont blame youbut you have got me into a scrape for all that if i did my duty i should send for a cab and take her back  toff opened his twinkling old eyes in a perfect transport of astonishment what he cried take her back without rest without supper and you call that duty how inconceivably ugly does duty look when it assumes an inhospitable aspect towards a woman pardon me sir i must express my sentiments or i shall burst you will say perhaps that i have no conception of duty pardon me againmy conception of duty is here  he threw open the door of the sittingroom in spite of his anxiety amelius burst out laughing the frenchmans inexhaustible contrivances had transformed the sittingroom into a bedroom for sally the sofa had become a snug little white bed a hairbrush and comb and a bottle of eaudecologne were on the table a bath stood near the fire with cans of hot and cold water and a railway rug placed under them to save the carpet i dare not presume to contradict you sir said toff but there is my conception of duty in the kitchen i have another conception keeping warm you can smell it up the stairs salmi of partridge with the littlest possible dash of garlic in the sauce oh sir let that angel rest and refresh herself virtuous severity believe me is a most horribly unbecoming virtue at your age he spoke quite seriously with the air of a profound moralist asserting principles that did equal honour to his head and his heart  amelius went back to the library  sally was resting in the easychair her position showed plainly that she was suffering from fatigue i have had a long long walk she said and i dont know which aches worst my back or my feet i dont careim quite happy now im here she nestled herself comfortably in the chair do you mind my looking at you she asked oh its so long since i saw you  there was a new undertone of tenderness in her voiceinnocent tenderness that openly avowed itself the reviving influences of the life at the home had done muchand had much yet left to do her wasted face and figure were filling out her cheeks and lips were regaining their lovely natural colour as amelius had seen in his dream but her eyes in repose still resumed their vacantly patient look and her manner with a perceptible increase of composure and confidence had not lost its quaint childish charm her growth from girl to woman was a growth of fine gradations guided by the unerring deliberation of nature and time  do you think they will follow you here from the home amelius asked  she looked at the clock i dont think so she said quietly its hours since i slipped out by the back door they have very strict rules about runaway girlseven when their friends bring them back if you send me back she stopped and looked thoughtfully into the fire  what will you do if i send you back  what one of our girls did before they took her in at the home she jumped into the river made a hole in the water thats how she calls it shes a big strong girl and they got her out and saved her she says it wasnt painful till they brought her to again im little and weaki dont think they could bring me to life if they tried  amelius made a futile attempt to reason with her he even got so far as to tell her that she had done very wrong to leave the home sallys answer set all further expostulation at defiance instead of attempting to defend herself she sighed wearily and said i had no money i walked all the way here  the wellintended remonstrances of amelius were lost in compassionate surprise you poor little soul he exclaimed it must be seven or eight miles at least  i dare say said sally it dont matter now ive found you  but how did you find me who told you where i lived  she smiled and took from her bosom the photograph of the cottage  but mrs payson cut off the address cried amelius bursting out with the truth in the impulse of the moment  sally turned over the photograph and pointed to the back of the card on which the photographers name and address were printed mrs payson didnt think of this she said shyly  did you think of it amelius asked  sally shook her head im too stupid she replied the girl who made the hole in the water put me up to it have you made up your mind to run away she says and i said yes you go to the man who did the picture she says he knows where the place is ill be bound i asked my way till i found him and he did know and he told me he was a good sort he gave me a glass of beer he said i looked so tired i said wed go and have our portraits taken some dayyou and your servant may i tell the funny old foreigner that he is to go away now i have come to you the complete simplicity with which she betrayed her jealousy of toff made amelius smile sally watching every change in his face instantly drew her own conclusion ah she said cheerfully ill keep your room cleaner than he keeps it i smelt dust on the curtains when i was hiding from you  amelius thought of his dream did you come out while i was asleep he asked  yes i wasnt frightened of you when you were asleep i had a good look at you and i gave you a kiss she made that confession without the slightest sign of confusion her calm blue eyes looked him straight in the face you got restless she went on and i got frightened again i put out the lamp i says to myself if he does scold me i can bear it better in the dark  amelius listened wondering had he seen drowsily what he thought he had dreamed or was there some mysterious sympathy between sally and himself the occult speculations were interrupted by sally may i take off my bonnet and make myself tidy she asked some men might have said no amelius was not one of them  the library possessed a door of communication with the sittingroom the bedchamber occupied by amelius being on the other side of the cottage when sally saw toffs reconstructed room she stood at the door in speechless admiration of the vision of luxury revealed to her from time to time amelius alone in the library heard her dabbling in her bath and humming the artless old english song from which she had taken her name once she knocked at the closed door and made a request through itthere is scent on the table may i have some and once toff knocked at the other door opening into the passage and asked when pretty young miss would be ready for supper events went on in the little household as if sally had become an integral part of it already what am i to do amelius asked himself and toff entering at the moment to lay the cloth answered respectfully hurry the young person sir or the salmi will be spoilt  she came out from her room walking delicately on her sore feetso fresh and charming that toff absorbed in admiration made a mistake in folding a napkin for the first time in his life champagne of course sir he said in confidence to amelius the salmi of partridge appeared the inspiriting wine sparkled in the glasses toff surpassed himself in all the qualities which made a servant invaluable at a supper table sally forgot the home forgot the cruel streets and laughed and chattered as gaily as the happiest girl living amelius expanding in the joyous atmosphere of youth and good spirits shook off his sense of responsibility and became once more the delightful companion who won everybodys love the effervescent gaiety of the evening was at its climax the awful forms of duty propriety and good sense had been long since laughed out of the roomwhen nemesis goddess of retribution announced her arrival outside by a crashing of carriagewheels and a peremptory ring at the cottage bell  there was dead silence amelius and sally looked at each other the experienced toff at once guessed what had happened is it her father or mother he asked of amelius a little anxiously hearing that she had never even seen her father or mother he snapped his fingers joyously and led the way on tiptoe into the hall i have my idea he whispered let us listen  a womans voice high clear and resolute speaking apparently to the coachman was the next audible sound say i come from mrs payson and must see mr goldenheart directly sally trembled and turned pale the matron she said faintly oh dont let her in amelius took the terrified girl back to the library toff followed them respectfully asking to be told what a matron was receiving the necessary explanation he expressed his contempt for matrons bent on carrying charming persons into captivity by opening the library door and spitting into the hall having relieved his mind in this way he returned to his master and laid a lank skinny forefinger cunningly along the side of his nose i suppose sir you dont want to see this furious woman he said before it was possible to say anything in reply another ring at the bell announced that the furious woman wanted to see amelius toff read his masters wishes in his masters face not even this emergency could find him unprepared he was as ready to circumvent a matron as to cook a dinner the shutters are up and the curtains are drawn he reminded amelius not a morsel of light is visible outside let them ringwe have all gone to bed he turned to sally grinning with impish enjoyment of his own stratagem ha miss what do you think of that there was a third pull at the bell as he spoke ring away missess matrone he cried we are fast asleepwake us if you can the fourth ring was the last a sharp crack revealed the breaking of the bellwire and was followed by the shrill fall of the iron handle on the pavement before the garden gate the gate like the palings was protected at the top from invading cats compose yourself miss said toff if she tries to get over the gate she will stick on the spikes in another moment the sound of retiring carriagewheels announced the defeat of the matron and settled the serious question of receiving sally for the night  she sat silent by the window when toff had left the room holding back the curtains and looking out at the murky sky  what are you looking for amelius asked  i was looking for the stars  amelius joined her at the window there are no stars to be seen tonight  she let the curtain fall to again i was thinking of nighttime at the home she said you see i got on pretty well in the day with my reading and writing i wanted so to improve myself my mind was troubled with the fear of your despising such an ignorant creature as i am so i kept on at my lessons i thought i might surprise you by writing you a pretty letter some day one of the teachers shes gone away ill was very good to me i used to talk to her and when i said a wrong word she took me up and told me the right one she said you would think better of me when you heard me speak properlyand i do speak better dont i all this was in the day it was the night that was the hard time to get throughwhen the other girls were all asleep and i had nothing to think of but how far away i was from you i used to get up and put the counterpane round me and stand at the window on fine nights the stars were company to me there were two stars near together that i got to know dont laugh at mei used to think one of them was you and one of them me i wondered whether you would die or i should die before i saw you again and most always it was my star that went out first lord how i used to cry it got into my poor stupid head that i should never see you again i do believe i ran away because of that you wont tell anybody will you it was so foolish i am ashamed of it now i wanted to see your star and my star tonight i dont know why oh im so fond of you she dropped on her knees and took his hand and put it on her head its burning hot she said and your kind hand cools it  amelius raised her gently and led her to the door of her room my poor sally you are quite worn out you want rest and sleep let us say good night  i will do anything you tell me she answered if mrs payson comes tomorrow you wont let her take me away thank you goodnight she put her hands on his shoulders with innocent familiarity and lifted herself to him on tiptoe and kissed him as a sister might have kissed him  long after sally was asleep in her bed amelius sat by the library fire thinking  the revival of the crushed feeling and fancy in the girls nature so artlessly revealed in her sad little story of the stars that were company to her not only touched and interested him but clouded his view of the future with doubts and anxieties which had never troubled him until that moment the mysterious influences under which the girls development was advancing were working morally and physically together weeks might pass harmlessly months might pass harmlesslybut the time must come when the innocent relations between them would be beset by peril unable as yet fully to realize these truths amelius nevertheless felt them vaguely his face was troubled as he lit the candle at last to go to his bed i dont see my way as clearly as i could wish he reflected how will it end  how indeed    chapter 4  at eight oclock the next morning amelius was awakened by toff a letter had arrived marked immediate and the messenger was waiting for an answer  the letter was from mrs payson she wrote briefly and in formal terms after referring to the matrons fruitless visit to the cottage on the previous night mrs payson proceeded in these wordsi request you will immediately let me know whether sally has taken refuge with you and has passed the night under your roof if i am right in believing that she has done so i have only to inform you that the doors of the home are henceforth closed to her in conformity with our rules if i am wrong it will be my painful duty to lose no time in placing the matter in the hands of the police  amelius began his reply acting on impulse as usual he wrote vehemently remonstrating with mrs payson on the unforgiving and unchristian nature of the rules at the home before he was halfway through his composition the person who had brought the letter sent a message to say that he was expected back immediately and that he hoped mr goldenheart would not get a poor man into trouble by keeping him much longer checked in the full flow of his eloquence amelius angrily tore up the unfinished remonstrance and matched mrs paysons briefly businesslike language by an answer in one linei beg to inform you that you are quite right on reflection he felt that the second letter was not only discourteous as a reply to a lady but also ungrateful as addressed to mrs payson personally at the third attempt he wrote becomingly as well as briefly sally has passed the night here as my guest she was suffering from severe fatigue it would have been an act of downright inhumanity to send her away i regret your decision but of course i submit to it you once said you believed implicitly in the purity of my motives do me the justice however you may blame my conduct to believe in me still  having despatched these lines the mind of amelius was at ease again he went into the library and listened to hear if sally was moving the perfect silence on the other side of the door informed him that the weary girl was still fast asleep he gave directions that she was on no account to be disturbed and sat down to breakfast by himself  while he was still at table toff appeared with profound mystery in his manner and discreet confidence in the tones of his voice heres another one sir the frenchman announced in his masters ear  another one amelius repeated what do you mean  she is not like the sweet little sleeping miss toff explained this time sir its the beauty of the devil himself as we say in france she refuses to confide in me and she appears to be agitatedboth bad signs shall i get rid of her before the other miss wakes  hasnt she got a name amelius asked  toff answered in his foreign accent one name onlyfaybay  do you mean phoebe  have i not said it sir  show her in directly  toff glanced at the door of sallys room shrugged his shoulders and obeyed his instructions  phoebe appeared looking pale and anxious her customary assurance of manner had completely deserted her she stopped in the doorway as if she was afraid to enter the room  come in and sit down said amelius whats the matter  im troubled in my mind sir phoebe answered i know its taking a liberty to come to you but i went yesterday to ask miss reginas advice and found she had gone abroad with her uncle i have something to say about mrs farnaby sir and theres no time to be lost in saying it i know of nobody but you that i can speak to now miss regina is away the footman told me where you lived  she stopped evidently in the greatest embarrassment amelius tried to encourage her if i can be of any use to mrs farnaby he said tell me at once what to do  phoebes eyes dropped before his straightforward look as he spoke to her  i must ask you to please excuse my mentioning names sir she resumed confusedly theres a person im interested in whom i wouldnt get into trouble for the whole world hes been misledim sure hes been misled by another persona wicked drunken old woman who ought to be in prison if she had her deserts im not free from blame myselfi know im not i listened sir to what i oughtnt to have heard and i told it again im sure in the strictest confidence and not meaning anything wrong to the person ive mentioned not the old womeni mean the person im interested in i hope you understand me sir i wish to speak openly excepting the names on account of mrs farnaby  amelius thought of phoebes vindictive language the last time he had seen her he looked towards a cabinet in a corner of the room in which he had placed mrs farnabys letter an instinctive distrust of his visitor began to rise in his mind his manner alteredhe turned to his plate and went on with his breakfast cant you speak to me plainly he said is mrs farnaby in any trouble  yes sir  and can i do anything to help her out of it  i am sure you can sirif you only know where to find her  i do know where to find her she has written to tell me the last time i saw you you expressed yourself very improperly about mrs farnaby you spoke as if you meant some harm to her  i mean nothing but good to her now sir  very well then cant you go and speak to her yourself if i give you the address  phoebes pale face flushed a little i couldnt do that sir she answered after the way mrs farnaby has treated me besides if she knew that i had listened to what passed between her and you she stopped again more painfully embarrassed than ever  amelius laid down his knife and fork look here he said this sort of thing is not in my way if you cant make a clean breast of it lets talk of something else im very much afraid he went on with his customary absence of all concealment youre not the harmless sort of girl i once took you for what do you mean by what passed between mrs farnaby and me  phoebe put her handkerchief to her eyes its very hard to speak to me so harshly she said when im sorry for what ive done and am only anxious to prevent harm coming of it  what have you done cried honest amelius weary of the womans inveterately indirect way of explaining herself to him  the flash of his quick temper in his eyes as he put that straightforward question roused a responsive temper in phoebe which stung her into speaking openly at last she told amelius what she had heard in the kitchen as plainly as she had told it to jervywith this one difference that she spoke without insolence when she referred to mrs farnaby  listening in silence until she had done amelius started to his feet and opening the cabinet took from it mrs farnabys letter he read the letter keeping his back towards phoebewaited a moment thinkingand suddenly turned on the woman with a look that made her shrink in her chair you wretch he said you detestable wretch  in the terror of the moment phoebe attempted to leave the room amelius stopped her instantly sit down again he said i mean to have the whole truth out of you now  phoebe recovered her courage you have had the whole truth sir i could tell you no more if i was on my deathbed  amelius refused to believe her there is a vile conspiracy against mrs farnaby he said do you mean to tell me you are not in it  so help me god sir i never even heard of it till yesterday  the tone in which she spoke shook the conviction of amelius the indescribable ring of truth was in it  there are two people who are cruelly deluding and plundering this poor lady he went on who are they  i told you if you remember that i couldnt mention names sir  amelius looked again at the letter after what he had heard there was no difficulty in identifying the invisible young man alluded to by mrs farnaby with the unnamed person in whom phoebe was interested who was he as the question passed through his mind amelius remembered the vagabond whom he had recognized with phoebe in the street there was no doubt of it nowthe man who was directing the conspiracy in the dark was jervy amelius would unquestionably have been rash enough to reveal this discovery if phoebe had not stopped him his renewed reference to mrs farnabys letter and his sudden silence after looking at it roused the womans suspicions if youre planning to get my friend into trouble she burst out not another word shall pass my lips  even amelius profited by the warning which that threat unintentionally conveyed to him  keep your own secrets he said i only want to spare mrs farnaby a dreadful disappointment but i must know what i am talking about when i go to her cant you tell me how you found out this abominable swindle  phoebe was perfectly willing to tell him interpreting her long involved narrative into plain english with the names added these were the facts relatedmrs sowler bearing in mind some talk which had passed between them on the occasion of a supper had called at phoebes lodgings on the previous day and had tried to entrap her into communicating what she knew of mrs farnabys secrets the trap failing mrs sowler had tried bribery next had promised phoebe a large sum of money to be equally divided between them if she would only speak had declared that jervy was perfectly capable of breaking his promise of marriage and leaving them both in the lurch if he once got the money into his own pocket and had thus informed phoebe that the conspiracy which she supposed to have been abandoned was really in full progress without her knowledge she had temporised with mrs sowler being afraid to set such a person openly at defiance and had hurried away at once to have an explanation with jervy he was reported to be not at home her fruitless visit to regina had followedand there so far as facts were concerned was an end of the story  amelius asked her no questions and spoke as briefly as possible when she had done i will go to mrs farnaby this morning was all he said  would you please let me hear how it ends phoebe asked  amelius pushed his pocketbook and pencil across the table to her pointing to a blank leaf on which she could write her address while she was thus employed the attentive toff came in and with his eye on phoebe whispered in his masters ear he had heard sally moving about would it be more convenient under the circumstances if she had her breakfast in her own room toffs astonishment was a sight to see when amelius answered certainly not let her breakfast here  phoebe rose to go her parting words revealed the doublesided nature that was in her the good and evil in perpetual conflict which should be uppermost  please dont mention me sir to mrs farnaby she said i dont forgive her for what shes done to me i dont say i wont be even with her yet but not in that way i wont have her death laid at my door oh but i know her temperand i say its as likely as not to kill her or drive her mad if she isnt warned about it in time never mind her losing her money if its lost its lost and shes got plenty more she may be robbed a dozen times over for all i care but dont let her set her heart on seeing her child and then find its all a swindle i hate her but i cant and wont let that go on goodmorning sir  amelius was relieved by her departure for a minute or two he sat absently stirring his coffee and considering how he might most safely perform the terrible duty of putting mrs farnaby on her guard toff interrupted his meditations by preparing the table for sallys breakfast and almost at the same moment sally herself fresh and rosy opened her door a little way and looked in  you have had a fine long sleep said amelius have you quite got over your walk yesterday  oh yes she answered gaily i only feel my long walk now in my feet it hurts me to put my boots on can you lend me a pair of slippers  a pair of my slippers why sally you would be lost in them whats the matter with your feet  theyre both sore and i think one of them has got a blister on it  come in and lets have a look at it  she came limping in with her feet bare dont scold me she pleaded i couldnt put my stockings on again without washing them and theyre not dry yet  ill get you new stockings and slippers said amelius which is the foot with the blister  the left foot she answered pointing to it    chapter 5  let me see the blister said amelius  sally looked longingly at the fire  may i warm my feet first she asked they are so cold  in those words she innocently deferred the discovery which if it had been made at the moment might have altered the whole aftercourse of events amelius only thought now of preventing her from catching cold he sent toff for a pair of the warmest socks that he possessed and asked if he should put them on for her she smiled and shook her head and put them on for herself  when they had done laughing at the absurd appearance of the little feet in the large socks they only drifted farther and farther away from the subject of the blistered foot sally remembered the terrible matron and asked if anything had been heard of her that morning being told that mrs payson had written and that the doors of the institution were closed to her she recovered her spirits and began to wonder whether the offended authorities would let her have her clothes toff offered to go and make the inquiry later in the day suggesting the purchase of slippers and stockings in the mean time while sally was having her breakfast amelius approved of the suggestion and toff set off on his errand with one of sallys boots for a pattern  the morning had by that time advanced to ten oclock  amelius stood before the fire talking while sally had her breakfast having first explained the reasons which made it impossible that she should live at the cottage in the capacity of his servant he astonished her by announcing that he meant to undertake the superintendence of her education himself they were to be master and pupil while the lessons were in progress and brother and sister at other timesand they were to see how they got on together on this plan without indulging in any needless anxiety about the future amelius believed with perfect sincerity that he had hit on the only sensible arrangement under the circumstances and sally cried joyously oh how good you are to me the happy life has come at last at the hour when those words passed the daughters lips the discovery of the conspiracy burst upon the mother in all its baseness and in all its horror  the suspicion of her infamous employer which had induced mrs sowler to attempt to intrude herself into phoebes confidence led her to make a visit of investigation at jervys lodgings later in the day informed as phoebe had been informed that he was not at home she called again some hours afterwards by that time the landlord had discovered that jervys luggage had been secretly conveyed away and that his tenant had left him in debt for rent of the two best rooms in the house  no longer in any doubt of what had happened mrs sowler employed the remaining hours of the evening in making inquiries after the missing man not a trace of him had been discovered up to eight oclock on the next morning  shortly after nine oclockthat is to say towards the hour at which phoebe paid her visit to ameliusmrs sowler resolute to know the worst made her appearance at the apartments occupied by mrs farnaby  i wish to speak to you she began abruptly about that young man we both know of have you seen anything of him lately  mrs farnaby steadily on her guard deferred answering the question why do you want to know she said  the reply was instantly ready because i have reason to believe he has bolted with your money in his pocket  he has done nothing of the sort mrs farnaby rejoined  has he got your money mrs sowler persisted tell me the truthand ill do the same by you he has cheated me if youre cheated too its your own interest to lose no time in finding him the police may catch him yet has he got your money  the woman was in earnestin terrible earnesther eyes and her voice both bore witness to it she stood there the living impersonation of those doubts and fears which mrs farnaby had confessed in writing to amelius her position at that moment was essentially a position of command mrs farnaby felt it in spite of herself she acknowledged that jervy had got the money  did you sent it to him or give it to him mrs sowler asked  i gave it to him  when  yesterday evening  mrs sowler clenched her fists and shook them in impotent rage hes the biggest scoundrel living she exclaimed furiously and youre the biggest fool put on your bonnet and come to the police if you get your money back again before hes spent it all dont forget it was through me  the audacity of the womans language roused mrs farnaby she pointed to the door you are an insolent creature she said i have nothing more to do with you  you have nothing more to do with me mrs sowler repeated you and the young man have settled it all between you i suppose she laughed scornfully i dare say now you expect to see him again  mrs farnaby was irritated into answering this i expect to see him this morning she said at ten oclock  and the lost young lady with him  say nothing about my lost daughter i wont even hear you speak of her  mrs sowler sat down look at your watch she said it must be nigh on ten oclock by this time youll make a disturbance in the house if you try to turn me out i mean to wait here till ten oclock  on the point of answering angrily mrs farnaby restrained herself you are trying to force a quarrel on me she said you shant spoil the happiest morning of my life wait here by yourself  she opened the door that led into her bedchamber and shut herself in perfectly impenetrable to any repulse that could be offered to her mrs sowler looked at the closed door with a sardonic smile and waited  the clock in the hall struck ten mrs farnaby returned again to the sittingroom walked straight to the window and looked out  any sign of him said mrs sowler  there were no signs of him mrs farnaby drew a chair to the window and sat down her hands turned icy cold she still looked out into the street  im going to guess whats happened mrs sowler resumed im a sociable creature you know and i must talk about something about the money now has the young man had his travelling expenses of you to go to foreign parts and bring your girl back with him eh i expect thats how it was you see i know him so well and what happened if you please yesterday evening did he tell you hed brought her back and got her at his own place and did he say he wouldnt let you see her till you paid him his reward as well as his travelling expenses and did you forget my warning to you not to trust him im a good one at guessing when i try i see you think so yourself any signs of him yet  mrs farnaby looked round from the window her manner was completely changed she was nervously civil to the wretch who was torturing her i beg your pardon maam if i have offended you she said faintly i am a little upseti am so anxious about my poor child perhaps you are a mother yourself you oughtnt to frighten me you ought to feel for me she paused and put her hand to her head he told me yesterday evening she went on slowly and vacantly that my poor darling was at his lodgings he said she was so worn out with the long journey from abroad that she must have a nights rest before she could come to me i asked him to tell me where he lived and let me go to her he said she was asleep and must not be disturbed i promised to go in on tiptoe and only look at her i offered him more money double the money to tell me where she was he was very hard on me he only said wait till ten tomorrow morningand wished me goodnight i ran out to follow him and fell on the stairs and hurt myself the people of the house were very kind to me she turned her head back towards the window and looked out into the street again i must be patient she said hes only a little late  mrs sowler rose and tapped her smartly on the shoulder lies she burst out he knows no more where your daughter is than i doand hes off with your money  the womans hateful touch struck out a spark of the old fire in mrs farnaby her natural force of character asserted itself once more you lie she rejoined leave the room  the door was opened while she spoke a respectable womanservant came in with a letter mrs farnaby took it mechanically and looked at the address jervys feigned handwriting was familiar to her in the instant when she recognized it the life seemed to go out of her like an extinguished light she stood pale and still and silent with the unopened letter in her hand  watching her with malicious curiosity mrs sowler coolly possessed herself of the letter looked at it and recognized the writing in her turn stop she cried as the servant was on the point of going out theres no stamp on this letter was it brought by hand is the messenger waiting  the respectable servant showed her opinion of mrs sowler plainly in her face she replied as briefly and as ungraciously as possibleno  man or woman was the next question  am i to answer this person maam said the servant looking at mrs farnaby  answer me instantly mrs sowler interposedin mrs farnabys own interests dont you see she cant speak to you herself  well then said the servant it was a man  a man with a squint  yes  which way did he go  towards the square  mrs sowler tossed the letter on the table and hurried out of the room the servant approached mrs farnaby you havent opened your letter yet maam she said  no said mrs farnaby vacantly i havent opened it yet  im afraid its bad news maam  yes i think its bad news  is there anything i can do for you  no thank you yes one thing open my letter for me please  it was a strange request to make the servant wondered and obeyed she was a kindhearted woman she really felt for the poor lady but the familiar household devil whose name is curiosity and whose opportunities are innumerable prompted her next words when she had taken the letter out of the envelopeshall i read it to you maam  no put it down on the table please ill ring when i want you  the mother was alonealone with her deathwarrant waiting for her on the table  the clock downstairs struck the half hour after ten she moved for the first time since she had received the letter once more she went to the window and looked out it was only for a moment she turned away again with a sudden contempt for herself what a fool i am she saidand took up the open letter  she looked at it and put it down again why should i read it she asked herself when i know what is in it without reading  some framed woodcuts from the illustrated newspapers were hung on the walls one of them represented a scene of rescue from shipwreck a mother embracing her daughter saved by the lifeboat was among the foreground groups the print was entitled the mercy of providence mrs farnaby looked at it with a moments steady attention providence has its favourites she said i am not one of them  after thinking a little she went into her bedroom and took two papers out of her dressingcase they were medical prescriptions  she turned next to the chimneypiece two medicinebottles were placed on it she took one of them downa bottle of the ordinary size known among chemists as a sixounce bottle it contained a colourless liquid the label stated the dose to be two tablespoonfuls and bore as usual a number corresponding with a number placed on the prescription she took up the prescription it was a mixture of bicarbonate of soda and prussic acid intended for the relief of indigestion she looked at the date and was at once reminded of one of the very rare occasions on which she had required the services of a medical man there had been a serious accident at a dinnerparty given by some friends she had eaten sparingly of a certain dish from which some of the other guests had suffered severely it was discovered that the food had been cooked in an old copper saucepan in her case the trifling result had been a disturbance of digestion and nothing more the doctor had prescribed accordingly she had taken but one dose with her healthy constitution she despised physic the remainder of the mixture was still in the bottle  she considered again with herselfthen went back to the chimneypiece and took down the second bottle  it contained a colourless liquid also but it was only half the size of the first bottle and not a drop had been taken she waited observing the difference between the two bottles with extraordinary attention in this case also the prescription was in her possessionbut it was not the original a line at the top stated that it was a copy made by the chemist at the request of a customer it bore the date of more than three years since a morsel of paper was pinned to the prescription containing some lines in a womans handwritingwith your enviable health and strength my dear i should have thought you were the last person in the world to want a tonic however here is my prescription if you must have it be very careful to take the right dose because theres poison in it the prescription contained three ingredients strychnine quinine and nitrohydrochloric acid and the dose was fifteen drops in water mrs farnaby lit a match and burnt the lines of her friends writing as long ago as that she reflected i thought of killing myself why didnt i do it  the paper having been destroyed she put back the prescription for indigestion in her dressingcase hesitated for a moment and opened the bedroom window it looked into a lonely little courtyard she threw the dangerous contents of the second and smaller bottle out into the yardand then put it back empty on the chimneypiece after another moment of hesitation she returned to the sittingroom with the bottle of mixture and the copied prescription for the tonic strychnine drops in her hand  she put the bottle on the table and advanced to the fireplace to ring the bell warm as the room was she began to shiver did the eager life in her feel the fatal purpose that she was meditating and shrink from it instead of ringing the bell she bent over the fire trying to warm herself  other women would get relief in crying she thought i wish i was like other women  the whole sad truth about herself was in that melancholy aspiration no relief in tears no merciful oblivion in a faintingfit for her the terrible strength of the vital organization in this woman knew no yielding to the unutterable misery that wrung her to the soul it roused its glorious forces to resist it held her in a stony quiet with a grip of iron  she turned away from the fire wondering at herself what baseness is there in me that fears death what have i got to live for now the open letter on the table caught her eye this will do it she saidand snatched it up and read it at last  the least i can do for you is to act like a gentleman and spare you unnecessary suspense you will not see me this morning at ten for the simple reason that i really dont know and never did know where to find your daughter i wish i was rich enough to return the money not being able to do that i will give you a word of advice instead the next time you confide any secrets of yours to mr goldenheart take better care that no third person hears you  she read those atrocious lines without any visible disturbance of the dreadful composure that possessed her her mind made no effort to discover the person who had listened and betrayed her to all ordinary curiosities to all ordinary emotions she was morally dead already  the one thought in her was a thought that might have occurred to a man if i only had my hands on his throat how i could wring the life out of him as it is instead of pursuing the reflection she threw the letter into the fire and rang the bell  take this at once to the nearest chemists she said giving the strychnine prescription to the servant and wait please and bring it back with you  she opened her desk when she was alone and tore up the letters and papers in it this done she took her pen and wrote a letter it was addressed to amelius  when the servant entered the room again bringing with her the prescription made up the clock downstairs struck eleven    chapter 6  toff returned to the cottage with the slippers and the stockings  what a time you have been gone said amelius  it is not my fault sir toff explained the stockings i obtained without difficulty but the nearest shoe shop in this neighbourhood sold only coarse manufactures and all too large i had to go to my wife and get her to take me to the right place see he exclaimed producing a pair of quilted silk slippers with blue rosettes here is a design that is really worthy of pretty feet try them on miss  sallys eyes sparkled at the sight of the slippers she rose at once and limped away to her room amelius observing that she still walked in pain called her back i had forgotten the blister he said before you put on the new stockings sally let me see your foot he turned to toff youre always ready with everything he went on i wonder whether you have got a needle and a bit of worsted thread  the old frenchman answered with an air of respectful reproach knowing me sir as you do he said could you doubt for a moment that i mend my own clothes and darn my own stockings he withdrew to his bedroom below and returned with a leather roll when you are ready sir he said opening the roll at the table and threading the needle while sally removed the sock from her left foot  she took a chair near the window at the suggestion of amelius he knelt down so as to raise her foot to his knee turn a little more towards the light he said he took the foot in his hand lifted it looked at itand suddenly let it drop back on the floor  a cry of alarm from sally instantly brought toff to the window oh look she cried hes ill toff lifted amelius to a chair for gods sake sir cried the terrified old man whats the matter amelius had turned to the strange ashy paleness which is only seen in men of his florid complexion overwhelmed by sudden emotion he stammered when he tried to speak fetch the brandy said toff pointing to the liqueurcase on the sideboard sally brought it at once the strong stimulant steadied amelius  im sorry to have frightened you he said faintly sallydear dear little sally go in and get your things on directly you must come out with me ill tell you why afterwards my god why didnt i find this out before he noticed toff wondering and trembling good old fellow dont alarm yourselfyou shall know about it too go run get the first cab you can find  left alone for a few minutes he had time to compose himself he did his best to take advantage of the time he tried to prepare his mind for the coming interview with mrs farnaby i must be careful of what i do he thought conscious of the overwhelming effect of the discovery on himself she doesnt expect me to bring her daughter to her  sally returned to him ready to go out she seemed to be afraid of him when he approached her and took her hand have i done anything wrong she asked in her childish way are you going to take me to some other home the tone and look with which she put the question burst through the restraints which amelius had imposed on himself for her sake my dear child he said can you bear a great surprise im dying to tell you the truthand i hardly dare do it he took her in his arms she trembled piteously instead of answering him she reiterated her question are you going to take me to some other home he could endure it no longer this is the happiest day of your life sally he cried i am going to take you to your mother  he held her close to him and looked at her in dread of having spoken too plainly  she slowly lifted her eyes to him in vacant fear and surprise she burst into no expression of delight no overwhelming emotion made her sink fainting in his arms the sacred associations which gather round the mere name of mother were associations unknown to her the man who held her to him so tenderly the hero who had pitied and saved her was father and mother both to her simple mind she dropped her head on his breast her faltering voice told him that she was crying will my mother take me away from you she asked oh do promise to bring me back with you to the cottage  for the moment and the moment only amelius was disappointed in her the generous sympathies in his nature guided him unerringly to the truer view he remembered what her life had been inexpressible pity for her filled his heart oh my poor sally the time is coming when you will not think as you think now i will do nothing to distress you you mustnt cryyou must be happy and loving and true to your mother she dried her eyes ill do anything you tell me she said as long as you bring me back with you  amelius sighed and said no more he took her out with him gravely and silently when the cab was announced to be ready double your fare he said when he gave the driver his instructions if you get there in a quarter of an hour it wanted twentyfive minutes to twelve when the cab left the cottage  at that moment the contrast of feeling between the two could hardly have been more strongly marked in proportion as amelius became more and more agitated so sally recovered the composure and confidence that she had lost the first question she put to him related not to her mother but to his strange behaviour when he had knelt down to look at her foot he answered explaining to her briefly and plainly what his conduct meant the description of what had passed between her mother and amelius interested and yet perplexed her how can she be so fond of me without knowing anything about me for all those years she asked is my mother a lady dont tell her where you found me she might be ashamed of me she paused and looked at amelius anxiously are you vexed about something may i take hold of your hand amelius gave her his hand and sally was satisfied  as the cab drew up at the house the door was opened from within a gentleman dressed in black hurriedly came out looked at amelius and spoke to him as he stepped from the cab to the pavement  i beg your pardon sir may i ask if you are any relative of the lady who lives in this house  no relative amelius answered only a friend who brings good news to her  the strangers grave face suddenly became compassionate as well as grave i must speak with you before you go upstairs he said lowering his voice as he looked at sally still seated in the cab you will perhaps excuse the liberty i am taking when i tell you that i am a medical man come into the hall for a momentand dont bring the young lady with you  amelius told sally to wait in the cab she saw his altered looks and entreated him not to leave her he promised to keep the house door open so that she could see him while he was away from her and hastened into the hall  i am sorry to say i have bad very bad news for you the doctor began time is of serious importancei must speak plainly you have heard of mistakes made by taking the wrong bottle of medicine the poor lady upstairs is i fear in a dying state from an accident of that sort try to compose yourself you may really be of use to me if you are firm enough to take my place while i am away  amelius steadied himself instantly what i can do i will do he answered  the doctor looked at him i believe you he said now listen in this case a dose limited to fifteen drops has been confounded with a dose of two tablespoonsful and the drug taken by mistake is strychnine one grain of the poison has been known to prove fatalshe has taken three the convulsion fits have begun antidotes are out of the questionthe poor creature can swallow nothing i have heard of opium as a possible means of relief and i am going to get the instrument for injecting it under the skin not that i have much belief in the remedy but i must try something have you courage enough to hold her if another of the convulsions comes on in my absence  will it relieve her if i hold her amelius asked  certainly  then i promise to do it  mind you must do it thoroughly there are only two women upstairs both perfectly useless in this emergency if she shrieks to you to be held exert your strengthtake her with a firm grasp if you only touch her i cant explain it but it is so you will make matters worse  the servant ran downstairs while he was speaking dont leave us sirim afraid its coming on again  this gentleman will help you while i am away said the doctor one word more he went on addressing amelius in the intervals between the fits she is perfectly conscious able to listen and even to speak if she has any last wishes to communicate make good use of the time she may die of exhaustion at any moment i will be back directly  he hurried to the door  take my cab said amelius and save time  but the young lady  leave her to me he opened the cab door and gave his hand to sally it was done in a moment the doctor drove off  amelius saw the servant waiting for them in the hall he spoke to sally telling her considerately and gently what he had heard before he took her into the house i had such good hopes for you he said and it has come to this dreadful end have you courage to go through with it if i take you to her bedside you will be glad one day my dear to remember that you cheered your mothers last moments on earth  sally put her hand in his i will go anywhere she said softly with you  amelius led her into the house the servant in pity for her youth ventured on a word of remonstrance oh sir youre not going to let the poor young lady see that dreadful sight upstairs  you mean well amelius answered and i thank you if you knew what i know you would take her upstairs too show the way  sally looked at him in silent awe as they followed the servant together he was not like the same man his brows were knit his lips were fast set he held the girls hand in a grip that hurt her the latent strength of will in himthat reserved resolution so finely and firmly entwined in the natures of sensitively organized menwas rousing itself to meet the coming trial the doctor would have doubly believed in him if the doctor had seen him at that moment  they reached the firstfloor landing  before the servant could open the drawingroom door a shriek rang frightfully through the silence of the house the servant drew back and crouched trembling on the upper stairs at the same moment the door was flung open and another woman ran out wild with terror i cant bear it she cried and rushed up the stairs blind to the presence of strangers in the panic that possessed her amelius entered the drawingroom with his arm round sally holding her up as he placed her in a chair the dreadful cry was renewed he only waited to rouse and encourage her by a word and a lookand ran into the bedroom  for an instant and an instant only he stood horrorstruck in the presence of the poisoned woman  the fell action of the strychnine wrung every muscle in her with the torture of convulsion her hands were fast clenched her head was bent back her body rigid as a bar of iron was arched upwards from the bed resting on the two extremities of the head and the heels the staring eyes the dusky face the twisted lips the clenched teeth were frightful to see he faced it after the one instant of hesitation he faced it  before she could cry out again his hands were on her the whole exertion of his strength was barely enough to keep the frenzied throbs of the convulsion as it reached its climax from throwing her off the bed through the worst of it he was still equal to the trust that had been placed in him still faithful to the work of mercy little by little he felt the lessening resistance of the rigid body as the paroxysm began to subside he saw the ghastly stare die out of her eyes and the twisted lips relax from their dreadful grin the tortured body sank and rested the perspiration broke out on her face her languid hands fell gently over on the bed for a while the heavy eyelids closedthen opened again feebly she looked at him do you know me he asked bending over her and she answered in a faint whisper amelius  he knelt down by her and kissed her hand can you listen if i tell you something  she breathed heavily her bosom heaved under the suffocating oppression that weighed upon it as he took her in his arms to raise her in the bed sallys voice reached him in low imploring tones from the next room oh let me come to you im so frightened here by myself  he waited before he told her to come in looking for a moment at the face that was resting on his breast a gray shadow was stealing over it a cold and clammy moisture struck a chill through him as he put his hand on her forehead he turned towards the next room the girl had ventured as far as the door he beckoned to her she came in timidly and stood by him and looked at her mother amelius signed to her to take his place put your arms round her he whispered oh sally tell her who you are in a kiss the girls tears fell fast as she pressed her lips on her mothers cheek the dying woman looked at her with a glance of helpless inquirythen looked at amelius the doubt in her eyes was too dreadful to be endured arranging the pillows so that she could keep her raised position in the bed he signed to sally to approach him and removed the slipper from her left foot as he took it off he looked again at the bedlooked and shuddered in a moment more it might be too late with his knife he ripped up the stocking and lifting her on the bed put her bare foot on her mothers lap your child your child he cried ive found your own darling for gods sake rouse yourself look  she heard him she lifted her feebly declining head she looked she knew  for one awful moment the sinking vital forces rallied and hurled back the hold of death her eyes shone radiant with the divine light of maternal love an exulting cry of rapture burst from her slowly very slowly she bent forward until her face rested on her daughters foot with a faint sigh of ecstasy she kissed it the moments passedand the bent head was raised no more the last beat of the heart was a beat of joy     book the eighth dame nature decides    chapter 1  the day which had united the mother and daughter only to part them again in this world for ever had advanced to evening  amelius and sally were together again in the cottage sitting by the library fire the silence in the room was uninterrupted on the open desk near amelius lay the letter which mrs farnaby had written to him on the morning of her death  he had found the letterwith the envelope unfastenedon the floor of the bedchamber and had fortunately secured it before the landlady and the servant had ventured back to the room the doctor returning a few minutes afterwards had warned the two women that a coroners inquest would be held in the house and had vainly cautioned them to be careful of what they said or did in the interval not only the subject of the death but a discovery which had followed revealing the name of the illfated woman marked on her linen and showing that she had used an assumed name in taking the lodgings as mrs ronald became the gossip of the neighbourhood in a few hours under these circumstances the catastrophe was made the subject of a paragraph in the evening journals the name being added for the information of any surviving relatives who might be ignorant of the sad event if the landlady had found the letter that circumstance also would in all probability have formed part of the statement in the newspapers and the secret of mrs farnabys life and death would have been revealed to the public view  i can trust you and you only she wrote to amelius to fulfil the last wishes of a dying woman you know me and you know how i looked forward to the prospect of a happy life in retirement with my child the one hope that i lived for has proved to be a cruel delusion i have only this morning discovered beyond the possibility of doubt that i have been made the victim of wretches who have deliberately lied to me from first to last if i had been a happier woman i might have had other interests to sustain me under this frightful disaster such as i am death is my one refuge left  my suicide will be known to no creature but yourself some years since the idea of self destructionconcealed under the disguise of a common mistakepresented itself to my mind i kept the means very simple means by me thinking i might end in that way after all when you read this i shall be at rest for ever you will do what i have yet to ask of you in merciful remembrance of mei am sure of that  you have a long life before you amelius my foolish fancy about you and my lost girl still lingers in my mind i still think it may be just possible that you may meet with her in the course of years  if this does happen i implore you by the tenderness and pity that you once felt for me to tell no human creature that she is my daughter and if john farnaby is living at the time i forbid you with the authority of a dying friend to let her see him or to let her know even that such a person exists are you at a loss to account for my motives i may make the shameful confession which will enlighten you now i know that we shall never meet again my child was born before my marriage and the man who afterwards became my husbanda man of low origin i should tell youwas the father he had calculated on this disgraceful circumstance to force my parents to make his fortune by making me his wife i now know what i only vaguely suspected before that he deliberately abandoned his child as a likely cause of hindrance and scandal in the way of his prosperous career in life do you now think i am asking too much when i entreat you never even to speak to my lost darling of this unnatural wretch as for my own fair fame i am not thinking of myself with death close at my side i think of my poor mother and of all that she suffered and sacrificed to save me from the disgrace that i had deserved for her sake not for mine keep silence to friends and enemies alike if they ask you who my girl iswith the one exception of my lawyer years since i left in his care the means of making a small provision for my child on the chance that she might live to claim it you can show him this letter as your authority in case of need  try not to forget me ameliusbut dont grieve about me i go to my death as you go to your sleep when you are tired i leave you my grateful loveyou have always been good to me there is no more to write i hear the servant returning from the chemists bringing with her only release from the hard burden of life without hope may you be happier than i have been goodbye  so she parted from him for ever but the fatal association of the unhappy womans sorrows with the life and fortune of amelius was not at an end yet  he had neither hesitation nor misgiving in resolving to show a natural respect to the wishes of the dead now that the miserable story of the past had been unreservedly disclosed to him he would have felt himself bound in honour even without instructions to guide him to keep the discovery of the daughter a secret for the mothers sake with that conviction he had read the distressing letter with that conviction he now rose to provide for the safe keeping of it under lock and key   just as he had secured the letter in a private drawer of his desk toff came in with a card and announced that a gentleman wished to see him amelius looking at the card was surprised to find on it the name of mr melton some lines were written on it in pencil i have called to speak with you on a matter of serious importance wondering what his middleaged rival could want with him amelius instructed toff to admit the visitor  sally started to her feet with her customary distrust of strangers may i run away before he comes in she asked if you like amelius answered quietly she ran to the door of her room at the moment when toff appeared again announcing the visitor mr melton entered just before she disappeared he saw the flutter of her dress as the door closed behind her  i fear i am disturbing you he said looking hard at the door  he was perfectly dressed his hat and gloves were models of what such things ought to be he was melancholy and courteous blandly distrustful of the flying skirts which he had seen at the door when amelius offered him a chair he took it with a mysterious sigh mournfully resigned to the sad necessity of sitting down i wont prolong my intrusion on you he resumed you have no doubt seen the melancholy news in the evening papers  i havent seen the evening papers amelius answered what news do you mean  mr melton leaned back in his chair and expressed emotions of sorrow and surprise in a perfect state of training by gently raising his smooth white hands  oh dear dear this is very sad i had hoped to find you in full possession of the particularsreconciled as we must all be to the inscrutable ways of providence permit me to break it to you as gently as possible i came here to inquire if you had heard yet from miss regina understand my motive there must be no misapprehension between us on that subject there is a very serious necessitypray follow me carefullyi say a very serious necessity for my communicating immediately with miss reginas uncle and i know of nobody who is so likely to hear from the travellers so soon after their departure as yourself you are in a certain sense a member of the family  stop a minute said amelius  i beg your pardon said mr melton politely at a loss to understand the interruption  i didnt at first know what you meant amelius explained you put it if you will forgive me for saying so in rather a roundabout way if you are alluding all this time to mrs farnabys death i must honestly tell you that i know of it already  the bland selfpossession of mr meltons face began to show signs of being ruffled he had been in a manner deluded into exhibiting his conventionally fluent eloquence in the choicest modulations of his sonorous voiceand it wounded his self esteem to be placed in his present position i understood you to say he remarked stiffly that you had not seen the evening newspapers  you are quite right amelius rejoined i have not seen them  then may i inquire mr melton proceeded how you became informed of mrs farnabys death  amelius replied with his customary frankness i went to call on the poor lady this morning he said knowing nothing of what had happened i met the doctor at the door and i was present at her death  even mr meltons carefullytrained composure was not proof against the revelation that now opened before him he burst out with an exclamation of astonishment like an ordinary man  good heavens what does this mean  amelius took it as a question addressed to himself im sure i dont know he said quietly  mr melton misunderstanding amelius on his side interpreted those innocent words as an outbreak of vulgar interruption pardon me he said coldly i was about to explain myself you will presently understand my surprise after seeing the evening paper i went at once to make inquiries at the address mentioned in mr farnabys absence i felt bound to do this as his old friend i saw the landlady and with her assistance the doctor also both these persons spoke of a gentleman who had called that morning accompanied by a young lady and who had insisted on taking the young lady upstairs with him until you mentioned just now that you were present at the death i had no suspicion that you were the gentleman surprise on my part was i think only natural i could hardly be expected to know that you were in mrs farnabys confidence about the place of her retreat and with regard to the young lady i am still quite at a loss to understand  if you understand that the people at the house told you the truth so far as i am concerned amelius interposed i hope that will be enough with regard to the young lady i must beg you to excuse me for speaking plainly i have nothing to say about her to you or to anybody  mr melton rose with the utmost dignity and the fullest possession of his vocal resources  permit me to assure you he said with frigidly fluent politeness that i have no wish to force myself into your confidence one remark i will venture to make it is easy enough no doubt to keep your own secrets when you are speaking to me you will find some difficulty i fear in pursuing the same course when you are called upon to give evidence before the coroner i presume you know that you will be summoned as a witness at the inquest  i left my name and address with the doctor for that purpose amelius rejoined as composedly as ever and i am ready to bear witness to what i saw at poor mrs farnabys bedside but if all the coroners in england questioned me about anything else i should say to them just what i have said to you  mr melton smiled with well bred irony we shall see he said in the mean time i presume i may ask you in the interests of the family to send me the address on the letter as soon as you hear from miss regina i have no other means of communicating with mr farnaby in respect to the melancholy event i may add that i have undertaken to provide for the funeral and to pay any little outstanding debts and so forth as mr farnabys old friend and representative  the conclusion of the sentence was interrupted by the entrance of toff with a note and an apology for his intrusion i beg your pardon sir the person is waiting she says its only a receipt to sign the box is in the hall  amelius examined the enclosure it was a formal document acknowledging the receipt of sallys clothes returned to her by the authorities at the home as he took a pen to sign the receipt he looked towards the door of sallys room mr melton observing the look prepared to retire i am only interrupting you he said you have my address on my card good evening  on his way out he passed an elderly woman waiting in the hall toff hastening before him to open the garden gate was saluted by the gruff voice of a cabman outside the lady whom he had driven to the cottage had not paid him his right fare he meant to have the money or the ladys name and address and summon her quietly crossing the road mr melton heard the womans voice next she had got her receipt and had followed him out in the dispute about fares and distances that ensued the contending parties more than once mentioned the name of the home and of the locality in which it was situated possessing this information mr melton looked in at his club consulted a directory under the heading of charitable institutions and solved the mystery of the vanishing petticoats at the door he had discovered an inmate of an asylum for lost women in the house of the man to whom regina was engaged to be married   the next mornings post brought to amelius a letter from regina it was dated from an hotel in paris her dear uncle had over estimated his strength he had refused to stay and rest for the night at boulogne and had suffered so severely from the fatigue of the long journey that he had been confined to his bed since his arrival the english physician consulted had declined to say when he would be strong enough to travel again the constitution of the patient must have received some serious shock he was brought very low having carefully reported the new medical opinion regina was at liberty to indulge herself next in expressions of affection and to assure amelius of her anxiety to hear from him as soon as possible but in this case again the dear uncles convenience was still the first consideration she reverted to mr farnaby in making her excuses for a hurriedly written letter the poor invalid suffered from depression of spirits his great consolation in his illness was to hear his niece read to him he was calling for her indeed at that moment the inevitable postscript warmed into a mild effusion of fondness how i wish you could be with us but alas it cannot be  amelius copied the address on the letter and sent it to mr melton immediately  it was then the twentyfourth day of the month the tidal train did not leave london early that morning and the inquest was deferred to suit other pressing engagements of the coroner until the twentysixth mr melton decided after his interview with amelius that the emergency was sufficiently serious to justify him in following his telegram to paris it was clearly his duty as an old friend to mention to mr farnaby what he had discovered at the cottage as well as what he had heard from the landlady and the doctor leaving it to the uncles discretion to act as he thought right in the interests of the niece whether that course of action might not also serve the interests of mr melton himself in the character of an unsuccessful suitor for reginas hand he did not stop to inquire beyond his duty it was for the present at least not his business to look  that night the two gentlemen held a private consultation in paris the doctor having previously certified that his patient was incapable of supporting the journey back to london under any circumstances  the question of the formal proceedings rendered necessary by mrs farnabys death having been discussed and disposed of mr melton next entered on the narrative which the obligations of friendship imperatively demanded from him to his astonishment and alarm mr farnaby started up in the bed like a man panicstricken did you say he stammered as soon as he could speak you mean to make inquiries about thatthat girl  i certainly thought it desirable bearing in mind mr goldenhearts position in your family  do nothing of the sort say nothing to regina or to any living creature wait till i get well againand leave me to deal with it i am the proper person to take it in hand dont you see that for yourself and look here there may be questions asked at the inquest some impudent scoundrel on the jury may want to pry into what doesnt concern him the moment youre back in london get a lawyer to represent usthe sharpest fellow that can be had for money tell him to stop all prying questions who the girl is and what made that cursed young socialist goldenheart take her upstairs with himall that sort of thing has nothing to do with the manner in which my wife met her death you understand i look to you melton to see yourself that this is done the less said at the infernal inquest the better in my position its an exposure that my enemies will make the most of as it is im too ill to go into the thing any further no i dont want regina go to her in the sitting room and tell the courier to get you something to eat and drink and i say for gods sake dont be late for the boulogne train tomorrow morning  left by himself he gave full vent to his fury he cursed amelius with oaths that are not to be written  he had burnt the letter which mrs farnaby had written to him on leaving him forever but he had not burnt out of his memory the words which that letter contained with his wifes language vividly present to his mind he could arrive at but one conclusion after what mr melton had told him amelius was concerned in the discovery of his deserted daughter amelius had taken the girl to her dying mothers bedside with his idiotic socialist notions he would be perfectly capable of owning the truth if inquiries were made the unblemished reputation which john farnaby had built up by the selfseeking hypocrisy of a lifetime was at the mercy of a visionary young fool who believed that rich men were created for the benefit of the poor and who proposed to regenerate society by reviving the obsolete morality of the primitive christians was it possible for him to come to terms with such a person as this there was not an inch of common ground on which they could meet he dropped back on his pillow in despair and lay for a while frowning and biting his nails suddenly he sat up again in the bed and wiped his moist forehead and heaved a heavy breath of relief had his illness obscured his intelligence how was it he had not seen at once the perfectly easy way out of the difficulty which was presented by the facts themselves here is a man engaged to marry my niece who has been discovered keeping a girl at his cottagewho even had the audacity to take her upstairs with him when he made a call on my wife charge him with it in plain words break off the engagement publicly in the face of society and if the profligate scoundrel tries to defend himself by telling the truth who will believe himwhen the girl was seen running out of his room and when he refused on the question being put to him to say who she was  so in ignorance of his wifes last instructions to ameliusin equal ignorance of the compassionate silence which an honourable man preserves when a womans reputation is at his mercythe wretch needlessly plotted and planned to save his usurped reputation seeing all things as such men invariably do through the foul light of his own inbred baseness and cruelty he was troubled by no retributive emotions of shame or remorse in contemplating this second sacrifice to his own interests of the daughter whom he had deserted in her infancy if he felt any misgivings they related wholly to himself his head was throbbing his tongue was dry a dread of increasing his illness shook him suddenly he drank some of the lemonade at his bedside and lay down to compose himself to sleep  it was not to be done there was a burning in his eyeballs there was a wild irregular beating at his heart which kept him awake in some degree at least retribution seemed to be on the way to him already  mr melton delicately administering sympathy and consolation to reginawhose affectionate nature felt keenly the calamity of her aunts deathmr melton making himself modestly useful by reading aloud certain devotional poems much prized by regina was called out of the room by the courier  i have just looked in at mr farnaby sir said the man and i am afraid he is worse  the physician was sent for he thought so seriously of the change in the patient that he obliged regina to accept the services of a professed nurse when mr melton started on his return journey the next morning he left his friend in a high fever    chapter 2  the inquiry into the circumstances under which mrs farnaby had died was held in the forenoon of the next day  mr melton surprised amelius by calling for him and taking him to the inquest the carriage stopped on the way and a gentleman joined them who was introduced as mr meltons legal adviser he spoke to amelius about the inquest stating as his excuse for asking certain discreet questions that his object was to suppress any painful disclosures on reaching the house mr melton and his lawyer said a few words to the coroner downstairs while the jury were assembling on the floor above  the first witness examined was the landlady  after deposing to the date at which the late mrs farnaby had hired her lodgings and verifying the statements which had appeared in the newspapers she was questioned about the life and habits of the deceased she described her late lodger as a respectable lady punctual in her payments and quiet and orderly in her way of life she received letters but saw no friends on several occasions an old woman was admitted to speak with her and these visits seemed to be anything but agreeable to the deceased asked if she knew anything of the old woman or of what had passed at the interviews described the witness answered both questions in the negative when the woman called she always told the servant to announce her as the nurse  mr melton was next examined to prove the identity of the deceased  he declared that he was quite unable to explain why she had left her husbands house under an assumed name asked if mr and mrs farnaby had lived together on affectionate terms he acknowledged that he had heard at various times of a want of harmony between them but was not acquainted with the cause mr farnabys high character and position in the commercial world spoke for themselves the restraints of a gentleman guided him in his relations with his wife the medical certificate of his illness in paris was then put in and mr meltons examination came to an end  the chemist who had made up the prescription was the third witness he knew the woman who brought it to his shop to be in the service of the first witness examined an old customer of his and a highly respected resident in the neighbourhood he made up all prescriptions himself in which poisons were conspicuous ingredients and he had affixed to the bottle a slip of paper bearing the word poison printed in large letters the bottle was produced and identified and the directions in the prescription were shown to have been accurately copied on the label  a general sensation of interest was excited by the appearance of the next witnessthe woman servant it was anticipated that her evidence would explain how the fatal mistake about the medicine had occurred after replying to the formal inquiries she proceeded as follows  when i answered the bell at the time i have mentioned i found the deceased standing at the fireplace there was a bottle of medicine on the table by her writing desk it was a much larger bottle than that which the last witness identified and it was more than three parts full of some colourless medicine the deceased gave me a prescription to take to the chemists with instructions to wait and bring back the physic she said i dont feel at all well this morning i thought of trying some of this medicine pointing to the bottle by her desk but i am not sure it is the right thing for me i think i want a tonic the prescription i have given you is a tonic i went out at once to our chemist and got it i found her writing a letter when i came back but she finished it immediately and pushed it away from her when i put the bottle i had brought from the chemist on the table she looked at the other larger bottle which she had by her and she said you will think me very undecided i have been doubting since i sent you to the chemist whether i had not better begin with this medicine here before i try the tonic its a medicine for the stomach and i fancy its only indigestion thats the matter with me after all i said you eat but a poor breakfast maam this morning it isnt for me to advise but as you seem to be in doubt about yourself wouldnt it be better to send for a doctor she shook her head and said she didnt want to have a doctor if she could possibly help it ill try the medicine for indigestion first she says and if it doesnt relieve me we will see what is to be done later in the day while we were talking the tonic was left in its sealed paper cover just as i had brought it from the shop she took up the bottle containing the stomach medicine and read the directions on it two tablespoonsful by measureglass twice a day i asked if she had a measureglass and she said yes and sent me to her bedroom to look for it i couldnt find it while i was looking i heard her cry out and ran back to the drawingroom to see what was the matter oh she says how clumsy i am ive broken the bottle she held up the bottle of the stomach medicine and showed it to me broken just below the neck go back to the bedroom she says and see if you can find an empty bottle i dont want to waste the medicine if i can help it there was only one empty bottle in the bedroom a bottle on the chimneypiece i took it to her immediately she gave me the broken bottle and while i poured the medicine into the bottle which i had found in the bedroom she opened the paper which covered the tonic i had brought from the chemist when i had done and the two bottles were together on the tablethe bottle that i had filled and the bottle that i had brought front the chemisti noticed that they were both of the same size and that both had a label pasted on them marked poison i said to her you must take care maam you dont make any mistake the two bottles are so exactly alike i can easily prevent that she says and dipped her pen in the ink and copied the directions on the broken bottle on to the label of the bottle that i had just filled there she said now i hope your minds at ease she spoke cheerfully as if she was joking with me and then she said but wheres the measureglass i went back to the bedroom to look for it and couldnt find it again she changed all at once upon thatshe became quite angry and walked up and down in a fume abusing me for my stupidity it was very unlike her on all other occasions she was a most considerate lady i made allowances for her she had been very much upset earlier in the morning when she had received a letter which she told me herself contained bad news yes another person was present at the timethe same woman that my mistress told you of the woman looked at the address on the letter and seemed to know who it was from i told her a squinteyed man had brought it to the houseand then she left directly i dont know where she went or the address at which she lives or who the messenger was who brought the letter as i have said i made allowances for the deceased lady i went downstairs without answering and got a tumbler and a tablespoon to serve instead of the measureglass when i came back with the things she was still walking about in a temper she took no notice of me i left the room again quietly seeing she was not in a state to be spoken to i saw nothing more of her until we were alarmed by hearing her scream we found the poor lady on the floor in a kind of fit i ran out and fetched the nearest doctor this is the whole truth on my oath and this is all i know about it  the landlady was recalled at the request of the jury and questioned again about the old woman she could give no information being asked next if any letters or papers belonging to or written by the deceased lady had been found she declared that after the strictest search nothing had been discovered but two medical prescriptions the writing desk was empty  the doctor was the next witness  he described the state in which he found the patient on being called to the house the symptoms were those of poisoning by strychnine examination of the prescriptions and the bottles aided by the servants information convinced him that a fatal mistake had been made by the deceased the nature of which he explained to the jury as he had already explained it to amelius having mentioned the meeting with amelius at the housedoor and the events which had followed he closed his evidence by stating the result of the postmortem examination proving that the death was caused by the poison called strychnine  the landlady and the servant were examined again they were instructed to inform the jury exactly of the time that had elapsed from the moment when the servant had left the deceased alone in the drawingroom to the time when the screams were first heard having both given the same evidence on this point they were next asked whether any person besides the old woman had visited the deceased ladyor had on any pretence obtained access to her in the interval both swore positively that there had not even been a knock at the housedoor in the interval and that the areagate was locked and the key in the possession of the landlady this evidence placed it beyond the possibility of doubt that the deceased had herself taken the poison the question whether she had taken it by accident was the only question left to decide when amelius was called as the next witness  the lawyer retained by mr melton to watch the case on behalf of mr farnaby had hitherto not interfered it was observed that he paid the closest attention to the inquiry at the stage which it had now reached  amelius was nervous at the outset the early training in america which had hardened him to face an audience and speak with selfpossession on social and political subjects had not prepared him for the very difficult ordeal of a first appearance as a witness having answered the customary inquiries he was so painfully agitated in describing mrs farnabys sufferings that the coroner suspended the examination for a few minutes to give him time to control himself he failed however to recover his composure until the narrative part of his evidence had come to an end when the critical questions bearing on his relations with mrs farnaby began the audience noticed that he lifted his head and looked and spoke for the first time like a man with a settled resolution in him sure of himself  the questions proceeded  was he in mrs farnabys confidence on the subject of her domestic differences with her husband did those differences lead to her withdrawing herself from her husbands roof did mrs farnaby inform him of the place of her retreat to these three questions the witness speaking quite readily in each case answered yes asked next what the nature of the domestic differences had been whether they were likely to affect mrs farnabys mind seriously why she had passed under an assumed name and why she had confided the troubles of her married life to a young man like himself only introduced to her a few months since the witness simply declined to reply to the inquiries addressed to him the confidence mrs farnaby placed in me he said to the coroner was a confidence which i gave her my word of honour to respect when i have said that i hope the jury will understand that i owe it to the memory of the dead to say no more  there was a murmur of approval among the audience instantly checked by the coroner the foreman of the jury rose and remarked that scruples of honour were out of place at a serious inquiry of that sort hearing this the lawyer saw his opportunity and got on his legs i represent the husband of the deceased lady he said mr goldenheart has appealed to the law of honour to justify him in keeping silence i am astonished that there is a man to be found in this assembly who fails to sympathize with him but as there appears to be such a person present i ask permission sir to put a question to the witness it may or may not satisfy the foreman of the jury but it will certainly assist the object of the present inquiry  the coroner after a glance at mr melton permitted the lawyer to put his question in these terms  did your knowledge of mrs farnabys domestic troubles give you any reason to apprehend that they might urge her to commit suicide  certainly not amelius answered when i called on her on the morning of her death i had no apprehension whatever of her committing suicide i went to the house as the bearer of good news and i said so to the doctor when he first spoke to me  the doctor confirmed this the foreman was silenced if not convinced one of his brotherjurymen however feeling the force of example interrupted the proceedings by assailing amelius with another questionwe have heard that you were accompanied by a young lady at the time you have mentioned and that you took her upstairs with you we want to know what business the young lady had in the house  the lawyer interfered again i object to that question he said the purpose of the inquest is to ascertain how mrs farnaby met with her death what has the young lady to do with it the doctors evidence has already told us that she was not at the house until after he had been called in and the deadly action of the poison had begun i appeal sir to the law of evidence and to you as the presiding authority to enforce it mr goldenheart who is acquainted with the circumstances of the deceased ladys life has declared on his oath that there was nothing in those circumstances to inspire him with any apprehension of her committing suicide the evidence of the servant at the lodgings points plainly to the conclusion already arrived at by the medical witness that the death was the result of a lamentable mistake and of that alone is our time to be wasted in irrelevant questions and are the feelings of the surviving relatives to be cruelly lacerated to no purpose to satisfy the curiosity of strangers  a strong expression of approval from the audience followed this the lawyer whispered to mr melton its all right  order being restored the coroner ruled that the jurymans question was not admissible and that the servants evidence taken with the statements of the doctor and the chemist was the only evidence for the consideration of the jury summing up to this effect he recalled amelius at the request of the foreman to inquire if the witness knew anything of the old woman who had been frequently alluded to in the course of the proceedings amelius could answer this question as honestly as he had answered the questions preceding it he neither knew the womans name nor where she was to be found the coroner inquired with a touch of irony if the jury wished the inquest to be adjourned under existing circumstances  for the sake of appearances the jury consulted together but the luncheonhour was approaching the servants evidence was undeniably clear and conclusive the coroner in summing up had requested them not to forget that the deceased had lost her temper with the servant and that an angry woman might well make a mistake which would be unlikely in her cooler moments all these influences led the jury irrepressibly over the obstacles of obstinacy on the way to submission after a needless delay they returned a verdict of death by misadventure the secret of mrs farnabys suicide remained inviolate the reputation of her vile husband stood as high as ever and the future life of amelius was from that fatal moment turned irrevocably into a new course    chapter 3  on the conclusion of the proceedings mr melton having no further need of amelius or the lawyer drove away by himself but he was too inveterately polite to omit making his excuses for leaving them in a hurry he expected he said to find a telegram from paris waiting at his house amelius only delayed his departure to ask the landlady if the day of the funeral was settled hearing that it was arranged for the next morning he thanked her and returned at once to the cottage  sally was waiting his arrival to complete some purchases of mourning for her unhappy mother toffs wife being in attendance to take care of her she was curious to know how the inquest had ended in answering her question amelius was careful to warn her if her companion made any inquiries only to say that she had lost her mother under very sad circumstances the two having left the cottage he instructed toff to let in a stranger who was to call by previous appointment and to close the door to every one else in a few minutes the expected person a young man who gave the name of morcross made his appearance and sorely puzzled the old frenchman he was well dressed his manner was quiet and selfpossessedand yet he did not look like a gentleman in fact he was a policeman of the higher order in plain clothes  being introduced to the library he spread out on the table some sheets of manuscript in the handwriting of amelius with notes in red ink on the margin made by himself  i understand sir he began that you have reasons for not bringing this case to trial in a court of law  i am sorry to say amelius answered that i dare not consent to the exposure of a public trial for the sake of persons living and dead for the same reason i have written the account of the conspiracy with certain reserves i hope i have not thrown any needless difficulties in your way  certainly not sir but i should wish to ask what you propose to do in case i discover the people concerned in the conspiracy  amelius owned very reluctantly that he could do nothing with the old woman who had been the accomplice unless he added i can induce her to assist me in bringing the man to justice for other crimes which i believe him to have committed  meaning the man named jervy sir in this statement  yes i have reason to believe that he has been obliged to leave the united states after committing some serious offence  i beg your pardon for interrupting you sir is it serious enough to charge him with under the treaty between the two countries  i dont doubt its serious enough i have telegraphed to the persons who formerly employed him for the particulars mind this i will stick at no sacrifice to make that scoundrel suffer for what he has done  in those plain words amelius revealed as frankly as usual the purpose that was in him the terrible remembrances associated with mrs farnabys last moments had kindled in his just and generous nature a burning sense of the wrong inflicted on the poor heartbroken creature who had trusted and loved him the unendurable thought that the wretch who had tortured her robbed her and driven her to her death had escaped with impunity literally haunted him night and day eager to provide for sallys future he had followed mrs farnabys instructions and had seen the lawyer privately during the period that had elapsed between the death and the inquest hearing that there were formalities to be complied with which would probably cause some delay he had at once announced his determination to employ the interval in attempting the pursuit of jervy the lawyerafter vainly pointing out the serious objections to the course proposedso far yielded to the irresistible earnestness and good faith of amelius as to recommend him to a competent man who could be trusted not to deceive him the same day the man had received a written statement of the case and he had now arrived to report the result of his first proceedings to his employer  one thing i want to know before you tell me anything else amelius resumed is my written description of jervy plain enough to help you to find him  its so plain sir that some of the older men in our office have recognized him by itunder another name than the name you give him  does that add to the difficulty of tracing him  he has been a long time away from england sir and its by no means easy to trace him on that account i have been to the young woman named phoebe in your statement to find out what she can tell me about him shes ready enough in the intervals of crying to help us to lay our hands on the man who has deserted her its the old story of a fellow getting at a girls secrets and a girls money under pretence of marrying her at one time shes furious with him and at another shes ready to cry her eyes out i got some information from her its not much but it may help us the name of the old woman who has been the gobetween in the business is mrs sowlerknown to the police as an inveterate drunkard and worse i dont think there will be much difficulty in tracing mrs sowler as to jervy if the young woman is to be believed and i think she is theres little doubt that he has got the money from the lady mentioned in my instructions here and that he has bolted with the sum about him wait a bit sir i havent done with my discoveries yet i asked the young woman of course if she had his photograph hes a sharp fellow she had it but he got it away from her on pretence of giving her a better one before he took himself off having missed this chance i asked next if she knew where he lived last she directed me to the place and i have had a talk with the landlord he tells me of a squinteyed man who was a good deal about the house doing jervys dirty work for him if i am not misled by the description i think i know the man i have my own notion of what hes capable of doing if he gets the chanceand i propose to begin by finding our way to him and using him as a means of tracing jervy its only right to tell you that it may take some time to do thisfor which reason i have to propose in the mean while trying a shorter way to the end in view do you object sir to the expense of sending a copy of your description of jervy to every policestation in london  i object to nothing which may help to find him do you think the police have got him anywhere  you forget sir that the police have no orders to take him what im speculating on is the chance that he has got the money about himsay in small banknotes for convenience of changing them you know  well  well sir the people he lives amongthe squinteyed man for instancedont stick at trifles if any of them have found out that jervys purse is worth having  you mean they would rob him  and murder him too sir if he tried to resist  amelius started to his feet send round to the policestations without losing another minute he said and let me hear what the answer is the instant you receive it  suppose i get the answer late at night sir  i dont care when you get it night or day dead or living i will undertake to identify him heres a duplicate key of the garden gate come this way and ill show you where my bedroom is if we are all in bed tap at the windowand i will be ready for you at a moments notice  on that understanding morcross left the cottage  the day when the mortal remains of mrs farnaby were laid at rest was a day of heavy rain mr melton and two or three other old friends were the attendants at the funeral when the coffin was borne into the damp and reeking burial ground a young man and a woman were the only persons beside the sexton and his assistants who stood by the open grave mr melton recognizing amelius was at a loss to understand who his companion could be it was impossible to suppose that he would profane that solemn ceremony by bringing to it the lost woman at the cottage the thick black veil of the person with him hid her face from view no visible expressions of grief escaped her when the last sublime words of the burial service had been read those two mourners were left after the others had all departed still standing together by the grave mr melton decided on mentioning the circumstance confidentially when he wrote to his friend in paris telegrams from regina in reply to his telegrams from london had informed him that mr farnaby had felt the benefit of the remedies employed and was slowly on the way to recovery it seemed likely that he would in no long time take the right course for the protection of his niece for the enlightenment which might or might not come with that time mr melton was resigned to wait with the disciplined patience to which he had been mainly indebted for his success in life   always remember your mother tenderly my child said amelius as they left the burial ground she was sorely tried poor thing in her life time and she loved you very dearly  do you know anything of my father sally asked timidly is he still living  my dear you will never see your father i must be all that the kindest father and mother could have been to you now oh my poor little girl  she pressed his arm to her as she held it why should you pity me she said havent i got you  they passed the day together quietly at the cottage amelius took down some of his books and pleased sally by giving her his first lessons soon after ten oclock she withdrew at the usual early hour to her room in her absence he sent for toff intending to warn him not to be alarmed if he heard footsteps in the garden after they had all gone to bed the old servant had barely entered the library when he was called away by the bell at the outer gate amelius looking into the hall discovered morcross and signed to him eagerly to come in the policeofficer closed the door cautiously behind him he had arrived with news that jervy was found    chapter 4  where has he been found amelius asked snatching up his hat  theres no hurry sir morcross answered quietly when i had the honour of seeing you yesterday you said you meant to make jervy suffer for what he had done somebody else has saved you the trouble he was found this evening in the river  drowned  stabbed in three places sir and put out of the way in the riverthats the surgeons report robbed of everything he possessedthats the police report after searching his pockets  amelius was silent it had not entered into his calculations that crime breeds crime and that the criminal might escape him under that law for the moment he was conscious of a sense of disappointment revealing plainly that the desire for vengeance had mingled with the higher motives which animated him he felt uneasy and ashamed and longed as usual to take refuge in action from his own unwelcome thoughts are you sure it is the man he asked my description may have misled the policei should like to see him myself  certainly sir while we are about it if you feel any curiosity to trace jervys illgotten money theres a chance from what i have heard of finding the man with the squint the people at our place think its likely he may have been concerned in the robbery if he hasnt committed the murder  in an hour after under the guidance of morcross amelius passed through the dreary doors of a deadhouse situated on the southern bank of the thames and saw the body of jervy stretched out on a stone slab the guardian who held the lantern inured to such horrible sights declared that the corpse could not have been in the water more than two days to any one who had seen the murdered man the face undisfigured by injury of any kind was perfectly recognizable amelius knew him again dead as certainly as he had known him again living when he was waiting for phoebe in the street  if youre satisfied sir said morcross the inspector at the policestation is sending a sergeant to look after walleyesthe name they give hereabouts to the man suspected of the robbery we can take the sergeant with us in the cab if you like  still keeping on the southern bank of the river they drove for a quarter of an hour in a westerly direction and stopped at a publichouse the sergeant of police went in by himself to make the first inquiries  we are a day too late sir he said to amelius on returning to the cab walleyes was here last night and mother sowler with him judging by the description both of them drunkand the woman the worse of the two the landlord knew nothing more about it but theres a man at the bar tells me he heard of them this morning still drinking at the dairy  the dairy amelius repeated  morcross interposed with the necessary explanation an old house sir which once stood by itself in the fields it was a dairy a hundred years ago and it has kept the name ever since though its nothing but a low lodging house now  one of the worst places on this side of the river the sergeant added the landlords a returned convict sly as he is we shall have him again yet for receiving stolen goods theres every sort of thief among his lodgers from a pickpocket to a housebreaker its my duty to continue the inquiry sir but a gentleman like you will be better i should say out of such a place as that  still disquieted by the sight that he had seen in the deadhouse and by the associations which that sight had recalled amelius was ready for any adventure which might relieve his mind even the prospect of a visit to a thieves lodging house was more welcome to him than the prospect of going home alone if theres no serious objection to it he said i own i should like to see the place  youll be safe enough with us the sergeant replied if you dont mind filthy people and bad languageall right sir cabman drive to the dairy  their direction was now towards the south through a perfect labyrinth of mean and dirty streets twice the driver was obliged to ask his way on the second occasion the sergeant putting his head out of the window to stop the cab cried hullo theres something up  they got out in front of a long low rambling house a complete contrast to the modern buildings about it late as the hour was a mob had assembled in front of the door the police were on the spot keeping the people in order  morcross and the sergeant pushed their way through the crowd leading amelius between them something wrong sir in the back kitchen said one of the policemen answering the sergeant while he opened the street door a few yards down the passage there was a second door with a man on the watch by it theres a nice todo downstairs the man announced recognizing the sergeant and unlocking the door with a key which he took from his pocket the landlord at the dairy knows his lodgers sir morcross whispered to amelius the place is kept like a prison as they passed through the second door a frantic voice startled them shouting in fury from below an old man came hobbling up the kitchen stairs his eyes wild with fear his long grey hair all tumbled over his face oh lord have you got the tools for breaking open the door he asked wringing his dirty hands in an agony of supplication shell set the house on fire shell kill my wife and daughter the sergeant pushed him contemptuously out of the way and looked round for amelius its only the landlord sir keep near morcross and follow me  they descended the kitchen stairs the frantic cries below growing louder and louder at every step they took and made their way through the thieves and vagabonds crowding together in the passage passing on their right hand a solid old oaken door fast closed they reached an open wicketgate of iron which led into a stonepaved yard a heavily barred window was now visible in the back wall of the house raised three or four feet from the pavement of the yard the room within was illuminated by a blaze of gaslight more policemen were here keeping back more inquisitive lodgers among the spectators was a man with a hideous outward squint holding by the windowbars in a state of drunken terror the sergeant looked at him and beckoned to one of the policemen take him to the station i shall have something to say to walleyes when hes sober now then stand back all of you and lets see whats going on in the kitchen  he took amelius by the arm and led him to the window even the sergeant started when the scene inside met his view by god he cried its mother sowler herself  it was mother sowler the horrible woman was tramping round and round in the middle of the kitchen like a beast in a cage raving in the dreadful drinkmadness called delirium tremens in the farthest corner of the room barricaded behind the table the landlords wife and daughter crouched in terror of their lives the gas turned full on blazed high enough to blacken the ceiling and showed the heavy bolts shot at the top and bottom of the solid door nothing less than a batteringram could have burst that door in from the outer side an hours work with the file would have failed to break a passage through the bars over the window how did she get there the sergeant asked run downstairs and bolted herself in while the missus and the young un were cookingwas the answering cry from the people in the yard as they spoke another vain attempt was made to break in the door from the passage the noise of the heavy blows redoubled the frenzy of the terrible creature in the kitchen still tramping round and round under the blazing gaslight suddenly she made a dart at the window and confronted the men looking in from the yard her staring eyes were bloodshot a purplered flush was over her face her hair waved wildly about her torn away in places by her own hands cats she screamed glaring out of the window millions of cats all their months wide open spitting at me fire fire to scare away the cats she searched furiously in her pocket and tore out a handful of loose papers one of them escaped and fluttered downward to a wooden press under the window amelius was nearest and saw it plainly as it fell good heavens he exclaimed its a banknote walleyes money shouted the thieves in the yard shes going to burn walleyes money the madwoman turned back to the middle of the kitchen leapt up at the gasburner and set fire to the banknotes she scattered them flaming all round her on the kitchen floor away with you she shouted shaking her fists at the visionary multitude of cats away with you up the chimney away with you out of the window she sprang back to the window with her crooked fingers twisted in her hair the snakes she shrieked the snakes are hissing again in my hair the beetles are crawling over my face she tore at her hair she scraped her face with long black nails that lacerated the flesh amelius turned away unable to endure the sight of her morcross took his place eyed her steadily for a moment and saw the way to end it a quarter of gin he shouted quick before she leaves the window in a minute he had the pewter measure in his hand and tapped at the window gin mother sowler break the window and have a drop of gin for a moment the drunkard mastered her own dreadful visions at the sight of the liquor she broke a pane of glass with her clenched fist the door cried morcross to the panicstricken women barricaded behind the table the door he reiterated as he handed the gin in through the bars the elder woman was too terrified to understand him her bolder daughter crawled under the table rushed across the kitchen and drew the bolts as the madwoman turned to attack her the room was filled with men headed by the sergeant three of them were barely enough to control the frantic wretch and bind her hand and foot when amelius entered the kitchen after she had been conveyed to the hospital a fivepound note on the press secured by one of the police and a few frail black ashes scattered thinly on the kitchen floor were the only relics left of the illgotten money   afterinquiry patiently pursued in more than one direction failed to throw any light on the mystery of jervys death morcrosss report to amelius towards the close of the investigation was little more than ingenious guesswork  it seems pretty clear sir in the first place that mother sowler must have overtaken walleyes after he had left the letter at mrs farnabys lodgings in the second place we are justified as i shall show you directly in assuming that she told him of the money in jervys possession and that the two succeeded in discovering jervyno doubt through walleyes superior knowledge of his masters movements the evidence concerning the banknotes proves this we know by the examination of the people at the dairy that walleyes took from his pocket a handful of notes when they refused to send for liquor without having the money first we are also informed that the breakingout of the drinkmadness in mother sowler showed itself in her snatching the notes out of his hand and trying to strangle himbefore she ran down into the kitchen and bolted herself in lastly mrs farnabys bankers have identified the note saved from the burning as one of forty fivepound notes paid to her cheque so much for the tracing of the money  i wish i could give an equally satisfactory account of the tracing of the crime we can make nothing of walleyes he declares that he didnt even know jervy was dead till we told him and he swears he found the money dropped in the street it is needless to say that this last assertion is a lie opinions are divided among us as to whether he is answerable for the murder as well as the robbery or whether there was a third person concerned in it my own belief is that jervy was drugged by the old woman with a young woman very likely used as a decoy in some house by the riverside and then murdered by walleyes in cold blood we have done our best to clear the matter up and we have not succeeded the doctors give us no hope of any assistance from mother sowler if she gets over the attack which is doubtful they say she will die to a certainty of liver disease in short my own fear is that this will prove to be one more of those murders which are mysteries to the police as well as the public  the report of the case excited some interest published in the newspapers in conspicuous type meddlesome readers wrote letters offering complacently stupid suggestions to the police after a while another crime attracted general attention and the murder of jervy disappeared from the public memory among other forgotten murders of modern times    chapter 5  the last dreary days of november came to their end  no longer darkened by the shadows of crime and torment and death the life of amelius glided insensibly into the peaceful byways of seclusion brightened by the companionship of sally the winter days followed one another in a happy uniformity of occupations and amusements there were lessons to fill up the morning and walks to occupy the afternoonand in the evenings sometimes reading sometimes singing sometimes nothing but the lazy luxury of talk in the vast world of london with its monstrous extremes of wealth and poverty and its allpermeating malady of life at feverheat there was one supremely innocent and supremely happy creature sally had heard of heaven attainable on the hard condition of first paying the debt of death i have found a kinder heaven she said one day it is here in the cottage and amelius has shown me the way to it  their social isolation was at this time complete they were two friendless people perfectly insensible to all that was perilous and pitiable in their own position they parted with a kiss at night and they met again with a kiss in the morningand they were as happily free from all mistrust of the future as a pair of birds no visitors came to the house the few friends and acquaintances of amelius forgotten by him forgot him in return now and then toffs wife came to the cottage and exhibited the cherubimbaby now and then toff himself a musician among his other accomplishments brought his fiddle upstairs and saying modestly a little music helps to pass the time played to the young master and mistress the cheerful tinkling tunes of the old vaudevilles of france they were pleased with these small interruptions when they came and they were not disappointed when the days passed and the baby and the vaudevilles were hushed in absence and silence so the happy winter time went by and the howling winds brought no rheumatism with them and even the taxgatherer himself looking in at this earthly paradise departed without a curse when he left his little paper behind him  now and then at long intervals the outer world intruded itself in the form of a letter  regina wrote always with the same placid affection always entering into the same minute narrative of the slow progress of dear uncles return to health he was forbidden to exert himself in any way his nerves were in a state of lamentable irritability i dare not even mention your name to him dear amelius it seems i cannot think why to make himoh so unreasonably angry i can only submit and pray that he may soon be himself again amelius wrote back always in the same considerate and gentle tone always laying the blame of his dull letters on the studious uniformity of his life he preserved with a perfectly easy conscience the most absolute silence on the subject of sally while he was faithful to regina what reason had he to reproach himself with the protection that he offered to a poor motherless girl when he was married he might mention the circumstances under which he had met with sally and leave the rest to his wifes sympathy  one morning the letters with the paris postmark were varied by a few lines from rufus  every morning my bright boy i get up and say to myself well i reckon its about time to take the route for london and every morning if youll believe me i put it off till next day whether its in the good feeding expensive i admit but when your cook helps you to digest instead of hindering you a man of my dyspeptic nation is too grateful to complainor whether its in the air which reminds me i do assure you of our native atmosphere at coolspring mass is more than i can tell with a hard steel pen on a leaf of flimsy paper you have heard the saying when a good american dies he goes to paris maybe sometimes hes smart enough to discount his own death and rationally enjoy the future time in the present this you see is a poetic light but mercy be praised the moral of my residence in paris is plainif i cant go to amelius amelius must come to me note the address grand hotel and pack up like a good boy on receipt of this memorandum the brown miss is here i saw her taking the air in a carriage and raised my hat she looked the other way  britisheminently british but there i bear no malice i am her most obedient servant and yours affectionately rufuspostscript i want you to see some of our girls at this hotel the genuine american material sir perfected by worth  another morning brought with it a few sad lines from phoebe after what had happened she was quite unable to face her friends she had no heart to seek employment in her own countryher present life was too dreary and too hopeless to be endured a benevolent lady had made her an offer to accompany a party of emigrants to new zealand and she had accepted the proposal perhaps among the new people she might recover her selfrespect and her spirits and live to be a better woman meanwhile she bade mr goldenheart farewell and asked his pardon for taking the liberty of wishing him happy with miss regina  amelius wrote a few kind lines to phoebe and a cordial reply to rufus making the pursuit of his studies his excuse for remaining in london after this there was no further correspondence the mornings succeeded each other and the postman brought no more news from the world outside  but the lessons went on and the teacher and pupil were as inconsiderately happy as ever in each others society observing with inexhaustible interest the progress of the mental development of sally amelius was slow to perceive the physical development which was unobtrusively keeping pace with it he was absolutely ignorant of the part which his own influence was taking in the gradual and delicate process of change ere long the first forewarnings of the coming disturbance in their harmless relations towards each other began to show themselves ere long there were signs of a troubled mind in sally which were mysteries to amelius and subjects of wonderment sometimes even trials of temper to the girl herself  one day she looked in from the door of her room in her white dressinggown and asked to be forgiven if she kept the lessons of the morning waiting for a little while  come in said amelius and tell me why  she hesitated you wont think me lazy if you see me in my dressinggown  of course not your dressinggown my dear is as good as any other gown a young girl like you looks best in white  she came in with her workbasket and her indoor dress over her arm  amelius laughed why havent you put it on he asked  she sat down in a corner and looked at her workbasket instead of looking at amelius it doesnt fit me so well as it did she answered i am obliged to alter it  amelius looked at herat the charming youthful figure that had filled out at the softlyrounded outline of the face with no angles and hollows in it now is it the dressmakers fault he asked slyly  her eyes were still on the basket its my fault she said you remember what a poor little skinny creature i was when you first saw me iyou wont like me the worse for it will youi am getting fat i dont know why they say happy people get fat perhaps thats why im never hungry and never frightened and never miserable now she stopped her dress slipped from her lap to the floor dont look at me she saidand suddenly put her hands over her face  amelius saw the tears finding their way through the pretty plump fingers which he remembered so shapeless and so thin he crossed the room and touched her gently on the shoulder my dear child have i said anything to distress you  nothing  then why are you crying  i dont know she hesitated looked at him and made a desperate effort to tell him what was in her mind im afraid youll get tired of me theres nothing about me to make you pity me now you seem to benot quite the sameno it isnt thati dont know whats come to meim a greater fool than ever give me my lesson amelius please give me my lesson  amelius produced the books in some little surprise at sallys extraordinary anxiety to begin her lessons while the unaltered dress lay neglected on the carpet at her feet a discreet abstract of the history of england published for the use of young persons happened to be at the top of the books the system of education under amelius recognized the laws of chance they began with the history because it turned up first sally read aloud and sallys master explained obscure passages and corrected occasional errors of pronunciation as she went on on that particular morning there was little to explain and nothing to correct am i doing it well today sally inquired on reaching the end of her task  very well indeed  she shut the book and looked at her teacher i wonder how it is she resumed that i get on so much better with my lessons here than i did at the home and yet its foolish of me to wonder i get on better because you are teaching me of course but i dont feel satisfied with myself im the same helpless creaturei feel your kindness and cant make any return to youfor all my learning i should like she left the thought in her unexpressed and opened her copybook ill do my writing now she said in a quiet resigned way perhaps i may improve enough some day to keep your accounts for you she chose her pen a little absently and began to write amelius looked over her shoulder and laughed she was writing his name he pointed to the copperplate copy on the top line presenting an undeniable moral maxim in characters beyond the reach of criticismchange is a law of nature there my dear you are to copy that till youre tired of it said the easy master and then well try overleaf another copy beginning with letter d  sally laid down her pen i dont like change is a law of nature she said knitting her pretty eyebrows into a frown i looked at those words yesterday and they made me miserable at night i was foolish enough to think that we should always go on together as we go on now till i saw that copy i hate the copy it came to my mind when i was awake in the dark and it seemed to tell me that we were going to change some day thats the worst of learningone knows too much and then theres an end of ones happiness thoughts come to you when you dont want them i thought of the young lady we saw last week in the park  she spoke gravely and sadly the bright contentment which had given a new charm to her eyes since she had been at the cottage died out of them as amelius looked at her what had become of her childish manner and her artless smile he drew his chair nearer to her what young lady do you mean he asked  sally shook her head and traced lines with her pen on the blotting paper oh you cant have forgotten her a young lady riding on a grand white horse all the people were admiring her i wonder you cared to look at me after that beautiful creature had gone by ah she knows all sorts of things that i dontshe doesnt sound a note at a time on the piano and as often as not the wrong one she can say her multiplication table and knows all the cities in the world i dare say shes almost as learned as you are if you had her living here with you wouldnt you like it better than only having me she dropped her arms on the table and laid her head on them wearily the dreadful streets she murmured in low tones of despair why did i think of the dreadful streets and the night i met with youafter i had seen the young lady oh amelius are you tired of me are you ashamed of me she lifted her head again before he could answer and controlled herself by a sudden effort of resolution i dont know whats the matter with me this morning she said looking at him with a pleading fear in her eyes never mind my nonsenseill do the copy she began to write the unendurable assertion that change is a law of nature with trembling fingers and fast heaving breath amelius took the pen gently out of her hand his voice faltered as he spoke to her  we will give up the lessons for today sally you have had a bad nights rest my dear and you are feeling itthats all do you think you are well enough to come out with me and try if the air will revive you a little  she rose and took his hand and kissed it i believe if i was dying i should get well enough to go out with you may i ask one little favour do you mind if we dont go into the park today  what has made you take a dislike to the park sally  we might meet the beautiful young lady again she answered with her head down i dont want to do that  we will go wherever you like my child you shall decidenot i  she gathered up her dress from the floor and hurried away to her roomwithout looking back at him as usual when she opened the door  left by himself amelius sat at the table mechanically turning over the lessonbooks sally had perplexed and even distressed him his capacity to preserve the harmless relations between them depended mainly on the mute appeal which the girls ignorant innocence unconsciously addressed to him he felt this vaguely without absolutely realizing it by some mysterious process of association which he was unable to follow a saying of the wise elder brother at tadmor revived in his memory while he was trying to see his way through the difficulties that beset him you will meet with many temptations amelius when you leave our community the old man had said at parting and most of them will come to you through women be especially on your guard my son if you meet with a woman who makes you feel truly sorry for her she is on the highroad to your passions through the open door of your sympathiesand all the more certainly if she is not aware of it herself amelius felt the truth expressed in those words as he had never felt it yet there had been signs of a changing nature in sally for some little time past but they had expressed themselves too delicately to attract the attention of a man unprepared to be on the watch only on that morning they had been marked enough to force themselves on his notice only on that morning she had looked at him and spoken to him as she had never looked or spoken before he began dimly to see the danger for both of them to which he had shut his eyes thus far where was the remedy what ought he to do those questions came naturally into his mindand yet his mind shrank from pursuing them  he got up impatiently and busied himself in putting away the lessonbooksa small duty hitherto always left to toff  it was useless his mind dwelt persistently on sally  while he moved about the room he still saw the look in her eyes he still heard the tone of her voice when she spoke of the young lady in the park the words of the good physician whom he had consulted about her recurred to his memory now the natural growth of her senses has been stunted like the natural growth of her body by starvation terror exposure to cold and other influences inherent in the life that she has led and then the doctor had spoken of nourishing food pure air and careful treatmentof the life in short which she had led at the cottageand had predicted that she would develop into an intelligent and healthy young woman again he asked himself what ought i to do  he turned aside to the window and looked out an idea occurred to him how would it be if he summoned courage enough to tell her that he was engaged to be married  no setting aside his natural dread of the shock that he might inflict on the poor grateful girl who had only known happiness under his care the detestable obstacle of mr farnaby stood immovably in his way sally would be sure to ask questions about his engagement and would never rest until they were answered it had been necessarily impossible to conceal her mothers name from her the discovery of her father if she heard of regina and reginas uncle would be simply a question of time what might such a man be not capable of doing what new act of treachery might he not commit if he found himself claimed by the daughter whom he had deserted even if the expression of mrs farnabys last wishes had not been sacred to amelius this consideration alone would have kept him silent for sallys sake  he now doubted for the first time if he had calculated wisely in planning to trust sallys sad story after his marriage to the sympathies of his wife the jealousy that she might naturally feel of a young girl who was an object of interest to her husband did not present the worst difficulty to contend with she believed in her uncles integrity as she believed in her religion what would she say what would she do if the innocent witness to farnabys infamy was presented to her if amelius asked the protection for sally which her own father had refused to her in her infancy and if he said as he must say your uncle is the man  and yet what prospect could he see but the prospect of making the disclosure when he looked to his own interests next and thought of his wedding day again the sinister figure of farnaby confronted him how could he receive the wretch whom regina would innocently welcome to the house there would be no longer a choice left it would be his duty to himself to tell his wife the terrible truth and what would be the result he recalled the whole course of his courtship and saw farnaby always on a level with himself in reginas estimation in spite of his natural cheerfulness in spite of his inbred courage his heart failed him when he thought of the time to come  as he turned away from the window sallys door opened she joined him ready for the walk her spirits had rallied assisted by the cheering influence of dressing to go out her charming smile brightened her face in sheer desperation reckless of what he did or said amelius held out both hands to welcome her thats right sally he cried look pleased and pretty my dear lets be happy while we canand let the future take care of itself    chapter 6  the capricious influences which combine to make us happy are never so certain to be absent influences as when we are foolish enough to talk about them amelius had talked about them when he and sally left the cottage the road which led them away from the park was also the road which led them past a church the influences of happiness left them at the church door  rows of carriages were in waiting hundreds of idle people were assembled about the church steps the thunderous music of the organ rolled out through the open doorsa grand wedding with choral service was in course of celebration sally begged amelius to take her in to see it they tried the front entrance and found it impossible to get through the crowd a side entrance and a fee to a verger succeeded better they obtained space enough to stand on with a view of the altar  the bride was a tall buxom girl splendidly dressed she performed her part in the ceremony with the most unruffled composure the bridegroom exhibited an instructive spectacle of aged nature sustained by art his hair his complexion his teeth his breast his shoulders and his legs showed what the wigmaker the valet the dentist the tailor and the hosier can do for a rich old man who wishes to present a juvenile appearance while he is buying a young wife no less than three clergymen were present conducting the sale the demeanour of the rich congregation was worthy of the glorious bygone days of the golden calf so far as could be judged by appearances one old lady in a pew close to the place at which amelius and sally were standing seemed to be the only person present who was not favourably impressed by the ceremony  i call it disgraceful the old lady remarked to a charming young person seated next to her  but the charming young personbeing the legitimate product of the present timehad no more sympathy with questions of sentiment than a hottentot how can you talk so grandmamma she rejoined he has twenty thousand a yearand that lucky girl will be mistress of the most splendid house in london  i dont care the old lady persisted its not the less a disgrace to everybody concerned in it there is many a poor friendless creature driven by hunger to the streets who has a better claim to our sympathy than that shameless girl selling herself in the house of god ill wait for you in the carriagei wont see any more of it  sally touched amelius take me out she whispered faintly  he supposed that the heat in the church had been too much for her are you better now he asked when they got into the open air  she held fast by his arm lets get farther away she said that lady is coming after usi dont want her to see me again i am one of the creatures she talked about is the mark of the streets on me after all you have done to rub it out  the wild misery in her words presented another development in her character which was entirely new to amelius my dear child he remonstrated you distress me when you talk in that way god knows the life you are leading now  but sallys mind was still full of its own acutely painful sense of what the lady had said i saw her she burst outi saw her look at me while she spoke  and she thought you better worth looking at than the brideand quite right too amelius rejoined come come sally be like yourself you dont want to make me unhappy about you i am sure  he had taken the right way with her she felt that simple appeal and asked his pardon with all the old charm in her manner and her voice for the moment she was simple sally again they walked on in silence when they had lost sight of the church amelius felt her hand beginning to tremble on his arm a mingled expression of tenderness and anxiety showed itself in her blue eyes as they looked up at him i am thinking of something else now she said i am thinking of you may i ask you something  amelius smiled the smile was not reflected as usual in sallys face its nothing particular she explained in an odd hurried way the church put it into my head you she hesitated and tried it under another form will you be married yourself amelius one of these days  he did his best to evade the question i am not rich sally like the old gentleman we have just seen  her eyes turned away from him she sighed softly to herself you will be married some day she said will you do one kind thing more for me amelius when i die you remember my reading in the newspaper of the new invention for burning the deadand my asking you about it you said you thought it was better than burying and you had a good mind to leave directions to be burnt instead of buried when your time came when my time has come will you leave other directions about yourself if i ask you  my dear you are talking in a very strange way if you will have it that i am to be married some day what has that to do with your death  it doesnt matter amelius when i have nothing left to live for i suppose its as likely as not i may die will you tell them to bury me in some quiet place away from london where there are very few graves and when you leave your directions dont say you are to be burnt saywhen you have lived a long long life and enjoyed all the happiness you have deserved so wellsay you are to be buried and your grave is to be near mine i should like to think of the same trees shading us and the same flowers growing over us no dont tell me im talking strangely againi cant bear it i want you to humour me and be kind to me about this do you mind going home im feeling a little tiredand i know im poor company for you today  the talk flagged at dinnertime though toff did his best to keep it going  in the evening the excellent frenchman made an effort to cheer the two dull young people he came in confidentially with his fiddle and said he had a favour to ask i possess some knowledge sir of the delightful art of dancing might i teach young miss to dance you see if i may venture to say so the other lessonsoh most useful most important the other lessons but they are just a little serious something to relieve her mind sirif you will forgive me for mentioning it i plead for innocent gaietylet us dance  he played a few notes on the fiddle and placed his right foot in position and waited amiably to begin sally thanked him and made the excuse that she was tired she wished amelius good night without waiting until they were alone togetherand for the first time without giving him the customary kiss  toff waited until she had gone and approached his master on tiptoe with a low bow  may i take the liberty of expressing an opinion sir a young girl who rejects the remedy of the fiddle presents a case of extreme gravity dont despair sir it is my pride and pleasure to be never at a loss where your interests are concerned this is i think a matter for the ministrations of a woman if you have confidence in my wife i venture to suggest a visit from madame toff  he discreetly retired and left his master to think about it  the time passedand amelius was still thinking and still as far as ever from arriving at a conclusion when he heard a door opened behind him sally crossed the room before he could rise from his chair her cheeks were flushed her eyes were bright her hair fell loose over her shouldersshe dropped at his feet and hid her face on his knees im an ungrateful wretch she burst out i never kissed you when i said good night  with the best intentions amelius took the worst possible way of composing herhe treated her trouble lightly perhaps you forgot it he said  she lifted her head and looked at him with the tears in her eyes im bad enough she answered but not so bad as that oh dont laugh theres nothing to laugh at have you done with liking me are you angry with me for behaving so badly all day and bidding you good night as if you were toff you shant be angry with me she jumped up and sat on his knee and put her arms round his neck i havent been to bed she whispered i was too miserable to go to sleep i dont know whats been the matter with me today i seem to be losing the little sense i ever had oh if i could only make you understand how fond i am of you and yet ive had bitter thoughts as if i was a burden to you and i had done a wrong thing in coming hereand you would have told me so only you pitied the poor wretch who had nowhere else to go she tightened her hold round his neck and laid her burning cheek against his face oh amelius my heart is sore kiss me and say good night sally  he was younghe was a manfor a moment he lost his self control he kissed her as he had never kissed her yet  then he remembered he recovered himself he put her gently away from him and led her to the door of her room and closed it on her in silence for a little while he waited alone the interval over he rang for toff  do you think your wife would take miss sally as an apprentice he asked  toff looked astonished whatever you wish sir my wife will do her knowledge of the art of dressmaking is words failed him to express his wifes immense capacity as a dressmaker he kissed his hand in mute enthusiasm and blew the kiss in the direction of madame toffs establishment however he proceeded i ought to tell you one thing sir the business is small small very small but we are all in the hands of providencethe business will improve one day he lifted his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows and looked perfectly satisfied with his wifes prospects  i will go and speak to madame toff myself tomorrow morning amelius resumed its quite possible that i may be obliged to leave london for a little whileand i must provide in some way for miss sally dont say a word about it to her yet toff and dont look miserable if i go away i shall take you with me good night  toff with his handkerchief halfway to his eyes recovered his native cheerfulness i am invariably sick at sea sir he said but no matter i will attend you to the uttermost ends of the earth  so honest amelius planned his way of escape from the critical position in which he found himself he went to his bed troubled by anxieties which kept him waking for many weary hours where was he to go to when he left sally if he could have known what had happened on that very day on the other side of the channel he might have decided in spite of the obstacle of mr farnaby on surprising regina by a visit to paris    chapter 7  on the morning when amelius and sally in london entered the church to look at the wedding rufus in paris went to the champs elysees to take a walk  he had advanced halfway up the magnificent avenue when he saw regina for the second time taking her daily drive with an elderly woman in attendance on her rufus took off his hat again perfectly impenetrable to the cold reception which he had already experienced greatly to his surprise regina not only returned his salute but stopped the carriage and beckoned to him to speak to her looking at her more closely he perceived signs of suffering in her face which completely altered her expression as he remembered it her magnificent eyes were dim and red she had lost her rich colour her voice trembled as she spoke to him  have you a few minutes to spare she asked  the whole day if you like miss rufus answered  she turned to the woman who accompanied her wait here for me elizabeth i have something to say to this gentleman  with those words she got out of the carriage rufus offered her his arm she put her hand in it as readily as if they had been old friends let us take one of the side paths she said they are almost deserted at this time of day i am afraid i surprise you very much i can only trust to your kindness to forgive me for passing you without notice the last time we met perhaps it may be some excuse for me that i am in great trouble it is just possible you may be able to relieve my mind i believe you know i am engaged to be married  rufus looked at her with a sudden expression of interest is this about amelius he asked  she answered him almost inaudiblyyes  rufus still kept his eyes fixed on her i dont wish to say anything miss he explained but if you have any complaint to make of amelius i should take it as a favour if you would look me straight in the face and mention it plainly  in the embarrassment which troubled regina at that moment he had preferred the two requests of all others with which it was most impossible for her to comply she still looked obstinately on the ground and instead of speaking of amelius she diverged to the subject of mr farnabys illness  i am staying in paris with my uncle she said he has had a long illness but he is strong enough now to speak to me of things that have been on his mind for some time past he has so surprised me he has made me so miserable about amelius she paused and put her handkerchief to her eyes rufus said nothing to console herhe waited doggedly until she was ready to go on you know amelius well she resumed you are fond of him you believe in him dont you do you think he is capable of behaving basely to any person who trusts him is it likely is it possible he could be false and cruel to me  the mere question roused the indignation of rufus whoever said that of him miss told you a lie i answer for my boy as i answer for myself  she looked at him at last with a sudden expression of relief i said so too she rejoined i said some enemy had slandered him my uncle wont tell me who it is he positively forbids me to write to amelius he tells me i must never see amelius againhe is going to write and break off the engagement oh its too cruel too cruel  thus far they had been walking on slowly but now rufus stopped determined to make her speak plainly  take a word of advice from me miss he said never trust anybody by halves theres nothing im not ready to do to set this matter right but i must know what im about first whats said against amelius out with it no matter what tis im old enough to be your father and i feel for you accordinglyi do  the thorough sincerity of tone and manner which accompanied those words had its effect regina blushed and trembledbut she spoke out  my uncle says amelius has disgraced himself and insulted me my uncle says there is a persona girl living with him she stopped with a faint cry of alarm her hand still testing on the arm of rufus felt him start as the allusion to the girl passed her lips you have heard of it she cried oh god help me its true  true rufus repeated with stern contempt whats come to you havent i told you already its a lie ill answer to it amelius is true to you will that do no youre an obstinate one missthat you are well its due to the boy that i should set him right with you if words will do it you know how hes been brought up at tadmor bear that in mindand now you shall have the truth of it on the word of an honest man  without further preface he told her how amelius had met with sally insisting strongly on the motives of pure humanity by which his friend had been actuated regina listened with an obstinate expression of distrust which would have discouraged most men rufus persisted nevertheless and to some extent at least succeeded in producing the right impression when he reached the close of the narrativewhen he asserted that he had himself seen amelius confide the girl unreservedly to the care of a lady who was a dear and valued friend of his own and when he declared that there had been no aftermeeting between them and no written correspondencethen at last regina owned that he had not encouraged her to trust in the honour of amelius without reason to justify him but even under these circumstances there was a residue of suspicion still left in her mind she asked for the name of the lady to whose benevolent assistance amelius had been indebted rufus took out one of his cards and wrote mrs paysons name and address on it  your nature my dear is not quite so confiding as i could have wished to see it he said quietly handing her the card but we cant change our naturescan we and youre not bound to believe a man like me without witnesses to back him write to mrs payson and make your mind easy and while we are about it tell me where i can telegraph to you tomorrowim off to london by the night mail  do you mean you are going to see amelius  that is so im too fond of amelius to let this trouble rest where tis now ive been away from him here in paris for some little timeand you may tell me and quite right too i cant answer for what may have been going on in my absence no now we are about it well have it out i mean to see amelius and see mrs payson tomorrow morning just tell your uncle to hold his hand before he breaks off your marriage and wait for a telegram from me well and this is your address is it i know the hotel a nice lookout on the twillery gardensbut a bad cellar of wine as i hear im at the grand hotel myself if theres anything else that troubles you before evening now i look at you again i reckon theres something more to be said if youll only let it find its way to your tongue no it aint thanks well take the gratitude for granted and get to whats behind it theres your carriageand the good lady looks tired of waiting well now  its only one thing regina acknowledged with her eyes on the ground again perhaps when you go to london you may see the  the girl  yes  its not likely say i do see herwhat then  reginas colour began to show itself again if you do see her she said i beg and entreat you wont speak of me in her hearing i should die of the shame of it if she thought herself asked to give him up out of pity for me promise i am not to be brought forward promise you wont even mention my having spoken to you about it on your word of honour  rufus gave her his promise without showing any hesitation or making any remark but when she shook hands with him on returning to the carriage he held her hand for a moment please to excuse me miss if i ask one question he said in tones too low to be heard by any other person are you really fond of amelius  i am surprised you should doubt it she answered i am moremuch more than fond of him  rufus handed her silently into the carriage fond of him are you he thought as he walked away by himself i reckon its a sort of fondness that dont wear well and wont stand washing    chapter 8  early the next morning rufus rang at the cottage gate  well mr frenchman and how do you git along and hows amelius  toff standing before the gate answered with the utmost respect but showed no inclination to let the visitor in  amelius has his intervals of laziness rufus proceeded i bet hes in bed  my young master was up and dressed an hour ago sirhe has just gone out  that is so is it well ill wait till he comes back he pushed by toff and walked into the cottage your foreign ceremonies are clean thrown away on me he said as toff tried to stop him in the hall im the american savage and im used up with travelling all night heres a little order for you whisky bitters lemon and iceill take a cocktail in the library  toff made a last desperate effort to get between the visitor and the door i beg your pardon sir a thousand times i must most respectfully entreat you to wait  before he could explain himself rufus with the most perfect good humour pulled the old man out of his way whats troubling this venerable creatures mind he inquired of himself does he think i dont know my way in  he opened the library doorand found himself face to face with sally she had risen from her chair hearing voices outside and hesitating whether to leave the room or not they confronted each other on either side of the table in silent dismay for once rufus was so completely bewildered that he took refuge in his customary form of greeting before he was aware of it himself  how do you find yourself miss i take pleasure in renewing our acquaintancethunder thats not it i reckon im off my head do me the favour young woman to forget every word ive said to you if any mortal creature had told me i should find you here i should have said twas a lieand i should have been the liar that makes a man feel bad i can tell you no dont slide off if you please into the next roomthat wont set things right nohow sit you down again now im here i have something to say ill speak first to mr frenchman listen to this old sir if i happen to want a witness standing in the doorway ill ring the bell for the present i can do without you bong shewer as we say in your country he proceeded to shut the door on toff and his remonstrances  i protest sir against acts of violence unworthy of a gentleman cried toff struggling to get back again  be as angry as you please in the kitchen rufus answered persisting in closing the door i wont have a noise up here if you know where your master is go and fetch himand the sooner the better he turned back to sally and surveyed her for a while in terrible silence she was afraid to look at him her eyes were on the book which she had been reading when he came in you look to me rufus remarked as if you had been settled here for a time never mind your book now you can go back to your reading after weve had a word or two together first he reached out his long arm and pulled the book to his own side of the table sally innocently silenced him for the second time he opened the book and discoveredthe new testament  its my lesson if you please sir im to learn it where the pencil mark is before amelius comes back she offered her poor little explanation trembling with terror in spite of himself rufus began to look at her less sternly  so you call him amelius do you he said i note that miss as an unfavourable sign to begin with how long if you please has amelius turned schoolmarm for your young ladyships benefit dont you understand well youre not the only inhabitant of great britain who dont understand the english language ill put it plainer when i last saw amelius you were learning your lessons at the home what ill wind miss blew you in here did amelius fetch you or did you come of your own accord without waiting to be whistled for he spoke coarsely but not illhumouredly sallys pretty downcast face was pleading with him for mercy and as he felt with supreme contempt for himself was not altogether pleading in vain if i guessed that you ran away from the home he resumed should i guess right  she answered with a sudden accession of confidence dont blame amelius she said i did run away i couldnt live without him  you dont know how you can live young one till youve tried the experiment well and what did they do at the home did they send after you to fetch you back  they wouldnt take me backthey sent my clothes here after me  ah those were the rules i reckon i begin to see my way to the end of it now amelius gave you houseroom  she looked at him proudly he gave me a room of my own she said  his next question was the exact repetition of the question which he had put to regina in paris the only variety was in the answer that he received  are you fond of amelius  i would die for him  rufus had hitherto spoken standing he now took a chair  if amelius had not been brought up at tadmor he said i should take my hat and wish you good morning as things are a word more may be a word in season your lessons here seem to have agreed with you miss youre a different sort of girl to what you were when i last saw you  she surprised him by receiving that remark in silence the colour left her face she sighed bitterly the sigh puzzled rufus he held his opinion of her in suspense until he had heard more  you said just now you would die for amelius he went on eyeing her attentively i take that to be a womans hysterical way of mentioning that she feels interest in amelius are you fond enough of him to leave him if you could only be persuaded that leaving him was for his good  she abruptly left the table and went to the window when her back was turned to rufus she spoke am i a disgrace to him she asked in tones so faint that he could barely hear them i have had my fears of it before now  if he had been less fond of amelius his natural kindness of heart might have kept him silent even as it was he made no direct reply you remember how you were living when amelius first met with you was all he said  the sad blue eyes looked at him in patient sorrow the low sweet voice answeredyes only a look and a wordonly the influence of an instantand in that instant rufuss last doubts of her vanished  dont think i say it reproachfully my child i know it was not your fault i know you are to be pitied and not blamed  she turned her face towards himpale quiet and resigned pitied and not blamed she repeated am i to be forgiven  he shrank from answering her there was silence  you said just now she went on that i looked like a different girl since you last saw me i am a different girl i think of things that i never thought of beforesome change i dont know what has come over me oh my heart does hunger so to be good i do so long to deserve what amelius has done for me you have got my book thereamelius gave it to me we read in it every day if christ had been on earth now is it wrong to think that christ would have forgiven me  no my dear its right to think so  and while i live if i do my best to lead a good life and if my last prayer to god is to take me to heaven shall i be heard  you will be heard my child i dont doubt it but you see you have got the world about you to reckon withand the world has invented a religion of its own theres no use looking for it in this book of yours its a religion with the pride of property at the bottom of it and a veneer of benevolent sentiment at the top it will be very sorry for you and very charitable towards you in short it will do everything for you except taking you back again  she had her answer to that amelius has taken me back again she said  amelius has taken you back again rufus agreed but theres one thing hes forgotten to do he has forgotten to count the cost it seems to be left to me to do that look here my girl i own i doubted you when i first came into this room and im sorry for it and i beg your pardon i do believe youre a good girli couldnt say why if i was asked but i do believe it for all that i wish there was no more to be saidbut there is more and neither you nor i must shirk it public opinion wont deal as tenderly with you as i do public opinion will make the worst of you and the worst of amelius while youre living here with himtheres no disguising ityoure innocently in the way of the boys prospects in life i dont know whether you understand me  she had turned away from him she was looking out of the window once more  i understand you she answered on the night when amelius met with me he did wrong to take me away with him he ought to have left me where i was  wait a bit thats as far from my meaning as far can be theres a lookout for everybody and if youll trust me ill find a lookout for you  she paid no heed to what he said her next words showed that she was pursuing her own train of thought  i am in the way of his prospects in life she resumed you mean that he might be married some day but for me  rufus admitted it cautiously the thing might happen was all he said  and his friends might come and see him she went on her face still turned away and her voice sinking into dull subdued tones nobody comes here now you see i understand you when shall i go away i had better not say goodbye i supposeit would only distress him i could slip out of the house couldnt i  rufus began to feel uneasy he was prepared for tearsbut not for such resignation as this after a little hesitation he joined her at the window she never turned towards him she still looked out straight before her her bright young face had turned pitiably rigid and pale he spoke to her very gently advising her to think of what he had said and to do nothing in a hurry she knew the hotel at which he stayed when he was in london and she could write to him there if she decided to begin a new life in another country he was wholly and truly at her service he would provide a passage for her in the same ship that took him back to america at his age and known as he was in his own neighbourhood there would be no scandal to fear he could get her reputably and profitably employed in work which a young girl might undertake ill be as good as a father to you my poor child he said dont think youre going to be friendless if you leave amelius ill see to that you shall have honest people about youand innocent pleasure in your new life  she thanked him still with the same dull tearless resignation what will the honest people say she asked when they know who i am  they have no business to know who you areand they shant know it  ah it comes back to the same thing she said you must deceive the honest people or you can do nothing for me amelius had better have left me where i was i disgraced nobody i was a burden to nobody there cold and hunger and illtreatment can sometimes be merciful friends in their way if i had been left to them they would have laid me at rest by this time she turned to rufus before he could speak to her im not ungrateful sir ill think of it as you say and ill do all that a poor foolish creature can do to be worthy of the interest you take in me she lifted her hand to her head with a momentary expression of pain ive got a dull kind of aching here she said it reminds me of my old life when i was sometimes beaten on the head may i go and lie down a little by myself  rufus took her hand and pressed it in silence she looked back at him as she opened the door of her room dont distress amelius she said i can bear anything but that  left alone in the library rufus walked restlessly to and fro driven by a troubled mind i was bound to do it he thought and i ought to be satisfied with myself im not satisfied the world is hard on womenand the rights of property is a darned bad reason for it  the door from the hall was suddenly thrown open amelius entered the room he looked flushed and angryhe refused to take the hand that rufus offered to him  whats this i hear from toff it seems that you forced your way in when sally was here there are limits to the liberties that a man may take in his friends house  thats true said rufus quietly but when a man hasnt taken liberties there dont seem much to be said sally was at the home when i last saw youand nobody told me i should find her in this room  you might have left the room when you found her here you have been talking to her if you have said anything about regina  i have said nothing about miss regina you have a hot temper of your own amelius wait a bit and let it cool  never mind my temper i want to know what you have been saying to sally stop ill ask sally herself he crossed the room to the inner door and knocked come in here my dear i want to speak to you  the answer reached him faintly through the door i have got a bad headache amelius please let me rest a little he turned back to rufus and lowered his voice but his eyes flashed he was more angry than ever  you had better go he said i can guess how you have been talking to heri know what her headache means any man who distresses that dear little affectionate creature is a man whom i hold as my enemy i spit upon all the worldly considerations which pass muster with people like you no sweeter girl than poor sally ever breathed the breath of life her happiness is more precious to me than words can say she is sacred to me and i have just proved iti have just come from a good woman who will teach her an honest way of earning her bread not a breath of scandal shall blow on her if you or any people like you think i will consent to cast her adrift on the world or consign her to a prison under the name of a home you little know my nature and my principles herehe snatched up the new testament from the table and shook it at rufushere are my principles and im not ashamed of them  rufus took up his hat  theres one thing youll be ashamed of my son when youre cool enough to think about it he said youll be ashamed of the words you have spoken to a friend who loves you im not a bit angry myself you remind me of that time on board the steamer when the quartermaster was going to shoot the bird you made it up with himand youll come to my hotel and make it up with me and then well shake hands and talk about sally if its not taking another liberty ill trouble you for a light he helped himself to a match from the box on the chimneypiece lit his cigar and left the room  he had not been gone half an hour before the better nature of amelius urged him to follow rufus and make his apologies but he was too anxious about sally to leave the cottage until he had seen her first the tone in which she had answered him when he knocked at her door suggested to his sensitive apprehension that there was something more serious the matter with her than a mere headache for another hour he waited patiently on the chance that he might hear her moving in her room nothing happened no sound reached his ears except the occasional rolling of carriagewheels on the road outside  his patience began to fail him as the second hour moved on he went to the door and listened and still heard nothing a sudden dread struck him that she might have fainted he opened the door a few inches and spoke to her there was no answer he looked in the room was empty  he ran into the hall and called to toff was she by any chance downstairs no or out in the garden no master and man looked at each other in silence sally was gone    chapter 9  toff was the first who recovered himself  courage sir he said with a little thinking we shall see the way to find her that rude american man who talked with her this morning may be the person who has brought this misfortune on us  amelius waited to hear no more there was the chance at least that something might have been said which had induced her to take refuge with rufus he ran back to the library to get his hat  toff followed his master with another suggestion one word more sir before you go if the american man cannot help us we must be ready to try another way permit me to accompany you as far as my wifes shop i propose that she shall come back here with me and examine poor little misss bedroom we will wait of course for your return before anything is done in the mean time i entreat you not to despair it is at least possible that the means of discovery may be found in the bedroom  they went out together taking the first cab that passed them amelius proceeded alone to the hotel  rufus was in his room whats gone wrong he asked the moment amelius opened the door shake hands my son and smother up that little trouble between us in silence your face alarms meit does what of sally  amelius started at the question isnt she here he asked  rufus drew back the mere action said no before he answered in words  have you seen nothing of her heard nothing of her  nothing steady now meet it like a man and tell me what has happened  amelius told him in two words dont suppose im going to break out again as i did this morning he went on im too wretched and too anxious to be angry only tell me rufus have you said anything to her  rufus held up his hand i see what youre driving at it will be more to the purpose to tell you what she said to me from first to last amelius i spoke kindly to her and i did her justice give me a minute to rummage my memory after brief consideration he carefully repeated the substance of what had passed between sally and himself during the latter part of the interview between them have you looked about in her room he inquired when he had done there might be a trifling something to help you left behind her there  amelius told him of toffs suggestion they returned together at once to the cottage madame toff was waiting to begin the search  the first discovery was easily made sally had taken off one or two little trinketspresents from amelius which she was in the habit of wearingand had left them wrapped up in paper on the dressingtable no such thing as a farewell letter was found near them the examination of the wardrobe came nextand here a startling circumstance revealed itself every one of the dresses which amelius had presented to her was hanging in its place they were not many and they had all on previous occasions been passed in review by toffs wife she was absolutely certain that the complete number of the dresses was there in the bedroom sally must have worn something in place of her new clothes what had she put on  looking round the room amelius noticed in a corner the box in which he had placed the first new dress that he had purchased for sally on the morning after they had met he tried to open the box it was lockedand the key was not to be found the everready toff fetched a skewer from the kitchen and picked the lock in two minutes on lifting the cover the box proved to be empty  the one person present who understood what this meant was amelius  he remembered that sally had taken her old threadbare clothes away with her in the box when the angry landlady had insisted on his leaving the house i want to look at them sometimes the poor girl had said and think how much better off i am now in those miserable rags she had fled from the cottage after hearing the cruel truth he had better have left me where i was she had said cold and hunger and illtreatment would have laid me at rest by this time amelius fell on his knees before the empty box in helpless despair the conclusion that now forced itself on his mind completely unmanned him she had gone back in the old dress to die under the cold the hunger and the horror of the old life  rufus took his hand and spoke to him kindly he rallied and dashed the tears from his eyes and rose to his feet i know where to look for her was all he said and i must do it alone he refused to enter into any explanation or to be assisted by any companion this is my secret and hers he answered go back to your hotel rufusand pray that i may not bring news which will make a wretched man of you for the rest of your life with that he left them  in another hour he stood once more on the spot at which he and sally had met  the wild bustle and uproar of the costermongers night market no longer rioted round him the street by daylight was in a state of dreary repose slowly pacing up and down from one end to another he waited with but one hope to sustain himthe hope that she might have taken refuge with the two women who had been her only friends in the dark days of her life ignorant of the place in which they lived he had no choice but to wait for the appearance of one or other of them in the street he was quiet and resolved for the rest of the day and for the whole of the night if need be his mind was made up to keep steadfastly on the watch  when he could walk no longer he obtained rest and refreshment in the cookshop which he remembered so well sitting on a stool near the window from which he could still command a view of the street the gaslamps were alight and the long winters night was beginning to set in when he resumed his weary march from end to end of the pavement as the darkness became complete his patience was rewarded at last passing the door of a pawnbrokers shop he met one of the women face to face walking rapidly with a little parcel under her arm  she recognized him with a cry of joyful surprise  oh sir how glad i am to see you to be sure youve come to look after sally havent you yes yes shes safe in our poor placebut in such a dreadful state off her head clean off her head talks of nothing but you im in the way of his prospects in life over and over and over again she keeps on saying that dont be afraid jennys at home taking care of her she wants to go out hot and wild with a kind of fever on her she wants to go out she asked if it rained the rain may kill me in these ragged clothes she says and then i shant be in the way of his prospects in life we tried to quiet her by telling her it didnt rainbut it was no use she was as eager as ever to go out i may get another blow on the bosom she says and maybe it will fall on the right place this time no theres no fear of the brute who used to beat herhes in prison dont ask to see her just yet sir please dont im afraid you would only make her worse if i took you to her now i wouldnt dare to risk it you see we cant get her to sleep and we thought of buying something to quiet her at the chemists yes sir it would be better to get a doctor to her but i wasnt going to the doctor if i must tell you i was obliged to take the sheets off the bed to raise a little moneyi was going to the pawnbrokers she looked at the parcel under her arm and smiled i may take the sheets back again now ive met with you and theres a good doctor lives close byi can show you the way to him oh how pale you do look are you very much tired its only a little way to the doctor ive got an arm at your servicebut you mightnt like to be seen waiting with such a person as me  mentally and physically amelius was completely prostrated the womans melancholy narrative had overwhelmed him he could neither speak nor act he mechanically put his purse in her hand and went with her to the house of the nearest medical man  the doctor was at home mixing drugs in his little surgery after one sharp look at amelius he ran into a back parlour and returned with a glass of spirits drink this sir he saidunless you want to find yourself on the floor in a fainting fit and dont presume again on your youth and strength to treat your heart as if it was made of castiron he signed to amelius to sit down and rest himself and turned to the woman to hear what was wanted of him after a few questions he said she might go promising to follow her in a few minutes when the gentleman would be sufficiently recovered to accompany him  well sir are you beginning to feel like yourself again he was mixing a composing draught while he addressed amelius in those terms you may trust that poor wretch who has just left us to take care of the sick girl he went on in the quaintly familiar manner which seemed to be habitual with him i dont ask how you got into her companyits no business of mine but i am pretty well acquainted with the people in my neighbourhood and i can tell you one thing in case youre anxious the woman who brought you here barring the one misfortune of her life is as good a creature as ever breathed and the other one who lives with her is the same when i think of what theyre exposed towell i take to my pipe and compose my mind in that way my early days were all passed as a ships surgeon i could get them both respectable employment in australia if i only had the money to fit them out theyll die in the hospital like the rest if something isnt done for them in my hopeful moments i sometimes think of a subscription what do you say will you put down a few shillings to set the example  i will do more than that amelius answered i have reasons for wishing to befriend both those two poor women and i will gladly engage to find the outfit  the familiar old doctor held out his hand over the counter youre a good fellow if ever there was one yet he burst out i can show references which will satisfy you that i am not a rogue in the mean time lets see what is the matter with this little girl you can tell me about her as we go along he put his bottle of medicine in his pocket and his arm in the arm of ameliusand so led the way out  when they reached the wretched lodginghouse in which the women lived he suggested that his companion would do well to wait at the door im used to sad sights it would only distress you to see the place i wont keep you long waiting  he was as good as his word in little more than ten minutes he joined amelius again in the street  dont alarm yourself he said the case is not so serious as it looks the poor child is suffering under a severe shock to the brain and nervous system caused by that sudden and violent distress you hinted at my medicine will give her the one thing she wants to begin witha good nights sleep  amelius asked when she would be well enough to see him  ah my young friend its not so easy to say just yet i could answer you to better purpose tomorrow wont that do must i venture on a rash opinion she ought to be composed enough to see you in three or four days and when that time comes its my belief you will do more than i can do to set her right again  amelius was relieved but not quite satisfied yet he inquired if it was not possible to remove her from that miserable place  quite impossiblewithout doing her serious injury they have got money to go on with and i have told you already she will be well taken care of i will look after her myself tomorrow morning go home and get to bed and eat a bit of supper first and make your mind easy come to my house at twelve oclock noon and you will find me ready with my references and my report of the patient surgeon pinfold blackacre buildings theres the address good night    chapter 10  after amelius had left him rufus remembered his promise to communicate with regina by telegraph  with his strict regard for truth it was no easy matter to decide on what message he should send to inspire regina if possible with his own unshaken belief in the good faith of amelius appeared on reflection to be all that he could honestly do under present circumstances with an anxious and foreboding mind he despatched his telegram to paris in these termsbe patient for a while and do justice to a he deserves it  having completed his business at the telegraphoffice rufus went next to pay his visit to mrs payson  the good lady received him with a grave face and a distant manner in startling contrast to the customary warmth of her welcome i used to think you were a man in a thousand she began abruptly and i find you are no better than the rest of them if you have come to speak to me about that blackguard young socialist understand if you please that i am not so easily imposed upon as miss regina i have done my duty i have opened her eyes to the truth poor thing ah you ought to be ashamed of yourself  rufus kept his temper with his habitual selfcommand its possible you may be right he said quietly but the biggest rascal living has a claim to an explanation when a lady puzzles him have you any particular objection old friend to tell me what you mean  the explanation was not of a nature to set his mind at ease  regina had written by the mail which took rufus to england repeating to mrs payson what had passed at the interview in the champs elysees and appealing to her sympathy for information and advice receiving the letter that morning mrs payson acting on her own generous and compassionate impulses had already answered it and sent it to the post her experience of the unfortunate persons received at the home was far from inclining her to believe in the innocence of a runaway girl placed under circumstances of temptation as an act of justice towards regina she enclosed to her the letter in which amelius had acknowledged that sally had passed the night under his roof  i believe i am only telling you the shameful truth mrs payson had written when i add that the girl has been an inmate of mr goldenhearts cottage ever since if you can reconcile this disgraceful state of things with mr rufus dingwells assertion of his friends fidelity to his marriageengagement i have no right and no wish to make any attempt to alter your opinion but you have asked for my advice and i must not shrink from giving it i am bound as an honest woman to tell you that your uncles resolution to break off the engagement represents the course that i should have taken myself if a daughter of my own had been placed in your painful and humiliating position  there was still ample time to modify this strong expression of opinion by the days post rufus appealed vainly to mrs payson to reconsider the conclusion at which she had arrived a more charitable and considerate woman within the limits of her own daily routine it would not be possible to find but the largeness of mind which having long and trustworthy experience of a rule can nevertheless understand that other minds may have equal experience of the exception to the rule was one of the qualities which had not been included in the moral composition of mrs payson she held firmly to her own narrowly conscientious sense of her duty stimulated by a natural indignation against amelius who had bitterly disappointed heragainst rufus who had not scrupled to take up his defence the two old friends parted in coldness for the first time in their lives  rufus returned to his hotel to wait there for news from amelius  the day passedand the one visitor who enlivened his solitude was an american friend and correspondent connected with the agency which managed his affairs in england the errand of this gentleman was to give his client the soundest and speediest advice relating to the investment of money having indicated the safe and solid speculation the visitor added a warning word relating to the plausible and dangerous investments of the day for instance he said theres that bank started by farnaby  no need to warn me against farnaby rufus interposed i wouldnt take shares in his bank if he made me a present of them  the american friend looked surprised surely he exclaimed you cant have heard the news already they dont even know it yet on the stock exchange  rufus explained that he had only spoken under the influence of personal prejudice against mr farnaby  whats in the wind now he asked  he was confidentially informed that a coming storm was in the wind in other words that a serious discovery had been made at the bank some time since the directors had advanced a large sum of money to a man in trade under mr farnabys own guarantee the man had just died and examination of his affairs showed that he had only received a few hundred pounds on condition of holding his tongue the bulk of the money had been traced to mr farnaby himself and had all been swallowed up by his newspaper his patent medicine and his other rotten speculations apart from his own proper business you may not know it the american friend concluded but the fact is farnaby rose from the dregs his bankruptcy is only a question of timehe will drop back to the dregs and quite possibly make his appearance to answer a criminal charge in a court of law i hear that melton whose credit has held up the bank lately is off to see his friend in paris they say farnabys niece is a handsome girl and melton is sweet on her awkward for melton  rufus listened attentively in signing the order for his investments he privately decided to stir no further for the present in the matter of his young friends marriageengagement  for the rest of the day and evening he still waited for amelius and waited in vain it was drawing near to midnight when toff made his appearance with a message from his master amelius had discovered sally and had returned in such a state of fatigue that he was only fit to take some refreshment and to go to his bed he would be away from home again on the next morning but he hoped to call at the hotel in the course of the day observing toffs face with grave and steady scrutiny rufus tried to extract some further information from him but the old frenchman stood on his dignity in a state of immovable reserve  you took me by the shoulder this morning sir and spun me round he said i do not desire to be treated a second time like a teetotum for the rest it is not my habit to intrude myself into my masters secrets  its not my habit rufus coolly rejoined to bear malice i beg to apologise sincerely sir for treating you like a teetotum and i offer you my hand  toff had got as far as the door he instantly returned with the dignity which a frenchman can always command in the serious emergencies of his life you appeal to my heart and my honour sir he said i bury the events of the morning in oblivion and i do myself the honour of taking your hand  as the door closed on him rufus smiled grimly youre not in the habit of intruding yourself into your masters secrets he repeated if amelius reads your face as i read it hell look over his shoulder when he goes out tomorrowand ten to one hell see you behind him in the distance  late on the next day amelius presented himself at the hotel in speaking of sally he was unusually reserved merely saying that she was ill and under medical care and then changing the subject struck by the depressed and anxious expression of his face rufus asked if he had heard from regina no a longer time than usual had passed since regina had written to him i dont understand it he said sadly i suppose you didnt see anything of her in paris  rufus had kept his promise not to mention reginas name in sallys presence but it was impossible for him to look at amelius without plainly answering the question put to him for the sake of the friend whom he loved im afraid theres trouble coming to you my son from that quarter with those warning words he described all that had passed between regina and himself some unknown enemy of yours has spoken against you to her uncle he concluded i suppose you have made enemies my poor old boy since you have been in london  i know the man amelius answered he wanted to marry regina before i met with her his name is melton  rufus started i heard only yesterday he was in paris with farnaby and thats not the worst of it amelius theres another of them making mischiefa good friend of mine who has shown a twist in her temper that has taken me by surprise after twenty years experience of her i reckon theres a drop of malice in the composition of the best woman that ever livedand the men only discover it when another woman steps in and stirs it up wait a bit he went on when he had related the result of his visit to mrs payson i have telegraphed to miss regina to be patient and to trust you dont you write to defend yourself till you hear how you stand in her estimation after my message tomorrows post may tell  tomorrows post did tell  two letters reached amelius from paris one from mr farnaby curt and insolent breaking off the marriageengagement the other from regina expressed with great severity of language her weak nature like all weak natures ran easily into extremes and once roused into asserting itself took refuge in violence as a shy person takes refuge in audacity only a woman of larger and firmer mind would have written of her wrongs in a more just and more moderate tone  regina began without any preliminary form of address she had no heart to upbraid amelius and no wish to speak of what she was suffering to a man who had but too plainly shown that he had no respect for himself and neither love nor pity even for her in justice to herself she released him from his promise and returned his letters and his presents her own letters might be sent in a sealed packet addressed to her at her uncles place of business in london she would pray that he might be brought to a sense of the sin that he had committed and that he might yet live to be a worthy and a happy man for the rest her decision was irrevocable his own letter to mrs payson condemned himand the testimony of an old and honoured friend of her uncle proved that his wickedness was no mere act of impulse but a deliberate course of infamy and falsehood continued over many weeks from the moment when she made that discovery he was a stranger to herand she now bade him farewell  have you written to her rufus asked when he had seen the letters  amelius reddened with indignation he was not aware of it himselfbut his look and manner plainly revealed that regina had lost her last hold on him her letter had inflicted an insultnot a wound he was outraged and revolted the deeper and gentler feelings the emotions of a grieved and humiliated lover had been killed in him by her stern words of dismissal and farewell  do you think i would allow myself to be treated in that way without a word of protest he said to rufus i have written refusing to take back my promise i declare on my word of honour that i have been faithful to you and to my engagementthat was how i put itand i scorn the vile construction which your uncle and his friend have placed upon an act of christian mercy on my part i wrote more tenderly before i finished my letter feeling for her distress and being anxious above all things not to add to it we shall see if she has love enough left for me to trust my faith and honour instead of trusting false appearances i will give her time  rufus considerately abstained from expressing any opinion he waited until the morning when a reply might be expected from paris and then he called at the cottage  without a word of comment amelius put a letter into his friends hand it was his own letter to regina returned to him on the back of it there was a line in mr farnabys handwritingif you send any more letters they will be burnt unopened in those insolent terms the wretch wrote with bankruptcy and exposure hanging over his head  rufus spoke plainly upon this theres an end of it now he said that girl would never have made the right wife for you amelius youre well out of it forget that you ever knew these people and let us talk of something else how is sally  at that illtimed inquiry amelius showed his temper again he was in a state of nervous irritability which made him apt to take offence where no offence was intended oh you neednt be alarmed he answered petulantly theres no fear of the poor child coming back to live with me she is still under the doctors care  rufus passed over the angry reply without notice and patted him on the shoulder i spoke of the girl he said because i wanted to help her and i can help her if you will let me before long my son i shall be going back to the united states i wish you would go with me  and desert sally cried amelius  nothing of the sort before we go ill see that sally is provided for to your satisfaction will you think of it to please me  amelius relented anything to please you he said  rufus noticed his hat and gloves on the table and left him without saying more the trouble with amelius he thought as he closed the cottage gate is not over yet    chapter 11  the day on which worthy old surgeon pinfold had predicted that sally would be in a fair way of recovery had come and gone and still the medical report to amelius was the sameyou must be patient sir she is not well enough to see you yet  toff watching his young master anxiously was alarmed by the steadily progressive change in him for the worse which showed itself at this time now sad and silent and now again bitter and irritable he had deteriorated physically as well as morally until he really looked like the shadow of his former self he never exchanged a word with his faithful old servant except when he said mechanically good morning or good night toff could endure it no longer at the risk of being roughly misinterpreted he followed his own kindly impulse and spoke may i own to you sir he said with perfect gentleness and respect that i am indeed heartily sorry to see you so ill  amelius looked up at him sharply you servants always make a fuss about trifles i am a little out of sorts and i want a changethats all perhaps i may go to america you wont like that i shant complain if you look out for another situation  the tears came into the old mans eyes never he answered fervently my last service sir if you send me away shall be my dearly loved service here  all that was most tender in the nature of amelius was touched to the quick forgive me toff he said i am lonely and wretched and more anxious about sally than words can tell there can be no change in my life until my mind is easy about that poor little girl but if it does end in my going to america you shall go with mei wouldnt lose you my good friend for the world  toff still remained in the room as if he had something left to say entirely ignorant of the marriage engagement between amelius and regina and of the rupture in which it had ended he vaguely suspected nevertheless that his master might have fallen into an entanglement with some lady unknown the opportunity of putting the question was now before him he risked it in a studiously modest form  are you going to america to be married sir  amelius eyed him with a momentary suspicion what has put that in your head he asked  i dont know sir toff answered humblyunless it was my own vivid imagination would there be anything very wonderful in a gentleman of your age and appearance conducting some charming person to the altar  amelius was conquered once more he smiled faintly enough of your nonsense toff i shall never be marriedunderstand that  toffs withered old face brightened slyly he turned away to withdraw hesitated and suddenly went back to his master  have you any occasion for my services sir for an hour or two he asked  no be back before i go out myselfbe back at three oclock  thank you sir my little boy is below if you want anything in my absence  the little boy dutifully attending toff to the gate observed with grave surprise that his father snapped his fingers gaily at starting and hummed the first bars of the marseillaise something is going to happen said toffs boy on his way back to the house   from the regents park to blackacre buildings is almost a journey from one end of london to the other assisted for part of the way by an omnibus toff made the journey and arrived at the residence of surgeon pinfold with the easy confidence of a man who knew thoroughly well where he was going and what he was about the sagacity of rufus had correctly penetrated his intentions he had privately followed his master and had introduced himself to the notice of the surgeonwith a mixture of motives in which pure devotion to the interests of amelius played the chief part his experience of the world told him that sallys departure was only the beginning of more trouble to come what is the use of me to my master he had argued except to spare him trouble in spite of himself  surgeon pinfold was prescribing for a row of sick people seated before him on a bench youre not ill are you he said sharply to toff very well then go into the parlour and wait  the patients being dismissed toff attempted to explain the object of his visit but the old naval surgeon insisted on clearing the ground by means of a plain question first has your master sent you hereor is this another private interview like the last  it is all that is most private toff answered my poor master is wasting away in unrelieved wretchedness and suspense something must be done for him oh dear and good sir help me in this most miserable state of things tell me the truth about miss sally  old pinfold put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the parlour wall looking at the frenchman with a complicated expression in which genuine sympathy mingled oddly with a quaint sense of amusement youre a worthy chap he said and you shall have the truth i have been obliged to deceive your master about this troublesome young sally i have stuck to it that she is too ill to see him or to answer his letters both lies theres nothing the matter with her now but a disease that i cant cure the disease of a troubled mind shes got it into her head that she has everlastingly degraded herself in his estimation by leaving him and coming here its no use telling herwhat mind you is perfectly truethat she was all but out of her senses and not in the least responsible for what she did at the time when she did it she holds to her own opinion nevertheless what can he think of me but that i have gone back willingly to the disgrace of my old life i should throw myself out of the window if he came into the room thats how she answers meand what makes matters worse still shes breaking her heart about him all the time the poor wretch is so eager for any little word of news about his health and his doings that its downright pitiable to see her i dont think her fevered little brain will bear it much longerand hang me if i can tell what to do next to set things right the two women her friends have no sort of influence over her when i saw her this morning she was ungrateful enough to say why didnt you let me die how your master got among these unfortunate people is more than i know and is no business of mine i only wish he had been a different sort of man before i knew him as well as i know him now i predicted like a fool that he would be just the person to help us in managing the girl i have altered my opinion hes such a glorious fellowso impulsive and so tenderheartedthat he would be certain in her present excited state to do her more harm than good do you know if he is going to be married  toff listening thus far in silent distress suddenly looked up  why do you ask me sir  its an idle question i dare say old pinfold remarked sally persists in telling us shes in the way of his prospects in lifeand its got somehow into her perverse little head that his prospects in life mean his marriage and shes in the way of thathullo are you going already  i want to go to miss sally sir i believe i can say something to comfort her do

a bell my errandboy is going past the house to deliver some medicine he answered its a poor place but youll find it neat and nice enoughthanks to your good master hes helping the two women to begin life again out of this country and while theyre waiting their turn to get a passage theyve taken an extra room and hired some decent furniture by your masters own wish oh heres the boy hell show you the way one word before you go what do you think of saying to sally  i shall tell her for one thing sir that my master is miserable for want of her  surgeon pinfold shook his head that wont take you very far on the way to persuading her you will make her miserable tooand theres about all you will get by it  toff lifted his indicative forefinger to the side of his nose suppose i tell her something else sir suppose i tell her my master is not going to be married to anybody  she wont believe you know anything about it  she will believe for this reason said toff gravely i put the question to my master before i came here and i have it from his own lips that there is no young lady in the way and that he is notpositively notgoing to be married if i tell miss sally this sir how do you say it will end will you bet me a shilling it has no effect on her  i wont bet a farthing follow the boyand tell young sally i have sent her a better doctor than i am   while toff was on his way to sally toffs boy was disturbing amelius by the announcement of a visitor the card sent in bore this inscription brother bawkwell from tadmor  amelius looked at the card and ran into the hall to receive the visitor with both hands held out in hearty welcome oh i am so glad to see you he cried come in and tell me all about tadmor  brother bawkwell acknowledged the enthusiastic reception offered to him by a stare of grim surprise he was a dry hard old man with a scrubby white beard a narrow wrinkled forehead and an obstinate lipless mouth fitted neither by age nor temperament to be the intimate friend of any of his younger brethren among the community but at that saddest time of his life the heart of amelius warmed to any one who reminded him of his tranquil and happy days at tadmor even this frozen old socialist now appeared to him for the first time under the borrowed aspect of a welcome friend  brother bawkwell took the chair offered to him and opened the proceedings in solemn silence by looking at his watch twentyfive minutes past two he said to himselfand put the watch back again  are you pressed for time amelius asked  much may be done in ten minutes brother bawkwell answered in a scotch accent which had survived the test of half a lifetime in america i would have you know i am in england on a mission from the community with a list of twentyseven persons in all whom i am appointed to confer with on matters of varying importance yours friend amelius is a matter of minor importance i can give you ten minutes  he opened a big black pocketbook stuffed with a mass of letters and placing two of them on the table before him addressed amelius as if he was making a speech at a public meeting  i have to request your attention to certain proceedings of the council at tadmor bearing date the third of december last and referring to a person under sentence of temporary separation from the community along with yourself  mellicent amelius exclaimed  we have no time for interruptions brother bawkwell remarked the person is sister mellicent and the business before the council was to consider a letter under her signature received december second said letter he proceeded taking up one of his papers is abridged as follows by the secretary to the council in substance the writer states first that the married sister under whose protection she has been living at new york is about to settle in england with her husband appointed to manage the branch of his business established in london second that she meaning sister mellicent has serious reasons for not accompanying her relatives to england and has no other friends to take charge of her welfare if she remains in new york third that she appeals to the mercy of the council under these circumstances to accept the expression of her sincere repentance for the offence of violating a rule and to permit a friendless and penitent creature to return to the only home left to her her home at tadmor no friend ameliuswe have no time for expressions of sympathy the first half of the ten minutes has nearly expired i have further to notify you that the question was put to the vote in this form is it consistent with the serious responsibility which rests on the council to consider the remission of any sentence justly pronounced under the book of rules the result was very remarkable the votes for and against being equally divided in this event as you know our laws provide that the decision rests with the elder brotherwho gave his vote thereupon for considering the remission of the sentence and moved the next resolution that the sentence be remitted accordingly carried by a small majority whereupon sister mellicent was received again at tadmor  ah the dear old elder brother cried ameliusalways on the side of mercy  brother bawkwell held up his hand in protest you seem to have no idea he said of the value of time do be quiet as travelling representative of the council i am further instructed to say that the sentence pronounced against yourself stands duly remitted in consequence of the remission of the sentence against sister mellicent you likewise are free to return to tadmor at your own will and pleasure butattend to what is coming friend ameliusthe council holds to its resolution that your choice between us and the world shall be absolutely unbiased in the fear of exercising even an indirect influence we have purposely abstained from corresponding with you with the same motive we now say that if you do return to us it must be with no interference on our part we inform you of an event that has happened in your absenceand we do no more  he paused and looked again at his watch time proverbially works wonders time closed his lips  amelius replied with a heavy heart the message from the council had recalled him from the remembrance of mellicent to the sense of his own position my experience of the world has been a very hard one he said i would gladly go back to tadmor this very day but for one consideration he hesitated the image of sally was before him the tears rose in his eyes he said no more  brother bawkwell driven hard by time got on his legs and handed to amelius the second of the two papers which he had taken out of his pocketbook  here is a purely informal document he said being a few lines from sister mellicent which i was charged to deliver to you be pleased to read it as quickly as you can and tell me if there is any reply  there was not much to readthe good people here amelius have forgiven me and let me return to them i am living happily now dear in my remembrances of you i take the walks that we once took togetherand sometimes i go out in the boat on the lake and think of the time when i told you my sad story your poor little pet creatures are under my care the dog and the fawn and the birdsall well and waiting for you with me my belief that you will come back to me remains the same unshaken belief that it has been from the first once more i say ityou will find me the first to welcome you when your spirits are sinking under the burden of life and your heart turns again to the friends of your early days until that time comes think of me now and then goodbye  i am waiting said brother bawkwell taking his hat in his hand  amelius answered with an effort thank her kindly in my name he said that is all his head drooped while he spoke he fell into thought as if he had been alone in the room  but the emissary from tadmor warned by the minutehand on the watch recalled his attention to passing events you would do me a kindness said brother bawkwell producing a list of names and addresses if you could put me in the way of finding the person named eighth from the top its getting on towards twenty minutes to three  the address thus pointed out was at no great distance on the northern side of the regents park amelius still silent and thoughtful acted willingly as a guide please thank the council for their kindness to me he said when they reached their destination brother bawkwell looked at friend amelius with a calm inquiring eye i think youll end in coming back to us he said ill take the opportunity when i see you at tadmor of making a few needful remarks on the value of time  amelius went back to the cottage to see if toff had returned in his absence before he paid his daily visit to surgeon pinfold he called down the kitchen stairs are you there toff and toff answered briskly at your service sir  the sky had become cloudy and threatened rain not finding his umbrella in the hall amelius went into the library to look for it as he closed the door behind him toff and his boy appeared on the kitchen stairs both walking on tiptoe and both evidently on the watch for something  amelius found his umbrella but it was characteristic of the melancholy change in him that he dropped languidly into the nearest chair instead of going out at once with the easy activity of happier days sally was in his mind again he was rousing his resolution to set the doctors commands at defiance and to insist on seeing her come what might of it  he suddenly looked up a slight sound had startled him  it was a faint rustling sound and it came from the sadly silent room which had once been sallys  he listened and heard it again he sprang to his feethis heart beat wildlyhe opened the door of the room  she was there  her hands were clasped over her fastheaving breast she was powerless to look at him powerless to speak to himpowerless to move towards him until he opened his arms to her then all the love and all the sorrow in the tender little heart flowed outward to him in a low murmuring cry she hid her blushing face on his bosom the rosy colour softly tinged her neckthe unspoken confession of all she feared and all she hoped  it was a time beyond words they were silent in each others arms  but under them on the floor below the stillness in the cottage was merrily broken by an outburst of dancemusicwith a rhythmical thumpthump of feet keeping time to the cheerful tune toff was playing his fiddle and toffs boy was dancing to his fathers music    chapter 12  after waiting a day or two for news from amelius and hearing nothing rufus went to make inquiries at the cottage  my master has gone out of town sir said toff opening the door  where  i dont know sir  anybody with him  i dont know sir  any news of sally  i dont know sir  rufus stepped into the hall look here mr frenchman three times is enough i have already apologized for treating you like a teetotum on a former occasion im afraid i shall do it again sir if i dont get an answer to my next questionmy hands are itching to be at you they are when is amelius expected back  your question is positive sir said toff with dignity i am happy to be able to meet it with a positive reply my master is expected back in three weeks time  having obtained some information at last rufus debated with himself what he should do next he decided that the boy was worth waiting for and that his wisest course as a good american would be to go back and wait in paris  passing through the garden of the tuileries two or three days later and crossing to the rue de rivoli the name of one of the hotels in that quarter reminded him of regina he yielded to the prompting of curiosity and inquired if mr farnaby and his niece were still in paris  the manager of the hotel was in the porters lodge at the time so far as he knew he said mr farnaby and his niece and an english gentleman with them were now on their travels they had left the hotel with an appearance of mystery the courier had been discharged and the coachman of the hired carriage which took them away had been told to drive straight forward until further orders in short as the manager put it the departure resembled a flight remembering what his american agent had told him rufus received this information without surprise even the apparently incomprehensible devotion of mr melton to the interests of such a man as farnaby failed to present itself to him as a perplexing circumstance to his mind mr meltons conduct was plainly attributable to a reward in prospect and the name of that reward wasmiss regina  at the end of the three weeks rufus returned to london  once again he and toff confronted each other on the threshold of the door this time the genial old man presented an appearance that was little less than dazzling from head to foot he was arrayed in new clothes and he exhibited an immense rosette of white ribbon in his buttonhole  thunder cried rufus heres mr frenchman going to be married  toff declined to humour the joke he stood on his dignity as stiffly as ever pardon me sir i possess a wife and family already  do you now wellnone of your knownothing answers this time has amelius come back  yes sir  and whats the news of sally  good news sir miss sally has come back too  you call that good news do you ill say a word to amelius what are you standing there for let me by  pardon me once more sir my master and miss sally do not receive visitors today  your master and miss sally rufus repeated has this old creature been liquoring up a little too freely what do you mean he burst out with a sudden change of tone to stern surprisewhat do you mean by putting your master and sally together  toff shot his bolt at last they will be together sir for the rest of their lives they were married this morning   rufus received the blow in dead silence he turned about and went back to his hotel  reaching his room he opened the despatch box in which he kept his correspondence and picked out the long letter containing the description by amelius of his introduction to the ladies of the farnaby family he took up the pen and wrote the indorsement which has been quoted as an integral part of the letter itself in the second book of this narrative  ah poor amelius he had better have gone back to miss mellicent and put up with the little drawback of her age what a bright lovable fellow he was goodbye to goldenheart   were the forebodings of rufus destined to be fulfilled this question will be answered it is hoped in a second series of the fallen leaves the narrative of the married life of amelius presents a subject too important to be treated within the limits of the present storyand the first series necessarily finds its end in the culminating event of his life thus far  the end
