96963913	tales of the fish patrol     white and yellow    san francisco bay is so large that often its storms are more disastrous to oceangoing craft than is the ocean itself in its violent moments  the waters of the bay contain all manner of fish wherefore its surface is ploughed by the keels of all manner of fishing boats manned by all manner of fishermen  to protect the fish from this motley floating population many wise laws have been passed and there is a fish patrol to see that these laws are enforced  exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol  in its history more than one dead patrolman has marked defeat and more often dead fishermen across their illegal nets have marked success  wildest among the fisherfolk may be accounted the chinese shrimp catchers  it is the habit of the shrimp to crawl along the bottom in vast armies till it reaches fresh water when it turns about and crawls back again to the salt  and where the tide ebbs and flows the chinese sink great bagnets to the bottom with gaping mouths into which the shrimp crawls and from which it is transferred to the boilingpot  this in itself would not be bad were it not for the small mesh of the nets so small that the tiniest fishes little newhatched things not a quarter of an inch long cannot pass through  the beautiful beaches of points pedro and pablo where are the shrimpcatchers villages are made fearful by the stench from myriads of decaying fish and against this wasteful destruction it has ever been the duty of the fish patrol to act  when i was a youngster of sixteen a good sloopsailor and all round baywaterman my sloop the reindeer was chartered by the fish commission and i became for the time being a deputy patrolman  after a deal of work among the greek fishermen of the upper bay and rivers where knives flashed at the beginning of trouble and men permitted themselves to be made prisoners only after a revolver was thrust in their faces we hailed with delight an expedition to the lower bay against the chinese shrimpcatchers  there were six of us in two boats and to avoid suspicion we ran down after dark and dropped anchor under a projecting bluff of land known as point pinole  as the east paled with the first light of dawn we got under way again and hauled close on the land breeze as we slanted across the bay toward point pedro  the morning mists curled and clung to the water so that we could see nothing but we busied ourselves driving the chill from our bodies with hot coffee also we had to devote ourselves to the miserable task of bailing for in some incomprehensible way the reindeer had sprung a generous leak  half the night had been spent in overhauling the ballast and exploring the seams but the labor had been without avail  the water still poured in and perforce we doubled up in the cockpit and tossed it out again  after coffee three of the men withdrew to the other boat a columbia river salmon boat leaving three of us in the reindeer then the two craft proceeded in company till the sun showed over the eastern skyline  its fiery rays dispelled the clinging vapors and there before our eyes like a picture lay the shrimp fleet spread out in a great halfmoon the tips of the crescent fully three miles apart and each junk moored fast to the buoy of a shrimpnet  but there was no stir no sign of life  the situation dawned upon us  while waiting for slack water in which to lift their heavy nets from the bed of the bay the chinese had all gone to sleep below  we were elated and our plan of battle was swiftly formed  throw each of your two men on to a junk whispered le grant to me from the salmon boat  and you make fast to a third yourself well do the same and theres no reason in the world why we shouldnt capture six junks at the least  then we separated  i put the reindeer about on the other tack ran up under the lee of a junk shivered the mainsail into the wind and lost headway and forged past the stern of the junk so slowly and so near that one of the patrolmen stepped lightly aboard  then i kept off filled the mainsail and bore away for a second junk  up to this time there had been no noise but from the first junk captured by the salmon boat an uproar now broke forth  there was shrill oriental yelling a pistol shot and more yelling  its all up  theyre warning the others said george the remaining patrolman as he stood beside me in the cockpit  by this time we were in the thick of the fleet and the alarm was spreading with incredible swiftness  the decks were beginning to swarm with halfawakened and halfnaked chinese  cries and yells of warning and anger were flying over the quiet water and somewhere a conch shell was being blown with great success  to the right of us i saw the captain of a junk chop away his mooring line with an axe and spring to help his crew at the hoisting of the huge outlandish lugsail  but to the left the first heads were popping up from below on another junk and i rounded up the reindeer alongside long enough for george to spring aboard  the whole fleet was now under way  in addition to the sails they had gotten out long sweeps and the bay was being ploughed in every direction by the fleeing junks  i was now alone in the reindeer seeking feverishly to capture a third prize  the first junk i took after was a clean miss for it trimmed its sheets and shot away surprisingly into the wind  by fully half a point it outpointed the reindeer and i began to feel respect for the clumsy craft realizing the hopelessness of the pursuit i filled away threw out the mainsheet and drove down before the wind upon the junks to leeward where i had them at a disadvantage  the one i had selected wavered indecisively before me and as i swung wide to make the boarding gentle filled suddenly and darted away the smart mongols shouting a wild rhythm as they bent to the sweeps  but i had been ready for this  i luffed suddenly putting the tiller hard down and holding it down with my body i brought the mainsheet in hand over hand on the run so as to retain all possible striking force  the two starboard sweeps of the junk were crumpled up and then the two boats came together with a crash  the reindeers bowsprit like a monstrous hand reached over and ripped out the junks chunky mast and towering sail  this was met by a curdling yell of rage  a big chinaman remarkably evillooking with his head swathed in a yellow silk handkerchief and face badly pockmarked planted a pikepole on the reindeers bow and began to shove the entangled boats apart pausing long enough to let go the jib halyards and just as the reindeer cleared and began to drift astern i leaped aboard the junk with a line and made fast  he of the yellow handkerchief and pockmarked face came toward me threateningly but i put my hand into my hip pocket and he hesitated  i was unarmed but the chinese have learned to be fastidiously careful of american hip pockets and it was upon this that i depended to keep him and his savage crew at a distance  i ordered him to drop the anchor at the junks bow to which he replied no sabbe  the crew responded in like fashion and though i made my meaning plain by signs they refused to understand  realizing the inexpediency of discussing the matter i went forward myself overran the line and let the anchor go  now get aboard four of you i said in a loud voice indicating with my fingers that four of them were to go with me and the fifth was to remain by the junk  the yellow handkerchief hesitated but i repeated the order fiercely much more fiercely than i felt at the same time sending my hand to my hip  again the yellow handkerchief was overawed and with surly looks he led three of his men aboard the reindeer  i cast off at once and leaving the jib down steered a course for georges junk  here it was easier for there were two of us and george had a pistol to fall back on if it came to the worst  and here as with my junk four chinese were transferred to the sloop and one left behind to take care of things  four more were added to our passenger list from the third junk  by this time the salmon boat had collected its twelve prisoners and came alongside badly overloaded  to make matters worse as it was a small boat the patrolmen were so jammed in with their prisoners that they would have little chance in case of trouble  youll have to help us out said le grant  i looked over my prisoners who had crowded into the cabin and on top of it  i can take three i answered  make it four he suggested and ill take bill with me  bill was the third patrolman  we havent elbow room here and in case of a scuffle one white to every two of them will be just about the right proportion  the exchange was made and the salmon boat got up its spritsail and headed down the bay toward the marshes off san rafael  i ran up the jib and followed with the reindeer  san rafael where we were to turn our catch over to the authorities communicated with the bay by way of a long and tortuous slough or marshland creek which could be navigated only when the tide was in  slack water had come and as the ebb was commencing there was need for hurry if we cared to escape waiting half a day for the next tide  but the land breeze had begun to die away with the rising sun and now came only in failing puffs  the salmon boat got out its oars and soon left us far astern  some of the chinese stood in the forward part of the cockpit near the cabin doors and once as i leaned over the cockpit rail to flatten down the jibsheet a bit i felt some one brush against my hip pocket  i made no sign but out of the corner of my eye i saw that the yellow handkerchief had discovered the emptiness of the pocket which had hitherto overawed him  to make matters serious during all the excitement of boarding the junks the reindeer had not been bailed and the water was beginning to slush over the cockpit floor  the shrimpcatchers pointed at it and looked to me questioningly  yes i said  bime by allee same dlown velly quick you no bail now  sabbe  no they did not sabbe or at least they shook their heads to that effect though they chattered most comprehendingly to one another in their own lingo  i pulled up three or four of the bottom boards got a couple of buckets from a locker and by unmistakable signlanguage invited them to fall to  but they laughed and some crowded into the cabin and some climbed up on top  their laughter was not good laughter  there was a hint of menace in it a maliciousness which their black looks verified  the yellow handkerchief since his discovery of my empty pocket had become most insolent in his bearing and he wormed about among the other prisoners talking to them with great earnestness  swallowing my chagrin i stepped down into the cockpit and began throwing out the water  but hardly had i begun when the boom swung overhead the mainsail filled with a jerk and the reindeer heeled over  the day wind was springing up  george was the veriest of landlubbers so i was forced to give over bailing and take the tiller  the wind was blowing directly off point pedro and the high mountains behind and because of this was squally and uncertain half the time bellying the canvas out and the other half flapping it idly  george was about the most allround helpless man i had ever met among his other disabilities he was a consumptive and i knew that if he attempted to bail it might bring on a hemorrhage  yet the rising water warned me that something must be done  again i ordered the shrimpcatchers to lend a hand with the buckets  they laughed defiantly and those inside the cabin the water up to their ankles shouted back and forth with those on top  youd better get out your gun and make them bail i said to george  but he shook his head and showed all too plainly that he was afraid  the chinese could see the funk he was in as well as i could and their insolence became insufferable  those in the cabin broke into the food lockers and those above scrambled down and joined them in a feast on our crackers and canned goods  what do we care george said weakly  i was fuming with helpless anger  if they get out of hand it will be too late to care  the best thing you can do is to get them in check right now  the water was rising higher and higher and the gusts forerunners of a steady breeze were growing stiffer and stiffer  and between the gusts the prisoners having gotten away with a weeks grub took to crowding first to one side and then to the other till the reindeer rocked like a cockleshell  yellow handkerchief approached me and pointing out his village on the point pedro beach gave me to understand that if i turned the reindeer in that direction and put them ashore they in turn would go to bailing by now the water in the cabin was up to the bunks and the bed clothes were sopping  it was a foot deep on the cockpit floor nevertheless i refused and i could see by georges face that he was disappointed  if you dont show some nerve theyll rush us and throw us overboard i said to him  better give me your revolver if you want to be safe  the safest thing to do he chattered cravenly is to put them ashore  i for one dont want to be drowned for the sake of a handful of dirty chinamen  and i for another dont care to give in to a handful of dirty chinamen to escape drowning i answered hotly  youll sink the reindeer under us all at this rate he whined and what good thatll do i cant see  every man to his taste i retorted  he made no reply but i could see he was trembling pitifully between the threatening chinese and the rising water he was beside himself with fright and more than the chinese and the water i feared him and what his fright might impel him to do  i could see him casting longing glances at the small skiff towing astern so in the next calm i hauled the skiff alongside  as i did so his eyes brightened with hope but before he could guess my intention i stove the frail bottom through with a handaxe and the skiff filled to its gunwales  its sink or float together i said  and if youll give me your revolver ill have the reindeer bailed out in a jiffy  theyre too many for us he whimpered  we cant fight them all  i turned my back on him in disgust  the salmon boat had long since passed from sight behind a little archipelago known as the marin islands so no help could be looked for from that quarter  yellow handkerchief came up to me in a familiar manner the water in the cockpit slushing against his legs  i did not like his looks  i felt that beneath the pleasant smile he was trying to put on his face there was an ill purpose  i ordered him back and so sharply that he obeyed  now keep your distance i commanded and dont you come closer  wha fo he demanded indignantly  i tinkum talkee talkee heap good  talkee talkee i answered bitterly for i knew now that he had understood all that passed between george and me  what for talkee talkee  you no sabbe talkee talkee  he grinned in a sickly fashion  yep i sabbe velly much  i honest chinaman  all right i answered  you sabbe talkee talkee then you bail water plenty plenty  after that we talkee talkee  he shook his head at the same time pointing over his shoulder to his comrades  no can do  velly bad chinamen heap velly bad  i tinkum  stand back i shouted for i had noticed his hand disappear beneath his blouse and his body prepare for a spring  disconcerted he went back into the cabin to hold a council apparently from the way the jabbering broke forth  the reindeer was very deep in the water and her movements had grown quite loggy  in a rough sea she would have inevitably swamped but the wind when it did blow was off the land and scarcely a ripple disturbed the surface of the bay  i think youd better head for the beach george said abruptly in a manner that told me his fear had forced him to make up his mind to some course of action  i think not i answered shortly  i command you he said in a bullying tone  i was commanded to bring these prisoners into san rafael was my reply  our voices were raised and the sound of the altercation brought the chinese out of the cabin  now will you head for the beach  this from george and i found myself looking into the muzzle of his revolverof the revolver he dared to use on me but was too cowardly to use on the prisoners  my brain seemed smitten with a dazzling brightness  the whole situation in all its bearings was focussed sharply before methe shame of losing the prisoners the worthlessness and cowardice of george the meeting with le grant and the other patrol men and the lame explanation and then there was the fight i had fought so hard victory wrenched from me just as i thought i had it within my grasp  and out of the tail of my eye i could see the chinese crowding together by the cabin doors and leering triumphantly  it would never do  i threw my hand up and my head down  the first act elevated the muzzle and the second removed my head from the path of the bullet which went whistling past  one hand closed on georges wrist the other on the revolver  yellow handkerchief and his gang sprang toward me  it was now or never  putting all my strength into a sudden effort i swung georges body forward to meet them  then i pulled back with equal suddenness ripping the revolver out of his fingers and jerking him off his feet  he fell against yellow handkerchiefs knees who stumbled over him and the pair wallowed in the bailing hole where the cockpit floor was torn open  the next instant i was covering them with my revolver and the wild shrimpcatchers were cowering and cringing away  but i swiftly discovered that there was all the difference in the world between shooting men who are attacking and men who are doing nothing more than simply refusing to obey  for obey they would not when i ordered them into the bailing hole  i threatened them with the revolver but they sat stolidly in the flooded cabin and on the roof and would not move  fifteen minutes passed the reindeer sinking deeper and deeper her mainsail flapping in the calm  but from off the point pedro shore i saw a dark line form on the water and travel toward us  it was the steady breeze i had been expecting so long  i called to the chinese and pointed it out  they hailed it with exclamations then i pointed to the sail and to the water in the reindeer and indicated by signs that when the wind reached the sail what of the water aboard we would capsize  but they jeered defiantly for they knew it was in my power to luff the helm and let go the mainsheet so as to spill the wind and escape damage  but my mind was made up  i hauled in the mainsheet a foot or two took a turn with it and bracing my feet put my back against the tiller  this left me one hand for the sheet and one for the revolver  the dark line drew nearer and i could see them looking from me to it and back again with an apprehension they could not successfully conceal  my brain and will and endurance were pitted against theirs and the problem was which could stand the strain of imminent death the longer and not give in  then the wind struck us  the mainsheet tautened with a brisk rattling of the blocks the boom uplifted the sail bellied out and the reindeer heeled overover and over till the leerail went under the cabin windows went under and the bay began to pour in over the cockpit rail  so violently had she heeled over that the men in the cabin had been thrown on top of one another into the lee bunk where they squirmed and twisted and were washed about those underneath being perilously near to drowning  the wind freshened a bit and the reindeer went over farther than ever  for the moment i thought she was gone and i knew that another puff like that and she surely would go  while i pressed her under and debated whether i should give up or not the chinese cried for mercy  i think it was the sweetest sound i have ever heard  and then and not until then did i luff up and ease out the mainsheet  the reindeer righted very slowly and when she was on an even keel was so much awash that i doubted if she could be saved  but the chinese scrambled madly into the cockpit and fell to bailing with buckets pots pans and everything they could lay hands on  it was a beautiful sight to see that water flying over the side  and when the reindeer was high and proud on the water once more we dashed away with the breeze on our quarter and at the last possible moment crossed the mud flats and entered the slough  the spirit of the chinese was broken and so docile did they become that ere we made san rafael they were out with the towrope yellow handkerchief at the head of the line  as for george it was his last trip with the fish patrol  he did not care for that sort of thing he explained and he thought a clerkship ashore was good enough for him  and we thought so too    the king of the greeks    big alec had never been captured by the fish patrol  it was his boast that no man could take him alive and it was his history that of the many men who had tried to take him dead none had succeeded it was also history that at least two patrolmen who had tried to take him dead had died themselves  further no man violated the fish laws more systematically and deliberately than big alec  he was called big alec because of his gigantic stature  his height was six feet three inches and he was correspondingly broad shouldered and deepchested  he was splendidly muscled and hard as steel and there were innumerable stories in circulation among the fisherfolk concerning his prodigious strength  he was as bold and dominant of spirit as he was strong of body and because of this he was widely known by another name that of the king of the greeks the fishing population was largely composed of greeks and they looked up to him and obeyed him as their chief  and as their chief he fought their fights for them saw that they were protected saved them from the law when they fell into its clutches and made them stand by one another and himself in time of trouble  in the old days the fish patrol had attempted his capture many disastrous times and had finally given it over so that when the word was out that he was coming to benicia i was most anxious to see him  but i did not have to hunt him up  in his usual bold way the first thing he did on arriving was to hunt us up  charley le grant and i at the time were under a patrolman named carmintel and the three of us were on the reindeer preparing for a trip when big alec stepped aboard  carmintel evidently knew him for they shook hands in recognition  big alec took no notice of charley or me  ive come down to fish sturgeon a couple of months he said to carmintel  his eyes flashed with challenge as he spoke and we noticed the patrolmans eyes drop before him  thats all right alec carmintel said in a low voice  ill not bother you  come on into the cabin and well talk things over he added  when they had gone inside and shut the doors after them charley winked with slow deliberation at me  but i was only a youngster and new to men and the ways of some men so i did not understand nor did charley explain though i felt there was something wrong about the business  leaving them to their conference at charleys suggestion we boarded our skiff and pulled over to the old steamboat wharf where big alecs ark was lying  an ark is a houseboat of small though comfortable dimensions and is as necessary to the upper bay fisherman as are nets and boats  we were both curious to see big alecs ark for history said that it had been the scene of more than one pitched battle and that it was riddled with bulletholes  we found the holes stopped with wooden plugs and painted over but there were not so many as i had expected  charley noted my look of disappointment and laughed and then to comfort me he gave an authentic account of one expedition which had descended upon big alecs floating home to capture him alive preferably dead if necessary  at the end of half a days fighting the patrolmen had drawn off in wrecked boats with one of their number killed and three wounded  and when they returned next morning with reinforcements they found only the mooringstakes of big alecs ark the ark itself remained hidden for months in the fastnesses of the suisun tules  but why was he not hanged for murder i demanded  surely the united states is powerful enough to bring such a man to justice  he gave himself up and stood trial charley answered  it cost him fifty thousand dollars to win the case which he did on technicalities and with the aid of the best lawyers in the state every greek fisherman on the river contributed to the sum  big alec levied and collected the tax for all the world like a king the united states may be allpowerful my lad but the fact remains that big alec is a king inside the united states with a country and subjects all his own  but what are you going to do about his fishing for sturgeon  hes bound to fish with a chinese line  charley shrugged his shoulders  well see what we will see he said enigmatically  now a chinese line is a cunning device invented by the people whose name it bears  by a simple system of floats weights and anchors thousands of hooks each on a separate leader are suspended at a distance of from six inches to a foot above the bottom  the remarkable thing about such a line is the hook  it is barbless and in place of the barb the hook is filed long and tapering to a point as sharp as that of a needle  these hoods are only a few inches apart and when several thousand of them are suspended just above the bottom like a fringe for a couple of hundred fathoms they present a formidable obstacle to the fish that travel along the bottom  such a fish is the sturgeon which goes rooting along like a pig and indeed is often called pigfish  pricked by the first hook it touches the sturgeon gives a startled leap and comes into contact with half a dozen more hooks  then it threshes about wildly until it receives hook after hook in its soft flesh and the hooks straining from many different angles hold the luckless fish fast until it is drowned  because no sturgeon can pass through a chinese line the device is called a trap in the fish laws and because it bids fair to exterminate the sturgeon it is branded by the fish laws as illegal  and such a line we were confident big alec intended setting in open and flagrant violation of the law  several days passed after the visit of big alec during which charley and i kept a sharp watch on him  he towed his ark around the solano wharf and into the big bight at turners shipyard  the bight we knew to be good ground for sturgeon and there we felt sure the king of the greeks intended to begin operations  the tide circled like a millrace in and out of this bight and made it possible to raise lower or set a chinese line only at slack water  so between the tides charley and i made it a point for one or the other of us to keep a lookout from the solano wharf  on the fourth day i was lying in the sun behind the stringerpiece of the wharf when i saw a skiff leave the distant shore and pull out into the bight  in an instant the glasses were at my eyes and i was following every movement of the skiff  there were two men in it and though it was a good mile away i made out one of them to be big alec and ere the skiff returned to shore i made out enough more to know that the greek had set his line  big alec has a chinese line out in the bight off turners shipyard charley le grant said that afternoon to carmintel  a fleeting expression of annoyance passed over the patrolmans face and then he said yes in an absent way and that was all  charley bit his lip with suppressed anger and turned on his heel  are you game my lad he said to me later on in the evening just as we finished washing down the reindeers decks and were preparing to turn in  a lump came up in my throat and i could only nod my head  well then and charleys eyes glittered in a determined way weve got to capture big alec between us you and i and weve got to do it in spite of carmintel  will you lend a hand  its a hard proposition but we can do it he added after a pause  of course we can i supplemented enthusiastically  and then he said of course we can and we shook hands on it and went to bed  but it was no easy task we had set ourselves  in order to convict a man of illegal fishing it was necessary to catch him in the act with all the evidence of the crime about himthe hooks the lines the fish and the man himself  this meant that we must take big alec on the open water where he could see us coming and prepare for us one of the warm receptions for which he was noted  theres no getting around it charley said one morning  if we can only get alongside its an even toss and theres nothing left for us but to try and get alongside  come on lad  we were in the columbia river salmon boat the one we had used against the chinese shrimpcatchers  slack water had come and as we dropped around the end of the solano wharf we saw big alec at work running his line and removing the fish  change places charley commanded and steer just astern of him as though youre going into the shipyard  i took the tiller and charley sat down on a thwart amidships placing his revolver handily beside him  if he begins to shoot he cautioned get down in the bottom and steer from there so that nothing more than your hand will be exposed  i nodded and we kept silent after that the boat slipping gently through the water and big alec growing nearer and nearer  we could see him quite plainly gaffing the sturgeon and throwing them into the boat while his companion ran the line and cleared the hooks as he dropped them back into the water  nevertheless we were five hundred yards away when the big fisherman hailed us  here  you  what do you want he shouted  keep going charley whispered just as though you didnt hear him  the next few moments were very anxious ones  the fisherman was studying us sharply while we were gliding up on him every second  you keep off if you know whats good for you he called out suddenly as though he had made up his mind as to who and what we were  if you dont ill fix you  he brought a rifle to his shoulder and trained it on me  now will you keep off he demanded  i could hear charley groan with disappointment  keep off he whispered its all up for this time  i put up the tiller and eased the sheet and the salmon boat ran off five or six points  big alec watched us till we were out of range when he returned to his work  youd better leave big alec alone carmintel said rather sourly to charley that night  so hes been complaining to you has he  charley said significantly  carmintel flushed painfully  youd better leave him alone i tell you he repeated  hes a dangerous man and it wont pay to fool with him  yes charley answered softly ive heard that it pays better to leave him alone  this was a direct thrust at carmintel and we could see by the expression of his face that it sank home  for it was common knowledge that big alec was as willing to bribe as to fight and that of late years more than one patrolman had handled the fishermans money  do you mean to say carmintel began in a bullying tone  but charley cut him off shortly  i mean to say nothing he said you heard what i said and if the cap fits why  he shrugged his shoulders and carmintel glowered at him speechless  what we want is imagination charley said to me one day when we had attempted to creep upon big alec in the gray of dawn and had been shot at for our trouble  and thereafter and for many days i cudgelled my brains trying to imagine some possible way by which two men on an open stretch of water could capture another who knew how to use a rifle and was never to be found without one  regularly every slack water without slyness boldly and openly in the broad day big alec was to be seen running his line  and what made it particularly exasperating was the fact that every fisherman from benicia to vallejo knew that he was successfully defying us  carmintel also bothered us for he kept us busy among the shadfishers of san pablo so that we had little time to spare on the king of the greeks  but charleys wife and children lived at benicia and we had made the place our headquarters so that we always returned to it  ill tell you what we can do i said after several fruitless weeks had passed we can wait some slack water till big alec has run his line and gone ashore with the fish and then we can go out and capture the line  it will put him to time and expense to make another and then well figure to capture that too  if we cant capture him we can discourage him you see  charley saw and said it wasnt a bad idea  we watched our chance and the next lowwater slack after big alec had removed the fish from the line and returned ashore we went out in the salmon boat we had the bearings of the line from shore marks and we knew we would have no difficulty in locating it  the first of the flood tide was setting in when we ran below where we thought the line was stretched and dropped over a fishingboat anchor  keeping a short rope to the anchor so that it barely touched the bottom we dragged it slowly along until it stuck and the boat fetched up hard and fast  weve got it charley cried  come on and lend a hand to get it in  together we hove up the rope till the anchor i came in sight with the sturgeon line caught across one of the flukes  scores of the murderouslooking hooks flashed into sight as we cleared the anchor and we had just started to run along the line to the end where we could begin to lift it when a sharp thud in the boat startled us  we looked about but saw nothing and returned to our work  an instant later there was a similar sharp thud and the gunwale splintered between charleys body and mine  thats remarkably like a bullet lad he said reflectively  and its a long shot big alecs making  and hes using smokeless powder he concluded after an examination of the miledistant shore  thats why we cant hear the report  i looked at the shore but could see no sign of big alec who was undoubtedly hidden in some rocky nook with us at his mercy  a third bullet struck the water glanced passed singing over our heads and struck the water again beyond  i guess wed better get out of this charley remarked coolly what do you think lad  i thought so too and said we didnt want the line anyway whereupon we cast off and hoisted the spritsail  the bullets ceased at once and we sailed away unpleasantly confident that big alec was laughing at our discomfiture  and more than that the next day on the fishing wharf where we were inspecting nets he saw fit to laugh and sneer at us and this before all the fishermen  charleys face went black with anger but beyond promising big alec that in the end he would surely land him behind the bars he controlled himself and said nothing  the king of the greeks made his boast that no fish patrol had ever taken him or ever could take him and the fishermen cheered him and said it was true  they grew excited and it looked like trouble for a while but big alec asserted his kingship and quelled them  carmintel also laughed at charley and dropped sarcastic remarks and made it hard for him  but charley refused to be angered though he told me in confidence that he intended to capture big alec if it took all the rest of his life to accomplish it  i dont know how ill do it he said but do it i will as sure as i am charley le grant  the idea will come to me at the right and proper time never fear  and at the right time it came and most unexpectedly  fully a month had passed and we were constantly up and down the river and down and up the bay with no spare moments to devote to the particular fisherman who ran a chinese line in the bight of turners shipyard  we had called in at selbys smelter one afternoon while on patrol work when all unknown to us our opportunity happened along  it appeared in the guise of a helpless yacht loaded with seasick people so we could hardly be expected to recognize it as the opportunity  it was a large sloopyacht and it was helpless inasmuch as the tradewind was blowing half a gale and there were no capable sailors aboard  from the wharf at selbys we watched with careless interest the lubberly manoeuvre performed of bringing the yacht to anchor and the equally lubberly manoeuvre of sending the small boat ashore  a very miserablelooking man in draggled ducks after nearly swamping the boat in the heavy seas passed us the painter and climbed out he staggered about as though the wharf were rolling and told us his troubles which were the troubles of the yacht  the only roughweather sailor aboard the man on whom they all depended had been called back to san francisco by a telegram and they had attempted to continue the cruise alone  the high wind and big seas of san pablo bay had been too much for them all hands were sick nobody knew anything or could do anything and so they had run in to the smelter either to desert the yacht or to get somebody to bring it to benicia  in short did we know of any sailors who would bring the yacht into benicia  charley looked at me  the reindeer was lying in a snug place  we had nothing on hand in the way of patrol work till midnight  with the wind then blowing we could sail the yacht into benicia in a couple of hours have several more hours ashore and come back to the smelter on the evening train  all right captain charley said to the disconsolate yachtsman who smiled in sickly fashion at the title  im only the owner he explained  we rowed him aboard in much better style than he had come ashore and saw for ourselves the helplessness of the passengers  there were a dozen men and women and all of them too sick even to appear grateful at our coming  the yacht was rolling savagely broad on and no sooner had the owners feet touched the deck than he collapsed and joined the others  not one was able to bear a hand so charley and i between us cleared the badly tangled running gear got up sail and hoisted anchor  it was a rough trip though a swift one  the carquinez straits were a welter of foam and smother and we came through them wildly before the wind the big mainsail alternately dipping and flinging its boom skyward as we tore along  but the people did not mind they did not mind anything  two or three including the owner sprawled in the cockpit shuddering when the yacht lifted and raced and sank dizzily into the trough and betweenwhiles regarding the shore with yearning eyes  the rest were huddled on the cabin floor among the cushions  now and again some one groaned but for the most part they were as limp as so many dead persons  as the bight at turners shipyard opened out charley edged into it to get the smoother water  benicia was in view and we were bowling along over comparatively easy water when a speck of a boat danced up ahead of us directly in our course  it was lowwater slack  charley and i looked at each other  no word was spoken but at once the yacht began a most astonishing performance veering and yawing as though the greenest of amateurs was at the wheel  it was a sight for sailormen to see  to all appearances a runaway yacht was careering madly over the bight and now and again yielding a little bit to control in a desperate effort to make benicia  the owner forgot his seasickness long enough to look anxious  the speck of a boat grew larger and larger till we could see big alec and his partner with a turn of the sturgeon line around a cleat resting from their labor to laugh at us  charley pulled his souwester over his eyes and i followed his example though i could not guess the idea he evidently had in mind and intended to carry into execution  we came foaming down abreast of the skiff so close that we could hear above the wind the voices of big alec and his mate as they shouted at us with all the scorn that professional watermen feel for amateurs especially when amateurs are making fools of themselves  we thundered on past the fishermen and nothing had happened charley grinned at the disappointment he saw in my face and then shouted  stand by the mainsheet to jibe  he put the wheel hard over and the yacht whirled around obediently  the mainsheet slacked and dipped then shot over our heads after the boom and tautened with a crash on the traveller the yacht heeled over almost on her beam ends and a great wail went up from the seasick passengers as they swept across the cabin floor in a tangled mass and piled into a heap in the starboard bunks  but we had no time for them  the yacht completing the manoeuvre headed into the wind with slatting canvas and righted to an even keel  we were still plunging ahead and directly in our path was the skiff  i saw big alec dive overboard and his mate leap for our bowsprit  then came the crash as we struck the boat and a series of grinding bumps as it passed under our bottom  that fixes his rifle i heard charley mutter as he sprang upon the deck to look for big alec somewhere astern  the wind and sea quickly stopped our forward movement and we began to drift backward over the spot where the skiff had been  big alecs black head and swarthy face popped up within arms reach and all unsuspecting and very angry with what he took to be the clumsiness of amateur sailors he was hauled aboard  also he was out of breath for he had dived deep and stayed down long to escape our keel  the next instant to the perplexity and consternation of the owner charley was on top of big alec in the cockpit and i was helping bind him with gaskets  the owner was dancing excitedly about and demanding an explanation but by that time big alecs partner had crawled aft from the bowsprit and was peering apprehensively over the rail into the cockpit  charleys arm shot around his neck and the man landed on his back beside big alec  more gaskets charley shouted and i made haste to supply them  the wrecked skiff was rolling sluggishly a short distance to windward and i trimmed the sheets while charley took the wheel and steered for it  these two men are old offenders he explained to the angry owner and they are most persistent violators of the fish and game laws you have seen them caught in the act and you may expect to be subpoenaed as witness for the state when the trial comes off  as he spoke he rounded alongside the skiff  it had been torn from the line a section of which was dragging to it  he hauled in forty or fifty feet with a young sturgeon still fast in a tangle of barbless hooks slashed that much of the line free with his knife and tossed it into the cockpit beside the prisoners  and theres the evidence exhibit a for the people charley continued  look it over carefully so that you may identify it in the courtroom with the time and place of capture  and then in triumph with no more veering and yawing we sailed into benicia the king of the greeks bound hard and fast in the cockpit and for the first time in his life a prisoner of the fish patrol    a raid on the oyster pirates    of the fish patrolmen under whom we served at various times charley le grant and i were agreed i think that neil partington was the best  he was neither dishonest nor cowardly and while he demanded strict obedience when we were under his orders at the same time our relations were those of easy comradeship and he permitted us a freedom to which we were ordinarily unaccustomed as the present story will show  neils family lived in oakland which is on the lower bay not more than six miles across the water from san francisco  one day while scouting among the chinese shrimpcatchers of point pedro he received word that his wife was very ill and within the hour the reindeer was bowling along for oakland with a stiff northwest breeze astern  we ran up the oakland estuary and came to anchor and in the days that followed while neil was ashore we tightened up the reindeers rigging overhauled the ballast scraped down and put the sloop into thorough shape  this done time hung heavy on our hands  neils wife was dangerously ill and the outlook was a weeks lieover awaiting the crisis  charley and i roamed the docks wondering what we should do and so came upon the oyster fleet lying at the oakland city wharf  in the main they were trim natty boats made for speed and bad weather and we sat down on the stringerpiece of the dock to study them  a good catch i guess charley said pointing to the heaps of oysters assorted in three sizes which lay upon their decks  pedlers were backing their wagons to the edge of the wharf and from the bargaining and chaffering that went on i managed to learn the selling price of the oysters  that boat must have at least two hundred dollars worth aboard i calculated  i wonder how long it took to get the load  three or four days charley answered  not bad wages for two mentwentyfive dollars a day apiece  the boat we were discussing the ghost lay directly beneath us two men composed its crew  one was a squat broadshouldered fellow with remarkably long and gorillalike arms while the other was tall and well proportioned with clear blue eyes and a mat of straight black hair  so unusual and striking was this combination of hair and eyes that charley and i remained somewhat longer than we intended  and it was well that we did  a stout elderly man with the dress and carriage of a successful merchant came up and stood beside us looking down upon the deck of the ghost  he appeared angry and the longer he looked the angrier he grew  those are my oysters he said at last  i know they are my oysters  you raided my beds last night and robbed me of them  the tall man and the short man on the ghost looked up  hello taft the short man said with insolent familiarity among the bayfarers he had gained the nickname of the centipede on account of his long arms  hello taft he repeated with the same touch of insolence  wot r you growling about now  those are my oystersthats what i said  youve stolen them from my beds  yer mighty wise aint ye was the centipedes sneering reply spose you can tell your oysters wherever you see em  now in my experience broke in the tall man oysters is oysters wherever you find em an theyre pretty much alike all the bay over and the world over too for that matter  were not wantin to quarrel with you mr taft but we jes wish you wouldnt insinuate that them oysters is yours an that were thieves an robbers till you can prove the goods  i know theyre mine id stake my life on it mr taft snorted  prove it challenged the tall man who we afterward learned was known as the porpoise because of his wonderful swimming abilities  mr taft shrugged his shoulders helplessly  of course he could not prove the oysters to be his no matter how certain he might be  id give a thousand dollars to have you men behind the bars he cried  ill give fifty dollars a head for your arrest and conviction all of you  a roar of laughter went up from the different boats for the rest of the pirates had been listening to the discussion  theres more money in oysters the porpoise remarked dryly  mr taft turned impatiently on his heel and walked away  from out of the corner of his eye charley noted the way he went  several minutes later when he had disappeared around a corner charley rose lazily to his feet  i followed him and we sauntered off in the opposite direction to that taken by mr taft  come on  lively charley whispered when we passed from the view of the oyster fleet  our course was changed at once and we dodged around corners and raced up and down sidestreets till mr tafts generous form loomed up ahead of us  im going to interview him about that reward charley explained as we rapidly overhauled the oysterbed owner  neil will be delayed here for a week and you and i might as well be doing something in the meantime  what do you say  of course of course mr taft said when charley had introduced himself and explained his errand  those thieves are robbing me of thousands of dollars every year and i shall be glad to break them up at any priceyes sir at any price  as i said ill give fifty dollars a head and call it cheap at that  theyve robbed my beds torn down my signs terrorized my watchmen and last year killed one of them  couldnt prove it  all done in the blackness of night  all i had was a dead watchman and no evidence  the detectives could do nothing  nobody has been able to do anything with those men  we have never succeeded in arresting one of them so i say mrwhat did you say your name was  le grant charley answered  so i say mr le grant i am deeply obliged to you for the assistance you offer  and i shall be glad most glad sir to co operate with you in every way  my watchmen and boats are at your disposal  come and see me at the san francisco offices any time or telephone at my expense  and dont be afraid of spending money ill foot your expenses whatever they are so long as they are within reason  the situation is growing desperate and something must be done to determine whether i or that band of ruffians own those oyster beds  now well see neil charley said when he had seen mr taft upon his train to san francisco  not only did neil partington interpose no obstacle to our adventure but he proved to be of the greatest assistance  charley and i knew nothing of the oyster industry while his head was an encyclopaedia of facts concerning it  also within an hour or so he was able to bring to us a greek boy of seventeen or eighteen who knew thoroughly well the ins and outs of oyster piracy  at this point i may as well explain that we of the fish patrol were free lances in a way  while neil partington who was a patrolman proper received a regular salary charley and i being merely deputies received only what we earnedthat is to say a certain percentage of the fines imposed on convicted violators of the fish laws  also any rewards that chanced our way were ours  we offered to share with partington whatever we should get from mr taft but the patrolman would not hear of it  he was only too happy he said to do a good turn for us who had done so many for him  we held a long council of war and mapped out the following line of action  our faces were unfamiliar on the lower bay but as the reindeer was well known as a fishpatrol sloop the greek boy whose name was nicholas and i were to sail some innocentlooking craft down to asparagus island and join the oyster pirates fleet here according to nicholass description of the beds and the manner of raiding it was possible for us to catch the pirates in the act of stealing oysters and at the same time to get them in our power  charley was to be on the shore with mr tafts watchmen and a posse of constables to help us at the right time  i know just the boat neil said at the conclusion of the discussion a crazy old sloop thats lying over at tiburon  you and nicholas can go over by the ferry charter it for a song and sail direct for the beds  good luck be with you boys he said at parting two days later remember they are dangerous men so be careful  nicholas and i succeeded in chartering the sloop very cheaply and between laughs while getting up sail we agreed that she was even crazier and older than she had been described  she was a big flatbottomed squaresterned craft slooprigged with a sprung mast slack rigging dilapidated sails and rotten runninggear clumsy to handle and uncertain in bringing about and she smelled vilely of coal tar with which strange stuff she had been smeared from stem to stern and from cabinroof to centreboard  and to cap it all coal tar maggie was printed in great white letters the whole length of either side  it was an uneventful though laughable run from tiburon to asparagus island where we arrived in the afternoon of the following day the oyster pirates a fleet of a dozen sloops were lying at anchor on what was known as the deserted beds  the coal tar maggie came sloshing into their midst with a light breeze astern and they crowded on deck to see us  nicholas and i had caught the spirit of the crazy craft and we handled her in most lubberly fashion  wot is it some one called  name it n ye kin have it called another  i swan naow ef it aint the old ark itself mimicked the centipede from the deck of the ghost  hey  ahoy there clipper ship another wag shouted  wots yer port  we took no notice of the joking but acted after the manner of greenhorns as though the coal tar maggie required our undivided attention  i rounded her well to windward of the ghost and nicholas ran forard to drop the anchor  to all appearances it was a bungle the way the chain tangled and kept the anchor from reaching the bottom  and to all appearances nicholas and i were terribly excited as we strove to clear it  at any rate we quite deceived the pirates who took huge delight in our predicament  but the chain remained tangled and amid all kinds of mocking advice we drifted down upon and fouled the ghost whose bowsprit poked square through our mainsail and ripped a hole in it as big as a barn door  the centipede and the porpoise doubled up on the cabin in paroxysms of laughter and left us to get clear as best we could  this with much unseamanlike performance we succeeded in doing and likewise in clearing the anchorchain of which we let out about three hundred feet  with only ten feet of water under us this would permit the coal tar maggie to swing in a circle six hundred feet in diameter in which circle she would be able to foul at least half the fleet  the oyster pirates lay snugly together at short hawsers the weather being fine and they protested loudly at our ignorance in putting out such an unwarranted length of anchorchain  and not only did they protest for they made us heave it in again all but thirty feet  having sufficiently impressed them with our general lubberliness nicholas and i went below to congratulate ourselves and to cook supper  hardly had we finished the meal and washed the dishes when a skiff ground against the coal tar maggies side and heavy feet trampled on deck  then the centipedes brutal face appeared in the companionway and he descended into the cabin followed by the porpoise  before they could seat themselves on a bunk another skiff came alongside and another and another till the whole fleet was represented by the gathering in the cabin  whered you swipe the old tub asked a squat and hairy man with cruel eyes and mexican features  didnt swipe it nicholas answered meeting them on their own ground and encouraging the idea that we had stolen the coal tar maggie  and if we did what of it  well i dont admire your taste thats all sneered he of the mexican features  id rot on the beach first before id take a tub that couldnt get out of its own way  how were we to know till we tried her nicholas asked so innocently as to cause a laugh  and how do you get the oysters he hurried on  we want a load of them thats what we came for a load of oysters  what dye want em for demanded the porpoise  oh to give away to our friends of course nicholas retorted thats what you do with yours i suppose  this started another laugh and as our visitors grew more genial we could see that they had not the slightest suspicion of our identity or purpose  didnt i see you on the dock in oakland the other day the centipede asked suddenly of me  yep i answered boldly taking the bull by the horns  i was watching you fellows and figuring out whether wed go oystering or not  its a pretty good business i calculate and so were going in for it  that is i hastened to add if you fellows dont mind  ill tell you one thing which aint two things he replied and that is youll have to hump yerself an get a better boat  we wont stand to be disgraced by any such box as this  understand  sure i said  soon as we sell some oysters well outfit in style  and if you show yerself square an the right sort he went on why you kin run with us  but if you dont here his voice became stern and menacing why itll be the sickest day of yer life  understand  sure i said  after that and more warning and advice of similar nature the conversation became general and we learned that the beds were to be raided that very night  as they got into their boats after an hours stay we were invited to join them in the raid with the assurance of the more the merrier  did you notice that short mexicanlooking chap nicholas asked when they had departed to their various sloops  hes barchi of the sporting life gang and the fellow that came with him is skilling  theyre both out now on five thousand dollars bail  i had heard of the sporting life gang before a crowd of hoodlums and criminals that terrorized the lower quarters of oakland and twothirds of which were usually to be found in states prison for crimes that ranged from perjury and ballotbox stuffing to murder  they are not regular oyster pirates nicholas continued theyve just come down for the lark and to make a few dollars but well have to watch out for them  we sat in the cockpit and discussed the details of our plan till eleven oclock had passed when we heard the rattle of an oar in a boat from the direction of the ghost  we hauled up our own skiff tossed in a few sacks and rowed over  there we found all the skiffs assembling it being the intention to raid the beds in a body  to my surprise i found barely a foot of water where we had dropped anchor in ten feet  it was the big june runout of the full moon and as the ebb had yet an hour and a half to run i knew that our anchorage would be dry ground before slack water  mr tafts beds were three miles away and for a long time we rowed silently in the wake of the other boats once in a while grounding and our oar blades constantly striking bottom  at last we came upon soft mud covered with not more than two inches of waternot enough to float the boats  but the pirates at once were over the side and by pushing and pulling on the flatbottomed skiffs we moved steadily along  the full moon was partly obscured by highflying clouds but the pirates went their way with the familiarity born of long practice after half a mile of the mud we came upon a deep channel up which we rowed with dead oyster shoals looming high and dry on either side  at last we reached the picking grounds  two men on one of the shoals hailed us and warned us off  but the centipede the porpoise barchi and skilling took the lead and followed by the rest of us at least thirty men in half as many boats rowed right up to the watchmen  youd better slide outa this here barchi said threateningly or well fill you so full of holes you wouldnt float in molasses  the watchmen wisely retreated before so overwhelming a force and rowed their boat along the channel toward where the shore should be  besides it was in the plan for them to retreat  we hauled the noses of the boats up on the shore side of a big shoal and all hands with sacks spread out and began picking every now and again the clouds thinned before the face of the moon and we could see the big oysters quite distinctly  in almost no time sacks were filled and carried back to the boats where fresh ones were obtained  nicholas and i returned often and anxiously to the boats with our little loads but always found some one of the pirates coming or going  never mind he said no hurry  as they pick farther and farther away it will take too long to carry to the boats  then theyll stand the full sacks on end and pick them up when the tide comes in and the skiffs will float to them  fully half an hour went by and the tide had begun to flood when this came to pass  leaving the pirates at their work we stole back to the boats  one by one and noiselessly we shoved them off and made them fast in an awkward flotilla  just as we were shoving off the last skiff our own one of the men came upon us  it was barchi  his quick eye took in the situation at a glance and he sprang for us but we went clear with a mighty shove and he was left floundering in the water over his head  as soon as he got back to the shoal he raised his voice and gave the alarm  we rowed with all our strength but it was slow going with so many boats in tow  a pistol cracked from the shoal a second and a third then a regular fusillade began  the bullets spat and spat all about us but thick clouds had covered the moon and in the dim darkness it was no more than random firing  it was only by chance that we could be hit  wish we had a little steam launch i panted  id just as soon the moon stayed hidden nicholas panted back  it was slow work but every stroke carried us farther away from the shoal and nearer the shore till at last the shooting died down and when the moon did come out we were too far away to be in danger  not long afterward we answered a shoreward hail and two whitehall boats each pulled by three pairs of oars darted up to us  charleys welcome face bent over to us and he gripped us by the hands while he cried oh you joys  you joys  both of you  when the flotilla had been landed nicholas and i and a watchman rowed out in one of the whitehalls with charley in the stern sheets  two other whitehalls followed us and as the moon now shone brightly we easily made out the oyster pirates on their lonely shoal  as we drew closer they fired a rattling volley from their revolvers and we promptly retreated beyond range  lot of time charley said  the flood is setting in fast and by the time its up to their necks there wont be any fight left in them  so we lay on our oars and waited for the tide to do its work  this was the predicament of the pirates  because of the big runout the tide was now rushing back like a millrace and it was impossible for the strongest swimmer in the world to make against it the three miles to the sloops  between the pirates and the shore were we precluding escape in that direction  on the other hand the water was rising rapidly over the shoals and it was only a question of a few hours when it would be over their heads  it was beautifully calm and in the brilliant white moonlight we watched them through our night glasses and told charley of the voyage of the coal tar maggie  one oclock came and two oclock and the pirates were clustering on the highest shoal waistdeep in water  now this illustrates the value of imagination charley was saying  taft has been trying for years to get them but he went at it with bull strength and failed  now we used our heads     just then i heard a scarcely audible gurgle of water and holding up my hand for silence i turned and pointed to a ripple slowly widening out in a growing circle  it was not more than fifty feet from us  we kept perfectly quiet and waited  after a minute the water broke six feet away and a black head and white shoulder showed in the moonlight  with a snort of surprise and of suddenly expelled breath the head and shoulder went down  we pulled ahead several strokes and drifted with the current  four pairs of eyes searched the surface of the water but never another ripple showed and never another glimpse did we catch of the black head and white shoulder  its the porpoise nicholas said  it would take broad daylight for us to catch him  at a quarter to three the pirates gave their first sign of weakening  we heard cries for help in the unmistakable voice of the centipede and this time on rowing closer we were not fired upon  the centipede was in a truly perilous plight  only the heads and shoulders of his fellowmarauders showed above the water as they braced themselves against the current while his feet were off the bottom and they were supporting him  now lads charley said briskly we have got you and you cant get away  if you cut up rough well have to leave you alone and the water will finish you  but if youre good well take you aboard one man at a time and youll all be saved  what do you say  ay they chorused hoarsely between their chattering teeth  then one man at a time and the short men first  the centipede was the first to be pulled aboard and he came willingly though he objected when the constable put the handcuffs on him  barchi was next hauled in quite meek and resigned from his soaking  when we had ten in our boat we drew back and the second whitehall was loaded  the third whitehall received nine prisoners onlya catch of twentynine in all  you didnt get the porpoise the centipede said exultantly as though his escape materially diminished our success  charley laughed  but we saw him just the same asnorting for shore like a puffing pig  it was a mild and shivering band of pirates that we marched up the beach to the oyster house  in answer to charleys knock the door was flung open and a pleasant wave of warm air rushed out upon us  you can dry your clothes here lads and get some hot coffee charley announced as they filed in  and there sitting ruefully by the fire with a steaming mug in his hand was the porpoise  with one accord nicholas and i looked at charley  he laughed gleefully  that comes of imagination he said  when you see a thing youve got to see it all around or whats the good of seeing it at all  i saw the beach so i left a couple of constables behind to keep an eye on it  thats all    the siege of the lancashire queen    possibly our most exasperating experience on the fish patrol was when charley le grant and i laid a two weeks siege to a big four masted english ship  before we had finished with the affair it became a pretty mathematical problem and it was by the merest chance that we came into possession of the instrument that brought it to a successful termination  after our raid on the oyster pirates we had returned to oakland where two more weeks passed before neil partingtons wife was out of danger and on the highroad to recovery  so it was after an absence of a month all told that we turned the reindeers nose toward benicia  when the cats away the mice will play and in these four weeks the fishermen had become very bold in violating the law  when we passed point pedro we noticed many signs of activity among the shrimpcatchers and well into san pablo bay we observed a widely scattered fleet of upper bay fishingboats hastily pulling in their nets and getting up sail  this was suspicious enough to warrant investigation and the first and only boat we succeeded in boarding proved to have an illegal net  the law permitted no smaller mesh for catching shad than one that measured seven and onehalf inches inside the knots while the mesh of this particular net measured only three inches  it was a flagrant breach of the rules and the two fishermen were forthwith put under arrest  neil partington took one of them with him to help manage the reindeer while charley and i went on ahead with the other in the captured boat  but the shad fleet had headed over toward the petaluma shore in wild flight and for the rest of the run through san pablo bay we saw no more fishermen at all  our prisoner a bronzed and bearded greek sat sullenly on his net while we sailed his craft  it was a new columbia river salmon boat evidently on its first trip and it handled splendidly  even when charley praised it our prisoner refused to speak or to notice us and we soon gave him up as a most unsociable fellow  we ran up the carquinez straits and edged into the bight at turners shipyard for smoother water  here were lying several english steel sailing ships waiting for the wheat harvest and here most unexpectedly in the precise place where we had captured big alec we came upon two italians in a skiff that was loaded with a complete chinese sturgeon line  the surprise was mutual and we were on top of them before either they or we were aware charley had barely time to luff into the wind and run up to them i ran forward and tossed them a line with orders to make it fast one of the italians took a turn with it over a cleat while i hastened to lower our big spritsail  this accomplished the salmon boat dropped astern dragging heavily on the skiff  charley came forward to board the prize but when i proceeded to haul alongside by means of the line the italians cast it off  we at once began drifting to leeward while they got out two pairs of oars and rowed their light craft directly into the wind  this manoeuvre for the moment disconcerted us for in our large and heavily loaded boat we could not hope to catch them with the oars but our prisoner came unexpectedly to our aid  his black eyes were flashing eagerly and his face was flushed with suppressed excitement as he dropped the centreboard sprang forward with a single leap and put up the sail  ive always heard that greeks dont like italians charley laughed as he ran aft to the tiller  and never in my experience have i seen a man so anxious for the capture of another as was our prisoner in the chase that followed his eyes fairly snapped and his nostrils quivered and dilated in a most extraordinary way  charley steered while he tended the sheet and though charley was as quick and alert as a cat the greek could hardly control his impatience  the italians were cut off from the shore which was fully a mile away at its nearest point  did they attempt to make it we could haul after them with the wind abeam and overtake them before they had covered an eighth of the distance  but they were too wise to attempt it contenting themselves with rowing lustily to windward along the starboard side of a big ship the lancashire queen  but beyond the ship lay an open stretch of fully two miles to the shore in that direction  this also they dared not attempt for we were bound to catch them before they could cover it  so when they reached the bow of the lancashire queen nothing remained but to pass around and row down her port side toward the stern which meant rowing to leeward and giving us the advantage  we in the salmon boat sailing close on the wind tacked about and crossed the ships bow  then charley put up the tiller and headed down the port side of the ship the greek letting out the sheet and grinning with delight  the italians were already halfway down the ships length but the stiff breeze at our back drove us after them far faster than they could row  closer and closer we came and i lying down forward was just reaching out to grasp the skiff when it ducked under the great stern of the lancashire queen  the chase was virtually where it had begun  the italians were rowing up the starboard side of the ship and we were hauled close on the wind and slowly edging out from the ship as we worked to windward  then they darted around her bow and began the row down her port side and we tacked about crossed her bow and went plunging down the wind hot after them  and again just as i was reaching for the skiff it ducked under the ships stern and out of danger  and so it went around and around the skiff each time just barely ducking into safety  by this time the ships crew had become aware of what was taking place and we could see their heads in a long row as they looked at us over the bulwarks  each time we missed the skiff at the stern they set up a wild cheer and dashed across to the other side of the lancashire queen to see the chase to windward  they showered us and the italians with jokes and advice and made our greek so angry that at least once on each circuit he raised his fist and shook it at them in a rage  they came to look for this and at each display greeted it with uproarious mirth  wot a circus cried one  tork about yer marine hippodromesif this aint one id like to know affirmed another  sixdaysgoasyerplease announced a third  who says the dagoes wont win  on the next tack to windward the greek offered to change places with charley  leta me saila de boat he demanded  i fixa them i catcha them sure  this was a stroke at charleys professional pride for pride himself he did upon his boatsailing abilities but he yielded the tiller to the prisoner and took his place at the sheet  three times again we made the circuit and the greek found that he could get no more speed out of the salmon boat than charley had  better give it up one of the sailors advised from above  the greek scowled ferociously and shook his fist in his customary fashion  in the meanwhile my mind had not been idle and i had finally evolved an idea  keep going charley one time more i said  and as we laid out on the next tack to windward i bent a piece of line to a small grappling hook i had seen lying in the bailhole the end of the line i made fast to the ringbolt in the bow and with the hook out of sight i waited for the next opportunity to use it  once more they made their leeward pull down the port side of the lancashire queen and once more we churned down after them before the wind  nearer and nearer we drew and i was making believe to reach for them as before  the stern of the skiff was not six feet away and they were laughing at me derisively as they ducked under the ships stern  at that instant i suddenly arose and threw the grappling iron  it caught fairly and squarely on the rail of the skiff which was jerked backward out of safety as the rope tautened and the salmon boat ploughed on  a groan went up from the row of sailors above which quickly changed to a cheer as one of the italians whipped out a long sheathknife and cut the rope  but we had drawn them out of safety and charley from his place in the sternsheets reached over and clutched the stern of the skiff  the whole thing happened in a second of time for the first italian was cutting the rope and charley was clutching the skiff when the second italian dealt him a rap over the head with an oar charley released his hold and collapsed stunned into the bottom of the salmon boat and the italians bent to their oars and escaped back under the ships stern  the greek took both tiller and sheet and continued the chase around the lancashire queen while i attended to charley on whose head a nasty lump was rapidly rising  our sailor audience was wild with delight and to a man encouraged the fleeing italians  charley sat up with one hand on his head and gazed about him sheepishly  it will never do to let them escape now he said at the same time drawing his revolver  on our next circuit he threatened the italians with the weapon but they rowed on stolidly keeping splendid stroke and utterly disregarding him  if you dont stop ill shoot charley said menacingly  but this had no effect nor were they to be frightened into surrendering even when he fired several shots dangerously close to them  it was too much to expect him to shoot unarmed men and this they knew as well as we did so they continued to pull doggedly round and round the ship  well run them down then charley exclaimed  well wear them out and wind them  so the chase continued  twenty times more we ran them around the lancashire queen and at last we could see that even their iron muscles were giving out  they were nearly exhausted and it was only a matter of a few more circuits when the game took on a new feature  on the row to windward they always gained on us so that they were halfway down the ships side on the row to leeward when we were passing the bow  but this last time as we passed the bow we saw them escaping up the ships gangway which had been suddenly lowered  it was an organized move on the part of the sailors evidently countenanced by the captain for by the time we arrived where the gangway had been it was being hoisted up and the skiff slung in the ships davits was likewise flying aloft out of reach  the parley that followed with the captain was short and snappy  he absolutely forbade us to board the lancashire queen and as absolutely refused to give up the two men  by this time charley was as enraged as the greek  not only had he been foiled in a long and ridiculous chase but he had been knocked senseless into the bottom of his boat by the men who had escaped him  knock off my head with little apples he declared emphatically striking the fist of one hand into the palm of the other if those two men ever escape me  ill stay here to get them if it takes the rest of my natural life and if i dont get them then i promise you ill live unnaturally long or until i do get them or my names not charley le grant  and then began the siege of the lancashire queen a siege memorable in the annals of both fishermen and fish patrol  when the reindeer came along after a fruitless pursuit of the shad fleet charley instructed neil partington to send out his own salmon boat with blankets provisions and a fishermans charcoal stove  by sunset this exchange of boats was made and we said goodby to our greek who perforce had to go into benicia and be locked up for his own violation of the law  after supper charley and i kept alternate fourhour watches till daylight  the fishermen made no attempt to escape that night though the ship sent out a boat for scouting purposes to find if the coast were clear  by the next day we saw that a steady siege was in order and we perfected our plans with an eye to our own comfort  a dock known as the solano wharf which ran out from the benicia shore helped us in this  it happened that the lancashire queen the shore at turners shipyard and the solano wharf were the corners of a big equilateral triangle  from ship to shore the side of the triangle along which the italians had to escape was a distance equal to that from the solano wharf to the shore the side of the triangle along which we had to travel to get to the shore before the italians  but as we could sail much faster than they could row we could permit them to travel about half their side of the triangle before we darted out along our side  if we allowed them to get more than halfway they were certain to beat us to shore while if we started before they were halfway they were equally certain to beat us back to the ship  we found that an imaginary line drawn from the end of the wharf to a windmill farther along the shore cut precisely in half the line of the triangle along which the italians must escape to reach the land  this line made it easy for us to determine how far to let them run away before we bestirred ourselves in pursuit  day after day we would watch them through our glasses as they rowed leisurely along toward the halfway point and as they drew close into line with the windmill we would leap into the boat and get up sail  at sight of our preparation they would turn and row slowly back to the lancashire queen secure in the knowledge that we could not overtake them  to guard against calmswhen our salmon boat would be uselesswe also had in readiness a light rowing skiff equipped with spoon oars  but at such times when the wind failed us we were forced to row out from the wharf as soon as they rowed from the ship  in the nighttime on the other hand we were compelled to patrol the immediate vicinity of the ship which we did charley and i standing fourhour watches turn and turn about  the italians however preferred the daytime in which to escape and so our long night vigils were without result  what makes me mad said charley is our being kept from our honest beds while those rascally lawbreakers are sleeping soundly every night  but much good may it do them he threatened  ill keep them on that ship till the captain charges them board as sure as a sturgeons not a catfish  it was a tantalizing problem that confronted us  as long as we were vigilant they could not escape and as long as they were careful we would be unable to catch them  charley cudgelled his brains continually but for once his imagination failed him  it was a problem apparently without other solution than that of patience  it was a waiting game and whichever waited the longer was bound to win  to add to our irritation friends of the italians established a code of signals with them from the shore so that we never dared relax the siege for a moment  and besides this there were always one or two suspiciouslooking fishermen hanging around the solano wharf and keeping watch on our actions we could do nothing but grin and bear it as charley said while it took up all our time and prevented us from doing other work  the days went by and there was no change in the situation  not that no attempts were made to change it  one night friends from the shore came out in a skiff and attempted to confuse us while the two italians escaped  that they did not succeed was due to the lack of a little oil on the ships davits  for we were drawn back from the pursuit of the strange boat by the creaking of the davits and arrived at the lancashire queen just as the italians were lowering their skiff  another night fully half a dozen skiffs rowed around us in the darkness but we held on like a leech to the side of the ship and frustrated their plan till they grew angry and showered us with abuse  charley laughed to himself in the bottom of the boat  its a good sign lad he said to me  when men begin to abuse make sure theyre losing patience and shortly after they lose patience they lose their heads  mark my words if we only hold out theyll get careless some fine day and then well get them  but they did not grow careless and charley confessed that this was one of the times when all signs failed  their patience seemed equal to ours and the second week of the siege dragged monotonously along  then charleys lagging imagination quickened sufficiently to suggest a ruse  peter boyelen a new patrolman and one unknown to the fisherfolk happened to arrive in benicia and we took him into our plan  we were as secret as possible about it but in some unfathomable way the friends ashore got word to the beleaguered italians to keep their eyes open  on the night we were to put our ruse into effect charley and i took up our usual station in our rowing skiff alongside the lancashire queen  after it was thoroughly dark peter boyelen came out in a crazy duck boat the kind you can pick up and carry away under one arm  when we heard him coming along paddling noisily we slipped away a short distance into the darkness and rested on our oars  opposite the gangway having jovially hailed the anchor watch of the lancashire queen and asked the direction of the scottish chiefs another wheat ship he awkwardly capsized himself the man who was standing the anchorwatch ran down the gangway and hauled him out of the water  this was what he wanted to get aboard the ship and the next thing he expected was to be taken on deck and then below to warm up and dry out  but the captain inhospitably kept him perched on the lowest gangway step shivering miserably and with his feet dangling in the water till we out of very pity rowed in from the darkness and took him off the jokes and gibes of the awakened crew sounded anything but sweet in our ears and even the two italians climbed up on the rail and laughed down at us long and maliciously  thats all right charley said in a low voice which i only could hear  im mighty glad its not us thats laughing first  well save our laugh to the end eh lad  he clapped a hand on my shoulder as he finished but it seemed to me that there was more determination than hope in his voice  it would have been possible for us to secure the aid of united states marshals and board the english ship backed by government authority  but the instructions of the fish commission were to the effect that the patrolmen should avoid complications and this one did we call on the higher powers might well end in a pretty international tangle  the second week of the siege drew to its close and there was no sign of change in the situation  on the morning of the fourteenth day the change came and it came in a guise as unexpected and startling to us as it was to the men we were striving to capture  charley and i after our customary night vigil by the side of the lancashire queen rowed into the solana wharf  hello cried charley in surprise  in the name of reason and common sense what is that  of all unmannerly craft did you ever see the like  well might he exclaim for there tied up to the dock lay the strangest looking launch i had ever seen  not that it could be called a launch either but it seemed to resemble a launch more than any other kind of boat  it was seventy feet long but so narrow was it and so bare of superstructure that it appeared much smaller than it really was  it was built wholly of steel and was painted black  three smokestacks a good distance apart and raking well aft arose in single file amidships while the bow long and lean and sharp as a knife plainly advertised that the boat was made for speed  passing under the stern we read streak painted in small white letters  charley and i were consumed with curiosity  in a few minutes we were on board and talking with an engineer who was watching the sunrise from the deck  he was quite willing to satisfy our curiosity and in a few minutes we learned that the streak had come in after dark from san francisco that this was what might be called the trial trip and that she was the property of silas tate a young mining millionaire of california whose fad was highspeed yachts  there was some talk about turbine engines direct application of steam and the absence of pistons rods and cranksall of which was beyond me for i was familiar only with sailing craft but i did understand the last words of the engineer  four thousand horsepower and fortyfive miles an hour though you wouldnt think it he concluded proudly  say it again man  say it again charley exclaimed in an excited voice  four thousand horsepower and fortyfive miles an hour the engineer repeated grinning goodnaturedly  wheres the owner was charleys next question  is there any way i can speak to him  the engineer shook his head  no im afraid not  hes asleep you see  at that moment a young man in blue uniform came on deck farther aft and stood regarding the sunrise  there he is thats him thats mr tate said the engineer  charley walked aft and spoke to him and while he talked earnestly the young man listened with an amused expression on his face  he must have inquired about the depth of water close in to the shore at turners shipyard for i could see charley making gestures and explaining  a few minutes later he came back in high glee  come on lad he said  on to the dock with you  weve got them  it was our good fortune to leave the streak when we did for a little later one of the spy fishermen appeared  charley and i took up our accustomed places on the stringerpiece a little ahead of the streak and over our own boat where we could comfortably watch the lancashire queen  nothing occurred till about nine oclock when we saw the two italians leave the ship and pull along their side of the triangle toward the shore  charley looked as unconcerned as could be but before they had covered a quarter of the distance he whispered to me  fortyfive miles an hour    nothing can save them    they are ours  slowly the two men rowed along till they were nearly in line with the windmill  this was the point where we always jumped into our salmon boat and got up the sail and the two men evidently expecting it seemed surprised when we gave no sign  when they were directly in line with the windmill as near to the shore as to the ship and nearer the shore than we had ever allowed them before they grew suspicious  we followed them through the glasses and saw them standing up in the skiff and trying to find out what we were doing  the spy fisherman sitting beside us on the stringerpiece was likewise puzzled  he could not understand our inactivity  the men in the skiff rowed nearer the shore but stood up again and scanned it as if they thought we might be in hiding there  but a man came out on the beach and waved a handkerchief to indicate that the coast was clear  that settled them  they bent to the oars to make a dash for it  still charley waited  not until they had covered threequarters of the distance from the lancashire queen which left them hardly more than a quarter of a mile to gain the shore did charley slap me on the shoulder and cry  theyre ours  theyre ours  we ran the few steps to the side of the streak and jumped aboard stern and bow lines were cast off in a jiffy  the streak shot ahead and away from the wharf  the spy fisherman we had left behind on the stringerpiece pulled out a revolver and fired five shots into the air in rapid succession  the men in the skiff gave instant heed to the warning for we could see them pulling away like mad  but if they pulled like mad i wonder how our progress can be described  we fairly flew  so frightful was the speed with which we displaced the water that a wave rose up on either side our bow and foamed aft in a series of three stiff upstanding waves while astern a great crested billow pursued us hungrily as though at each moment it would fall aboard and destroy us  the streak was pulsing and vibrating and roaring like a thing alive  the wind of our progress was like a galea fortyfivemile gale  we could not face it and draw breath without choking and strangling  it blew the smoke straight back from the mouths of the smokestacks at a direct right angle to the perpendicular  in fact we were travelling as fast as an express train  we just streaked it was the way charley told it afterward and i think his description comes nearer than any i can give  as for the italians in the skiffhardly had we started it seemed to me when we were on top of them  naturally we had to slow down long before we got to them but even then we shot past like a whirlwind and were compelled to circle back between them and the shore  they had rowed steadily rising from the thwarts at every stroke up to the moment we passed them when they recognized charley and me  that took the last bit of fight out of them  they hauled in their oars and sullenly submitted to arrest  well charley neil partington said as we discussed it on the wharf afterward i fail to see where your boasted imagination came into play this time  but charley was true to his hobby  imagination he demanded pointing to the streak  look at that just look at it  if the invention of that isnt imagination i should like to know what is  of course he added its the other fellows imagination but it did the work all the same    charleys coup    perhaps our most laughable exploit on the fish patrol and at the same time our most dangerous one was when we rounded in at a single haul an even score of wrathful fishermen  charley called it a coop having heard neil partington use the term but i think he misunderstood the word and thought it meant coop to catch to trap  the fishermen however coup or coop must have called it a waterloo for it was the severest stroke ever dealt them by the fish patrol while they had invited it by open and impudent defiance of the law  during what is called the open season the fishermen might catch as many salmon as their luck allowed and their boats could hold but there was one important restriction  from sundown saturday night to sunup monday morning they were not permitted to set a net  this was a wise provision on the part of the fish commission for it was necessary to give the spawning salmon some opportunity to ascend the river and lay their eggs  and this law with only an occasional violation had been obediently observed by the greek fishermen who caught salmon for the canneries and the market  one sunday morning charley received a telephone call from a friend in collinsville who told him that the full force of fishermen was out with its nets  charley and i jumped into our salmon boat and started for the scene of the trouble  with a light favoring wind at our back we went through the carquinez straits crossed suisun bay passed the ship island light and came upon the whole fleet at work  but first let me describe the method by which they worked  the net used is what is known as a gillnet  it has a simple diamond shaped mesh which measures at least seven and onehalf inches between the knots  from five to seven and even eight hundred feet in length these nets are only a few feet wide  they are not stationary but float with the current the upper edge supported on the surface by floats the lower edge sunk by means of leaden weights  this arrangement keeps the net upright in the current and effectually prevents all but the smaller fish from ascending the river  the salmon swimming near the surface as is their custom run their heads through these meshes and are prevented from going on through by their larger girth of body and from going back because of their gills which catch in the mesh  it requires two fishermen to set such a netone to row the boat while the other standing in the stern carefully pays out the net  when it is all out stretching directly across the stream the men make their boat fast to one end of the net and drift along with it  as we came upon the fleet of lawbreaking fishermen each boat two or three hundred yards from its neighbors and boats and nets dotting the river as far as we could see charley said  ive only one regret lad and that is that i havent a thousand arms so as to be able to catch them all  as it is well only be able to catch one boat for while we are tackling that one it will be up nets and away with the rest  as we drew closer we observed none of the usual flurry and excitement which our appearance invariably produced  instead each boat lay quietly by its net while the fishermen favored us with not the slightest attention  its curious charley muttered  can it be they dont recognize us  i said that it was impossible and charley agreed yet there was a whole fleet manned by men who knew us only too well and who took no more notice of us than if we were a hay scow or a pleasure yacht  this did not continue to be the case however for as we bore down upon the nearest net the men to whom it belonged detached their boat and rowed slowly toward the shore  the rest of the boats showed no sign of uneasiness  thats funny was charleys remark  but we can confiscate the net at any rate  we lowered sail picked up one end of the net and began to heave it into the boat  but at the first heave we heard a bullet zip zipping past us on the water followed by the faint report of a rifle  the men who had rowed ashore were shooting at us  at the next heave a second bullet went zipping past perilously near charley took a turn around a pin and sat down  there were no more shots  but as soon as he began to heave in the shooting recommenced  that settles it he said flinging the end of the net overboard you fellows want it worse than we do and you can have it  we rowed over toward the next net for charley was intent on finding out whether or not we were face to face with an organized defiance  as we approached the two fishermen proceeded to cast off from their net and row ashore while the first two rowed back and made fast to the net we had abandoned  and at the second net we were greeted by rifle shots till we desisted and went on to the third where the manoeuvre was again repeated  then we gave it up completely routed and hoisted sail and started on the long windward beat back to benicia  a number of sundays went by on each of which the law was persistently violated  yet short of an armed force of soldiers we could do nothing  the fishermen had hit upon a new idea and were using it for all it was worth while there seemed no way by which we could get the better of them  about this time neil partington happened along from the lower bay where he had been for a number of weeks  with him was nicholas the greek boy who had helped us in our raid on the oyster pirates and the pair of them took a hand  we made our arrangements carefully  it was planned that while charley and i tackled the nets they were to be hidden ashore so as to ambush the fishermen who landed to shoot at us  it was a pretty plan  even charley said it was  but we reckoned not half so well as the greeks  they forestalled us by ambushing neil and nicholas and taking them prisoners while as of old bullets whistled about our ears when charley and i attempted to take possession of the nets  when we were again beaten off neil partington and nicholas were released  they were rather shamefaced when they put in an appearance and charley chaffed them unmercifully  but neil chaffed back demanding to know why charleys imagination had not long since overcome the difficulty  just you wait the ideall come all right charley promised  most probably neil agreed  but im afraid the salmon will be exterminated first and then there will be no need for it when it does come  neil partington highly disgusted with his adventure departed for the lower bay taking nicholas with him and charley and i were left to our own resources  this meant that the sunday fishing would be left to itself too until such time as charleys idea happened along  i puzzled my head a good deal to find out some way of checkmating the greeks as also did charley and we broached a thousand expedients which on discussion proved worthless  the fishermen on the other hand were in high feather and their boasts went up and down the river to add to our discomfiture among all classes of them we became aware of a growing insubordination  we were beaten and they were losing respect for us  with the loss of respect contempt began to arise  charley began to be spoken of as the olda woman and i received my rating as the peewee kid  the situation was fast becoming unbearable and we knew that we should have to deliver a stunning stroke at the greeks in order to regain the oldtime respect in which we had stood  then one morning the idea came  we were down on steamboat wharf where the river steamers made their landings and where we found a group of amused longshoremen and loafers listening to the hard luck tale of a sleepyeyed young fellow in long seaboots  he was a sort of amateur fisherman he said fishing for the local market of berkeley  now berkeley was on the lower bay thirty miles away on the previous night he said he had set his net and dozed off to sleep in the bottom of the boat  the next he knew it was morning and he opened his eyes to find his boat rubbing softly against the piles of steamboat wharf at benicia  also he saw the river steamer apache lying ahead of him and a couple of deckhands disentangling the shreds of his net from the paddlewheel  in short after he had gone to sleep his fishermans riding light had gone out and the apache had run over his net  though torn pretty well to pieces the net in some way still remained foul and he had had a thirtymile tow out of his course  charley nudged me with his elbow  i grasped his thought on the instant but objected  we cant charter a steamboat  dont intend to he rejoined  but lets run over to turners shipyard  ive something in my mind there that may be of use to us  and over we went to the shipyard where charley led the way to the mary rebecca lying hauled out on the ways where she was being cleaned and overhauled  she was a scowschooner we both knew well carrying a cargo of one hundred and forty tons and a spread of canvas greater than other schooner on the bay  how dye do ole charley greeted a big blueshirted swede who was greasing the jaws of the main gaff with a piece of pork rind  ole grunted puffed away at his pipe and went on greasing  the captain of a bay schooner is supposed to work with his hands just as well as the men  ole ericsen verified charleys conjecture that the mary rebecca as soon as launched would run up the san joaquin river nearly to stockton for a load of wheat  then charley made his proposition and ole ericsen shook his head  just a hook one goodsized hook charley pleaded  no ay tank not said ole ericsen  der mary rebecca yust hang up on efery mudbank with that hook  ay dont want to lose der mary rebecca  shes all ay got  no no charley hurried to explain  we can put the end of the hook through the bottom from the outside and fasten it on the inside with a nut  after its done its work why all we have to do is to go down into the hold unscrew the nut and out drops the hook  then drive a wooden peg into the hole and the mary rebecca will be all right again  ole ericsen was obstinate for a long time but in the end after we had had dinner with him he was brought round to consent  ay do it by yupiter he said striking one huge fist into the palm of the other hand  but yust hurry you up wid der hook  der mary rebecca slides into der water tonight  it was saturday and charley had need to hurry  we headed for the shipyard blacksmith shop where under charleys directions a most generously curved book of heavy steel was made  back we hastened to the mary rebecca  aft of the great centreboard case through what was properly her keel a hole was bored  the end of the hook was inserted from the outside and charley on the inside screwed the nut on tightly  as it stood complete the hook projected over a foot beneath the bottom of the schooner  its curve was something like the curve of a sickle but deeper  in the late afternoon the mary rebecca was launched and preparations were finished for the start upriver next morning charley and ole intently studied the evening sky for signs of wind for without a good breeze our project was doomed to failure  they agreed that there were all the signs of a stiff westerly windnot the ordinary afternoon seabreeze but a halfgale which even then was springing up  next morning found their predictions verified  the sun was shining brightly but something more than a halfgale was shrieking up the carquinez straits and the mary rebecca got under way with two reefs in her mainsail and one in her foresail  we found it quite rough in the straits and in suisun bay but as the water grew more landlocked it became calm though without letup in the wind  off ship island light the reefs were shaken out and at charleys suggestion a big fishermans staysail was made all ready for hoisting and the maintopsail bunched into a cap at the masthead was overhauled so that it could be set on an instants notice  we were tearing along wingandwing before the wind foresail to starboard and mainsail to port as we came upon the salmon fleet there they were boats and nets as on that first sunday when they had bested us strung out evenly over the river as far as we could see  a narrow space on the righthand side of the channel was left clear for steamboats but the rest of the river was covered with the widestretching nets  the narrow space was our logical course but charley at the wheel steered the mary rebecca straight for the nets  this did not cause any alarm among the fishermen because upriver sailing craft are always provided with shoes on the ends of their keels which permit them to slip over the nets without fouling them  now she takes it charley cried as we dashed across the middle of a line of floats which marked a net  at one end of this line was a small barrel buoy at the other the two fishermen in their boat  buoy and boat at once began to draw together and the fishermen to cry out as they were jerked after us  a couple of minutes later we hooked a second net and then a third and in this fashion we tore straight up through the centre of the fleet  the consternation we spread among the fishermen was tremendous  as fast as we hooked a net the two ends of it buoy and boat came together as they dragged out astern and so many buoys and boats coming together at such breakneck speed kept the fishermen on the jump to avoid smashing into one another  also they shouted at us like mad to heave to into the wind for they took it as some drunken prank on the part of scowsailors little dreaming that we were the fish patrol  the drag of a single net is very heavy and charley and ole ericsen decided that even in such a wind ten nets were all the mary rebecca could take along with her  so when we had hooked ten nets with ten boats containing twenty men streaming along behind us we veered to the left out of the fleet and headed toward collinsville  we were all jubilant  charley was handling the wheel as though he were steering the winning yacht home in a race  the two sailors who made up the crew of the mary rebecca were grinning and joking ole ericsen was rubbing his huge hands in childlike glee  ay tank you fish patrol fallers never ban so lucky as when you sail with ole ericsen he was saying when a rifle cracked sharply astern and a bullet gouged along the newly painted cabin glanced on a nail and sang shrilly onward into space  this was too much for ole ericsen  at sight of his beloved paintwork thus defaced he jumped up and shook his fist at the fishermen but a second bullet smashed into the cabin not six inches from his head and he dropped down to the deck under cover of the rail  all the fishermen had rifles and they now opened a general fusillade  we were all driven to covereven charley who was compelled to desert the wheel  had it not been for the heavy drag of the nets we would inevitably have broached to at the mercy of the enraged fishermen  but the nets fastened to the bottom of the mary rebecca well aft held her stern into the wind and she continued to plough on though somewhat erratically  charley lying on the deck could just manage to reach the lower spokes of the wheel but while he could steer after a fashion it was very awkward  ole ericsen bethought himself of a large piece of sheet steel in the empty hold  it was in fact a plate from the side of the new jersey a steamer which had recently been wrecked outside the golden gate and in the salving of which the mary rebecca had taken part  crawling carefully along the deck the two sailors ole and myself got the heavy plate on deck and aft where we reared it as a shield between the wheel and the fishermen  the bullets whanged and banged against it till it rang like a bullseye but charley grinned in its shelter and coolly went on steering  so we raced along behind us a howling screaming bedlam of wrathful greeks collinsville ahead and bullets spatspatting all around us  ole charley said in a faint voice i dont know what were going to do  ole ericsen lying on his back close to the rail and grinning upward at the sky turned over on his side and looked at him  ay tank we go into collinsville yust der same he said  but we cant stop charley groaned  i never thought of it but we cant stop  a look of consternation slowly overspread ole ericsens broad face it was only too true  we had a hornets nest on our hands and to stop at collinsville would be to have it about our ears  every man jack of them has a gun one of the sailors remarked cheerfully  yes and a knife too the other sailor added  it was ole ericsens turn to groan  what for a svaidish faller like me monkey with none of my biziness i dont know he soliloquized  a bullet glanced on the stern and sang off to starboard like a spiteful bee  theres nothing to do but plump the mary rebecca ashore and run for it was the verdict of the first cheerful sailor  and leaf der mary rebecca ole demanded with unspeakable horror in his voice  not unless you want to was the response  but i dont want to be within a thousand miles of her when those fellers come aboard indicating the bedlam of excited greeks towing behind  we were right in at collinsville then and went foaming by within biscuittoss of the wharf  i only hope the wind holds out charley said stealing a glance at our prisoners  what of der wind ole demanded disconsolately  der river will not hold out and then    and then     its head for tall timber and the greeks take the hindermost adjudged the cheerful sailor while ole was stuttering over what would happen when we came to the end of the river  we had now reached a dividing of the ways  to the left was the mouth of the sacramento river to the right the mouth of the san joaquin  the cheerful sailor crept forward and jibed over the foresail as charley put the helm to starboard and we swerved to the right into the san joaquin  the wind from which we had been running away on an even keel now caught us on our beam and the mary rebecca was pressed down on her port side as if she were about to capsize  still we dashed on and still the fishermen dashed on behind  the value of their nets was greater than the fines they would have to pay for violating the fish laws so to cast off from their nets and escape which they could easily do would profit them nothing further they remained by their nets instinctively as a sailor remains by his ship  and still further the desire for vengeance was roused and we could depend upon it that they would follow us to the ends of the earth if we undertook to tow them that far  the riflefiring had ceased and we looked astern to see what our prisoners were doing  the boats were strung along at unequal distances apart and we saw the four nearest ones bunching together  this was done by the boat ahead trailing a small rope astern to the one behind  when this was caught they would cast off from their net and heave in on the line till they were brought up to the boat in front  so great was the speed at which we were travelling however that this was very slow work  sometimes the men would strain to their utmost and fail to get in an inch of the rope at other times they came ahead more rapidly  when the four boats were near enough together for a man to pass from one to another one greek from each of three got into the nearest boat to us taking his rifle with him  this made five in the foremost boat and it was plain that their intention was to board us  this they undertook to do by main strength and sweat running hand over hand the floatline of a net  and though it was slow and they stopped frequently to rest they gradually drew nearer  charley smiled at their efforts and said give her the topsail ole  the cap at the mainmast head was broken out and sheet and downhaul pulled flat amid a scattering rifle fire from the boats and the mary rebecca lay over and sprang ahead faster than ever  but the greeks were undaunted  unable at the increased speed to draw themselves nearer by means of their hands they rigged from the blocks of their boat sail what sailors call a watchtackle one of them held by the legs by his mates would lean far over the bow and make the tackle fast to the floatline  then they would heave in on the tackle till the blocks were together when the manoeuvre would be repeated  have to give her the staysail charley said  ole ericsen looked at the straining mary rebecca and shook his head  it will take der masts out of her he said  and well be taken out of her if you dont charley replied  ole shot an anxious glance at his masts another at the boat load of armed greeks and consented  the five men were in the bow of the boata bad place when a craft is towing  i was watching the behavior of their boat as the great fishermans staysail far far larger than the topsail and used only in light breezes was broken out  as the mary rebecca lurched forward with a tremendous jerk the nose of the boat ducked down into the water and the men tumbled over one another in a wild rush into the stern to save the boat from being dragged sheer under water  that settles them charley remarked though he was anxiously studying the behavior of the mary rebecca which was being driven under far more canvas than she was rightly able to carry  next stop is antioch announced the cheerful sailor after the manner of a railway conductor  and next comes merryweather  come here quick charley said to me  i crawled across the deck and stood upright beside him in the shelter of the sheet steel  feel in my inside pocket he commanded and get my notebook thats right  tear out a blank page and write what i tell you  and this is what i wrote   telephone to merryweather to the sheriff the constable or the judge  tell them we are coming and to turn out the town  arm everybody  have them down on the wharf to meet us or we are gone gooses   now make it good and fast to that marlinspike and stand by to toss it ashore  i did as he directed  by then we were close to antioch  the wind was shouting through our rigging the mary rebecca was half over on her side and rushing ahead like an ocean greyhound  the seafaring folk of antioch had seen us breaking out topsail and staysail a most reckless performance in such weather and had hurried to the wharfends in little groups to find out what was the matter  straight down the water front we boomed charley edging in till a man could almost leap ashore  when he gave the signal i tossed the marlinspike  it struck the planking of the wharf a resounding smash bounced along fifteen or twenty feet and was pounced upon by the amazed onlookers  it all happened in a flash for the next minute antioch was behind and we were heeling it up the san joaquin toward merryweather six miles away  the river straightened out here into its general easterly course and we squared away before the wind wingandwing once more the foresail bellying out to starboard  ole ericsen seemed sunk into a state of stolid despair  charley and the two sailors were looking hopeful as they had good reason to be  merryweather was a coalmining town and it being sunday it was reasonable to expect the men to be in town  further the coalminers had never lost any love for the greek fishermen and were pretty certain to render us hearty assistance  we strained our eyes for a glimpse of the town and the first sight we caught of it gave us immense relief  the wharves were black with men  as we came closer we could see them still arriving stringing down the main street guns in their hands and on the run charley glanced astern at the fishermen with a look of ownership in his eye which till then had been missing  the greeks were plainly overawed by the display of armed strength and were putting their own rifles away  we took in topsail and staysail dropped the main peak and as we got abreast of the principal wharf jibed the mainsail  the mary rebecca shot around into the wind the captive fishermen describing a great arc behind her and forged ahead till she lost way when lines were flung ashore and she was made fast  this was accomplished under a hurricane of cheers from the delighted miners  ole ericsen heaved a great sigh  ay never tank ay see my wife never again he confessed  why we were never in any danger said charley  ole looked at him incredulously  sure i mean it charley went on  all we had to do any time was to let go our endas i am going to do now so that those greeks can untangle their nets  he went below with a monkeywrench unscrewed the nut and let the hook drop off  when the greeks had hauled their nets into their boats and made everything shipshape a posse of citizens took them off our hands and led them away to jail  ay tank ay ban a great big fool said ole ericsen  but he changed his mind when the admiring townspeople crowded aboard to shake hands with him and a couple of enterprising newspaper men took photographs of the mary rebecca and her captain    demetrios contos    it must not be thought from what i have told of the greek fishermen that they were altogether bad  far from it  but they were rough men gathered together in isolated communities and fighting with the elements for a livelihood  they lived far away from the law and its workings did not understand it and thought it tyranny  especially did the fish laws seem tyrannical  and because of this they looked upon the men of the fish patrol as their natural enemies  we menaced their lives or their living which is the same thing in many ways  we confiscated illegal traps and nets the materials of which had cost them considerable sums and the making of which required weeks of labor  we prevented them from catching fish at many times and seasons which was equivalent to preventing them from making as good a living as they might have made had we not been in existence  and when we captured them they were brought into the courts of law where heavy cash fines were collected from them  as a result they hated us vindictively  as the dog is the natural enemy of the cat the snake of man so were we of the fish patrol the natural enemies of the fishermen  but it is to show that they could act generously as well as hate bitterly that this story of demetrios contos is told  demetrios contos lived in vallejo  next to big alec he was the largest bravest and most influential man among the greeks  he had given us no trouble and i doubt if he would ever have clashed with us had he not invested in a new salmon boat  this boat was the cause of all the trouble  he had had it built upon his own model in which the lines of the general salmon boat were somewhat modified  to his high elation he found his new boat very fastin fact faster than any other boat on the bay or rivers  forthwith he grew proud and boastful  and our raid with the mary rebecca on the sunday salmon fishers having wrought fear in their hearts he sent a challenge up to benicia  one of the local fishermen conveyed it to us it was to the effect that demetrios contos would sail up from vallejo on the following sunday and in the plain sight of benicia set his net and catch salmon and that charley le grant patrolman might come and get him if he could  of course charley and i had heard nothing of the new boat  our own boat was pretty fast and we were not afraid to have a brush with any other that happened along  sunday came  the challenge had been bruited abroad and the fishermen and seafaring folk of benicia turned out to a man crowding steamboat wharf till it looked like the grand stand at a football match  charley and i had been sceptical but the fact of the crowd convinced us that there was something in demetrios contoss dare  in the afternoon when the seabreeze had picked up in strength his sail hove into view as he bowled along before the wind  he tacked a score of feet from the wharf waved his hand theatrically like a knight about to enter the lists received a hearty cheer in return and stood away into the straits for a couple of hundred yards  then he lowered sail and drifting the boat sidewise by means of the wind proceeded to set his net  he did not set much of it possibly fifty feet yet charley and i were thunderstruck at the mans effrontery  we did not know at the time but we learned afterward that the net he used was old and worthless  it could catch fish true but a catch of any size would have torn it to pieces  charley shook his head and said  i confess it puzzles me  what if he has out only fifty feet  he could never get it in if we once started for him  and why does he come here anyway flaunting his lawbreaking in our faces  right in our home town too  charleys voice took on an aggrieved tone and he continued for some minutes to inveigh against the brazenness of demetrios contos  in the meantime the man in question was lolling in the stern of his boat and watching the net floats  when a large fish is meshed in a gillnet the floats by their agitation advertise the fact and they evidently advertised it to demetrios for he pulled in about a dozen feet of net and held aloft for a moment before he flung it into the bottom of the boat a big glistening salmon  it was greeted by the audience on the wharf with round after round of cheers  this was more than charley could stand  come on lad he called to me and we lost no time jumping into our salmon boat and getting up sail  the crowd shouted warning to demetrios and as we darted out from the wharf we saw him slash his worthless net clear with a long knife  his sail was all ready to go up and a moment later it fluttered in the sunshine  he ran aft drew in the sheet and filled on the long tack toward the contra costa hills  by this time we were not more than thirty feet astern  charley was jubilant  he knew our boat was fast and he knew further that in fine sailing few men were his equals  he was confident that we should surely catch demetrios and i shared his confidence  but somehow we did not seem to gain  it was a pretty sailing breeze  we were gliding sleekly through the water but demetrios was slowly sliding away from us  and not only was he going faster but he was eating into the wind a fraction of a point closer than we  this was sharply impressed upon us when he went about under the contra costa hills and passed us on the other tack fully one hundred feet dead to windward  whew charley exclaimed  either that boat is a daisy or weve got a fivegallon coaloil can fast to our keel  it certainly looked it one way or the other  and by the time demetrios made the sonoma hills on the other side of the straits we were so hopelessly outdistanced that charley told me to slack off the sheet and we squared away for benicia  the fishermen on steamboat wharf showered us with ridicule when we returned and tied up  charley and i got out and walked away feeling rather sheepish for it is a sore stroke to ones pride when he thinks he has a good boat and knows how to sail it and another man comes along and beats him  charley mooned over it for a couple of days then word was brought to us as before that on the next sunday demetrios contos would repeat his performance  charley roused himself  he had our boat out of the water cleaned and repainted its bottom made a trifling alteration about the centreboard overhauled the running gear and sat up nearly all of saturday night sewing on a new and much larger sail  so large did he make it in fact that additional ballast was imperative and we stowed away nearly five hundred extra pounds of old railroad iron in the bottom of the boat  sunday came and with it came demetrios contos to break the law defiantly in open day  again we had the afternoon seabreeze and again demetrios cut loose some forty or more feet of his rotten net and got up sail and under way under our very noses  but he had anticipated charleys move and his own sail peaked higher than ever while a whole extra cloth had been added to the after leech  it was nip and tuck across to the contra costa hills neither of us seeming to gain or to lose  but by the time we had made the return tack to the sonoma hills we could see that while we footed it at about equal speed demetrios had eaten into the wind the least bit more than we  yet charley was sailing our boat as finely and delicately as it was possible to sail it and getting more out of it than he ever had before  of course he could have drawn his revolver and fired at demetrios but we had long since found it contrary to our natures to shoot at a fleeing man guilty of only a petty offence  also a sort of tacit agreement seemed to have been reached between the patrolmen and the fishermen  if we did not shoot while they ran away they in turn did not fight if we once laid hands on them  thus demetrios contos ran away from us and we did no more than try our best to overtake him and in turn if our boat proved faster than his or was sailed better he would we knew make no resistance when we caught up with him  with our large sails and the healthy breeze romping up the carquinez straits we found that our sailing was what is called ticklish  we had to be constantly on the alert to avoid a capsize and while charley steered i held the mainsheet in my hand with but a single turn round a pin ready to let go at any moment demetrios we could see sailing his boat alone had his hands full  but it was a vain undertaking for us to attempt to catch him  out of his inner consciousness he had evolved a boat that was better than ours  and though charley sailed fully as well if not the least bit better the boat he sailed was not so good as the greeks  slack away the sheet charley commanded and as our boat fell off before the wind demetrioss mocking laugh floated down to us  charley shook his head saying its no use  demetrios has the better boat  if he tries his performance again we must meet it with some new scheme  this time it was my imagination that came to the rescue  whats the matter i suggested on the wednesday following with my chasing demetrios in the boat next sunday while you wait for him on the wharf at vallejo when he arrives  charley considered it a moment and slapped his knee  a good idea  youre beginning to use that head of yours  a credit to your teacher i must say  but you mustnt chase him too far he went on the next moment or hell head out into san pablo bay instead of running home to vallejo and there ill be standing lonely on the wharf and waiting in vain for him to arrive  on thursday charley registered an objection to my plan  everybodyll know ive gone to vallejo and you can depend upon it that demetrios will know too  im afraid well have to give up the idea  this objection was only too valid and for the rest of the day i struggled under my disappointment  but that night a new way seemed to open to me and in my eagerness i awoke charley from a sound sleep  well he grunted whats the matter  house afire  no i replied but my head is  listen to this  on sunday you and i will be around benicia up to the very moment demetrioss sail heaves into sight  this will lull everybodys suspicions  then when demetrioss sail does heave in sight do you stroll leisurely away and uptown  all the fishermen will think youre beaten and that you know youre beaten  so far so good charley commented while i paused to catch breath  and very good indeed i continued proudly  you stroll carelessly uptown but when youre once out of sight you leg it for all youre worth for dan maloneys  take the little mare of his and strike out on the country road for vallejo  the roads in fine condition and you can make it in quicker time than demetrios can beat all the way down against the wind  and ill arrange right away for the mare first thing in the morning charley said accepting the modified plan without hesitation  but i say he said a little later this time waking me out of a sound sleep  i could hear him chuckling in the dark  i say lad isnt it rather a novelty for the fish patrol to be taking to horseback  imagination i answered  its what youre always preaching keep thinking one thought ahead of the other fellow and youre bound to win out  he he he chuckled  and if one thought ahead including a mare doesnt take the other fellows breath away this time im not your humble servant charley le grant  but can you manage the boat alone he asked on friday remember weve a ripping big sail on her  i argued my proficiency so well that he did not refer to the matter again till saturday when he suggested removing one whole cloth from the after leech  i guess it was the disappointment written on my face that made him desist for i also had a pride in my boat sailing abilities and i was almost wild to get out alone with the big sail and go tearing down the carquinez straits in the wake of the flying greek  as usual sunday and demetrios contos arrived together  it had become the regular thing for the fishermen to assemble on steamboat wharf to greet his arrival and to laugh at our discomfiture  he lowered sail a couple of hundred yards out and set his customary fifty feet of rotten net  i suppose this nonsense will keep up as long as his old net holds out charley grumbled with intention in the hearing of several of the greeks  den i givea heem my olda neta one of them spoke up promptly and maliciously  i dont care charley answered  ive got some old net myself he can haveif hell come around and ask for it  they all laughed at this for they could afford to be sweet tempered with a man so badly outwitted as charley was  well so long lad charley called to me a moment later  i think ill go uptown to maloneys  let me take the boat out i asked  if you want to was his answer as he turned on his heel and walked slowly away  demetrios pulled two large salmon out of his net and i jumped into the boat  the fishermen crowded around in a spirit of fun and when i started to get up sail overwhelmed me with all sorts of jocular advice  they even offered extravagant bets to one another that i would surely catch demetrios and two of them styling themselves the committee of judges gravely asked permission to come along with me to see how i did it  but i was in no hurry  i waited to give charley all the time i could and i pretended dissatisfaction with the stretch of the sail and slightly shifted the small tackle by which the huge sprit forces up the peak  it was not until i was sure that charley had reached dan maloneys and was on the little mares back that i cast off from the wharf and gave the big sail to the wind  a stout puff filled it and suddenly pressed the lee gunwale down till a couple of buckets of water came inboard  a little thing like this will happen to the best smallboat sailors and yet though i instantly let go the sheet and righted i was cheered sarcastically as though i had been guilty of a very awkward blunder  when demetrios saw only one person in the fish patrol boat and that one a boy he proceeded to play with me  making a short tack out with me not thirty feet behind he returned with his sheet a little free to steamboat wharf  and there he made short tacks and turned and twisted and ducked around to the great delight of his sympathetic audience  i was right behind him all the time and i dared to do whatever he did even when he squared away before the wind and jibed his big sail overa most dangerous trick with such a sail in such a wind  he depended upon the brisk sea breeze and the strong ebbtide which together kicked up a nasty sea to bring me to grief  but i was on my mettle and never in all my life did i sail a boat better than on that day  i was keyed up to concert pitch my brain was working smoothly and quickly my hands never fumbled once and it seemed that i almost divined the thousand little things which a smallboat sailor must be taking into consideration every second  it was demetrios who came to grief instead  something went wrong with his centreboard so that it jammed in the case and would not go all the way down  in a moments breathing space which he had gained from me by a clever trick i saw him working impatiently with the centreboard trying to force it down  i gave him little time and he was compelled quickly to return to the tiller and sheet  the centreboard made him anxious  he gave over playing with me and started on the long beat to vallejo  to my joy on the first long tack across i found that i could eat into the wind just a little bit closer than he  here was where another man in the boat would have been of value to him for with me but a few feet astern he did not dare let go the tiller and run amidships to try to force down the centreboard  unable to hang on as close in the eye of the wind as formerly he proceeded to slack his sheet a trifle and to ease off a bit in order to outfoot me  this i permitted him to do till i had worked to windward when i bore down upon him  as i drew close he feinted at coming about  this led me to shoot into the wind to forestall him  but it was only a feint cleverly executed and he held back to his course while i hurried to make up lost ground  he was undeniably smarter than i when it came to manoeuvring  time after time i all but had him and each time he tricked me and escaped  besides the wind was freshening constantly and each of us had his hands full to avoid capsizing  as for my boat it could not have been kept afloat but for the extra ballast  i sat cocked over the weather gunwale tiller in one hand and sheet in the other and the sheet with a single turn around a pin i was very often forced to let go in the severer puffs  this allowed the sail to spill the wind which was equivalent to taking off so much driving power and of course i lost ground  my consolation was that demetrios was as often compelled to do the same thing  the strong ebbtide racing down the straits in the teeth of the wind caused an unusually heavy and spiteful sea which dashed aboard continually  i was dripping wet and even the sail was wet halfway up the after leech  once i did succeed in outmanoeuvring demetrios so that my bow bumped into him amidships  here was where i should have had another man  before i could run forward and leap aboard he shoved the boats apart with an oar laughing mockingly in my face as he did so  we were now at the mouth of the straits in a bad stretch of water here the vallejo straits and the carquinez straits rushed directly at each other  through the first flowed all the water of napa river and the great tidelands through the second flowed all the water of suisun bay and the sacramento and san joaquin rivers  and where such immense bodies of water flowing swiftly clashed together a terrible tiderip was produced  to make it worse the wind howled up san pablo bay for fifteen miles and drove in a tremendous sea upon the tiderip  conflicting currents tore about in all directions colliding forming whirlpools sucks and boils and shooting up spitefully into hollow waves which fell aboard as often from leeward as from windward  and through it all confused driven into a madness of motion thundered the great smoking seas from san pablo bay  i was as wildly excited as the water  the boat was behaving splendidly leaping and lurching through the welter like a race horse  i could hardly contain myself with the joy of it  the huge sail the howling wind the driving seas the plunging boati a pygmy a mere speck in the midst of it was mastering the elemental strife flying through it and over it triumphant and victorious  and just then as i roared along like a conquering hero the boat received a frightful smash and came instantly to a dead stop  i was flung forward and into the bottom  as i sprang up i caught a fleeting glimpse of a greenish barnaclecovered object and knew it at once for what it was that terror of navigation a sunken pile  no man may guard against such a thing  waterlogged and floating just beneath the surface it was impossible to sight it in the troubled water in time to escape  the whole bow of the boat must have been crushed in for in a few seconds the boat was half full  then a couple of seas filled it and it sank straight down dragged to bottom by the heavy ballast so quickly did it all happen that i was entangled in the sail and drawn under  when i fought my way to the surface suffocating my lungs almost bursting i could see nothing of the oars  they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents  i saw demetrios contos looking back from his boat and heard the vindictive and mocking tones of his voice as he shouted exultantly  he held steadily on his course leaving me to perish  there was nothing to do but to swim for it which in that wild confusion was at the best a matter of but a few moments  holding my breath and working with my hands i managed to get off my heavy seaboots and my jacket  yet there was very little breath i could catch to hold and i swiftly discovered that it was not so much a matter of swimming as of breathing  i was beaten and buffeted smashed under by the great san pablo whitecaps and strangled by the hollow tiderip waves which flung themselves into my eyes nose and mouth  then the strange sucks would grip my legs and drag me under to spout me up in some fierce boiling where even as i tried to catch my breath a great whitecap would crash down upon my head  it was impossible to survive any length of time  i was breathing more water than air and drowning all the time  my senses began to leave me my head to whirl around  i struggled on spasmodically instinctively and was barely half conscious when i felt myself caught by the shoulders and hauled over the gunwale of a boat  for some time i lay across a seat where i had been flung face downward and with the water running out of my mouth  after a while still weak and faint i turned around to see who was my rescuer  and there in the stern sheet in one hand and tiller in the other grinning and nodding goodnaturedly sat demetrios contos  he had intended to leave me to drownhe said so afterwardbut his better self had fought the battle conquered and sent him back to me  you alla right he asked  i managed to shape a yes on my lips though i could not yet speak  you saila de boat verra gooda he said  so gooda as a man  a compliment from demetrios contos was a compliment indeed and i keenly appreciated it though i could only nod my head in acknowledgment  we held no more conversation for i was busy recovering and he was busy with the boat  he ran in to the wharf at vallejo made the boat fast and helped me out  then it was as we both stood on the wharf that charley stepped out from behind a netrack and put his hand on demetrios contoss arm  he saved my life charley i protested and i dont think he ought to be arrested  a puzzled expression came into charleys face which cleared immediately after in a way it had when he made up his mind  i cant help it lad he said kindly  i cant go back on my duty and its plain duty to arrest him  today is sunday there are two salmon in his boat which he caught today  what else can i do  but he saved my life i persisted unable to make any other argument  demetrios contoss face went black with rage when he learned charleys judgment  he had a sense of being unfairly treated  the better part of his nature had triumphed he had performed a generous act and saved a helpless enemy and in return the enemy was taking him to jail  charley and i were out of sorts with each other when we went back to benicia  i stood for the spirit of the law and not the letter but by the letter charley made his stand  as far as he could see there was nothing else for him to do  the law said distinctly that no salmon should be caught on sunday  he was a patrolman and it was his duty to enforce that law  that was all there was to it he had done his duty and his conscience was clear  nevertheless the whole thing seemed unjust to me and i felt very sorry for demetrios contos  two days later we went down to vallejo to the trial  i had to go along as a witness and it was the most hateful task that i ever performed in my life when i testified on the witness stand to seeing demetrios catch the two salmon charley had captured him with  demetrios had engaged a lawyer but his case was hopeless  the jury was out only fifteen minutes and returned a verdict of guilty  the judge sentenced demetrios to pay a fine of one hundred dollars or go to jail for fifty days  charley stepped up to the clerk of the court  i want to pay that fine he said at the same time placing five twentydollar gold pieces on the desk  itit was the only way out of it lad he stammered turning to me  the moisture rushed into my eyes as i seized his hand  i want to pay i began  to pay your half he interrupted  i certainly shall expect you to pay it  in the meantime demetrios had been informed by his lawyer that his fee likewise had been paid by charley  demetrios came over to shake charleys hand and all his warm southern blood flamed in his face  then not to be outdone in generosity he insisted on paying his fine and lawyers fee himself and flew halfway into a passion because charley refused to let him  more than anything else we ever did i think this action of charleys impressed upon the fishermen the deeper significance of the law  also charley was raised high in their esteem while i came in for a little share of praise as a boy who knew how to sail a boat  demetrios contos not only never broke the law again but he became a very good friend of ours and on more than one occasion he ran up to benicia to have a gossip with us    yellow handkerchief    im not wanting to dictate to you lad charley said but im very much against your making a last raid  youve gone safely through rough times with rough men and it would be a shame to have something happen to you at the very end  but how can i get out of making a last raid i demanded with the cocksureness of youth  there always has to be a last you know to anything  charley crossed his legs leaned back and considered the problem very true  but why not call the capture of demetrios contos the last  youre back from it safe and sound and hearty for all your good wetting andand  his voice broke and he could not speak for a moment  and i could never forgive myself if anything happened to you now  i laughed at charleys fears while i gave in to the claims of his affection and agreed to consider the last raid already performed we had been together for two years and now i was leaving the fish patrol in order to go back and finish my education  i had earned and saved money to put me through three years at the high school and though the beginning of the term was several months away i intended doing a lot of studying for the entrance examinations  my belongings were packed snugly in a seachest and i was all ready to buy my ticket and ride down on the train to oakland when neil partington arrived in benicia  the reindeer was needed immediately for work far down on the lower bay and neil said he intended to run straight for oakland  as that was his home and as i was to live with his family while going to school he saw no reason he said why i should not put my chest aboard and come along  so the chest went aboard and in the middle of the afternoon we hoisted the reindeers big mainsail and cast off  it was tantalizing fall weather  the seabreeze which had blown steadily all summer was gone and in its place were capricious winds and murky skies which made the time of arriving anywhere extremely problematical  we started on the first of the ebb and as we slipped down the carquinez straits i looked my last for some time upon benicia and the bight at turners shipyard where we had besieged the lancashire queen and had captured big alec the king of the greeks  and at the mouth of the straits i looked with not a little interest upon the spot where a few days before i should have drowned but for the good that was in the nature of demetrios contos  a great wall of fog advanced across san pablo bay to meet us and in a few minutes the reindeer was running blindly through the damp obscurity  charley who was steering seemed to have an instinct for that kind of work  how he did it he himself confessed that he did not know but he had a way of calculating winds currents distance time drift and sailing speed that was truly marvellous  it looks as though it were lifting neil partington said a couple of hours after we had entered the fog  where do you say we are charley  charley looked at his watch six oclock and three hours more of ebb he remarked casually  but where do you say we are neil insisted  charley pondered a moment and then answered the tide has edged us over a bit out of our course but if the fog lifts right now as it is going to lift youll find were not more than a thousand miles off mcnears landing  you might be a little more definite by a few miles anyway neil grumbled showing by his tone that he disagreed  all right then charley said conclusively not less than a quarter of a mile not more than a half  the wind freshened with a couple of little puffs and the fog thinned perceptibly  mcnears is right off there charley said pointing directly into the fog on our weather beam  the three of us were peering intently in that direction when the reindeer struck with a dull crash and came to a standstill  we ran forward and found her bowsprit entangled in the tanned rigging of a short chunky mast  she had collided head on with a chinese junk lying at anchor  at the moment we arrived forward five chinese like so many bees came swarming out of the little tweendecks cabin the sleep still in their eyes  leading them came a big muscular man conspicuous for his pock marked face and the yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his head  it was yellow handkerchief the chinaman whom we had arrested for illegal shrimpfishing the year before and who at that time had nearly sunk the reindeer as he had nearly sunk it now by violating the rules of navigation  what dye mean you yellowfaced heathen lying here in a fairway without a horn agoing charley cried hotly  mean neil calmly answered  just take a lookthats what he means  our eyes followed the direction indicated by neils finger and we saw the open amidships of the junk half filled as we found on closer examination with freshcaught shrimps  mingled with the shrimps were myriads of small fish from a quarter of an inch upward in size  yellow handkerchief had lifted the trapnet at highwater slack and taking advantage of the concealment offered by the fog had boldly been lying by waiting to lift the net again at lowwater slack  well neil hummed and hawed in all my varied and extensive experience as a fish patrolman i must say this is the easiest capture i ever made  whatll we do with them charley  tow the junk into san rafael of course came the answer charley turned to me  you stand by the junk lad and ill pass you a towing line  if the wind doesnt fail us well make the creek before the tide gets too low sleep at san rafael and arrive in oakland tomorrow by midday  so saying charley and neil returned to the reindeer and got under way the junk towing astern  i went aft and took charge of the prize steering by means of an antiquated tiller and a rudder with large diamondshaped holes through which the water rushed back and forth  by now the last of the fog had vanished and charleys estimate of our position was confirmed by the sight of mcnears landing a short halfmile away  following along the west shore we rounded point pedro in plain view of the chinese shrimp villages and a great to do was raised when they saw one of their junks towing behind the familiar fish patrol sloop  the wind coming off the land was rather puffy and uncertain and it would have been more to our advantage had it been stronger  san rafael creek up which we had to go to reach the town and turn over our prisoners to the authorities ran through widestretching marshes and was difficult to navigate on a falling tide while at low tide it was impossible to navigate at all  so with the tide already halfebbed it was necessary for us to make time  this the heavy junk prevented lumbering along behind and holding the reindeer back by just so much dead weight  tell those coolies to get up that sail charley finally called to me  we dont want to hang up on the mud flats for the rest of the night  i repeated the order to yellow handkerchief who mumbled it huskily to his men  he was suffering from a bad cold which doubled him up in convulsive coughing spells and made his eyes heavy and bloodshot  this made him more evillooking than ever and when he glared viciously at me i remembered with a shiver the close shave i had had with him at the time of his previous arrest  his crew sullenly tailed on to the halyards and the strange outlandish sail lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown rose in the air  we were sailing on the wind and when yellow handkerchief flattened down the sheet the junk forged ahead and the towline went slack  fast as the reindeer could sail the junk outsailed her and to avoid running her down i hauled a little closer on the wind  but the junk likewise outpointed and in a couple of minutes i was abreast of the reindeer and to windward  the towline had now tautened at right angles to the two boats and the predicament was laughable  cast off i shouted  charley hesitated  its all right i added  nothing can happen  well make the creek on this tack and youll be right behind me all the way up to san rafael  at this charley cast off and yellow handkerchief sent one of his men forward to haul in the line  in the gathering darkness i could just make out the mouth of san rafael creek and by the time we entered it i could barely see its banks  the reindeer was fully five minutes astern and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow winding channel  with charley behind us it seemed i had little to fear from my five prisoners but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them so i transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat where i could more quickly put my hand on it  yellow handkerchief was the one i feared and that he knew it and made use of it subsequent events will show  he was sitting a few feet away from me on what then happened to be the weather side of the junk  i could scarcely see the outlines of his form but i soon became convinced that he was slowly very slowly edging closer to me  i watched him carefully  steering with my left hand i slipped my right into my pocket and got hold of the revolver  i saw him shift along for a couple of inches and i was just about to order him backthe words were trembling on the tip of my tonguewhen i was struck with great force by a heavy figure that had leaped through the air upon me from the lee side  it was one of the crew  he pinioned my right arm so that i could not withdraw my hand from my pocket and at the same time clapped his other hand over my mouth  of course i could have struggled away from him and freed my hand or gotten my mouth clear so that i might cry an alarm but in a trice yellow handkerchief was on top of me  i struggled around to no purpose in the bottom of the junk while my legs and arms were tied and my mouth securely bound in what i afterward found to be a cotton shirt  then i was left lying in the bottom  yellow handkerchief took the tiller issuing his orders in whispers and from our position at the time and from the alteration of the sail which i could dimly make out above me as a blot against the stars i knew the junk was being headed into the mouth of a small slough which emptied at that point into san rafael creek  in a couple of minutes we ran softly alongside the bank and the sail was silently lowered  the chinese kept very quiet  yellow handkerchief sat down in the bottom alongside of me and i could feel him straining to repress his raspy hacking cough  possibly seven or eight minutes later i heard charleys voice as the reindeer went past the mouth of the slough  i cant tell you how relieved i am i could plainly hear him saying to neil that the lad has finished with the fish patrol without accident  here neil said something which i could not catch and then charleys voice went on  the youngster takes naturally to the water and if when he finishes high school he takes a course in navigation and goes deep sea i see no reason why he shouldnt rise to be master of the finest and biggest ship afloat  it was all very flattering to me but lying there bound and gagged by my own prisoners with the voices growing faint and fainter as the reindeer slipped on through the darkness toward san rafael i must say i was not in quite the proper situation to enjoy my smiling future  with the reindeer went my last hope  what was to happen next i could not imagine for the chinese were a different race from mine and from what i knew i was confident that fair play was no part of their makeup  after waiting a few minutes longer the crew hoisted the lateen sail and yellow handkerchief steered down toward the mouth of san rafael creek  the tide was getting lower and he had difficulty in escaping the mudbanks  i was hoping he would run aground but he succeeded in making the bay without accident  as we passed out of the creek a noisy discussion arose which i knew related to me  yellow handkerchief was vehement but the other four as vehemently opposed him  it was very evident that he advocated doing away with me and that they were afraid of the consequences  i was familiar enough with the chinese character to know that fear alone restrained them  but what plan they offered in place of yellow handkerchiefs murderous one i could not make out  my feelings as my fate hung in the balance may be guessed  the discussion developed into a quarrel in the midst of which yellow handkerchief unshipped the heavy tiller and sprang toward me  but his four companions threw themselves between and a clumsy struggle took place for possession of the tiller  in the end yellow handkerchief was overcome and sullenly returned to the steering while they soundly berated him for his rashness  not long after the sail was run down and the junk slowly urged forward by means of the sweeps  i felt it ground gently on the soft mud  three of the chinesethey all wore long seabootsgot over the side and the other two passed me across the rail  with yellow handkerchief at my legs and his two companions at my shoulders they began to flounder along through the mud  after some time their feet struck firmer footing and i knew they were carrying me up some beach  the location of this beach was not doubtful in my mind  it could be none other than one of the marin islands a group of rocky islets which lay off the marin county shore  when they reached the firm sand that marked high tide i was dropped and none too gently  yellow handkerchief kicked me spitefully in the ribs and then the trio floundered back through the mud to the junk  a moment later i heard the sail go up and slat in the wind as they drew in the sheet  then silence fell and i was left to my own devices for getting free  i remembered having seen tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes with which they were bound but though i writhed and squirmed like a good fellow the knots remained as hard as ever and there was no appreciable slack  in the course of my squirming however i rolled over upon a heap of clamshellsthe remains evidently of some yachting partys clambake  this gave me an idea  my hands were tied behind my back and clutching a shell in them i rolled over and over up the beach till i came to the rocks i knew to be there  rolling around and searching i finally discovered a narrow crevice into which i shoved the shell  the edge of it was sharp and across the sharp edge i proceeded to saw the rope that bound my wrists  the edge of the shell was also brittle and i broke it by bearing too heavily upon it  then i rolled back to the heap and returned with as many shells as i could carry in both hands  i broke many shells cut my hands a number of times and got cramps in my legs from my strained position and my exertions  while i was suffering from the cramps and resting i heard a familiar halloo drift across the water  it was charley searching for me  the gag in my mouth prevented me from replying and i could only lie there helplessly fuming while he rowed past the island and his voice slowly lost itself in the distance  i returned to the sawing process and at the end of half an hour succeeded in severing the rope  the rest was easy  my hands once free it was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the gag out of my mouth  i ran around the island to make sure it was an island and not by any chance a portion of the mainland  an island it certainly was one of the marin group fringed with a sandy beach and surrounded by a sea of mud  nothing remained but to wait till daylight and to keep warm for it was a cold raw night for california with just enough wind to pierce the skin and cause one to shiver  to keep up the circulation i ran around the island a dozen times or so and clambered across its rocky backbone as many times more all of which was of greater service to me as i afterward discovered than merely to warm me up  in the midst of this exercise i wondered if i had lost anything out of my pockets while rolling over and over in the sand  a search showed the absence of my revolver and pocketknife  the first yellow handkerchief had taken but the knife had been lost in the sand  i was hunting for it when the sound of rowlocks came to my ears at first of course i thought of charley but on second thought i knew charley would be calling out as he rowed along  a sudden premonition of danger seized me  the marin islands are lonely places chance visitors in the dead of night are hardly to be expected  what if it were yellow handkerchief  the sound made by the rowlocks grew more distinct  i crouched in the sand and listened intently  the boat which i judged a small skiff from the quick stroke of the oars was landing in the mud about fifty yards up the beach  i heard a raspy hacking cough and my heart stood still  it was yellow handkerchief  not to be robbed of his revenge by his more cautious companions he had stolen away from the village and come back alone  i did some swift thinking  i was unarmed and helpless on a tiny islet and a yellow barbarian whom i had reason to fear was coming after me  any place was safer than the island and i turned instinctively to the water or rather to the mud  as he began to flounder ashore through the mud i started to flounder out into it going over the same course which the chinese had taken in landing me and in returning to the junk  yellow handkerchief believing me to be lying tightly bound exercised no care but came ashore noisily  this helped me for under the shield of his noise and making no more myself than necessary i managed to cover fifty feet by the time he had made the beach  here i lay down in the mud  it was cold and clammy and made me shiver but i did not care to stand up and run the risk of being discovered by his sharp eyes  he walked down the beach straight to where he had left me lying and i had a fleeting feeling of regret at not being able to see his surprise when he did not find me  but it was a very fleeting regret for my teeth were chattering with the cold  what his movements were after that i had largely to deduce from the facts of the situation for i could scarcely see him in the dim starlight  but i was sure that the first thing he did was to make the circuit of the beach to learn if landings had been made by other boats  this he would have known at once by the tracks through the mud  convinced that no boat had removed me from the island he next started to find out what had become of me  beginning at the pile of clamshells he lighted matches to trace my tracks in the sand at such times i could see his villanous face plainly and when the sulphur from the matches irritated his lungs between the raspy cough that followed and the clammy mud in which i was lying i confess i shivered harder than ever  the multiplicity of my footprints puzzled him  then the idea that i might be out in the mud must have struck him for he waded out a few yards in my direction and stooping with his eyes searched the dim surface long and carefully  he could not have been more than fifteen feet from me and had he lighted a match he would surely have discovered me  he returned to the beach and clambered about over the rocky backbone again hunting for me with lighted matches the closeness of the shave impelled me to further flight  not daring to wade upright on account of the noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud i remained lying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface by means of my hands  still keeping the trail made by the chinese in going from and to the junk i held on until i reached the water  into this i waded to a depth of three feet and then i turned off to the side on a line parallel with the beach  the thought came to me of going toward yellow handkerchiefs skiff and escaping in it but at that very moment he returned to the beach and as though fearing the very thing i had in mind he slushed out through the mud to assure himself that the skiff was safe  this turned me in the opposite direction  half swimming half wading with my head just out of water and avoiding splashing i succeeded in putting about a hundred feet between myself and the spot where the chinese had begun to wade ashore from the junk  i drew myself out on the mud and remained lying flat  again yellow handkerchief returned to the beach and made a search of the island and again he returned to the heap of clamshells  i knew what was running in his mind as well as he did himself  no one could leave or land without making tracks in the mud  the only tracks to be seen were those leading from his skiff and from where the junk had been  i was not on the island  i must have left it by one or the other of those two tracks  he had just been over the one to his skiff and was certain i had not left that way therefore i could have left the island only by going over the tracks of the junk landing  this he proceeded to verify by wading out over them himself lighting matches as he came along  when he arrived at the point where i had first lain i knew by the matches he burned and the time he took that he had discovered the marks left by my body  these he followed straight to the water and into it but in three feet of water he could no longer see them on the other hand as the tide was still falling he could easily make out the impression made by the junks bow and could have likewise made out the impression of any other boat if it had landed at that particular spot  but there was no such mark and i knew that he was absolutely convinced that i was hiding somewhere in the mud  but to hunt on a dark night for a boy in a sea of mud would be like hunting for a needle in a haystack and he did not attempt it instead he went back to the beach and prowled around for some time i was hoping he would give me up and go for by this time i was suffering severely from the cold  at last he waded out to his skiff and rowed away  what if this departure of yellow handkerchiefs were a sham  what if he had done it merely to entice me ashore  the more i thought of it the more certain i became that he had made a little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away  so i remained lying in the mud and shivering  i shivered till the muscles of the small of my back ached and pained me as badly as the cold and i had need of all my selfcontrol to force myself to remain in my miserable situation  it was well that i did however for possibly an hour later i thought i could make out something moving on the beach  i watched intently but my ears were rewarded first by a raspy cough i knew only too well  yellow handkerchief had sneaked back landed on the other side of the island and crept around to surprise me if i had returned  after that though hours passed without sign of him i was afraid to return to the island at all  on the other hand i was almost equally afraid that i should die of the exposure i was undergoing i had never dreamed one could suffer so  i grew so cold and numb finally that i ceased to shiver  but my muscles and bones began to ache in a way that was agony  the tide had long since begun to rise and foot by foot it drove me in toward the beach  high water came at three oclock and at three oclock i drew myself up on the beach more dead than alive and too helpless to have offered any resistance had yellow handkerchief swooped down upon me  but no yellow handkerchief appeared  he had given me up and gone back to point pedro  nevertheless i was in a deplorable not to say dangerous condition  i could not stand upon my feet much less walk  my clammy muddy garments clung to me like sheets of ice  i thought i should never get them off  so numb and lifeless were my fingers and so weak was i that it seemed to take an hour to get off my shoes  i had not the strength to break the porpoise hide laces and the knots defied me  i repeatedly beat my hands upon the rocks to get some sort of life into them  sometimes i felt sure i was going to die  but in the endafter several centuries it seemed to mei got off the last of my clothes  the water was now close at hand and i crawled painfully into it and washed the mud from my naked body still i could not get on my feet and walk and i was afraid to lie still  nothing remained but to crawl weakly like a snail and at the cost of constant pain up and down the sand  i kept this up as long as possible but as the east paled with the coming of dawn i began to succumb  the sky grew rosyred and the golden rim of the sun showing above the horizon found me lying helpless and motionless among the clamshells  as in a dream i saw the familiar mainsail of the reindeer as she slipped out of san rafael creek on a light puff of morning air this dream was very much broken  there are intervals i can never recollect on looking back over it  three things however i distinctly remember  the first sight of the reindeers mainsail her lying at anchor a few hundred feet away and a small boat leaving her side and the cabin stove roaring redhot myself swathed all over with blankets except on the chest and shoulders which charley was pounding and mauling unmercifully and my mouth and throat burning with the coffee which neil partington was pouring down a trifle too hot  but burn or no burn i tell you it felt good  by the time we arrived in oakland i was as limber and strong as everthough charlie and neil partington were afraid i was going to have pneumonia and mrs partington for my first six months of school kept an anxious eye upon me to discover the first symptoms of consumption  time flies  it seems but yesterday that i was a lad of sixteen on the fish patrol  yet i know that i arrived this very morning from china with a quick passage to my credit and master of the barkentine harvester  and i know that tomorrow morning i shall run over to oakland to see neil partington and his wife and family and later on up to benicia to see charley le grant and talk over old times  no i shall not go to benicia now that i think about it  i expect to be a highly interested party to a wedding shortly to take place  her name is alice partington and since charley has promised to be best man he will have to come down to oakland instead
