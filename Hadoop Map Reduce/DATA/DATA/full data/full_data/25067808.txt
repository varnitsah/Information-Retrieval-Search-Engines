signifies his consent      chapter lxxxii     chapter i  how did he get it   illustration  i can never bring myself to believe it john said mary walker the pretty daughter of mr george walker attorney of silverbridge walker and winthrop was the name of the firm and they were respectable people who did all the solicitors business that had to be done in that part of barsetshire on behalf of the crown were employed on the local business of the duke of omnium who is great in those parts and altogether held their heads up high as provincial lawyers often do theythe walkerslived in a great brick house in the middle of the town gave dinners to which the county gentlemen not unfrequently condescended to come and in a mild way led the fashion in silverbridge i can never bring myself to believe it john said miss walker  youll have to bring yourself to believe it said john without taking his eyes from his book  a clergymanand such a clergyman too  i dont see that that has anything to do with it and as he now spoke john did take his eyes off his book why should not a clergyman turn thief as well as anybody else you girls always seem to forget that clergymen are only men after all  their conduct is likely to be better than that of other men i think  i deny it utterly said john walker ill undertake to say that at this moment there are more clergymen in debt in barsetshire than there are either lawyers or doctors this man has always been in debt since he has been in the county i dont think he has ever been able to show his face in the high street of silverbridge  john that is saying more than you have a right to say said mrs walker  why mother this very cheque was given to a butcher who had threatened a few days before to post bills all about the county giving an account of the debt that was due to him if the money was not paid at once  more shame for mr fletcher said mary he has made a fortune as butcher in silverbridge  what has that to do with it of course a man likes to have his money he had written three times to the bishop and he had sent a man over to hogglestock to get his little bill settled six days running you see he got it at last of course a tradesman must look for his money  mamma do you think that mr crawley stole the cheque mary as she asked the question came and stood over her mother looking at her with anxious eyes  i would rather give no opinion my dear  but you must think something when everybody is talking about it mamma  of course my mother thinks he did said john going back to his book it is impossible that she should think otherwise  that is not fair john said mrs walker and i wont have you fabricate thoughts for me or put the expression of them into my mouth the whole affair is very painful and as your father is engaged in the inquiry i think that the less said about the matter in this house the better i am sure that that would be your fathers feeling  of course i should say nothing about it before him said mary i know that papa does not wish to have it talked about but how is one to help thinking about such a thing it would be so terrible for all of us who belong to the church  i do not see that at all said john mr crawley is not more than any other man just because hes a clergyman i hate all that kind of claptrap there are a lot of people here in silverbridge who think the matter shouldnt be followed up just because the man is in a position which makes the crime more criminal in him than it would be in another  but i feel sure that mr crawley has committed no crime at all said mary  my dear said mrs walker i have just said that i would rather you would not talk about it papa will be in directly  i wont mammaonly  only yes just only said john shed go on till dinner if any one would stay to hear her  youve said twice as much as i have john but john had left the room before his sisters last words could reach him  you know mamma it is quite impossible not to help thinking of it said mary  i dare say it is my dear  and when one knows the people it does make it so dreadful  but do you know them i never spoke to mr crawley in my life and i do not think i ever saw her  i knew grace very wellwhen she used to come first to miss prettymans school  poor girl i pity her  pity her pity is no word for it mamma my heart bleeds for them and yet i do not believe for a moment that he stole the cheque how can it be possible for though he may have been in debt because they have been so very very poor yet we all know that he has been an excellent clergyman when the robartses were dining here last i heard mrs robarts say that for piety and devotion to his duties she had hardly ever seen any one equal to him and the robartses know more of them than anybody  they say that the dean is his great friend  what a pity it is that the arabins should be away just now when he is in such trouble and in this way the mother and daughter went on discussing the question of the clergymans guilt in spite of mrs walkers previously expressed desire that nothing more might be said about it but mrs walker like many other mothers was apt to be more free in converse with her daughter than she was with her son while they were thus talking the father came in from his office and then the subject was dropped he was a man between fifty and sixty years of age with grey hair rather short and somewhat corpulent but still gifted with that amount of personal comeliness which comfortable position and the respect of others will generally seem to give a man rarely carries himself meanly whom the world holds high in esteem  i am very tired my dear said mr walker  you look tired come and sit down for a few minutes before you dress mary get your fathers slippers mary instantly ran to the door  thanks my darling said the father and then he whispered to his wife as soon as mary was out of hearing i fear that unfortunate man is guilty i fear he is i fear he is  oh heavens what will become of them  what indeed she has been with me today  has she and what could you say to her  i told her at first that i could not see her and begged her not to speak to me about it i tried to make her understand that she should go to some one else but it was of no use  and how did it end  i asked her to go in to you but she declined she said you could do nothing for her  and does she think her husband guilty  no indeed she think him guilty nothing on earthor from heaven either as i take it would make her suppose it to be possible she came to me simply to tell me how good he was  i love her for that said mrs walker  so did i but what is the good of loving her thank you dearest ill get your slippers for you some day perhaps  the whole county was astir in this matter of this alleged guilt of the reverend josiah crawleythe whole county almost as keenly as the family of mr walker of silverbridge the crime laid to his charge was the theft of a cheque for twenty pounds which he was said to have stolen out of a pocketbook left or dropped in his house and to have passed as money into the hands of one fletcher a butcher of silverbridge to whom he was indebted mr crawley was in those days the perpetual curate of hogglestock a parish in the northern extremity of east barsetshire a man known by all who knew anything of him to be very pooran unhappy moody disappointed man upon whom the troubles of the world always seemed to come with a double weight but he had ever been respected as a clergyman since his old friend mr arabin the dean of barchester had given him the small incumbency which he now held though moody unhappy and disappointed he was a hardworking conscientious pastor among the poor people with whom his lot was cast for in the parish of hogglestock there resided only a few farmers higher in degree than field labourers brickmakers and such like mr crawley had now passed some ten years of his life at hogglestock and during those years he had worked very hard to do his duty struggling to teach the people around him perhaps too much of the mystery but something also of the comfort of religion that he had become popular in his parish cannot be said of him he was not a man to make himself popular in any position i have said that he was moody and disappointed he was even worse than this he was morose sometimes almost to insanity there had been days in which even his wife had found it impossible to deal with him otherwise than as with an acknowledged lunatic and this was known among the farmers who talked about their clergyman among themselves as though he were a madman but among the very poor among the brickmakers of hoggle enda lawless drunken terribly rough lot of humanityhe was held in high respect for they knew that he lived hardly as they lived that he worked hard as they worked and that the outside world was hard to him as it was to them and there had been an apparent sincerity of godliness about the man and a manifest struggle to do his duty in spite of the worlds illusage which had won its way even with the rough so that mr crawleys name had stood high with many in his parish in spite of the unfortunate peculiarity of his disposition this was the man who was now accused of stealing a cheque for twenty pounds  but before the circumstances of the alleged theft are stated a word or two must be said as to mr crawleys family it is declared that a good wife is a crown to her husband but mrs crawley had been much more than a crown to him as had regarded all the inner life of the manall that portion of his life which had not been passed in the pulpit or in pastoral teachingshe had been crown throne and sceptre all in one that she had endured with him and on his behalf the miseries of poverty and the troubles of a life which had known no smiles is perhaps not to be alleged as much to her honour she had joined herself to him for better or worse and it was her manifest duty to bear such things wives always have to bear them knowing when they marry that they must take their chance mr crawley might have been a bishop and mrs crawley when she married him perhaps thought it probable that such would be his fortune instead of that he was now just as he was approaching his fiftieth year a perpetual curate with an income of one hundred and thirty pounds per annumand a family that had been mrs crawleys luck in life and of course she bore it but she had also done much more than this she had striven hard to be contented or rather to appear to be contented when he had been most wretched and most moody she had struggled to conceal from him her own conviction as to his halfinsanity treating him at the same time with the respect due to an honoured father of a family and with the careful measured indulgence fit for a sick and wayward child in all the terrible troubles of their life her courage had been higher than his the metal of which she was made had been tempered to a steel which was very rare and fine but the rareness and fineness of which he had failed to appreciate he had often told her that she was without pride because she had stooped to receive from others on his behalf and on behalf of her children things which were very needful but which she could not buy he had told her that she was a beggar and that it was better to starve than to beg she had borne the rebuke without a word in reply and had then begged again for him and had endured the starvation herself nothing in their poverty had for years past been a shame to her but every accident of their poverty was still and ever had been a living disgrace to him  illustration mr and mrs crawley  they had had many children and three were still alive of the eldest grace crawley we shall hear much in the coming story she was at this time nineteen years old and there were those who said that in spite of her poverty her shabby outward apparel and a certain thin unfledged unrounded form of person a want of fulness in the lines of her figure she was the prettiest girl in that part of the world she was living now at a school in silverbridge where for the last year she had been a teacher and there were many in silverbridge who declared that very bright prospects were opening to herthat young major grantly of cosby lodge who though a widower with a young child was the cynosure of all female eyes in and round silverbridge had found beauty in her thin face and that grace crawleys fortune was made in the teeth as it were of the prevailing illfortune of her family bob crawley who was two years younger was now at marlbro school from whence it was intended that he should proceed to cambridge and be educated there at the expense of his godfather dean arabin in this also the world saw a stroke of good luck but then nothing was lucky to mr crawley bob indeed who had done very well at school might do well at cambridgemight do great things there but mr crawley would almost have preferred that the boy should work in the fields than that he should be educated in a manner so manifestly eleemosynary and then his clothes how was he to be provided with clothes fit either for school or for college but the dean and mrs crawley between them managed this leaving mr crawley very much in the dark as mrs crawley was in the habit of leaving him then there was a younger daughter jane still at home who passed her life between her mothers worktable and her fathers greek mending linen and learning to scan iambicsfor mr crawley in his early days had been a ripe scholar  and now there had come upon them all this terriblycrushing disaster that poor mr crawley had gradually got himself into a mess of debt at silverbridge from which he was quite unable to extricate himself was generally known by all the world both of silverbridge and hogglestock to a great many it was known that dean arabin had paid money for him very much contrary to his own consent and that he had quarrelled or attempted to quarrel with the dean in consequencehad so attempted although the money had in part passed through his own hands there had been one creditor fletcher the butcher of silverbridge who had of late been specially hard upon poor crawley this man who had not been without good nature in his dealings had heard stories of the deans goodwill and such like and had loudly expressed his opinion that the perpetual curate of hogglestock would show a higher pride in allowing himself to be indebted to a rich brother clergyman than in remaining under thrall to a butcher and thus a rumour had grown up and then the butcher had written repeated letters to the bishopto bishop proudie of barchester who had at first caused his chaplain to answer them and had told mr crawley somewhat roundly what was his opinion of a clergyman who eat meat and did not pay for it but nothing that the bishop could say or do enabled mr crawley to pay the butcher it was very grievous to such a man as mr crawley to receive these letters from such a man as bishop proudie but the letters came and made festering wounds but then there was an end of them and at last there had come forth from the butchers shop a threat that if the money were not paid by a certain date printed bills should be posted about the county all who heard of this in silverbridge were very angry with mr fletcher for no one there had ever known a tradesman to take such a step before but fletcher swore that he would persevere and defended himself by showing that six or seven months since in the spring of the year mr crawley had been paying money in silverbridge but had paid none to himto him who had been not only his earliest but his most enduring creditor he got money from the dean in march said mr fletcher to mr walker and he paid twelve pounds ten to green and seventeen pounds to grobury the baker it was that seventeen pounds to grobury the baker for flour which made the butcher so fixedly determined to smite the poor clergyman hip and thigh and he paid money to hall and to mrs holt and to a deal more but he never came near my shop if he had even shown himself i would not have said so much about it and then a day before the date named mrs crawley had come to silverbridge and had paid the butcher twenty pounds in four fivepound notes so far fletcher the butcher had been successful  some six weeks after this inquiry began to be made as to a certain cheque for twenty pounds drawn by lord lufton on his bankers in london which cheque had been lost early in the spring by mr soames lord luftons man of business in barsetshire together with a pocketbook in which it had been folded this pocketbook soames had believed himself to have left at mr crawleys house and had gone so far even at the time of the loss as to express his absolute conviction that he had so left it he was in the habit of paying a rentcharge to mr crawley on behalf of lord lufton amounting to twenty pounds four shillings every halfyear lord lufton held the large tithes of hogglestock and paid annually a sum of forty pounds eight shillings to the incumbent this amount was as a rule remitted punctually by mr soames through the post on the occasion now spoken of he had had some reason for visiting hogglestock and had paid the money personally to mr crawley of so much there was no doubt but he had paid it by a cheque drawn by himself on his own bankers at barchester and that cheque had been cashed in the ordinary way on the next morning on returning to his own house in barchester he had missed his pocketbook and had written to mr crawley to make inquiry there had been no money in it beyond the cheque drawn by lord lufton for twenty pounds mr crawley had answered this letter by another saying that no pocketbook had been found in his house all this had happened in march  in october mrs crawley paid the twenty pounds to fletcher the butcher and in november lord luftons cheque was traced back through the barchester bank to mr crawleys hands a brickmaker of hoggle end much favoured by mr crawley had asked for change over the counter of this barchester banknot as will be understood the bank on which the cheque was drawnand had received it the accommodation had been refused to the man at first but when he presented the cheque the second day bearing mr crawleys name on the back of it together with a note from mr crawley himself the money had been given for it and the identical notes so paid had been given to fletcher the butcher on the next day by mrs crawley when inquiry was made mr crawley stated that the cheque had been paid to him by mr soames on behalf of the rentcharge due to him by lord lufton but the error of this statement was at once made manifest there was the cheque signed by mr soames himself for the exact amounttwenty pounds four shillings as he himself declared he had never in his life paid money on behalf of lord lufton by a cheque drawn by his lordship the cheque given by lord lufton and which had been lost had been a private matter between them his lordship had simply wanted change in his pocket and his agent had given it to him mr crawley was speedily shown to be altogether wrong in the statement made to account for possession of the cheque  then he became very moody and would say nothing further but his wife who had known nothing of his first statement when made came forward and declared that she believed the cheque for twenty pounds to be a part of a present given by dean arabin to her husband in april last there had been she said great heartburnings about this gift and she had hardly dared to speak to her husband on the subject an execution had been threatened in the house by grobury the baker of which the dean had heard then there had been some scenes at the deanery between her husband and the dean and mrs arabin as to which she had subsequently heard much from mrs arabin mrs arabin had told her that money had been givenand at last taken indeed so much had been very apparent as bills had been paid to the amount of at least fifty pounds when the threat made by the butcher had reached her husbands ears the effect upon him had been very grievous all this was the story told by mrs crawley to mr walker the lawyer when he was pushing his inquiries she poor woman at any rate told all that she knew her husband had told her one morning when the butchers threat was weighing heavily on his mind speaking to her in such a humour that she found it impossible to crossquestion him that he had still money left though it was money which he had hoped that he would not be driven to use and he had given her the four fivepound notes and had told her to go to silverbridge and satisfy the man who was so eager for his money she had done so and had felt no doubt that the money so forthcoming had been given by the dean that was the story as told by mrs crawley  but how could she explain her husbands statement as to the cheque which had been shown to be altogether false all this passed between mr walker and mrs crawley and the lawyer was very gentle with her in the first stages of the inquiry he had simply desired to learn the truth and place the clergyman above suspicion latterly being bound as he was to follow the matter up officially he would not have seen mrs crawley had he been able to escape that ladys importunity mr walker she had said at last you do not know my husband no one knows him but i it is hard to have to tell you of all our troubles if i can lessen them trust me that i will do so said the lawyer no one i think can lessen them in this world said the lady the truth is sir that my husband often knows not what he says when he declared that the money had been paid to him by mr soames most certainly he thought so there are times when in his misery he knows not what he sayswhen he forgets everything  up to this period mr walker had not suspected mr crawley of anything dishonest nor did he suspect him as yet the poor man had probably received the money from the dean and had told the lie about it not choosing to own that he had taken money from his rich friend and thinking that there would be no further inquiry he had been very foolish and that would be the end of it mr soames was by no means so goodnatured in his belief how should my pocketbook have got into dean arabins hands said mr soames almost triumphantly and then i felt sure at the time that i had left it at crawleys house  mr walker wrote a letter to the dean who at that moment was in florence on his way to rome from whence he was going on to the holy land there came back a letter from mr arabin saying that on the 17th of march he had given to mr crawley a sum of fifty pounds and that the payment had been made with five bank of england notes of ten pounds each which had been handed by him to his friend in the library at the deanery the letter was very short and may perhaps be described as having been almost curt mr walker in his anxiety to do the best he could for mr crawley had simply asked a question as to the nature of the transaction between the two gentlemen saying that no doubt the deans answer would clear up a little mystery which existed at present respecting a cheque for twenty pounds the dean in answer simply stated the fact as it has been given above but he wrote to mr crawley begging to know what was in truth this new difficulty and offering any assistance in his power he explained all the circumstances of the money as he remembered them the sum advanced had certainly consisted of fifty pounds and there had certainly been five bank of england notes he had put the notes into an envelope which he had not closed but had addressed to mr crawley and had placed this envelope in his friends hands he went on to say that mrs arabin would have written but that she was in paris with her son mrs arabin was to remain in paris during his absence in the holy land and meet him in italy on his return as she was so much nearer at hand the dean expressed a hope that mrs crawley would apply to her if there was any trouble  the letter to mr walker was conclusive as to the deans money mr crawley had not received lord luftons cheque from the dean then whence had he received it the poor wife was left by the lawyer to obtain further information from her husband ah who can tell how terrible were the scenes between that poor pair of wretches as the wife endeavoured to learn the truth from her miserable halfmaddened husband that her husband had been honest throughout she had not any shadow of doubt she did not doubt that to her at least he endeavoured to tell the truth as far as his poor racked imperfect memory would allow him to remember what was true and what was not true the upshot of it all was that the husband declared that he still believed that the money had come to him from the dean he had kept it by him not wishing to use it if he could help it he had forgotten itso he said at timeshaving understood from arabin that he was to have fifty pounds and having received more if it had not come to him from the dean then it had been sent to him by the prince of evil for his utter undoing and there were times in which he seemed to think that such had been the manner in which the fatal cheque had reached him in all that he said he was terribly confused contradictory unintelligiblespeaking almost as a madman might speakending always by declaring that the cruelty of the world had been too much for him that the waters were meeting over his head and praying for gods mercy to remove him from the world it need hardly be said that his poor wife in these days had a burden on her shoulders that was more than enough to crush any woman  she at last acknowledged to mr walker that she could not account for the twenty pounds she herself would write again to the dean about it but she hardly hoped for any further assistance there the deans answer is very plain said mr walker he says that he gave mr crawley five tenpound notes and those five notes we have traced to mr crawleys hands then mrs crawley could say nothing further beyond making protestations of her husbands innocence     chapter ii  by heavens he had better not   i must ask the reader to make the acquaintance of major grantly of cosby lodge before he is introduced to the family of mr crawley at their parsonage in hogglestock it has been said that major grantly had thrown a favourable eye on grace crawleyby which report occasion was given to all men and women in those parts to hint that the crawleys with all their piety and humility were very cunning and that one of the grantlys wasto say the least of itvery soft admitted as it was throughout the county of barsetshire that there was no family therein more widely awake to the affairs generally of this world and the next combined than the family of which archdeacon grantly was the respected head and patriarch mrs walker the most goodnatured woman in silverbridge had acknowledged to her daughter that she could not understand itthat she could not see anything at all in grace crawley mr walker had shrugged his shoulders and expressed a confident belief that major grantly had not a shilling of his own beyond his halfpay and his late wifes fortune which was only six thousand pounds others who were illnatured had declared that grace crawley was little better than a beggar and that she could not possibly have acquired the manners of a gentlewoman fletcher the butcher had wondered whether the major would pay his future fatherinlaws debts and dr tempest the old rector of silverbridge whose four daughters were all as yet unmarried had turned up his old nose and had hinted that halfpay majors did not get caught in marriage so easily as that  such and such like had been the expressions of the opinion of men and women in silverbridge but the matter had been discussed further afield than at silverbridge and had been allowed to intrude itself as a most unwelcome subject into the family conclave of the archdeacons rectory to those who have not as yet learned the fact from the public character and wellappreciated reputation of the man let it be known that archdeacon grantly was at this time as he had been for many years previously archdeacon of barchester and rector of plumstead episcopi a rich and prosperous man he had ever beenthough he also had had his sore troubles as we all havehis having arisen chiefly from want of that higher ecclesiastical promotion which his soul had coveted and for which the whole tenour of his life had especially fitted him now in his green old age he had ceased to covet but had not ceased to repine he had ceased to covet aught for himself but still coveted much for his children and for him such a marriage as this which was now suggested for his son was encompassed almost with the bitterness of death i think it would kill me he had said to his wife by heavens i think it would be my death  a daughter of the archdeacon had made a splendid matrimonial allianceso splendid that its history was at the time known to all the aristocracy of the county and had not been altogether forgotten by any of those who keep themselves well instructed in the details of the peerage griselda grantly had married lord dumbello the eldest son of the marquis of hartletopthan whom no english nobleman was more puissant if broad acres many castles high title and stars and ribbons are any signs of puissanceand she was now herself marchioness of hartletop with a little lord dumbello of her own the daughters visits to the parsonage of her father were of necessity rare such necessity having come from her own altered sphere of life a marchioness of hartletop has special duties which will hardly permit her to devote herself frequently to the humdrum society of a clerical father and mother that it would be so father and mother had understood when they sent the fortunate girl forth to a higher world but now and again since her august marriage she had laid her coroneted head upon one of the old rectory pillows for a night or so and on such occasions all the plumsteadians had been loud in praise of her condescension now it happened that when this second and more aggravated blast of the evil wind reached the rectorythe renewed waft of the tidings as to major grantlys infatuation regarding miss grace crawley which on its renewal seemed to bring with it something of confirmationit chanced i say that at that moment griselda marchioness of hartletop was gracing the paternal mansion it need hardly be said that the father was not slow to invoke such a daughters counsel and such a sisters aid  i am not quite sure that the mother would have been equally quick to ask her daughters advice had she been left in the matter entirely to her own propensities mrs grantly had ever loved her daughter dearly and had been very proud of that great success in life which griselda had achieved but in late years the child had become as a woman separate from the mother and there had arisen not unnaturally a break of that close confidence which in early years had existed between them griselda marchioness of hartletop was more than ever a daughter to the archdeacon even though he might never see her nothing could rob him of the honour of such a progenynothing even though there had been actual estrangement between them but it was not so with mrs grantly griselda had done very well and mrs grantly had rejoiced but she had lost her child now the major who had done well also though in a much lesser degree was still her child moving in the same sphere of life with her still dependent in a great degree upon his fathers bounty a neighbour in the county a frequent visitor at the parsonage and a visitor who could be received without any of that trouble which attended the unfrequent comings of griselda the marchioness to the home of her youth and for this reason mrs grantly terribly put out as she was at the idea of a marriage between her son and one standing so poorly in the worlds esteem as grace crawley would not have brought forward the matter before her daughter had she been left to her own desires a marchioness in ones family is a tower of strength no doubt but there are counsellors so strong that we do not wish to trust them lest in the trusting we ourselves be overwhelmed by their strength now mrs grantly was by no means willing to throw her influence into the hands of her titled daughter  but the titled daughter was consulted and gave her advice on the occasion of the present visit to plumstead she had consented to lay her head for two nights on the parsonage pillows and on the second evening her brother the major was to come over from cosby lodge to meet her before his coming the affair of grace crawley was discussed  it would break my heart griselda said the archdeacon piteouslyand your mothers  there is nothing against the girls character said mrs grantly and the father and mother are gentlefolks by birth but such a marriage for henry would be very unseemly  to make it worse there is this terrible story about him said the archdeacon  i dont suppose there is much in that said mrs grantly  i cant say there is no knowing they told me today in barchester that soames is pressing the case against him  who is soames papa asked the marchioness  he is lord luftons man of business my dear  oh lord luftons man of business there was something of a sneer in the tone of the ladys voice as she mentioned lord luftons name  i am told continued the archdeacon that soames declares the cheque was taken from a pocketbook which he left by accident in crawleys house  you dont mean to say archdeacon that you think that mr crawleya clergymanstole it said mrs grantly  i dont say anything of the kind my dear but supposing mr crawley to be as honest as the sun you wouldnt wish henry to marry his daughter  certainly not said the mother it would be an unfitting marriage the poor girl has had no advantages  he is not able even to pay his bakers bill i always thought arabin was very wrong to place such a man in such a parish as hogglestock of course the family could not live there the arabin here spoken of was dr arabin dean of barchester the dean and the archdeacon had married sisters and there was much intimacy between the families  after all it is only a rumour as yet said mrs grantly  fothergill told me only yesterday that he sees her almost every day said the father what are we to do griselda you know how headstrong henry is the marchioness sat quite still looking at the fire and made no immediate answer to this address  there is nothing for it but that you should tell him what you think said the mother  if his sister were to speak to him it might do much said the archdeacon to this mrs grantly said nothing but mrs grantlys daughter understood very well that her mothers confidence in her was not equal to her fathers lady hartletop said nothing but still sat with impassive face and eyes fixed upon the fire i think that if you were to speak to him griselda and tell him that he would disgrace his family he would be ashamed to go on with such a marriage said the father he would feel connected as he is with lord hartletop  i dont think he would feel anything about that said mrs grantly  i dare say not said lady hartletop  i am sure he ought to feel it said the father they were all silent and sat looking at the fire  i suppose papa you allow henry an income said lady hartletop after a while  indeed i doeight hundred a year  then i think i should tell him that that must depend upon his conduct mamma if you wont mind ringing the bell i will send for cecile and go upstairs and dress then the marchioness went upstairs to dress and in about an hour the major arrived in his dogcart he also was allowed to go upstairs to dress before anything was said to him about his great offence  griselda is right said the archdeacon speaking to his wife out of his dressingroom she always was right i never knew a young woman with more sense than griselda  but you do not mean to say that in any event you would stop henrys income mrs grantly also was dressing and made reply out of her bedroom  upon my word i dont know as a father i would do anything to prevent such a marriage as that  but if he did marry her in spite of the threat and he would if he had once said so  is a fathers word then to go for nothing and a father who allows his son eight hundred a year if he told the girl that he would be ruined she couldnt hold him to it  my dear theyd know as well as i do that you would give way after three months  but why should i give way good heavens  of course youd give way and of course we should have the young woman here and of course we should make the best of it  the idea of having grace crawley as a daughter at the plumstead rectory was too much for the archdeacon and he resented it by additional vehemence in the tone of his voice and a nearer personal approach to the wife of his bosom all unaccoutred as he was he stood in the doorway between the two rooms and thence fulminated at his wife his assurances that he would never allow himself to be immersed in such a depth of humility as that she had suggested i can tell you this then that if ever she comes here i shall take care to be away i will never receive her here you can do as you please  that is just what i cannot do if i could do as i pleased i would put a stop to it at once  it seems to me that you want to encourage him a child about sixteen years of age  i am told she is nineteen  what does it matter if she was fiftynine think of what her bringing up has been think what it would be to have all the crawleys in our house for ever and all their debts and all their disgrace  i do not know that they have ever been disgraced  youll see the whole county has heard of the affair of this twenty pounds look at that dear girl upstairs who has been such a comfort to us do you think it would be fit that she and her husband should meet such a one as grace crawley at our table  i dont think it would do them a bit of harm said mrs grantly but there would be no chance of that seeing that griseldas husband never comes to us  he was here the year before last  and i never was so tired of a man in all my life  then you prefer the crawleys i suppose this is what you get from eleanors teaching eleanor was the deans wife and mrs grantlys younger sister it has always been a sorrow to me that i ever brought arabin into the diocese  i never asked you to bring him archdeacon but nobody was so glad as you when he proposed to eleanor  well the long and the short of it is this i shall tell henry tonight that if he makes a fool of himself with this girl he must not look to me any longer for an income he has about six hundred a year of his own and if he chooses to throw himself away he had better go and live in the south of france or in canada or where he pleases he shant come here  i hope he wont marry the girl with all my heart said mrs grantly  he had better not by heavens he had better not  but if he does youll be the first to forgive him  on hearing this the archdeacon slammed the door and retired to his washing apparatus at the present moment he was very angry with his wife but then he was so accustomed to such anger and was so well aware that it in truth meant nothing that it did not make him unhappy the archdeacon and mrs grantly had now been man and wife for more than a quarter of a century and had never in truth quarrelled he had the most profound respect for her judgment and the most implicit reliance on her conduct she had never yet offended him or caused him to repent the hour in which he had made her mrs grantly but she had come to understand that she might use a womans privilege with her tongue and she used itnot altogether to his comfort on the present occasion he was the more annoyed because he felt that she might be right it would be a positive disgrace and i never would see him again he said to himself and yet as he said it he knew that he would not have the strength of character to carry him through a prolonged quarrel with his son i never would see hernever never he said to himself and then such an opening as he might have at his sisters house  major grantly had been a successful man in lifewith the one exception of having lost the mother of his child within a twelvemonth of his marriage and within a few hours of that childs birth he had served in india as a very young man and had been decorated with the victoria cross then he had married a lady with some money and had left the active service of the army with the concurring advice of his own family and that of his wife he had taken a small place in his fathers county but the wife for whose comfort he had taken it had died before she was permitted to see it nevertheless he had gone to reside there hunting a good deal and farming a little making himself popular in the district and keeping up the good name of grantly in a successful way tillalasit had seemed good to him to throw those favouring eyes on poor grace crawley his wife had now been dead just two years and as he was still under thirty no one could deny it would be right that he should marry again no one did deny it his father had hinted that he ought to do so and had generously whispered that if some little increase to the majors present income were needed he might possibly be able to do something what is the good of keeping it the archdeacon had said in liberal afterdinner warmth i only want it for your brother and yourself the brother was a clergyman  and the majors mother had strongly advised him to marry again without loss of time my dear henry she had said youll never be younger and youth does go for something as for dear little edith being a girl she is almost no impediment do you know those two girls at chaldicotes  what mrs thornes nieces  no they are not her nieces but her cousins emily dunstable is very handsomeand as for money  but what about birth mother  one cant have everything my dear  as far as i am concerned i should like to have everything or nothing the major had said laughing now for him to think of grace crawley after thatof grace crawley who had no money and no particular birth and not even beauty itselfso at least mrs grantly saidwho had not even enjoyed the ordinary education of a lady was too bad nothing had been wanting to emily dunstables education and it was calculated that she would have at least twenty thousand pounds on the day of her marriage  the disappointment to the mother would be the more sore because she had gone to work upon her little scheme with reference to miss emily dunstable and had at first as she thought seen her way to successto success in spite of the disparaging words which her son had spoken to her mrs thornes house at chaldicotesor dr thornes house as it should perhaps be more properly called for dr thorne was the husband of mrs thornewas in these days the pleasantest house in barsetshire no one saw so much company as the thornes or spent so much money in so pleasant a way the great county families the pallisers and the de courcys the luftons and the greshams were no doubt grander and some of them were perhaps richer than the chaldicote thornesas they were called to distinguish them from the thornes of ullathorne but none of these people were so pleasant in their ways so free in their hospitality or so easy in their modes of living as the doctor and his wife when first chaldicotes a very old country seat had by the chances of war fallen into their hands and been newly furnished and newly decorated and newly gardened and newly greenhoused and hotwatered by them many of the county people had turned up their noses at them dear old lady lufton had done so and had been greatly grievedsaying nothing however of her grief when her son and daughterinlaw had broken away from her and submitted themselves to the blandishments of the doctors wife and the grantlys had stood aloof partly influenced no doubt by their dear and intimate old friend miss monica thorne of ullathorne a lady of the very old school who though good as gold and kind as charity could not endure that an interloping mrs thorne who never had a grandfather should come to honour and glory in the county simply because of her riches miss monica thorne stood out but mrs grantly gave way and having once given way found that dr thorne and mrs thorne and emily dunstable and chaldicote house together were very charming and the major had been once there with her and had made himself very pleasant and there had certainly been some little passage of incipient love between him and miss dunstable as to which mrs thorne who managed everything seemed to be well pleased this had been after the first mention made by mrs grantly to her son of emily dunstables name but before she had heard any faintest whispers of his fancy for grace crawley and she had therefore been justified in hopingalmost in expecting that emily dunstable would be her daughterinlaw and was therefore the more aggrieved when this terrible crawley peril first opened itself before her eyes     chapter iii  the archdeacons threat   the dinnerparty at the rectory comprised none but the grantly family the marchioness had written to say that she preferred to have it so the father had suggested that the thornes of ullathorne very old friends might be asked and the greshams from boxall hill and had even promised to endeavour to get old lady lufton over to the rectory lady lufton having in former years been griseldas warm friend but lady hartletop had preferred to see her dear father and mother in privacy her brother henry she would be glad to meet and hoped to make some arrangement with him for a short visit to hartlebury her husbands place in shropshireas to which latter hint it may however be at once said that nothing further was spoken after the crawley alliance had been suggested and there had been a very sore point mooted by the daughter in a request made by her to her father that she might not be called upon to meet her grandfather her mothers father mr harding a clergyman of barchester who was now stricken in yearspapa would not have come said mrs grantly but i thinki do think then she stopped herself  your father has odd ways sometimes my dear you know how fond i am of having him here myself  it does not signify said mrs grantly do not let us say anything more about it of course we cannot have everything i am told the child does her duty in her sphere of life and i suppose we ought to be contented then mrs grantly went up to her own room and there she cried nothing was said to the major on the unpleasant subject of the crawleys before dinner he met his sister in the drawingroom and was allowed to kiss her noble cheek i hope edith is well henry said the sister quite well and little dumbello is the same i hope thank you yes quite well then there seemed to be nothing more to be said between the two the major never made inquiries after the august family or would allow it to appear that he was conscious of being shone upon by the wife of a marquis any adulation which griselda received of that kind came from her father and therefore unconsciously she had learned to think that her father was better bred than the other members of her family and more fitted by nature to move in that sacred circle to which she herself had been exalted we need not dwell upon the dinner which was but a dull affair mrs grantly strove to carry on the family party exactly as it would have been carried on had her daughter married the son of some neighbouring squire but she herself was conscious of the struggle and the fact of there being a struggle produced failure the rectors servants treated the daughter of the house with special awe and the marchioness herself moved and spoke and ate and drank with a cold magnificence which i think had become a second nature with her but which was not on that account the less oppressive even the archdeacon who enjoyed something in that which was so disagreeable to his wife felt a relief when he was left alone after dinner with his son he felt relieved as his son got up to open the door for his mother and sister but was aware at the same time that he had before him a most difficult and possibly a most disastrous task his dear son henry was not a man to be talked smoothly out of or into any propriety he had a will of his own and having hitherto been a successful man who in youth had fallen into few youthful troubleswho had never justified his father in using stern parental authoritywas not now inclined to bend his neck henry said the archdeacon what are you drinking thats 34 port but its not just what it should be shall i send for another bottle  it will do for me sir i shall only take a glass  i shall drink two or three glasses of claret but you young fellows have become so desperately temperate  we take our wine at dinner sir  bytheby how well griselda is looking  yes she is its always easy for women to look well when theyre rich how would grace crawley look then who was poor as poverty itself and who should remain poor if his son was fool enough to marry her that was the train of thought which ran through the archdeacons mind i do not think much of riches said he but it is always well that a gentlemans wife or a gentlemans daughter should have a sufficiency to maintain her position in life  you may say the same sir of everybodys wife and everybodys daughter  you know what i mean henry  i am not quite sure that i do sir  perhaps i had better speak out at once a rumour has reached your mother and me which we dont believe for a moment but which nevertheless makes us unhappy even as a report they say that there is a young woman living in silverbridge to whom you are becoming attached  is there any reason why i should not become attached to a young woman in silverbridgethough i hope any young woman to whom i may become attached will be worthy at any rate of being called a young lady  i hope so henry i hope so i do hope so  so much i will promise sir but i will promise nothing more  the archdeacon looked across into his sons face and his heart sank within him his sons voice and his sons eyes seemed to tell him two things they seemed to tell him firstly that the rumour about grace crawley was true and secondly that the major was resolved not to be talked out of his folly but you are not engaged to any one are you said the archdeacon the son did not at first make any answer and then the father repeated the question considering our mutual positions henry i think you ought to tell me if you are engaged  i am not engaged had i become so i should have taken the first opportunity of telling either you or my mother  thank god now my dear boy i can speak out more plainly the young woman whose name i have heard is daughter to that mr crawley who is perpetual curate at hogglestock i knew that there could be nothing in it  but there is something in it sir  what is there in it do not keep me in suspense henry what is it you mean  it is rather hard to be crossquestioned in this way on such a subject when you express yourself as thankful that there is nothing in the rumour i am forced to stop you as otherwise it is possible that hereafter you may say that i have deceived you  but you dont mean to marry her  i certainly do not mean to pledge myself not to do so  do you mean to tell me henry that you are in love with miss crawley then there was another pause during which the archdeacon sat looking for an answer but the major said never a word am i to suppose that you intend to lower yourself by marrying a young woman who cannot possibly have enjoyed any of the advantages of a ladys education i say nothing of the imprudence of the thing nothing of her own want of fortune nothing of your having to maintain a whole family steeped in poverty nothing of the debts and character of the father upon whom as i understand at this moment there rests a very grave suspicion ofofofwhat im afraid i must call downright theft  downright theft certainly if he were guilty  i say nothing of all that but looking at the young woman herself  she is simply the best educated girl whom it has ever been my lot to meet  henry i have a right to expect that you will be honest with me  i am honest with you  do you mean to ask this girl to marry you  i do not think that you have any right to ask me that question sir  i have a right at any rate to tell you this that if you so far disgrace yourself and me i shall consider myself bound to withdraw from you all the sanction which would be conveyed by mymymy continued assistance  do you intend me to understand that you will stop my income  certainly i should  then sir i think you would behave to me most cruelly you advised me to give up my profession  not in order that you might marry grace crawley  i claim the privilege of a man of my age to do as i please in such a matter as marriage miss crawley is a lady her father is a clergyman as is mine her fathers oldest friend is my uncle there is nothing on earth against her except her poverty i do not think i ever heard of such cruelty on a fathers part  very well henry  i have endeavoured to do my duty by you sir always and by my mother you can treat me in this way if you please but it will not have any effect on my conduct you can stop my allowance tomorrow if you like it i had not as yet made up my mind to make an offer to miss crawley but i shall now do so tomorrow morning  this was very bad indeed and the archdeacon was extremely unhappy he was by no means at heart a cruel man he loved his children dearly if this disagreeable marriage were to take place he would doubtless do exactly as his wife had predicted he would not stop his sons income for a single quarter and though he went on telling himself that he would stop it he knew in his own heart that any such severity was beyond his power he was a generous man in money mattershaving a dislike for poverty which was not generousand for his own sake could not have endured to see a son of his in want but he was terribly anxious to exercise the power which the use of the threat might give him henry he said you are treating me badly very badly my anxiety has always been for the welfare of my children do you think that miss crawley would be a fitting sisterinlaw for that dear girl upstairs  certainly i do or for any other dear girl in the world excepting that griselda who is not clever would hardly be able to appreciate miss crawley who is clever  griselda not clever good heavens then there was another pause and as the major said nothing the father continued his entreaties pray pray think of what my wishes are and your mothers you are not committed as yet pray think of us while there is time i would rather double your income if i saw you marry any one that we could name here  i have enough as it is if i may only be allowed to know that it will not be capriciously withdrawn the archdeacon filled his glass unconsciously and sipped his wine while he thought what further he might say perhaps it might be better that he should say nothing further at the present moment the major however was indiscreet and pushed the question may i understand sir that your threat is withdrawn and that my income is secure  what if you marry this girl  yes sir will my income be continued to me if i marry miss crawley  no it will not then the father got up hastily pushed the decanter back angrily from his hand and without saying another word walked away into the drawingroom that evening at the rectory was very gloomy the archdeacon now and again said a word or two to his daughter and his daughter answered him in monosyllables the major sat apart moodily and spoke to no one mrs grantly understanding well what had passed knew that nothing could be done at the present moment to restore family comfort so she sat by the fire and knitted exactly at ten they all went to bed  dear henry said the mother to her son the next morning think much of yourself and of your child and of us before you take any great step in life  i will mother said he then he went out and put on his wrapper and got into his dogcart and drove himself off to silverbridge he had not spoken to his father since they were in the diningroom on the previous evening when he started the marchioness had not yet come downstairs but at eleven she breakfasted and at twelve she also was taken away poor mrs grantly had not had much comfort from her childrens visits     chapter iv  the clergymans house at hogglestock   illustration  mrs crawley had walked from hogglestock to silverbridge on the occasion of her visit to mr walker the attorney and had been kindly sent back by that gentleman in his wifes little open carriage the tidings she brought home with her to her husband were very grievous the magistrates would sit on the next thursdayit was then fridayand mr crawley had better appear before them to answer the charge made by mr soames he would be served with a summons which he could obey of his own accord there had been many points very closely discussed between walker and mrs crawley as to which there had been great difficulty in the choice of words which should be tender enough in regard to the feelings of the poor lady and yet strong enough to convey to her the very facts as they stood would mr crawley come or must a policeman be sent to fetch him the magistrates had already issued a warrant for his apprehension such in truth was the fact but they had agreed with mr walker that as there was no reasonable ground for anticipating any attempt at escape on the part of the reverend gentleman the lawyer might use what gentle means he could for ensuring the clergymans attendance could mrs crawley undertake to say that he would appear mrs crawley did undertake either that her husband should appear on the thursday or else that she would send over in the early part of the week and declare her inability to ensure his appearance in that case it was understood the policeman must come then mr walker had suggested that mr crawley had better employ a lawyer upon this mrs crawley had looked beseechingly up into mr walkers face and had asked him to undertake the duty he was of course obliged to explain that he was already employed on the other side mr soames had secured his services and though he was willing to do all in his power to mitigate the sufferings of the family he could not abandon the duty he had undertaken he named another attorney however and then sent the poor woman home in his wifes carriage i fear that unfortunate man is guilty i fear he is mr walker had said to his wife within ten minutes of the departure of the visitor  mrs crawley would not allow herself to be driven up to the garden gate before her own house but had left the carriage some three hundred yards off down the road and from thence she walked home it was now quite dark it was nearly six in the evening on a wet december night and although cloaks and shawls had been supplied to her she was wet and cold when she reached her home but at such a moment anxious as she was to prevent the additional evil which would come to them all from illness to herself she could not pass through to her room till she had spoken to her husband he was sitting in the one sittingroom on the left side of the passage as the house was entered and with him was their daughter jane a girl now nearly sixteen years of age there was no light in the room and hardly more than a spark of fire showed itself in the grate the father was sitting on one side of the hearth in an old armchair and there he had sat for the last hour without speaking his daughter had been in and out of the room and had endeavoured to gain his attention now and again by a word but he had never answered her and had not even noticed her presence at the moment when mrs crawleys step was heard upon the gravel which led to the door jane was kneeling before the fire with a hand upon her fathers arm she had tried to get her hand into his but he had either been unaware of the attempt or had rejected it  here is mamma at last said jane rising to her feet as her mother entered the house  are you all in the dark said mrs crawley striving to speak in a voice that should not be sorrowful  yes mamma we are in the dark papa is here oh mamma how wet you are  yes dear it is raining get a light out of the kitchen jane and i will go upstairs in two minutes then when jane was gone the wife made her way in the dark over to her husbands side and spoke a word to him josiah she said will you not speak to me  what should i speak about where have you been  i have been to silverbridge i have been to mr walker he at any rate is very kind  i dont want his kindness i want no mans kindness mr walker is the attorney i believe kind indeed  i mean considerate josiah let us do the best we can in this trouble we have had others as heavy before  but none to crush me as this will crush me well what am i to do am i to go to prisontonight at this moment his daughter returned with a candle and the mother could not make her answer at once it was a wretched povertystricken room by degrees the carpet had disappeared which had been laid down some nine or ten years since when they had first come to hogglestock and which even then had not been new now nothing but a poor fragment of it remained in front of the fireplace in the middle of the room there was a table which had once been large but one flap of it was gone altogether and the other flap sloped grievously towards the floor the weakness of old age having fallen into its legs there were two or three smaller tables about but they stood propped against walls thence obtaining a security which their own strength would not give them at the further end of the room there was an ancient piece of furniture which was always called papas secretary at which mr crawley customarily sat and wrote his sermons and did all work that was done by him within his house the man who had made it some time in the last century had intended it to be a locked guardian for domestic documents and the receptacle for all that was most private in the house of some paterfamilias but beneath the hands of mr crawley it always stood open and with the exception of the small space at which he wrote was covered with dogseared books from nearly all of which the covers had disappeared there were there two odd volumes of euripides a greek testament an odyssey a duodecimo pindar and a miniature anacreon there was half a horacethe two first books of the odes at the beginning and the de arte poetica at the end having disappeared there was a little bit of a volume of cicero and there were cæsars commentaries in two volumes so stoutly bound that they had defied the combined illusage of time and the crawley family all these were piled upon the secretary with many othersodd volumes of sermons and the like but the greek and latin lay at the top and showed signs of most frequent use there was one armchair in the rooma windsorchair as such used to be called made soft by an old cushion in the back in which mr crawley sat when both he and his wife were in the room and mrs crawley when he was absent and there was an old horsehair sofanow almost denuded of its horsehairbut that like the tables required the assistance of a friendly wall then there was half a dozen of other chairsall of different sortsand they completed the furniture of the room it was not such a room as one would wish to see inhabited by a beneficed clergyman of the church of england but they who know what money will do and what it will not will understand how easily a man with a family and with a hundred and thirty pounds a year may be brought to the need of inhabiting such a chamber when it is remembered that three pounds of meat a day at ninepence a pound will cost over forty pounds a year there need be no difficulty in understanding that it may be so bread for such a family must cost at least twentyfive pounds clothes for five persons of whom one must at any rate wear the raiment of a gentleman can hardly be found for less than ten pounds a year a head then there remains fifteen pounds for tea sugar beer wages education amusements and the like in such circumstances a gentleman can hardly pay much for the renewal of his furniture  mrs crawley could not answer her husbands question before her daughter and was therefore obliged to make another excuse for again sending her out of the room jane dear she said bring my things down to the kitchen and i will change them by the fire i will be there in two minutes when i have had a word with your papa the girl went immediately and then mrs crawley answered her husbands question no my dear there is no question of your going to prison  but there will be  i have undertaken that you shall attend before the magistrates at silverbridge on thursday next at twelve oclock you will do that  do it you mean i suppose to say that i must go there is anybody to come and fetch me  nobody will come only you must promise that you will be there i have promised for you you will go will you not she stood leaning over him half embracing him waiting for an answer but for a while he gave none you will tell me that you will do what i have undertaken for you josiah  i think i would rather that they fetched me i think that i will not go myself  and have policemen come for you into the parish mr walker has promised that he will send over his phaeton he sent me home in it today  i want nobodys phaeton if i go i will walk if it were ten times the distance and though i had not a shoe left to my feet i would walk if i go there at all of my own accord i will walk there  but you will go  what do i care for the parish what matters it who sees me now i cannot be degraded worse than i am everybody knows it  there is no disgrace without guilt said his wife  everybody thinks me guilty i see it in their eyes the children know of it and i hear their whispers in the school mr crawley has taken some money i heard the girl say it myself  what matters what the girl says  and yet you would have me go in a fine carriage to silverbridge as though to a wedding if i am wanted there let them take me as they would another i shall be here for themunless i am dead  at this moment jane reappeared pressing her mother to take off her wet clothes and mrs crawley went with her daughter to the kitchen the one redarmed young girl who was their only servant was sent away and then the mother and child discussed how best they might prevail with the head of the family but mamma it must come right must it not  i trust it will i think it will but i cannot see my way as yet  papa cannot have done anything wrong  no my dear he has done nothing wrong he has made great mistakes and it is hard to make people understand that he has not intentionally spoken untruths he is ever thinking of other things about the school and his sermons and he does not remember  and about how poor we are mamma  he has much to occupy his mind and he forgets things which dwell in the memory with other people he said that he had got this money from mr soames and of course he thought that it was so  and where did he get it mamma  ahi wish i knew i should have said that i had seen every shilling that came into the house but i know nothing of this chequewhence it came  but will not papa tell you  he would tell me if he knew he thinks it came from the dean  and are you sure it did not  yes quite sure as sure as i can be of anything the dean told me he would give him fifty pounds and the fifty pounds came i had them in my own hands and he has written to say that it was so  but couldnt this be part of the fifty pounds  no dear no  then where did papa get it perhaps he picked it up and has forgotten  to this mrs crawley made no reply the idea that the cheque had been found by her husbandhad been picked up as jane had saidhad occurred also to janes mother mr soames was confident that he had dropped the pocketbook at the parsonage mrs crawley had always disliked mr soames thinking him to be hard cruel and vulgar she would not have hesitated to believe him guilty of a falsehood or even of direct dishonesty if by so believing she could in her own mind have found the means of reconciling her husbands possession of the cheque with absolute truth on his part but she could not do so even though soames had with devilish premeditated malice slipped the cheque into her husbands pocket his having done so would not account for her husbands having used the cheque when he found it there she was driven to make excuses for him which valid as they might be with herself could not be valid with others he had said that mr soames had paid the cheque to him that was clearly a mistake he had said that the cheque had been given to him by the dean that was clearly another mistake she knew or thought she knew that he being such as he was might make such blunders as these and yet be true she believed that such statements might be blunders and not falsehoodsso convinced was she that her husbands mind would not act at all times as do the minds of other men but having such a conviction she was driven to believe also that almost anything might be possible soames may have been right or he might have dropped not the book but the cheque she had no difficulty in presuming soames to be wrong in any detail if by so supposing she could make the exculpation of her husband easier to herself if villany on the part of soames was needful to her theory soames would become to her a villain at onceof the blackest dye might it not be possible that the cheque having thus fallen into her husbands hands he had come after a while to think that it had been sent to him by his friend the dean and if it were so would it be possible to make others so believe that there was some mistake which would be easily explained were her husbands mind lucid at all points but which she could not explain because of the darkness of his mind she was thoroughly convinced but were she herself to put forward such a defence on her husbands part she would in doing so be driven to say that he was a lunaticthat he was incapable of managing the affairs of himself or his family it seemed to her that she would be compelled to have him proved to be either a thief or a madman and yet she knew that he was neither that he was not a thief was as clear to her as the sun at noonday could she have lain on the mans bosom for twenty years and not yet have learned the secrets of the heart beneath the whole mind of the man was as she told herself within her grasp he might have taken the twenty pounds he might have taken it and spent it though it was not his own but yet he was no thief nor was he a madman no man more sane in preaching the gospel of his lord in making intelligible to the ignorant the promises of his saviour ever got into a parish pulpit or taught in a parish school the intellect of the man was as clear as running water in all things not appertaining to his daily life and its difficulties he could be logical with a vengeanceso logical as to cause infinite trouble to his wife who with all her good sense was not logical and he had greek at his fingers endsas his daughter knew very well and even to this day he would sometimes recite to them english poetry lines after lines stanzas upon stanzas in a sweet low melancholy voice on long winter evenings when occasionally the burden of his troubles would be lighter to him than was usual books in latin and in french he read with as much ease as in english and took delight in such as came to him when he would condescend to accept such loans from the deanery and there was at times a lightness of heart about the man in the course of the last winter he had translated into greek irregular verse the very noble ballad of lord bateman maintaining the rhythm and the rhyme and had repeated it with uncouth glee till his daughter knew it all by heart and when there had come to him a fivepound note from some admiring magazine editor as the price of the samestill through the deans handshe had brightened up his heart and had thought for an hour or two that even yet the world would smile upon him his wife knew well that he was not mad but yet she knew that there were dark moments with him in which his mind was so much astray that he could not justly be called to account as to what he might remember and what he might forget how would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and jury so that they might neither say that he was dishonest nor yet that he was mad perhaps he picked it up and had forgotten her daughter said to her perhaps it was so but she might not as yet admit as much even to her child  it is a mystery dear as yet which with gods aid will be unravelled of one thing we at least may be sure that your papa has not wilfully done anything wrong  of course we are sure of that mamma  mrs crawley had many troubles during the next four or five days of which the worst perhaps had reference to the services of the sunday which intervened between the day of her visit to silverbridge and the sitting of the magistrates on the saturday it was necessary that he should prepare his sermons of which he preached two on every sunday though his congregation consisted only of farmers brickmakers and agricultural labourers who would willingly have dispensed with the second mrs crawley proposed to send over to mr robarts a neighbouring clergyman for the loan of a curate mr robarts was a warm friend to the crawleys and in such an emergency would probably have come himself but mr crawley would not hear of it the discussion took place early on the saturday morning before it was as yet daylight for the poor woman was thinking day and night of her husbands troubles and it had this good effect that immediately after breakfast he seated himself at his desk and worked at his task as though he had forgotten all else in the world  and on the sunday morning he went into his school before the hour of the church service as had been his wont and taught there as though everything with him was as usual some of the children were absent having heard of their teachers tribulation and having been told probably that he would remit his work and for these absent ones he sent in great anger the poor bairns came creeping in for he was a man who by his manners had been able to secure their obedience in spite of his poverty and he preached to the people of his parish on that sunday as he had always preached eagerly clearly with an eloquence fitted for the hearts of such an audience no one would have guessed from his tones and gestures and appearance on that occasion that there was aught wrong with himunless there had been there some observer keen enough to perceive that the greater care which he used and the special eagerness of his words denoted a special frame of mind  after that after those church services were over he sank again and never roused himself till the dreaded day had come     chapter v  what the world thought about it   opinion in silverbridge at barchester and throughout the county was very much divided as to the guilt or innocence of mr crawley up to the time of mrs crawleys visit to silverbridge the affair had not been much discussed to give mr soames his due he had been by no means anxious to press the matter against the clergyman but he had been forced to go on with it while the first cheque was missing lord lufton had sent him a second cheque for the money and the loss had thus fallen upon his lordship the cheque had of course been traced and inquiry had of course been made as to mr crawleys possession of it when that gentleman declared that he had received it from mr soames mr soames had been forced to contradict and to resent such an assertion when mr crawley had afterwards said that the money had come to him from the dean and when the dean had shown that this also was untrue mr soames confident as he was that he had dropped the pocketbook at mr crawleys house could not but continue the investigation he had done so with as much silence as the nature of the work admitted but by the day of the magistrates meeting at silverbridge the subject had become common through the county and mens minds were very much divided  all hogglestock believed their parson to be innocent but then all hogglestock believed him to be mad at silverbridge the tradesmen with whom he had dealt and to whom he had owed and still owed money all declared him to be innocent they knew something of the man personally and could not believe him to be a thief all the ladies in silverbridge too were sure of his innocence it was to them impossible that such a man should have stolen twenty pounds my dear said the eldest miss prettyman to poor grace crawley in england where the laws are good no gentleman is ever made out to be guilty when he is innocent and your papa of course is innocent therefore you should not trouble yourself it will break papas heart grace had said and she did trouble herself but the gentlemen in silverbridge were made of sterner stuff and believed the man to be guilty clergyman and gentleman though he was mr walker who among the lights in silverbridge was the leading light would not speak a word upon the subject to anybody and then everybody who was anybody knew that mr walker was convinced of the mans guilt had mr walker believed him to be innocent his tongue would have been ready enough john walker who was in the habit of laughing at his fathers good nature had no doubt upon the subject mr winthrop mr walkers partner shook his head people did not think much of mr winthrop excepting certain unmarried ladies for mr winthrop was a bachelor and had plenty of money people did not think much of mr winthrop but still on this subject he might know something and when he shook his head he manifestly intended to indicate guilt and dr tempest the rector of silverbridge did not hesitate to declare his belief in the guilt of the incumbent of hogglestock no man reverences a clergyman as a clergyman so slightly as a brother clergyman to dr tempest it appeared to be neither very strange nor very terrible that mr crawley should have stolen twenty pounds what is a man to do he said when he sees his children starving he should not have married on such a preferment as that mr crawley had married however long before he got the living of hogglestock  there were two lady luftonsmotherinlaw and daughterinlawwho at this time were living together at framley hall lord luftons seat in the county of barset and they were both thoroughly convinced of mr crawleys innocence the elder lady had lived much among clergymen and could hardly i think by any means have been brought to believe in the guilt of any man who had taken upon himself the orders of the church of england she had also known mr crawley personally for some years and was one of those who could not admit to herself that any one was vile who had been near to herself she believed intensely in the wickedness of the outside world of the world which was far away from herself and of which she never saw anything but they who were near to her and who had even become dear to her or who even had been respected by her were made as it were saints in her imagination they were brought into the inner circle and could hardly be expelled she was an old woman who thought all evil of those she did not know and all good of those whom she did know and as she did know mr crawley she was quite sure he had not stolen mr soamess twenty pounds she did know mr soames also and thus there was a mystery for the unravelling of which she was very anxious and the young lady lufton was equally sure and perhaps with better reason for such certainty she had in truth known more of mr crawley personally than had any one in the county unless it was the dean the younger lady lufton the present lord luftons wife had sojourned at one time in mr crawleys house amidst the crawley poverty living as they lived and nursing mrs crawley through an illness which had well nigh been fatal to her and the younger lady lufton believed in mr crawleyas mr crawley also believed in her  it is quite impossible my dear the old woman said to her daughterinlaw  quite impossible my lady the dowager was always called my lady both by her own daughter and by her sons wife except in the presence of their children when she was addressed as grandmamma think how well i knew him its no use talking of evidence no evidence would make me believe it  nor me and i think it a great shame that such a report should be spread about  i suppose mr soames could not help himself said the younger lady who was not herself very fond of mr soames  ludovic says that he has only done what he was obliged to do the ludovic spoken of was lord lufton  this took place in the morning but in the evening the affair was again discussed at framley hall indeed for some days there was hardly any other subject held to be worthy of discussion in the county mr robarts the clergyman of the parish and the brother of the younger lady lufton was dining at the hall with his wife and the three ladies had together expressed their perfect conviction of the falseness of the accusation but when lord lufton and mr robarts were together after the ladies had left them there was much less of this certainty expressed by jove said lord lufton i dont know what to think of it i wish with all my heart that soames had said nothing about it and that the cheque had passed without remark  that was impossible when the banker sent to soames he was obliged to take the matter up  of course he was but im sorry that it was so for the life of me i cant conceive how the cheque got into crawleys hands  i imagine that it had been lying in the house and that crawley had come to think that it was his own  but my dear mark said lord lufton excuse me if i say that thats nonsense what do we do when a poor man has come to think that another mans property is his own we send him to prison for making the mistake  i hope they wont send crawley to prison  i hope so too but what is a jury to do  you think it will go to a jury then  i do said lord lufton i dont see how the magistrates can save themselves from committing him it is one of those cases in which every one concerned would wish to drop it if it were only possible but it is not possible on the evidence as one sees it at present one is bound to say that it is a case for a jury  i believe that he is mad said the brother parson  he always was as far as i could learn said the lord i never knew him myself you do i think  oh yes i know him and the vicar of framley became silent and thoughtful as the memory of a certain interview between himself and mr crawley came back upon his mind at that time the waters had nearly closed over his head and mr crawley had given him some assistance when the gentlemen had again found the ladies they kept their own doubts to themselves for at framley hall as at present tenanted female voices and female influences predominated over those which came from the other sex  at barchester the cathedral city of the county in which the crawleys lived opinion was violently against mr crawley in the city mrs proudie the wife of the bishop was the leader of opinion in general and she was very strong in her belief of the mans guilt she had known much of clergymen all her life as it behoved a bishops wife to do and she had none of that mingled weakness and ignorance which taught so many ladies in barsetshire to suppose that an ordained clergyman could not become a thief she hated old lady lufton with all her heart and old lady lufton hated her as warmly mrs proudie would say frequently that lady lufton was a conceited old idiot and lady lufton would declare as frequently that mrs proudie was a vulgar virago it was known at the palace in barchester that kindness had been shown to the crawleys by the family at framley hall and this alone would have been sufficient to make mrs proudie believe that mr crawley could have been guilty of any crime and as mrs proudie believed so did the bishop believe it is a terrible disgrace to the diocese said the bishop shaking his head and patting his apron as he sat by his study fire  fiddlestick said mrs proudie  but my deara beneficed clergyman  you must get rid of him thats all you must be firm whether he be acquitted or convicted  but if he be acquitted i cannot get rid of him my dear  yes you can if you are firm and you must be firm is it not true that he has been disgracefully involved in debt ever since he has been there that you have been pestered by letters from unfortunate tradesmen who cannot get their money from him  that is true my dear certainly  and is that kind of thing to go on he cannot come to the palace as all clergymen should do because he has got no clothes to come in i saw him once about the lanes and i never set my eyes on such an object in my life i would not believe that the man was a clergyman till john told me he is a disgrace to the diocese and he must be got rid of i feel sure of his guilt and i hope he will be convicted one is bound to hope that a guilty man should be convicted but if he escape conviction you must sequestrate the living because of the debts the income is enough to get an excellent curate it would just do for thumble to all of which the bishop made no further reply but simply nodded his head and patted his apron he knew that he could not do exactly what his wife required of him but if it should so turn out that poor crawley was found to be guilty then the matter would be comparatively easy  it should be an example to us that we should look to our own steps my dear said the bishop  thats all very well said mrs proudie but it has become your duty and mine too to look to the steps of other people and that duty we must do  of course my dear of course that was the tone in which the question of mr crawleys alleged guilt was discussed at the palace  we have already heard what was said on the subject at the house of archdeacon grantly as the days passed by and as other tidings came in confirmatory of those which had before reached him the archdeacon felt himself unable not to believe in the mans guilt and the fear which he entertained as to his sons intended marriage with grace crawley tended to increase the strength of his belief dr grantly had been a very successful man in the world and on all ordinary occasions had been able to show that bold front with which success endows a man but he still had his moments of weakness and feared greatly lest anything of misfortune should touch him and mar the comely roundness of his prosperity he was very wealthy the wife of his bosom had been to him all that a wife should be his reputation in the clerical world stood very high he had lived all his life on terms of equality with the best of the gentry around him his only daughter had made a splendid marriage his two sons had hitherto done well in the world not only as regarded their happiness but as to marriage also and as to social standing but how great would be the fall if his son should at last marry the daughter of a convicted thief how would the proudies rejoice over himthe proudies who had been crushed to the ground by the success of the hartletop alliance and how would the lowchurch curates who swarmed in barsetshire gather together and scream in delight over his dismay but why should we say that he is guilty said mrs grantly  it hardly matters as far as we are concerned whether they find him guilty or not said the archdeacon if henry marries that girl my heart will be broken  but perhaps to no one except to the crawleys themselves had the matter caused so much terrible anxiety as to the archdeacons son he had told his father that he had made no offer of marriage to grace crawley and he had told the truth but there are perhaps few men who make such offers in direct terms without having already said and done that which make such offers simply necessary as the final closing of an accepted bargain it was so at any rate between major grantly and miss crawley and major grantly acknowledged to himself that it was so he acknowledged also to himself that as regarded grace herself he had no wish to go back from his implied intentions nothing that either his father or mother might say would shake him in that but could it be his duty to bind himself to the family of a convicted thief could it be right that he should disgrace his father and his mother and his sister and his one child by such a connection he had a mans heart and the poverty of the crawleys caused him no solicitude but he shrank from the contamination of a prison     chapter vi  grace crawley   it has already been said that grace crawley was at this time living with the two miss prettymans who kept a girls school at silverbridge two more benignant ladies than the miss prettymans never presided over such an establishment the younger was fat and fresh and fair and seemed to be always running over with the milk of human kindness the other was very thin and very small and somewhat afflicted with bad healthwas weak too in the eyes and subject to racking headaches so that it was considered generally that she was unable to take much active part in the education of the pupils but it was considered as generally that she did all the thinking that she knew more than any other woman in barsetshire and that all the prettyman schemes for education emanated from her mind it was said too by those who knew them best that her sisters goodnature was as nothing to hers that she was the most charitable the most loving and the most conscientious of schoolmistresses this was miss annabella prettyman the elder and perhaps it may be inferred that some portion of her great character for virtue may have been due to the fact that nobody ever saw her out of her own house she could not even go to church because the open air brought on neuralgia she was therefore perhaps taken to be magnificent partly because she was unknown miss anne prettyman the younger went about frequently to teapartieswould go indeed to any party to which she might be invited and was known to have a pleasant taste for poundcake and sweetmeats being seen so much in the outer world she became common and her character did not stand so high as did that of her sister some people were illnatured enough to say that she wanted to marry mr winthrop but of what maiden lady that goes out into the world are not such stories told and all such stories in silverbridge were told with special reference to mr winthrop  miss crawley at present lived with the miss prettymans and assisted them in the school this arrangement had been going on for the last twelve months since the time in which grace would have left the school in the natural course of things there had been no bargain made and no intention that grace should stay she had been invited to fill the place of an absent superintendent first for one month then for another and then for two more months and when the assistant came back the miss prettymans thought there were reasons why grace should be asked to remain a little longer but they took great care to let the fashionable world of silverbridge know that grace crawley was a visitor with them and not a teacher we pay her no salary or anything of that kind said miss anne prettyman a statement however which was by no means true for during those four months the regular stipend had been paid to her and twice since then miss annabella prettyman who managed all the money matters had called grace into her little room and had made a little speech and had put a little bit of paper into her hand i know i ought not to take it grace had said to her friend anne if i was not here there would be no one in my place nonsense my dear anne prettyman had said it is the greatest comfort to us in the world and you should make yourself nice you know for his sake all the gentlemen like it then grace had been very angry and had sworn that she would give the money back again nevertheless i think she did make herself as nice as she knew how to do and from all this it may be seen that the miss prettymans had hitherto quite approved of major grantlys attentions  but when this terrible affair came on about the cheque which had been lost and found and traced to mr crawleys hands miss anne prettyman said nothing further to grace crawley about major grantly it was not that she thought that mr crawley was guilty but she knew enough of the world to be aware that suspicion of such guilt might compel such a man as major grantly to change his mind if he had only popped anne said to her sister it would have been all right he would never have gone back from his word my dear said annabella i wish you would not talk about popping it is a terrible word i shouldnt to any one except you said anne  there had come to silverbridge some few months since on a visit to mrs walker a young lady from allington in the neighbouring county between whom and grace crawley there had grown up from circumstances a warm friendship grace had a cousin in londona clerk high up and welltodo in a public office a nephew of her mothersand this cousin was and for years had been violently smitten in love for this young lady but the young ladys tale had been sad and though she acknowledged feelings of most affectionate friendship for the cousin she could not bring herself to acknowledge more grace crawley had met the young lady at silverbridge and words had been spoken about the cousin and though the young lady from allington was some years older than grace there had grown up to be a friendship and as is not uncommon between young ladies there had been an agreement that they would correspond the name of the lady was miss lily dale and the name of the welltodo cousin in london was mr john eames  at the present moment miss dale was at home with her mother at allington and grace crawley in her terrible sorrow wrote to her friend pouring out her whole heart as graces letter and miss dales answer will assist us in our story i will venture to give them both      silverbridge  december 186     dearest lily     i hardly know how to tell you what has happened it is so    very terrible but perhaps you will have heard it already    as everybody is talking of it here it has got into the    newspapers and therefore it cannot be kept secret not    that i should keep anything from you only this is so very    dreadful that i hardly know how to write it somebody    saysa mr soames i believe it isthat papa has taken    some money that does not belong to him and he is to be    brought before the magistrates and tried of course papa    has done nothing wrong i do think he would be the last    man in the world to take a penny that did not belong to    him you know how poor he is what a life he has had but    i think he would almost sooner see mamma starvingi am    sure he would rather be starved himself than even borrow    a shilling which he could not pay to suppose that he    would take money she had tried to write the word steal    but she could not bring her pen to form the letters is    monstrous but somehow the circumstances have been made    to look bad against him and they say that he must come    over here to the magistrates i often think that of all    men in the world papa is the most unfortunate everything    seems to go against him and yet he is so good poor mamma    has been over here and she is distracted i never saw    her so wretched before she had been to your friend mr    walker and came to me afterwards for a minute mr walker    has got something to do with it though mamma says she    thinks he is quite friendly to papa i wonder whether    you could find out through mr walker what he thinks    about it of course mamma knows that papa has done    nothing wrong but she says that the whole thing is most    mysterious and that she does not know how to account for    the money papa you know is not like other people he    forgets things and is always thinking thinking thinking    of his great misfortunes poor papa my heart bleeds so    when i remember all his sorrows that i hate myself for    thinking about myself     when mamma left meand it was then i first knew that    papa would really have to be triedi went to miss    annabella and told her that i would go home she asked me    why and i said i would not disgrace her house by staying    in it she got up and took me in her arms and there came    a tear out of both her dear old eyes and she said that if    anything evil came to papawhich she would not believe    as she knew him to be a good manthere should be a    home in her house not only for me but for mamma and    jane isnt she a wonderful woman when i think of her    i sometimes think that she must be an angel already    then she became very seriousfor just before through    her tears she had tried to smileand she told me to    remember that all people could not be like her who had    nobody to look to but herself and her sister and that at    present i must task myself not to think of that which i    had been thinking of before she did not mention anybodys    name but of course i understood very well what she meant    and i suppose she is right i said nothing in answer to    her for i could not speak she was holding my hand and i    took hers up and kissed it to show her if i could that    i knew that she was right but i could not have spoken    about it for all the world it was not ten days since    that she herself with all her prudence told me that she    thought i ought to make up my mind what answer i would    give him and then i did not say anything but of course    she knew and after that miss anne spoke quite freely    about it so that i had to beg her to be silent even    before the girls you know how imprudent she is but it    is all over now of course miss annabella is right he    has got a great many people to think of his father and    mother and his darling little edith whom he brought here    twice and left her with us once for two days so that    she got to know me quite well and i took such a love for    her that i could not bear to part with her but i think    sometimes that all our family are born to be unfortunate    and then i tell myself that i will never hope for anything    again     pray write to me soon i feel as though nothing on earth    could comfort me and yet i shall like to have your    letter dear dear lily i am not even yet so wretched but    what i shall rejoice to be told good news of you if it    only could be as john wishes it and why should it not    it seems to me that nobody has a right or a reason to be    unhappy except us goodby dearest lily     your affectionate friend     grace crawley     psi think i have made up my mind that i will go back    to hogglestock at once if the magistrates decide against    papa i think i should be doing the school harm if i were    to stay here   the answer to this letter did not reach miss crawley till after the magistrates meeting on the thursday but it will be better for our story that it should be given here than postponed until the result of that meeting shall have been told miss dales answer was as follows      allington  december 186     dear grace     your letter has made me very unhappy if it can at all    comfort you to know that mamma and i sympathize with you    altogether in that you may at any rate be sure but in    such troubles nothing will give comfort they must be    borne till the fire of misfortune burns itself out     i had heard about the affair a day or two before i got    your note our clergyman mr boyce told us of it of    course we all know that the charge must be altogether    unfounded and mamma says that the truth will be sure to    show itself at last but that conviction does not cure the    evil and i can well understand that your father should    suffer grievously and i pity your mother quite as much as    i do him     as for major grantly if he be such a man as i took him to    be from the little i saw of him all this would make no    difference to him i am sure that it ought to make none    whether it should not make a difference in you is another    question i think it should and i think your answer to    him should be that you could not even consider any such    proposition while your father was in so great trouble i    am so much older than you and seem to have had so much    experience that i do not scruple as you will see to    come down upon you with all the weight of my wisdom     about that other subject i had rather say nothing i have    known your cousin all my life almost and i regard no one    more kindly than i do him when i think of my friends he    is always one of the dearest but when one thinks of going    beyond friendship even if one tries to do so there are    so many barriers     your affectionate friend     lily dale     mamma bids me say that she would be delighted to have you    here whenever it might suit you to come and i add to this    message my entreaty that you will come at once you say    that you think you ought to leave miss prettymans for a    while i can well understand your feeling but as your    sister is with your mother surely you had better come    to usi mean quite at once i will not scruple to tell    you what mamma says because i know your good sense she    says that as the interest of the school may possibly be    concerned and as you have no regular engagement she    thinks you ought to leave silverbridge but she says that    it will be better that you come to us than that you should    go home if you went home people might say that you had    left in some sort of disgrace come to us and when all    this has been put right then you go back to silverbridge    and then if a certain person speaks again you can make a    different answer mamma quite understands that you are to    come so you have only got to ask your own mamma and come    at once   this letter as the reader will understand did not reach grace crawley till after the allimportant thursday but before that day had come round grace had told miss prettymanhad told both the miss prettymansthat she was resolved to leave them she had done this without even consulting her mother driven to it by various motives she knew that her fathers conduct was being discussed by the girls in the school and that things were said of him which it could not but be for the disadvantage of miss prettyman that any one should say of a teacher in her establishment she felt too that she could not hold up her head in silverbridge in these days as it would become her to do if she retained her position she did struggle gallantly and succeeded much more nearly than she was herself aware she was all but able to carry herself as though no terrible accusation was being made against her father of the struggle however she was not herself the less conscious and she told herself that on that account also she must go and then she must go also because of major grantly whether he was minded to come and speak to her that one other needed word or whether he was not so minded it would be better that she should be away from silverbridge if he spoke it she could only answer him by a negative and if he were minded not to speak it would it not be better that she should leave herself the power of thinking that his silence had been caused by her absence and not by his coldness or indifference  she asked therefore for an interview with miss prettyman and was shown into the elder sisters room at eleven oclock on the tuesday morning the elder miss prettyman never came into the school herself till twelve but was in the habit of having interviews with the young ladieswhich were sometimes very awful in their naturefor the two previous hours during these interviews an immense amount of business was done and the fortunes in life of some girls were said to have been there made or marred as when for instance miss crimpton had been advised to stay at home with her uncle in england instead of going out with her sisters to india both of which sisters were married within three months of their landing at bombay the way in which she gave her counsel on such occasions was very efficacious no one knew better than miss prettyman that a cock can crow most effectively in his own farmyard and therefore all crowing intended to be effective was done by her within the shrine of her own peculiar room  well my dear what is it she said to grace sit in the armchair my dear and we can then talk comfortably the teachers when they were closeted with miss prettyman were always asked to sit in the armchair whereas a small straightbacked uneasy chair was kept for the use of the young ladies and there was too a stool of repentance out against the wall very uncomfortable indeed for young ladies who had not behaved themselves so prettily as young ladies generally do  grace seated herself and then began her speech very quickly miss prettyman she said i have made up my mind that i will go home if you please  and why should you go home grace did i not tell you that you should have a home here miss prettyman had weak eyes and was very small and had never possessed any claim to be called goodlooking and she assumed nothing of majestical awe from any adornment or studied amplification of the outward woman by means of impressive trappings the possessor of an unobservant eye might have called her a meanlooking little old woman and certainly there would have been nothing awful in her to any one who came across her otherwise than as a lady having authority in her own school but within her own precincts she did know how to surround herself with a dignity which all felt who approached her there grace crawley as she heard the simple question which miss prettyman had asked unconsciously acknowledged the strength of the womans manner she already stood rebuked for having proposed a plan so ungracious so unnecessary and so unwise  i think i ought to be with mamma at present said grace  your mother has your sister with her  yes miss prettyman jane is there  if there be no other reason i cannot think that that can be held to be a reason now of course your mother would like to have you always unless you should be marriedbut then there are reasons why this should not be so  of course there are  i do not thinkthat is if i know all that there is to be knowni do not think i say that there can be any good ground for your leaving us nowjust now  then grace sat silent for a moment gathering her courage and collecting her words and after that she spoke it is because of papa and because of this charge  but grace  i know what you are going to say miss prettymanthat is i think i know  if you will hear me you may be sure that you know  but i want you to hear me for one moment first i beg your pardon miss prettyman i do indeed but i want to say this before you go on i must go home and i know i ought we are all disgraced and i wont stop here to disgrace the school i know papa has done nothing wrong but nevertheless we are disgraced the police are to bring him in here on thursday and everybody in silverbridge will know it it cannot be right that i should be here teaching in the school while it is all going onand i wont and miss prettyman i couldnt do itindeed i couldnt i cant bring myself to think of anything i am doing indeed i cant and then miss prettyman there are other reasons by the time that she had proceeded thus far grace crawleys words were nearly choked by her tears  and what are the other reasons grace  i dont know said grace struggling to speak through her tears  but i know said miss prettyman i know them all i know all your reasons and i tell you that in my opinion you ought to remain where you are and not go away the very reasons which to you are reasons for your going to me are reasons for your remaining here  i cant remain i am determined to go i dont mind you and miss anne but i cant bear to have the girls looking at meand the servants  then miss prettyman paused awhile thinking what words of wisdom would be most appropriate in the present conjuncture but words of wisdom did not seem to come easily to her having for the moment been banished by tenderness of heart come here my love she said at last come here grace slowly grace got up from her seat and came round and stood by miss prettymans elbow miss prettyman pushed her chair a little back and pushed herself a little forward and stretching out one hand placed her arm round graces waist and with the other took hold of graces hand and thus drew her down and kissed the girls forehead and lips and then grace found herself kneeling at her friends feet grace she said do you not know that i love you do you not know that i love you dearly in answer to this grace kissed the withered hand she held in hers while the warm tears trickled down upon miss prettymans knuckles i love you as though you were my own exclaimed the schoolmistress and will you not trust me that i know what is best for you  illustration i love you as though you were my own said the schoolmistress  i must go home said grace  of course you shall if you think it right at last but let us talk of it no one in this house you know has the slightest suspicion that your father has done anything that is in the least dishonourable  i know that you have not  no nor has anne miss prettyman said this as though no one in that house beyond herself and her sister had a right to have any opinion on any subject  i know that said grace  well my dear if we think so  but the servants miss prettyman  if any servant in this house says a word to offend you illill  they dont say anything miss prettyman but they look indeed id better go home indeed i had  do not you think your mother has cares enough upon her and burden enough without having another mouth to feed and another head to shelter you havent thought of that grace  yes i have  and as for the work whilst you are not quite well you shall not be troubled with teaching i have some old papers that want copying and settling and you shall sit here and do that just for an employment anne knows that ive long wanted to have it done and ill tell her that youve kindly promised to do it for me  no no no said grace i must go home she was still kneeling at miss prettymans knee and still holding miss prettymans hand and then at that moment there came a tap at the door gentle but yet not humble a tap which acknowledged on the part of the tapper the supremacy in that room of the lady who was sitting there but which still claimed admittance almost as a right the tap was well known by both of them to be the tap of miss anne grace immediately jumped up and miss prettyman settled herself in her chair with a motion which almost seemed to indicate some feeling of shame as to her late position  i suppose i may come in said miss anne opening the door and inserting her head  yes you may come inif you have anything to say said miss prettyman with an air which seemed to be intended to assert her supremacy but in truth she was simply collecting the wisdom and dignity which had been somewhat dissipated by her tenderness  i did not know that grace crawley was here said miss anne  grace crawley is here said miss prettyman  what is the matter grace said miss anne seeing the tears  never mind now said miss prettyman  poor dear im sure im sorry as though she were my own sister said anne but annabella i want to speak to you especially  to me in private  yes to you in private if grace wont mind  then grace prepared to go but as she was going miss anne upon whose brow a heavy burden of thought was lying stopped her suddenly grace my dear she said go upstairs into your room will younot across the hall to the school  and why shouldnt she go to the school said miss prettyman  miss anne paused a moment and then answeredunwillingly as though driven to make a reply which she knew to be indiscreet because there is somebody in the hall  go to your room dear said miss prettyman and grace went to her room never turning an eye down towards the hall who is it said miss prettyman  major grantly is here asking to see you said miss anne     chapter vii  miss prettymans private room   illustration  major grantly when threatened by his father with pecuniary punishment should he demean himself by such a marriage as that he had proposed to himself had declared that he would offer his hand to miss crawley on the next morning this however he had not done he had not done it partly because he did not quite believe his fathers threat and partly because he felt that that threat was almost justifiedfor the present momentby the circumstances in which grace crawleys father had placed himself henry grantly acknowledged as he drove himself home on the morning after his dinner at the rectory that in this matter of his marriage he did owe much to his family should he marry at all he owed it to them to marry a lady and grace crawleyso he told himselfwas a lady and he owed it to them to bring among them as his wife a woman who should not disgrace him or them by her education manners or even by her personal appearance in all these respects grace crawley was in his judgment quite as good as they had a right to expect her to be and in some respects a great deal superior to that type of womanhood with which they had been most generally conversant if everybody had her due my sister isnt fit to hold a candle to her he said to himself it must be acknowledged therefore that he was really in love with grace crawley and he declared to himself over and over again that his family had no right to demand that he should marry a woman with money the archdeacons son by no means despised money how could he having come forth as a bird fledged from such a nest as the rectory at plumstead episcopi before he had been brought by his better nature and true judgment to see that grace crawley was the greater woman of the two he had nearly submitted himself to the twenty thousand pounds of miss emily dunstableto that and her goodhumour and rosy freshness combined but he regarded himself as the welltodo son of a very rich father his only child was amply provided for and he felt that as regarded money he had a right to do as he pleased he felt this with double strength after his fathers threat  but he had no right to make a marriage by which his family would be disgraced whether he was right or wrong in supposing that he would disgrace his family were he to marry the daughter of a convicted thief it is hardly necessary to discuss here he told himself that it would be sotelling himself also that by the stern laws of the world the son and the daughter must pay for the offence of the father and the mother even among the poor who would willingly marry the child of a man who had been hanged but he carried the argument beyond this thinking much of the matter and endeavouring to think of it not only justly but generously if the accusation against crawley were falseif the man were being injured by an unjust chargeeven if he grantly could make himself think that the girls father had not stolen the money then he would dare everything and go on i do not know that his argument was good or that his mind was logical in the matter he ought to have felt that his own judgment as to the mans guilt was less likely to be correct than that of those whose duty it was and would be to form and to express a judgment on the matter and as to grace herself she was equally innocent whether her father were guilty or not guilty if he were to be debarred from asking her for her hand by his feelings for her father and mother he should hardly have trusted to his own skill in ascertaining the real truth as to the alleged theft but he was not logical and thus meaning to be generous he became unjust  he found that among those in silverbridge whom he presumed to be best informed on such matters there was a growing opinion that mr crawley had stolen the money he was intimate with all the walkers and was able to find out that mrs walker knew that her husband believed in the clergymans guilt he was by no means alone in his willingness to accept mr walkers opinion as the true opinion silverbridge generally was endeavouring to dress itself in mr walkers glass and to believe as mr walker believed the ladies of silverbridge including the miss prettymans were aware that mr walker had been very kind both to mr and mrs crawley and argued from this that mr walker must think the man to be innocent but henry grantly who did not dare to ask a direct question of the solicitor went cunningly to work and closeted himself with mrs walkerwith mrs walker who knew well of the good fortune which was hovering over graces head and was so nearly settling itself upon her shoulders she would have given a finger to be able to whitewash mr crawley in the majors estimation nor must it be supposed that she told the major in plain words that her husband had convinced himself of the mans guilt in plain words no question was asked between them and in plain words no opinion was expressed but there was the look of sorrow in the womans eye there was the absence of reference to her husbands assurance that the man was innocent there was the air of settled grief which told of her own conviction and the major left her convinced that mrs walker believed mr crawley to be guilty  then he went to barchester not openmouthed with inquiry but rather with open ears and it seemed to him that all men in barchester were of one mind there was a countyclub in barchester and at this countyclub nine men out of every ten were talking about mr crawley it was by no means necessary that a man should ask questions on the subject opinion was expressed so freely that no such asking was required and opinion in barchesterat any rate in the countyclubseemed now to be all of one mind there had been every disposition at first to believe mr crawley to be innocent he had been believed to be innocent even after he had said wrongly that the cheque had been paid to him by mr soames but he had since stated that he had received it from dean arabin and that statement was also shown to be false a man who has a cheque changed on his own behalf is bound at least to show where he got the cheque mr crawley had not only failed to do this but had given two false excuses henry grantly as he drove home to silverbridge on the sunday afternoon summed up all the evidence in his own mind and brought in a verdict of guilty against the father of the girl whom he loved  on the following morning he walked into silverbridge and called at miss prettymans house as he went along his heart was warmer towards grace than it had ever been before he had told himself that he was now bound to abstain for his fathers sake from doing that which he had told his father that he would certainly do but he knew also that he had said that which though it did not bind him to miss crawley gave her a right to expect that he would so bind himself and miss prettyman could not but be aware of what his intention had been and could not but expect that he should now be explicit had he been a wise man altogether he would probably have abstained from saying anything at the present momenta wise man that is in the ways and feelings of the world in such matters but as there are men who will allow themselves all imaginable latitude in their treatment of women believing that the world will condone any amount of fault of that nature so are there other men and a class of men which on the whole is the more numerous of the two who are tremblingly alive to the danger of censure on this headand to the danger of censure not only from others but from themselves also major grantly had done that which made him think it imperative upon him to do something further and to do that something at once  therefore he started off on the monday morning after breakfast and walked to silverbridge and as he walked he built various castles in the air why should he not marry graceif she would have himand take her away beyond the reach of her fathers calamity why should he not throw over his own people altogether money position society and all and give himself up to love were he to do so men might say that he was foolish but no one could hint that he was dishonourable his spirit was high enough to teach him to think that such conduct on his part would have in it something of magnificence but yet such was not his purpose in going to miss prettyman it was his intention to apologize for not doing this magnificent thing his mind was quite made up nevertheless he built those castles in the air  it so happened that he encountered the younger miss prettyman in the hall it would not at all have suited him to reveal to her the purport of his visit or ask her either to assist his suit or to receive his apologies miss anne prettyman was too common a personage in the silverbridge world to be fit for such employment miss anne prettyman was indeed herself submissive to him and treated him with the courtesy which is due to a superior being he therefore simply asked her whether he could be allowed to see her sister  surely major grantlythat is i think so it is a little early but i think she can receive you  it is early i know but as i want to say a word or two on business  oh on business i am sure she will see you on business she will only be too proud if you will be kind enough to step in here for two minutes then miss anne having deposited the major in the little parlour ran upstairs with her message to her sister of course its about grace crawley she said to herself as she went it cant be about anything else i wonder what it is hes going to say if hes going to pop and the father in all this trouble hes the finest fellow that ever trod such were her thoughts as she tapped at the door and announced in the presence of grace that there was somebody in the hall  its major grantly whispered anne as soon as grace had shut the door behind her  so i supposed by your telling her not to go into the hall what has he come to say  how on earth can i tell you that annabella but i suppose he can have only one thing to say after all that has come and gone he can only have come with one object  he wouldnt have come to me for that he would have asked to see herself  but she never goes out now and he cant see her  or he would have gone to them over at hogglestock said miss prettyman but of course he must come up now he is here would you mind telling him or shall i ring the bell  ill tell him we need not make more fuss than necessary with the servants you know i suppose id better not come back with him  there was a tone of supplication in the younger sisters voice as she made the last suggestion which ought to have melted the heart of the elder but it was unavailing as he has asked to see me i think you had better not said annabella miss anne prettyman bore her cross meekly offered no argument on the subject and returning to the little parlour where she had left the major brought him upstairs and ushered him into her sisters room without even entering it again herself  major grantly was as intimately acquainted with miss anne prettyman as a man under thirty may well be with a lady nearer fifty than forty who is not specially connected with him by any family tie but of miss prettyman he knew personally very much less miss prettyman as has before been said did not go out and was therefore not common to the eyes of the silverbridgians she did occasionally see her friends in her own house and grace crawleys lover as the major had come to be called had been there on more than one occasion but of real personal intimacy between them there had hitherto existed none he might have spoken perhaps a dozen words to her in his life he had now more than a dozen to speak to her but he hardly knew how to commence them  she had got up and curtseyed and had then taken his hand and asked him to sit down my sister tells me that you want to see me she said in her softest mildest voice  i do miss prettyman i want to speak to you about a matter that troubles me very muchvery much indeed  anything that i can do major grantly  thank you yes i know that you are very good or i should not have ventured to come to you indeed i shouldnt trouble you now of course if it was only about myself i know very well what a great friend you are to miss crawley  yes i am we love grace dearly here  so do i said the major bluntly i love her dearly too then he paused as though he thought that miss prettyman ought to take up the speech but miss prettyman seemed to think differently and he was obliged to go on i dont know whether you have ever heard about it or noticed it ororor he felt that he was very awkward and he blushed major as he was he blushed as he sat before the old woman trying to tell his story but not knowing how to tell it the truth is miss prettyman i have done all but ask her to be my wife and now has come this terrible affair about her father  it is a terrible affair major grantly very terrible  by jove you may say that  of course mr crawley is as innocent in the matter as you or i are  you think so miss prettyman  think so i feel quite sure of it what a clergyman of the church of england a pious hardworking country clergyman whom we have known among us by his good works for years suddenly turn thief and pilfer a few pounds it is not possible major grantly and the father of such a daughter too it is not possible it may do for men of business to think so lawyers and such like who are obliged to think in accordance with the evidence as they call it but to my mind the idea is monstrous i dont know how he got it and i dont care but im quite sure he did not steal it whoever heard of anybody becoming so base as that all at once  the major was startled by her eloquence and by the indignant tone of voice in which it was expressed it seemed to tell him that she would give him no sympathy in that which he had come to say to her and to upbraid him already in that he was not prepared to do the magnificent thing of which he had thought when he had been building his castles in the air why should he not do the magnificent thing miss prettymans eloquence was so strong that it half convinced him that the barchester club and mr walker had come to a wrong conclusion after all  and how does miss crawley bear it he asked desirous of postponing for a while any declaration of his own purpose  she is very unhappy of course not that she thinks evil of her father  of course she does not think him guilty  nobody thinks him so in this house major grantly said the little woman very imperiously but grace is naturally enough very sadvery sad indeed i do not think i can ask you to see her today  i was not thinking of it said the major  poor dear girl it is a great trial for her do you wish me to give her any message major grantly  the moment had now come in which he must say that which he had come to say the little woman waited for an answer and as he was there within her power as it were he must speak i fear that what he said will not be approved by any strongminded reader i fear that our lover will henceforth be considered by such a one as being but a weak wishywashy man who had hardly any mind of his own to speak ofthat he was a man of no account as the poor people say miss prettyman what message ought i to send to her he said  nay major grantly how can i tell you that how can i put words into your mouth  it isnt the words he said but the feelings  and how can i tell the feelings of your heart  oh as for that i know what my feelings are i do love her with all my hearti do indeed a fortnight ago i was only thinking whether she would accept me when i asked herwondering whether i was too old for her and whether she would mind having edith to take care of  she is very fond of edithvery fond indeed  is she said the major more distracted than ever why should he not do the magnificent thing after all but it is a great charge for a young girl when she marries  it is a great chargea very great charge it is for you to think whether you should entrust so great a charge to one so young  i have no fear about that at all  nor should i have anyas you ask me we have known grace well thoroughly and are quite sure that she will do her duty in that state of life to which it may please god to call her  the major was aware when this was said to him that he had not come to miss prettyman for a character of the girl he loved and yet he was not angry at receiving it he was neither angry nor even indifferent he accepted the character almost gratefully though he felt that he was being led away from his purpose he consoled himself for this however by remembering that the path by which miss prettyman was now leading him led to the magnificent and to those pleasant castles in the air which he had been building as he walked into silverbridge i am quite sure that she is all that you say he replied indeed i had made up my mind about that long ago  and what can i do for you major grantly  you think i ought not to see her  i will ask herself if you please i have such trust in her judgment that i should leave her altogether to her own discretion  the magnificent thing must be done and the major made up his mind accordingly something of regret came over his spirit as he thought of a fatherinlaw disgraced and degraded and of his own father brokenhearted but now there was hardly an alternative left to him and was it not the manly thing for him to do he had loved the girl before this trouble had come upon her and was he not bound to accept the burden which his love had brought with it i will see her he said at once if you will let me and ask her to be my wife but i must see her alone  then miss prettyman paused hitherto she had undoubtedly been playing her fish cautiously or rather her young friends fishperhaps i may say cunningly she had descended to artifice on behalf of the girl whom she loved admired and pitied she had seen some way into the mans mind and had been partly aware of his purposeof his infirmity of purpose of his double purpose she had perceived that a word from her might help graces chance and had led the man on till he had committed himself at any rate to her in doing this she had been actuated by friendship rather than by abstract principle but now when the moment had come in which she must decide upon some action she paused was it right for the sake of either of them that an offer of marriage should be made at such a moment as this it might be very well in regard to some future time that the major should have so committed himself she saw something of the mans spirit and believed that having gone so farhaving so far told his love he would return to his love hereafter let the result of the crawley trial be what it might butbut this could be no proper time for lovemaking though grace loved the man as miss prettyman knew wellthough grace loved the child having allowed herself to long to call it her own though such a marriage would be the making of graces fortune as those who loved her could hardly have hoped that it should ever have been made she would certainly refuse the man if he were to propose to her now she would refuse him and then the man would be freefree to change his mind if he thought fit considering all these things craftily in the exercise of her friendship too cunningly i fear to satisfy the claims of a high morality she resolved that the major had better not see miss crawley at the present moment miss prettyman paused before she replied and when she did speak major grantly had risen from his chair and was standing with his back to the fire major grantly she said you shall see her if you please and if she pleases but i doubt whether her answer at such a moment as this would be that which you would wish to receive  you think she would refuse me  i do not think that she would accept you now she would feeli am sure she would feel that these hours of her fathers sorrow are not hours in which love should be either offered or accepted you shall however see her if you please  the major allowed himself a moment for thought and as he thought he sighed grace crawley became more beautiful in his eyes than ever was endowed by these words from miss prettyman with new charms and brighter virtues than he had seen before let come what might he would ask her to be his wife on some future day if he did not so ask her now for the present perhaps he had better be guided by miss prettyman then i will not see her he said  i think that will be the wiser course  of course you knew before this that iloved her  i thought so major grantly  and that i intended to ask her to be my wife  well since you put the question to me so plainly i must confess that as graces friend i should not quite have let things go on as they have gonethough i am not at all disposed to interfere with any girl whom i believe to be pure and good as i know her to bebut still i should hardly have been justified in letting things go as they have gone if i had not believed that such was your purpose  i wanted to set myself right with you miss prettyman  you are right with mequite right and she got up and gave him her hand you are a fine noblehearted gentleman and i hope that our grace may live to be your happy wife and the mother of your darling child and the mother of other children i do not see how a woman could have a happier lot in life  and will you give grace my love  i will tell her at any rate that you have been here and that you have inquired after her with the greatest kindness she will understand what that means without any word of love  can i do anything for heror for her father i mean in the way ofmoney i dont mind mentioning it to you miss prettyman  i will tell her that you are ready to do it if anything can be done for myself i feel no doubt that the mystery will be cleared up at last and then if you will come here we shall be so glad to see youi shall at least  then the major went and miss prettyman herself actually descended with him into the hall and bade him farewell most affectionately before her sister and two of the maids who came out to open the door miss anne prettyman when she saw the great friendship with which the major was dismissed could not contain herself but asked most impudent questions in a whisper indeed but in such a whisper that any sharpeared maidservant could hear and understand them is it settled she asked when her sister had ascended only the first flight of stairshas he popped the look with which the elder sister punished and dismayed the younger i would not have borne for twenty pounds she simply looked and said nothing but passed on when she had regained her room she rang the bell and desired the servant to ask miss crawley to be good enough to step to her poor miss anne retired discomforted into the solitude of one of the lower rooms and sat for some minutes all alone recovering from the shock of her sisters anger at any rate he hasnt popped she said to herself as she made her way back to the school  after that miss prettyman and miss crawley were closeted together for about an hour what passed between them need not be repeated here word for word but it may be understood that miss prettyman said no more than she ought to have said and that grace understood all that she ought to have understood  no man ever behaved with more considerate friendship or more like a gentleman said miss prettyman  i am sure he is very good and i am so glad he did not ask to see me said grace then grace went away and miss prettyman sat awhile in thought considering what she had done not without some stings of conscience  major grantly as he walked home was not altogether satisfied with himself though he gave himself credit for some diplomacy which i do not think he deserved he felt that miss prettyman and the world in general should the world in general ever hear anything about it would give him credit for having behaved well and that he had obtained this credit without committing himself to the necessity of marrying the daughter of a thief should things turn out badly in regard to the father butand this but robbed him of all the pleasure which comes from real successbut he had not treated grace crawley with the perfect generosity which love owes and he was in some degree ashamed of himself he felt however that he might probably have grace should he choose to ask for her when this trouble should have passed by and i will he said to himself as he entered the gate of his own paddock and saw his child in her perambulator before the nurse and i will ask her sooner or later let things go as they may then he took the perambulator under his own charge for halfanhour to the satisfaction of the nurse of the child and of himself     chapter viii  mr crawley is taken to silverbridge   it had become necessary on the monday morning that mrs crawley should obtain from her husband an undertaking that he would present himself before the magistrates at silverbridge on the thursday she had been made to understand that the magistrates were sinning against the strict rule of the law in not issuing a warrant at once for mr crawleys apprehension and that they were so sinning at the instance of mr walkerat whose instance they would have committed almost any sin practicable by a board of english magistrates so great was their faith in him and she knew that she was bound to answer her engagement she had also another task to performthat namely of persuading him to employ an attorney for his defence and she was prepared with the name of an attorney one mr mason also of silverbridge who had been recommended to her by mr walker but when she came to the performance of these two tasks on the monday morning she found that she was unable to accomplish either of them mr crawley first declared that he would have nothing to do with any attorney as to that he seemed to have made up his mind beforehand and she saw at once that she had no hope of shaking him but when she found that he was equally obstinate in the other matter and that he declared that he would not go before the magistrates unless he were made to do sounless the policemen came and fetched him then she almost sank beneath the burden of her troubles and for a while was disposed to let things go as they would how could she strive to bear a load that was so manifestly too heavy for her shoulders  on the sunday the poor man had exerted himself to get through his sunday duties and he had succeeded he had succeeded so well that his wife had thought that things might yet come right with him that he would remember before it was too late the true history of that unhappy bit of paper and that he was rising above that half madness which for months past had afflicted him on the sunday evening when he was tired with his work she thought it best to say nothing to him about the magistrates and the business of thursday but on the monday morning she commenced her task feeling that she owed it to mr walker to lose no more time he was very decided in his manners and made her understand that he would employ no lawyer on his own behalf why should i want a lawyer i have done nothing wrong he said then she tried to make him understand that many who may have done nothing wrong require a lawyers aid and who is to pay him he asked to this she replied unfortunately that there would be no need of thinking of that at once and i am to get further into debt he said i am to put myself right before the world by incurring debts which i know i can never pay when it has been a question of food for the children i have been weak but i will not be weak in such a matter as this i will have no lawyer she did not regard this denial on his part as very material though she would fain have followed mr walkers advice had she been able but when later in the day he declared that the police should fetch him then her spirit gave way early in the morning he had seemed to assent to the expediency of going into silverbridge on the thursday and it was not till after he had worked himself into a rage about the proposed attorney that he utterly refused to make the journey during the whole day however his state was such as almost to break his wifes heart he would do nothing he would not go to the school nor even stir beyond the housedoor he would not open a book he would not eat nor would he even sit at table or say the accustomed grace when the scanty midday meal was placed upon the table nothing is blessed to me he said when his wife pressed him to say the words for their childs sake shall i say that i thank god when my heart is thankless shall i serve my child by a lie then for hours he sat in the same position in the old armchair hanging over the fire speechless sleepless thinking ever as she well knew of the injustice of the world she hardly dared to speak to him so great was the bitterness of his words when he was goaded to reply at last late in the evening feeling that it would be her duty to send in to mr walker early on the following morning she laid her hand gently on his shoulder and asked him for his promise i may tell mr walker that you will be there on thursday  no he said shouting at her no i will have no such message sent she started back trembling not that she was accustomed to tremble at his ways or to show that she feared him in his paroxysms but that his voice had been louder than she had before known it i will hold no intercourse with them at silverbridge in this matter do you hear me mary  i hear you josiah but i must keep my word to mr walker i promised that i would send to him  tell him then that i will not stir a foot out of this house on thursday of my own accord on thursday i shall be here and here i will remain all dayunless they take me hence by force  but josiah  will you obey me or i shall walk into silverbridge myself and tell the man that i will not come to him then he arose from his chair and stretched forth his hand to his hat as though he were going forth immediately on his way to silverbridge the night was now pitch dark and the rain was falling and abroad he would encounter all the severity of the pitiless winter still it might have been better that he should have gone the exercise and the fresh air even the wet and the mud would have served to bring back his mind to reason but his wife thought of the misery of the journey of his scanty clothing of his worn boots of the need there was to preserve the raiment which he wore and she remembered that he was fastingthat he had eaten nothing since the morning and that he was not fit to be alone she stopped him therefore before he could reach the door  your bidding shall be done she saidof course  tell them then that they must seek me here if they want me  but josiah think of the parishof the people who respect youfor their sakes let it not be said that you were taken away by policemen  was st paul not bound in prison did he think of what the people might see  if it were necessary i would encourage you to bear it without a murmur  it is necessary whether you murmur or do not murmur murmur indeed why does not your voice ascend to heaven with one loud wail against the cruelty of man then he went forth from the room into an empty chamber on the other side of the passage and his wife when she followed him there after a few minutes found him on his knees with his forehead against the floor and with his hands clutching at the scanty hairs of his head often before had she seen him so on the same spot half grovelling half prostrate in prayer reviling in his agony all things around himnay nearly all things above himand yet striving to reconcile himself to his creator by the humiliation of confession  it might be better with him now if only he could bring himself to some softness of heart softly she closed the door and placing the candle on the mantelshelf softly she knelt beside him and softly touched his hand with hers he did not stir nor utter a word but seemed to clutch at his thin locks more violently than before then she kneeling there aloud but with low voice with her thin hands clasped uttered a prayer in which she asked her god to remove from her husband the bitterness of that hour he listened till she had finished and then he rose slowly to his feet it is in vain said he it is all in vain it is all in vain then he returned back to the parlour and seating himself again in the armchair remained there without speaking till past midnight at last when she told him that she herself was very cold and reminded him that for the last hour there had been no fire still speechless he went up with her to their bed  early on the following morning she contrived to let him know that she was about to send a neighbours son over with a note to mr walker fearing to urge him further to change his mind but hoping that he might express his purpose of doing so when he heard that the letter was to be sent but he took no notice whatever of her words at this moment he was reading greek with his daughter or rather rebuking her because she could not be induced to read greek  oh papa the poor girl said dont scold me now i am so unhappy because of all this  and am not i unhappy he said as he closed the book my god what have i done against thee that my lines should be cast in such terrible places  the letter was sent to mr walker he knows himself to be innocent said the poor wife writing what best excuse she knew how to make and thinks that he should take no step himself in such a matter he will not employ a lawyer and he says that he should prefer that he should be sent for if the law requires his presence at silverbridge on thursday all this she wrote as though she felt that she ought to employ a high tone in defending her husbands purpose but she broke down altogether in the few words of the postscript indeed indeed i have done what i could mr walker understood it all both the high tone and the subsequent fall  on the thursday morning at about ten oclock a fly stopped at the gate of the hogglestock parsonage and out of it there came two men one was dressed in ordinary black clothes and seemed from his bearing to be a respectable man of the middle class of life he was however the superintendent of police for the silverbridge district the other man was a policeman pure and simple with the helmetlooking hat which has lately become common and all the ordinary halfmilitary and wholly disagreeable outward adjuncts of the profession wilkins said the superintendent likely enough i shall want you for they tell me the gent is uncommon strange but if i dont call you when i come out just open the door like a servant and mount up on the box when were in and dont speak nor say nothing then the senior policeman entered the house  he found mrs crawley sitting in the parlour with her bonnet and shawl on and mr crawley in the armchair leaning over the fire i suppose we had better go with you said mrs crawley directly the door was opened for of course she had seen the arrival of the fly from the window  the gentleman had better come with us if hell be so kind said thompson ive brought a close carriage for him  but i may go with him said the wife with frightened voice i may accompany my husband he is not well sir and wants assistance  thompson thought about it for a moment before he spoke there was room in the fly for only two or if for three still he knew his place better than to thrust himself inside together with his prisoner and his prisoners wife he had been specially asked by mr walker to be very civil only one could sit on the box with the driver and if the request was conceded the poor policeman must walk back the walk however would not kill the policeman all right maam said thompsonthat is if the gentleman will just pass his word not to get out till i ask him  he will not he will not said mrs crawley  i will pass my word for nothing said mr crawley  upon hearing this thompson assumed a very long face and shook his head as he turned his eyes first towards the husband and then towards the wife and shrugged his shoulders and compressing his lips blew out his breath as though in this way he might blow off some of the mingled sorrow and indignation with which the gentlemans words afflicted him  mrs crawley rose and came close to him you may take my word for it he will not stir you may indeed he thinks it incumbent on him not to give any undertaking himself because he feels himself to be so harshly used  i dont know about harshness said thompson brindling up a close carriage brought and  i will walk if i am made to go i will walk shouted mr crawley  i did not allude to youor to mr walker said the poor wife i know you have been most kind i meant the harshness of the circumstances of course he is innocent and you must feel for him  yes i feel for him and for you too maam  that is all i meant he knows his own innocence and therefore he is unwilling to give way in anything  of course he knows hisself thats certain but hed better come in the carriage if only because of the dirt and slush  he will go in the carriage and i will go with him there will be room there for you sir  thompson looked up at the rain and told himself that it was very cold then he remembered mr walkers injunction and bethought himself that mrs crawley in spite of her poverty was a lady he conceived even unconsciously the idea that something was due to her because of her poverty ill go with the driver said he but hell only give hisself a deal of trouble if he attempts to get out  he wont he wont said mrs crawley and i thank you with all my heart  come along then said thompson  she went up to her husband hat in hand and looking round to see that she was not watched put the hat on his head and then lifted him as it were from his chair he did not refuse to be led and allowed her to throw round his shoulders the old cloak which was hanging in the passage and then he passed out and was the first to seat himself in the silverbridge fly his wife followed him and did not hear the blandishments with which thompson instructed his myrmidon to follow through the mud on foot slowly they made their way through the lanes and it was nearly twelve when the fly was driven into the yard of the george and vulture at silverbridge  silverbridge though it was blessed with a mayor and corporation and was blessed also with a member of parliament all to itself was not blessed with any courthouse the magistrates were therefore compelled to sit in the big room at the george and vulture in which the county balls were celebrated and the meeting of the west barsetshire freemasons was held that part of the country was no doubt very much ashamed of its backwardness in this respect but as yet nothing had been done to remedy the evil thompson and his fly were therefore driven into the yard of the inn and mr and mrs crawley were ushered by him up into a little bedchamber close adjoining to the big room in which the magistrates were already assembled theres a bit of fire here said thompson and you can make yourselves a little warm he himself was shivering with the cold when the gents is ready in there ill just come and fetch you  i may go in with him said mrs crawley  ill have a chair for you at the end of the table just nigh to him said thompson you can slip into it and say nothing to nobody then he left them and went away to the magistrates  mr crawley had not spoken a word since he had entered the vehicle nor had she said much to him but had sat with him holding his hand in hers now he spoke to herwhere is it that we are he asked  at silverbridge dearest  but what is this chamber and why are we here  we are to wait here till the magistrates are ready they are in the next room  but this is the inn  yes dear it is the inn  and i see crowds of people about there were crowds of people about there had been men in the yard and others standing about on the stairs and the public room was full of men who were curious to see the clergyman who had stolen twenty pounds and to hear what would be the result of the case before the magistrates he must be committed so at least said everybody but then there would be the question of bail would the magistrates let him out on bail and who would be the bailsmen why are the people here said mr crawley  i suppose it is the custom when the magistrates are sitting said his wife  they have come to see the degradation of a clergyman said heand they will not be disappointed  nothing can degrade but guilt said his wife  yesmisfortune can degrade and poverty a man is degraded when the cares of the world press so heavily upon him that he cannot rouse himself they have come to look at me as though i were a hunted beast  it is but their custom always on such days  they have not always a clergyman before them as a criminal then he was silent for a while while she was chafing his cold hands would that i were dead before they had brought me to this would that i were dead  is it not right dear that we should all bear what he sends us  would that i were dead he repeated the load is too heavy for me to bear and i would that i were dead  the time seemed to be very long before thompson returned and asked them to accompany him into the big room when he did so mr crawley grasped hold of his chair as though he had resolved that he would not go but his wife whispered a word to him and he obeyed her he will follow me she said to the policeman and in that way they went from the small room into the large one thompson went first mrs crawley with her veil down came next and the wretched man followed his wife with his eyes fixed upon the ground and his hands clasped together upon his breast he could at first have seen nothing and could hardly have known where he was when they placed him in a chair she with a better courage contrived to look round through her veil and saw that there was a long board or table covered with green cloth and that six or seven gentlemen were sitting at one end of it while there seemed to be a crowd standing along the sides and about the room her husband was seated at the other end of the table near the corner and round the cornerso that she might be close to himher chair had been placed on the other side of him there was another chair now empty intended for any professional gentleman whom he might choose to employ  there were five magistrates sitting there lord lufton from framley was in the chaira handsome man still young who was very popular in the county the cheque which had been cashed had borne his signature and he had consequently expressed his intention of not sitting at the board but mr walker desirous of having him there had overruled him showing him that the loss was not his loss the cheque if stolen had not been stolen from him he was not the prosecutor no by jove said lord lufton if i could quash the whole thing id do it at once  you cant do that my lord but you may help us at the board said mr walker  then there was the hon george de courcy lord de courcys brother from castle courcy lord de courcy did not live in the county but his brother did so and endeavoured to maintain the glory of the family by the discretion of his conduct he was not perhaps among the wisest of men but he did very well as a country magistrate holding his tongue keeping his eyes open and on such occasions as this obeying mr walker in all things dr tempest was also there the rector of the parish he being both magistrate and clergyman there were many in silverbridge who declared that dr tempest would have done far better to stay away when a brother clergyman was thus to be brought before the bench but it had been long since dr tempest had cared what was said about him in silverbridge he had become so accustomed to the life he led as to like to be disliked and to be enamoured of unpopularity so when mr walker had ventured to suggest to him that perhaps he might not choose to be there he had laughed mr walker to scorn of course i shall be there he said i am interested in the casevery much interested of course i shall be there and had not lord lufton been present he would have made himself more conspicuous by taking the chair mr fothergill was the fourth mr fothergill was man of business to the duke of omnium who was the great owner of property in and about silverbridge and he was the most active magistrate in that part of the county he was a sharp man and not at all likely to have any predisposition in favour of a clergyman the fifth was dr thorne of chaldicotes a gentleman whose name has been already mentioned in these pages he had been for many years a medical man practising in a little village in the further end of the county but it had come to be his fate late in life to marry a great heiress with whose money the ancient house and domain of chaldicotes had been purchased from the sowerbys since then dr thorne had done his duty well as a country gentlemannot however without some little want of smoothness between him and the dukes people  chaldicotes lay next to the dukes territory and the duke had wished to buy chaldicotes when chaldicotes slipped through the dukes fingers and went into the hands of dr thorneor of dr thornes wifethe duke had been very angry with mr fothergill hence it had come to pass that there had not always been smoothness between the dukes people and the chaldicotes people it was now rumoured that dr thorne intended to stand for the county on the next vacancy and that did not tend to make things smoother on the right hand of lord lufton sat lord george and mr fothergill and beyond mr fothergill sat mr walker and beyond mr walker sat mr walkers clerk on the left hand of the chairman were dr tempest and dr thorne and a little lower down was mr zachary winthrop who held the situation of clerk to the magistrates many people in silverbridge said that this was all wrong as mr winthrop was partner with mr walker who was always employed before the magistrates if there was any employment going for an attorney for this however mr walker cared very little he had so much of his own way in silverbridge that he was supposed to care nothing for anybody  there were many other gentlemen in the room and some who knew mr crawley with more or less intimacy he however took notice of no one and when one friend who had really known him well came up behind and spoke to him gently leaning over his chair the poor man hardly recognized his friend  im sure your husband wont forget me said mr robarts the clergyman of framley as he gave his hand to that lady across the back of mr crawleys chair  no mr robarts he does not forget you but you must excuse him if at this moment he is not quite himself it is a trying situation for a clergyman  i can understand all that but ill tell you why i have come i suppose this inquiry will finish the whole affair and clear up whatever may be the difficulty but should it not do so it may be just possible mrs crawley that something may be said about bail i dont understand much about it and i daresay you do not either but if there should be anything of that sort let mr crawley name me a brother clergyman will be best and ill have some other gentleman with me then he left her not waiting for any answer  at the same time there was a conversation going on between mr walker and another attorney standing behind him mr mason ill go to him said walker and try to arrange it so mr walker seated himself in the empty chair beside mr crawley and endeavoured to explain to the wretched man that he would do well to allow mr mason to assist him mr crawley seemed to listen to all that was said and then turned upon the speaker sharply i will have no one to assist me he said so loudly that every one in the room heard the words i am innocent why should i want assistance nor have i money to pay for it mr mason made a quick movement forward intending to explain that that consideration need offer no impediment but was stopped by further speech from mr crawley i will have no one to help me said he standing upright and for the first time removing his hat from his head go on and do what it is you have to do after that he did not sit down till the proceedings were nearly over though he was invited more than once by lord lufton to do so  we need not go through all the evidence that was brought to bear upon the question it was proved that money for the cheque was paid to mr crawleys messenger and that this money was given to mr crawley when there occurred some little delay in the chain of evidence necessary to show that mr crawley had signed and sent the cheque and got the money he became impatient why do you trouble the man he said i had the cheque and i sent him i got the money has any one denied it that you should strive to drive a poor man like that beyond his wits then mr soames and the manager of the bank showed what inquiry had been made as soon as the cheque came back from the london bank how at first they had both thought that mr crawley could of course explain the matter and how he had explained it by a statement which was manifestly untrue then there was evidence to prove that the cheque could not have been paid to him by mr soames and as this was given mr crawley shook his head and again became impatient i erred in that he exclaimed of course i erred in my haste i thought it was so and in my haste i said so i am not good at reckoning money and remembering sums but i saw that i had been wrong when my error was shown to me and i acknowledged at once that i had been wrong  up to this point he had behaved not only with so much spirit but with so much reason that his wife began to hope that the importance of the occasion had brought back the clearness of his mind and that he would even now be able to place himself right as the inquiry went on then it was explained that mr crawley had stated that the cheque had been given to him by dean arabin as soon as it was shown that it could not have been given to him by mr soames in reference to this mr walker was obliged to explain that application had been made to the dean who was abroad and that the dean had stated that he had given fifty pounds to his friend mr walker explained also that the very notes of which this fifty pounds had consisted had been traced back to mr crawley and that they had had no connection with the cheque or with the money which had been given for the cheque at the bank  mr soames stated that he had lost the cheque with a pocketbook that he had certainly lost it on the day on which he had called on mr crawley at hogglestock and that he missed his pocketbook on his journey back from hogglestock to barchester at the moment of missing it he remembered that he had taken the book out from his pocket in mr crawleys room and at that moment he had not doubted but that he had left it in mr crawleys house he had written and sent to mr crawley to inquire but had been assured that nothing had been found there had been no other property of value in the pocketbooknothing but a few visiting cards and a memorandum and he had therefore stopped the cheque at the london bank and thought no more about it  mr crawley was then asked to explain in what way he came possessed of the cheque the question was first put by lord lufton but it soon fell into mr walkers hands who certainly asked it with all the kindness with which such an inquiry could be made could mr crawley at all remember by what means that bit of paper had come into his possession or how long he had had it he answered the last question first it had been with him for months and why had he kept it he looked round the room sternly almost savagely before he answered fixing his eyes for a moment upon almost every face around him as he did so then he spoke i was driven by shame to keep itand then by shame to use it that this statement was true no one in the room doubted  and then the other question was pressed upon him and he lifted up his hands and raised his voice and swore by the saviour in whom he trusted that he knew not from whence the money had come to him why then had he said that it had come from the dean he had thought so the dean had given him money covered up in an enclosure so that the touch of the coin might not add to my disgrace in taking his alms said the wretched man thus speaking openly and freely in his agony of the shame which he had striven so persistently to hide he had not seen the deans monies as they had been given and he had thought that the cheque had been with them beyond that he could tell them nothing  then there was a conference between the magistrates and mr walker in which mr walker submitted that the magistrates had no alternative but to commit the gentleman to this lord lufton demurred and with him dr thorne  i believe as i am sitting here said lord lufton that he has told the truth and that he does not know any more than i do from whence the cheque came  i am quite sure he does not said dr thorne  lord george remarked that it was the queerest go he had ever come across dr tempest merely shook his head mr fothergill pointed out that even supposing the gentlemans statement to be true it by no means went towards establishing the gentlemans innocence the cheque had been traced to the gentlemans hands and the gentleman was bound to show how it had come into his possession even supposing that the gentleman had found the cheque in his house which was likely enough he was not thereby justified in changing it and applying the proceeds to his own purposes mr walker told them that mr fothergill was right and that the only excuse to be made for mr crawley was that he was out of his senses  i dont see it said lord lufton i might have a lot of paper money by me and not know from adam where i got it  but you would have to show where you got it my lord when inquiry was made said mr fothergill  lord lufton who was not particularly fond of mr fothergill and was very unwilling to be instructed by him in any of the duties of a magistrate turned his back at once upon the dukes agent but within three minutes afterwards he had submitted to the same instructions from mr walker  mr crawley had again seated himself and during this period of the affair was leaning over the table with his face buried on his arms mrs crawley sat by his side utterly impotent as to any assistance just touching him with her hand and waiting behind her veil till she should be made to understand what was the decision of the magistrates this was at last communicated to herand to himin a whisper by mr walker mr crawley must understand that he was committed to take his trial at barchester at the next assizes which would be held in april but that bail would be takenhis own bail in five hundred pounds and that of two others in two hundred and fifty pounds each and mr walker explained further that he and the bailmen were ready and that the bailbond was prepared the bailmen were to be the rev mr robarts and major grantly in five minutes the bond was signed and mr crawley was at liberty to go away a free mantill the barchester assizes should come round in april  of all that was going on at this time mr crawley knew little or nothing and mrs crawley did not know much she did say a word of thanks to mr robarts and begged that the same might be said tothe other gentleman if she had heard the majors name she did not remember it then they were led out back into the bedroom where mrs walker was found anxious to do something if she only knew what to comfort the wretched husband and the wretched wife but what comfort or consolation could there be within their reach there was tea made ready for them and sandwiches cut from the inn larder and there was sherry in the inn decanter but no such comfort as that was possible for either of them  they were taken home again in the fly returning without the escort of mr thompson and as they went some few words were spoken by mrs crawley josiah she said there will be a way out of this even yet if you will only hold up your head and trust  there is a way out of it he said there is a way there is but one way when he had so spoken she said no more but resolved that her eye should never be off him nonot for a moment then when she had gotten him once more into that front parlour she threw her arms round him and kissed him     chapter ix  grace crawley goes to allington   illustration  the tidings of what had been done by the magistrates at their petty sessions was communicated the same night to grace crawley by miss prettyman miss anne prettyman had heard the news within five minutes of the execution of the bailbond and had rushed to her sister with information as to the event they have found him guilty they have indeed they have convicted himor whatever it is because he couldnt say where he got it you do not mean that they have sent him to prison nonot to prison not as yet that is i dont understand it altogether but hes to be tried again at the assizes in the meantime hes to be out on bail major grantly is to be the bailhe and mr robarts that i think was very nice of him it was undoubtedly the fact that miss anne prettyman had received an accession of pleasurable emotion when she learned that mr crawley had not been sent away scathless but had been condemned as it were to a public trial at the assizes and yet she would have done anything in her power to save grace crawley or even to save her father and it must be explained that miss anne prettyman was supposed to be specially efficient in teaching roman history to her pupils although she was so manifestly ignorant of the course of law in the country in which she lived committed him said miss prettyman correcting her sister with scorn they have not convicted him had they convicted him there could be no question of bail i dont know how all that is annabella but at any rate major grantly is to be the bailsman and there is to be another trial at barchester there cannot be more than one trial in a criminal case said miss prettyman unless the jury should disagree or something of that kind i suppose he has been committed and that the trial will take place at the assizes exactlythats just it had lord lufton appeared as lictor and had thompson carried the fasces miss anne would have known more about it  the sad tidings were not told to grace till the evening mrs crawley when the inquiry was over before the magistrates would fain have had herself driven to the miss prettymans school that she might see her daughter but she felt that to be impossible while her husband was in her charge the father would of course have gone to his child had the visit been suggested to him but that would have caused another terrible scene and the mother considering it all in her mind thought it better to abstain miss prettyman did her best to make poor grace think that the affair had gone so far favourablydid her best that is without saying anything which her conscience told her to be false it is to be settled at the assizes in april she said  and in the meantime what will become of papa  your papa will be at home just as usual he must have some one to advise him i dare say it would have been all over now if he would have employed an attorney  but it seems so hard that an attorney should be wanted  my dear grace things in this world are hard  but they are always harder for papa and mamma than for anybody else in answer to this miss prettyman made some remarks intended to be wise and kind at the same time grace whose eyes were laden with tears made no immediate reply to this but reverted to her former statement that she must go home i cannot remain miss prettyman i am so unhappy  will you be more happy at home  i can bear it better there  the poor girl soon learned from the intended consolations of those around her from the illconsidered kindnesses of the pupils and from words which fell from the servants that her father had in fact been judged to be guilty as far as judgment had as yet gone they do say miss its only because he hadnt a lawyer said the housekeeper and if men so kind as lord lufton and mr walker had made him out to be guilty what could be expected from a stern judge down from london who would know nothing about her poor father and his peculiarities and from twelve jurymen who would be shopkeepers out of barchester it would kill her father and then it would kill her mother and after that it would kill her also and there was no money in the house at home she knew it well she had been paid three pounds a month for her services at the school and the money for the last two months had been sent to her mother yet badly as she wanted anything that she might be able to earn she knew that she could not go on teaching it had come to be acknowledged by both the miss prettymans that any teaching on her part for the present was impossible she would go home and perish with the rest of them there was no room left for hope to her or to any of her family they had accused her father of being a common thiefher father whom she knew to be so nobly honest her father whom she believed to be among the most devoted of gods servants he was accused of a paltry theft and the magistrates and lawyers and policemen among them had decided that the accusation was true how could she look the girls in the face after that or attempt to hold her own among the teachers  on the next morning there came the letter from miss lily dale and with that in her hand she again went to miss prettyman she must go home she said she must at any rate see her mother could miss prettyman be kind enough to send her home i havent sixpence to pay for anything she said bursting out into tears and i havent a right to ask for it then the statements which miss prettyman made in her eagerness to cover this latter misfortune were decidedly false there was so much money owing to grace she said money for this money for that money for anything or nothing ten pounds would hardly clear the account nobody owes me anything but if youll lend me five shillings said grace in her agony miss prettyman as she made her way through this difficulty thought of major grantly and his love it would have been of no use she knew had she brought them together on that monday grace would have said nothing to him indeed such a meeting at such a time would have been improper but regarding major grantly as she did in the light of a millionairefor the wealth of the archdeacon was notoriousshe could not but think it a pity that poor grace should be begging for five shillings you need not at any rate trouble yourself about money grace said miss prettyman what is a pound or two more or less between you and me it is almost unkind of you to think about it is that letter in your hand anything for me to see my dear then grace explained that she did not wish to show miss dales letter but that miss dale had asked her to go to allington and you will go said miss prettyman it will be the best thing for you and the best thing for your mother  it was at last decided that grace should go to her friend at allington and to allington she went she returned home for a day or two and was persuaded by her mother to accept the invitation that had been given her at hogglestock while she was there new troubles came up of which something shall shortly be told but they were troubles in which grace could give no assistance to her mother and which indeed though they were in truth troubles as will be seen were so far beneficent that they stirred her father up to a certain action which was in itself salutary i think it will be better that you should be away dearest said the mother who now for the first time heard plainly all that poor grace had to tell about major grantlygrace having heretofore barely spoken in most ambiguous words of major grantly as a gentleman whom she had met at framley and whom she had described as being very nice  in old days long ago lucy robarts the present lady lufton sister of the rev mark robarts the parson of framley had sojourned for a while under mr crawleys roof at hogglestock peculiar circumstances which need not perhaps be told here had given occasion for this visit she had then resolvedfor her future destiny had been known to her before she left mrs crawleys housethat she would in coming days do much to befriend the family of her friend but the doing of much had been very difficult and the doing of anything had come to be very difficult through a certain indiscretion on lord luftons part lord lufton had offered assistance pecuniary assistance to mr crawley which mr crawley had rejected with outspoken anger what was lord lufton to him that his lordship should dare to come to him with his paltry money in his hand but after a while lady lufton exercising some cunning in the operations of her friendship had persuaded her sisterinlaw at the framley parsonage to have grace crawley over there as a visitorand there she had been during the summer holidays previous to the commencement of our story and there at framley she had become acquainted with major grantly who was staying with lord lufton at framley court she had then said something to her mother about major grantly something ambiguous something about his being very nice and the mother had thought how great was the pity that her daughter who was nice too in her estimation should have so few of those adjuncts to assist her which come from full pockets she had thought no more about it then but now she felt herself constrained to think more i dont quite understand why he should have come to miss prettyman on monday said grace because he hardly knows her at all  i suppose it was on business said mrs crawley  no mamma it was not on business  how can you tell dear  because miss prettyman said it wasit wasto ask after me oh mamma i must tell you i know he did like me  did he ever say so to you dearest  yes mamma  and what did you tell him  i told him nothing mamma  and did he ask to see you on monday  no mamma i dont think he did i think he understood it all too well for i could not have spoken to him then  mrs crawley pursued the crossexamination no further but made up her mind that it would be better that her girl should be away from her wretched home during this period of her life if it were written in the book of fate that one of her children should be exempted from the series of misfortunes which seemed to fall one after another almost as a matter of course upon her husband upon her and upon her family if so great good fortune were in store for her grace as such a marriage as this which seemed to be so nearly offered to her it might probably be well that grace should be as little at home as possible mrs crawley had heard nothing but good of major grantly but she knew that the grantlys were proud rich peoplewho lived with their heads high up in the countyand it could hardly be that a son of the archdeacon would like to take his bride direct from hogglestock parsonage  it was settled that grace should go to allington as soon as a letter could be received from miss dale in return to graces note and on the third morning after her arrival at home she started none but they who have themselves been poor gentrygentry so poor as not to know how to raise a shillingcan understand the peculiar bitterness of the trials which such poverty produces the poverty of the normal poor does not approach it or rather the pangs arising from such poverty are altogether of a different sort to be hungry and have no food to be cold and have no fuel to be threatened with distraint for ones few chairs and tables and with the loss of the roof over ones headall these miseries which if they do not positively reach are so frequently near to reaching the normal poor are no doubt the severest of the trials to which humanity is subjected they threaten lifeor if not life then libertyreducing the abject one to a choice between captivity and starvation by hook or crook the poor gentleman or poor ladylet the one or the other be ever so poordoes not often come to the last extremity of the workhouse there are such cases but they are exceptional mrs crawley through all her sufferings had never yet found her cupboard to be absolutely bare or the breadpan to be actually empty but there are pangs to which at the time starvation itself would seem to be preferable the angry eyes of unpaid tradesmen savage with an anger which one knows to be justifiable the taunt of the poor servant who wants her wages the gradual relinquishment of habits which the soft nurture of earlier kinder years had made second nature the wan cheeks of the wife whose malady demands wine the rags of the husband whose outward occupations demand decency the neglected children who are learning not to be the children of gentlefolk and worse than all the alms and doles of halfgenerous friends the waning pride the pride that will not wane the growing doubt whether it be not better to bow the head and acknowledge to all the world that nothing of the pride of station is leftthat the hand is open to receive and ready to touch the cap that the fall from the upper to the lower level has been accomplishedthese are the pangs of poverty which drive the crawleys of the world to the frequent entertaining of that idea of the bare bodkin it was settled that grace should go to allingtonbut how about her clothes and then whence was to come the price of her journey  i dont think theyll mind about my being shabby at allington they live very quietly there  but you say that miss dale is so very nice in all her ways  lily is very nice mamma but i shant mind her so much as her mother because she knows it all i have told her everything  but you have given me all your money dearest  miss prettyman told me i was to come to her said grace who had already taken some small sum from the schoolmistress which at once had gone into her mothers pocket and into household purposes she said i should be sure to go to allington and that of course i should go to her as i must pass through silverbridge  i hope papa will not ask about it said mrs crawley luckily papa did not ask about it being at the moment occupied much with other thoughts and other troubles and grace was allowed to return by silverbridge and to take what was needed from miss prettyman who can tell of the mending and patching of the weary wearing midnight hours of needlework which were accomplished before the poor girl went so that she might not reach her friends house in actual rags and when the work was ended what was there to show for it i do not think that the idea of the bare bodkin as regarded herself ever flitted across mrs crawleys brainshe being one of those who are very strong to endure but it must have occurred to her very often that the repose of the grave is sweet and that there cometh after death a levelling and making even of things which would at last cure all her evils  grace no doubt looked forward to a levelling and making even of thingsor perhaps even to something more prosperous than that which should come to her relief on this side of the grave she could not but have high hopes in regard to her future destiny although as has been said she understood no more than she ought to have understood from miss prettymans account of the conversation with major grantly still innocent as she was she had understood much she knew that the man loved her and she knew also that she loved the man she thoroughly comprehended that the present could be to her no time for listening to speeches of love or for giving kind answers but still i think that she did look for relief on this side of the grave  tut tut said miss prettyman as grace in vain tried to conceal her tears up in the private sanctum you ought to know me by this time and to have learned that i can understand things the tears had flown in return not only for the five gold sovereigns which miss prettyman had pressed into her hand but on account of the prettiest soft grey merino frock that ever charmed a girls eye i should like to know how many girls i have given dresses to when they have been going out visiting law my dear they take them many of them from us old maids almost as if we were only paying our debts in giving them and then miss anne gave her a cloth cloak very warm with pretty buttons and gimp trimmingsjust such a cloak as any girl might like to wear who thought that she would be seen out walking by her major grantly on a christmas morning grace crawley did not expect to be seen out walking by her major grantly but nevertheless she liked the cloak by the power of her practical will and by her true sympathy the elder miss prettyman had for a while conquered the annoyance which on graces part was attached to the receiving of gifts by the consciousness of her poverty and when miss anne with some pride in the tone of her voice expressed a hope that grace would think the cloak pretty grace put her arms pleasantly round her friends neck and declared that it was very prettythe prettiest cloak in all the world  grace was met at the guestwick railwaystation by her friend lilian dale and was driven over to allington in a pony carriage belonging to lilians uncle the squire of the parish i think she will be excused in having put on her new cloak not so much because of the cold as with a view of making the best of herself before mrs dale and yet she knew that mrs dale would know all the circumstances of her poverty and was very glad that it should be so i am so glad that you have come dear said lily it will be such a comfort  i am sure you are very good said grace  and mamma is so glad from the moment that we both talked ourselves into eagerness about itwhile i was writing my letter you know we resolved that it must be so  im afraid i shall be a great trouble to mrs dale  a trouble to mamma indeed you will not you shall be a trouble to no one but me i will have all the trouble myself and the labour i delight in shall physic my pain  grace crawley could not during the journey be at home and at ease even with her friend lily she was going to a strange house under strange circumstances her father had not indeed been tried and found guilty of theft but the charge of theft had been made against him and the magistrates before whom it had been made had thought that the charge was true grace knew that all the local newspapers had told the story and was of course aware that mrs dale would have heard it her own mind was full of it and though she dreaded to speak of it yet she could not be silent miss dale who understood much of this endeavoured to talk her friend into easiness but she feared to begin upon the one subject and before the drive was over they were both of them too cold for much conversation theres mamma said miss dale as they drove up turning out of the street of the village to the door of mrs dales house she always knows by instinct when i am coming you must understand now that you are among us that mamma and i are not mother and daughter but two loving old ladies living together in peace and harmony we do have our quarrelswhether the chicken shall be roast or boiled but never anything beyond that mamma here is grace starved to death and she says if you dont give her some tea she will go back at once  i will give her some tea said mrs dale  and i am worse than she is because ive been driving its all up with bernard and mr green for the next week at least it is freezing as hard as it can freeze and they might as well try to hunt in lapland as here  theyll console themselves with skating said mrs dale  have you ever observed grace said miss dale how much amusement gentlemen require and how imperative it is that some other game should be provided when one game fails  not particularly said grace  oh but it is so now with women it is supposed that they can amuse themselves or live without amusement once or twice in a year perhaps something is done for them there is an arrowshooting party or a ball or a picnic but the catering for mens sport is neverending and is always paramount to everything else and yet the pet game of the day never goes off properly in partridge time the partridges are wild and wont come to be killed in hunting time the foxes wont run straightthe wretches they show no spirit and will take to ground to save their brushes then comes a nipping frost and skating is proclaimed but the ice is always rough and the woodcocks have deserted the country and as for salmonwhen the summer comes round i do really believe that they suffer a great deal about the salmon im sure they never catch any so they go back to their clubs and their cards and their billiards and abuse their cooks and blackball their friends thats about it mamma is it not  you know more about it than i do my dear  because i have to listen to bernard as you never will do weve got such a mr green down here grace hes such a duck of a mansuch topboots and all the rest of it and yet they whisper to me that he doesnt ride always to hounds and to see him play billiards is beautiful only he never can make a stroke i hope you play billiards grace because uncle christopher has just had a new table put up  i never saw a billiardtable yet said grace  then mr green shall teach you hell do anything that you ask him if you dont approve the colour of the ball hell go to london to get you another one only you must be very careful about saying that you like anything before him as hell be sure to have it for you the next day mamma happened to say that she wanted a fourpenny postagestamp and he walked off to guestwick to get it for her instantly although it was lunchtime  he did nothing of the kind lily said her mother he was going to guestwick and was very goodnatured and brought me back a postagestamp that i wanted  of course hes goodnatured i know that and theres my cousin bernard hes captain dale you know but he prefers to be called mr dale because he has left the army and has set up as junior squire of the parish uncle christopher is the real squire only bernard does all the work and now you know all about us im afraid youll find us dull enoughunless you can take a fancy to mr green  does mr green live here asked grace  no he does not live here i never heard of his living anywhere he was something once but i dont know what and i dont think hes anything now in particular but hes bernards friend and like most men as one sees them he never has much to do does major grantly ever go forth to fight his countrys battles this last question she asked in a low whisper so that the words did not reach her mother grace blushed up to her eyes however as she answered  i think that major grantly has left the army  we shall get her round in a day or two mamma said lily dale to her mother that night im sure it will be the best thing to force her to talk of her troubles  i would not use too much force my dear  things are better when theyre talked about im sure they are and it will be good to make her accustomed to speak of major grantly from what mary walker tells me he certainly means it and if so she should be ready for it when it comes  do not make her ready for what may never come  no mamma but she is at present such a child that she knows nothing of her own powers she should be made to understand that it is possible that even a major grantly may think himself fortunate in being allowed to love her  i should leave all that to nature if i were you said mrs dale     chapter x  dinner at framley court   lord lufton as he drove home to framley after the meeting of the magistrates at silverbridge discussed the matter with his brotherinlaw mark robarts the clergyman lord lufton was driving a dogcart and went along the road at the rate of twelve miles an hour ill tell you what it is mark he said that man is innocent but if he wont employ lawyers at his trial the jury will find him guilty  i dont know what to think about it said the clergyman  were you in the room when he protested so vehemently that he didnt know where he got the money  i was in the room all the time  and did you not believe him when he said that  yesi think i did  anybody must have believed himexcept old tempest who never believes anybody and fothergill who always suspects everybody the truth is that he had found the cheque and put it by and did not remember anything about it  but lufton surely that would amount to stealing it  yes if it wasnt that he is such a poor cracked crazy creature with his mind all abroad i think soames did drop his book in his house im sure soames would not say so unless he was quite confident somebody has picked it up and in some way the cheque has got into crawleys hand then he has locked it up and has forgotten all about it and when that butcher threatened him he has put his hand upon it and he has thought or believed that it had come from soames or from the dean or from heaven if you will when a man is so crazy as that you cant judge of him as you do of others  but a jury must judge of him as it would of others  and therefore there should be a lawyer to tell the jury what to do they should have somebody up out of the parish to show that he is beside himself half his time his wife would be the best person only it would be hard lines on her  very hard and after all he would only escape by being shown to be mad  and he is mad  mrs proudie would come upon him in such a case as that and sequester his living  and what will mrs proudie do when hes a convicted thief simply unfrock him and take away his living altogether nothing on earth should induce me to find him guilty if i were on a jury  but you have committed him  yesive been one at least in doing so i simply did that which walker told us we must do a magistrate is not left to himself as a juryman is id eat the biggest pair of boots in barchester before i found him guilty i say mark you must talk it over with the women and see what can be done for them lucy tells me that theyre so poor that if they have bread to eat its as much as they have  on this evening archdeacon grantly and his wife dined and slept at framley court there having been a very long family friendship between old lady lufton and the grantlys and dr thorne with his wife from chaldicotes also dined at framley there was also there another clergyman from barchester mr champion one of the prebends of the cathedral there were only three now who had houses in the city since the retrenchments of the ecclesiastical commission had come into full force and this mr champion was dear to the dowager lady lufton because he carried on worthily the clerical war against the bishop which had raged in barsetshire ever since dr proudie had come therewhich war old lady lufton good and pious and charitable as she was considered that she was bound to keep up even to the knife till dr proudie and all his satellites should have been banished into outer darkness as the light of the proudies still shone brightly it was probable that poor old lady lufton might die before her battle was accomplished she often said that it would be so but when so saying always expressed a wish that the fight might be carried on after her death i shall never never rest in my grave she had once said to the archdeacon while that woman sits in your fathers palace for the archdeacons father had been bishop of barchester before dr proudie what mode of getting rid of the bishop or his wife lady lufton proposed to herself i am unable to say but i think she lived in hopes that in some way it might be done if only the bishop could have been found to have stolen a cheque for twenty pounds instead of poor mr crawley lady lufton would i think have been satisfied  in the course of these battles framley court would sometimes assume a clerical aspecthave a prevailing hue as it were of black coats which was not altogether to the taste of lord lufton and as to which he would make complaint to his wife and to mark robarts himself a clergyman theres more of this than i can stand hed say to the latter theres a deuced deal more of it than you like yourself i know  its not for me to like or dislike its a great thing having your mother in the parish  thats all very well and of course shell do as she likes she may ask whom she pleases here and i shant interfere its the same as though it was her own house but i shall take lucy to lufton now lord lufton had been building his house at lufton for the last seven years and it was not yet finishedor nearly finished if all that his wife and mother said was true and if they could have their way it never would be finished and so in order that lord lufton might not be actually driven away by the turmoils of ecclesiastical contest the younger lady lufton would endeavour to moderate both the wrath and the zeal of the elder one and would struggle against the coming clergymen on this day however three sat at the board at framley and lady lufton in her justification to her son swore that the invitation had been given by her daughterinlaw you know my dear the dowager said to lord lufton something must be done for these poor crawleys and as the dean is away lucy wants to speak to the archdeacon about them  and the archdeacon could not subscribe his tenpound note without having mr champion to back him  my dear ludovic you do put it in such a way  never mind mother ive no special dislike to champion only as you are not paid five thousand a year for your trouble it is rather hard that you should have to do all the work of opposition bishop in the diocese  it was felt by them allincluding lord lufton himself who became so interested in the matter as to forgive the black coats before the evening was overthat this matter of mr crawleys committal was very serious and demanded the full energies of their party it was known to them all that the feeling at the palace was inimical to mr crawley that shebeelzebub hates him for his poverty and because arabin brought him into the diocese said the archdeacon permitting himself to use very strong language in his allusion to the bishops wife it must be recorded on his behalf that he used the phrase in the presence only of the gentlemen of the party i think he might have whispered the word into the ear of his confidential friend old lady lufton and perhaps have given no offence but he would not have ventured to use such words aloud in the presence of ladies  you forget archdeacon said dr thorne laughing that the shebeelzebub is my wifes particular friend  not a bit of it said the archdeacon your wife knows better than that you tell her what i call her and if she complains of the name ill unsay it it may therefore be supposed that dr thorne and mrs thorne and the archdeacon knew each other intimately and understood each others feelings on these matters  it was quite true that the palace party was inimical to mr crawley mr crawley undoubtedly was poor and had not been so submissive to episcopal authority as it behoves any clergyman to be whose loaves and fishes are scanty he had raised his back more than once against orders emanating from the palace in a manner that had made the hairs on the head of the bishops wife to stand almost on end and had taken as much upon himself as though his living had been worth twelve hundred a year mrs proudie almost as energetic in her language as the archdeacon had called him a beggarly perpetual curate we must have perpetual curates my dear the bishop had said they should know their places then but what can you expect of a creature from the deanery all that ought to be altered the dean should have no patronage in the diocese no dean should have any patronage it is an abuse from the beginning to the end dean arabin if he had any conscience would be doing the duty at hogglestock himself how the bishop strove to teach his wife with mildest words what really ought to be a deans duty and how the wife rejoined by teaching her husband not in the mildest words what ought to be a bishops duty we will not further inquire here the fact that such dialogues took place at the palace is recorded simply to show that the palatial feeling in barchester ran counter to mr crawley  and this was cause enough if no other cause existed for partiality to mr crawley at framley court but as has been partly explained there existed if possible even stronger ground than this for adherence to the crawley cause the younger lady lufton had known the crawleys intimately and the elder lady lufton had reckoned them among the neighbouring clerical families of her acquaintance both these ladies were therefore staunch in their defence of mr crawley the archdeacon himself had his own reasonsreasons which for the present he kept altogether within his own bosomfor wishing that mr crawley had never entered the diocese whether the perpetual curate should or should not be declared to be a thief it would be terrible to him to have to call the child of that perpetual curate his daughterinlaw but not the less on this occasion was he true to his order true to his side in the diocese true to his hatred of the palace  i dont believe it for a moment he said as he took his place on the rug before the fire in the drawingroom when the gentlemen came in from their wine the ladies understood at once what it was that he couldnt believe mr crawley had for the moment so usurped the county that nobody thought of talking of anything else  how is it then said mrs thorne that lord lufton and my husband and the other wiseacres at silverbridge have committed him for trial  because we were told to do so by the lawyer said dr thorne  ladies will never understand that magistrates must act in accordance with the law said lord lufton  but you all say hes not guilty said mrs robarts  the fact is that the magistrates cannot try the question said the archdeacon they only hear the primary evidence in this case i dont believe crawley would ever have been committed if he had employed an attorney instead of speaking for himself  why didnt somebody make him have an attorney said lady lufton  i dont think any attorney in the world could have spoken for him better than he spoke for himself said dr thorne  and yet you committed him said his wife what can we do for him cant we pay the bail and send him off to america  a jury will never find him guilty said lord lufton  and what is the truth of it asked the younger lady lufton  then the whole matter was discussed again and it was settled among them all that mr crawley had undoubtedly appropriated the cheque through temporary obliquity of judgmentobliquity of judgment and forgetfulness as to the source from whence the cheque had come to him he has picked it up about the house and then has thought that it was his own said lord lufton had they come to the conclusion that such an appropriation of money had been made by one of the clergy of the palace by one of the proudeian party they would doubtless have been very loud and very bitter as to the iniquity of the offender they would have said much as to the weakness of the bishop and the wickedness of the bishops wife and would have declared the appropriator to have been as very a thief as ever picked a pocket or opened a tillbut they were unanimous in their acquittal of mr crawley it had not been his intention they said to be a thief and a man should be judged only by his intention it must now be their object to induce a barchester jury to look at the matter in the same light  when they come to understand how the land lies said the archdeacon they will be all right theres not a tradesman in the city who does not hate that woman as though she were  archdeacon said his wife cautioning him to repress his energy  their bills are all paid by this new chaplain theyve got and he is made to claim discount on every leg of mutton said the archdeacon arguing from which factor from which assertion he came to the conclusion that no barchester jury would find mr crawley guilty  but it was agreed on all sides that it would not be well to trust to the unassisted friendship of the barchester tradesmen mr crawley must be provided with legal assistance and this must be furnished to him whether he should be willing or unwilling to receive it that there would be a difficulty was acknowledged mr crawley was known to be a man not easy of persuasion with a will of his own with a great energy of obstinacy on points which he chose to take up as being of importance to his calling or to his own professional status he had pleaded his own cause before the magistrates and it might be that he would insist on doing the same thing before the judge at last mr robarts the clergyman of framley was deputed from the knot of crawleian advocates assembled in lady luftons drawingroom to undertake the duty of seeing mr crawley and of explaining to him that his proper defence was regarded as a matter appertaining to the clergy and gentry generally of that part of the country and that for the sake of the clergy and gentry the defence must of course be properly conducted in such circumstances the expense of the defence would of course be borne by the clergy and gentry concerned it was thought that mr robarts could put the matter to mr crawley with such a mixture of the strength of manly friendship and the softness of clerical persuasion as to overcome the recognized difficulties of the task     chapter xi  the bishop sends his inhibition   tidings of mr crawleys fate reached the palace at barchester on the afternoon of the day on which the magistrates had committed him all such tidings travel very quickly conveyed by imperceptible wires and distributed by indefatigable message boys whom rumour seems to supply for the purpose barchester is twenty miles from silverbridge by road and more than forty by railway i doubt whether any one was commissioned to send the news along the actual telegraph and yet mrs proudie knew it before four oclock but she did not know it quite accurately bishop she said standing at her husbands study door they have committed that man to gaol there was no help for them unless they had forsworn themselves  not forsworn themselves my dear said the bishop striving as was usual with him by some meek and ineffectual word to teach his wife that she was occasionally led by her energy into error he never persisted in the lessons when he found as was usual that they were taken amiss  i say forsworn themselves said mrs proudie and now what do you mean to do this is thursday and of course the man must not be allowed to desecrate the church of hogglestock by performing the sunday services  if he has been committed my dear and is in prison  i said nothing about prison bishop  gaol my dear  i say they have committed him to gaol so my informant tells me but of course all the plumstead and framley set will move heaven and earth to get him out so that he may be there as a disgrace to the diocese i wonder how the dean will feel when he hears of it i do indeed for the dean though he is an idle useless man with no church principles and no real piety still he has a conscience i think he has a conscience  im sure he has my dear  welllet us hope so and if he has a conscience what must be his feelings when he hears that this creature whom he brought into the diocese has been committed to gaol along with common felons  not with felons my dear at least i should think not  i say with common felons a downright robbery of twenty pounds just as though he had broken into the bank and so he did with sly artifice which is worse in such hands than a crowbar and now what are we to do here is thursday and something must be done before sunday for the souls of those poor benighted creatures at hogglestock mrs proudie was ready for the battle and was even now sniffing the blood afaroff i believe its a hundred and thirty pounds a year she said before the bishop had collected his thoughts sufficiently for a reply  i think we must find out first of all whether he is really to be shut up in prison said the bishop  and suppose he is not to be shut up suppose they have been weak or untrue to their dutyand from what we know of the magistrates of barsetshire there is too much reason to suppose that they will have been so suppose they have let him out is he to go about like a roaring lionamong the souls of the people  the bishop shook in his shoes when mrs proudie began to talk of the souls of the people he always shook in his shoes she had an eloquent way of raising her voice over the word souls that was qualified to make any ordinary man shake in his shoes the bishop was a conscientious man and well knew that poor mr crawley even though he might have become a thief under terrible temptation would not roar at hogglestock to the injury of any mans soul he was aware that this poor clergyman had done his duty laboriously and efficiently and he was also aware that though he might have been committed by the magistrates and then let out upon bail he should not be regarded now in these days before his trial as a convicted thief but to explain all this to mrs proudie was beyond his power he knew well that she would not hear a word in mitigation of mr crawleys presumed offence mr crawley belonged to the other party and mrs proudie was a thoroughgoing partisan i know a manan excellent fellow who being himself a strong politician constantly expresses a belief that all politicians opposed to him are thieves childmurderers parricides lovers of incest demons upon the earth he is a strong partisan but not i think so strong as mrs proudie he says that he believes all evil of his opponents but she really believed the evil the archdeacon had called mrs proudie a shebeelzebub but that was a simple ebullition of mortal hatred he believed her to be simply a vulgar interfering brazenfaced virago mrs proudie in truth believed that the archdeacon was an actual emanation from satan sent to those parts to devour soulsas she would call itand that she herself was an emanation of another sort sent from another source expressly to barchester to prevent such devouring as far as it might possibly be prevented by a mortal agency the bishop knew it allunderstood it all he regarded the archdeacon as a clergyman belonging to a party opposed to his party and he disliked the man he knew that from his first coming into the diocese he had been encountered with enmity by the archdeacon and the archdeacons friends if left to himself he could feel and to a certain extent could resent such enmity but he had no faith in his wifes doctrine of emanations he had no faith in many things which she believed religiouslyand yet what could he do if he attempted to explain she would stop him before he had got through the first half of his first sentence  if he is out on bail commenced the bishop  of course he will be out on bail  then i think he should feel  feel such men never feel what feeling can one expect from a convicted thief  not convicted as yet my dear said the bishop  a convicted thief repeated mrs proudie and she vociferated the words in such a tone that the bishop resolved that he would for the future let the word convicted pass without notice after all she was only using the phrase in a peculiar sense given to it by herself  illustration a convicted thief repeated mrs proudie  it wont be proper certainly that he should do the services suggested the bishop  proper it would be a scandal to the whole diocese how could he raise his head as he pronounced the eighth commandment that must be at least prevented  the bishop who was seated fretted himself in his chair moving about with little movements he knew that there was a misery coming upon him and as far as he could see it might become a great miserya huge blistering sore upon him when miseries came to him as they did not unfrequently he would unconsciously endeavour to fathom them and weigh them and then with some gallantry resolve to bear them if he could find that their depth and weight were not too great for his powers of endurance he would let the cold wind whistle by him putting up the collar of his coat and would encounter the winter weather without complaint and he would be patient under the hot sun knowing well that tranquillity is best for those who have to bear tropical heat but when the storm threatened to knock him off his legs when the earth beneath him became too hot for his poor tender feetwhat could he do then there had been with him such periods of misery during which he had wailed inwardly and had confessed to himself that the wife of his bosom was too much for him now the storm seemed to be coming very roughly it would be demanded of him that he should exercise certain episcopal authority which he knew did not belong to him now episcopal authority admits of being stretched or contracted according to the character of the bishop who uses it it is not always easy for a bishop himself to know what he may do and what he may not do he may certainly give advice to any clergyman in his diocese and he may give it in such form that it will have in it something of authority such advice coming from a dominant bishop to a clergyman with a submissive mind has in it very much of authority but bishop proudie knew that mr crawley was not a clergyman with a submissive mind and he feared that he himself as regarded from mr crawleys point of view was not a dominant bishop and yet he could only act by advice i will write to him said the bishop and will explain to him that as he is circumstanced he should not appear in the reading desk  of course he must not appear in the reading desk that scandal must at any rate be inhibited now the bishop did not at all like the use of the word inhibited understanding well that mrs proudie intended it to be understood as implying some episcopal command against which there should be no appealbut he let it pass  i will write to him my dear tonight  and mr thumble can go over with the letter the first thing in the morning  will not the post be better  no bishop certainly not  he would get it sooner if i write tonight my dear  in either case he will get it tomorrow morning an hour or two will not signify and if mr thumble takes it himself we shall know how it is received it will be well that thumble should be there in person as he will want to look for lodgings in the parish  but my dear  well bishop  about lodgings i hardly think that mr thumble if we decide that mr thumble shall undertake the duty  we have decided that mr thumble should undertake the duty that is decided  but i do not think he should trouble himself to look for lodgings at hogglestock he can go over on the sundays  and who is to do the parish work would you have that man a convicted thief to look after the schools and visit the sick and perhaps attend the dying  there will be a great difficulty there will indeed said the bishop becoming very unhappy and feeling that he was driven by circumstances either to assert his own knowledge or teach his wife something of the law with reference to his position as a bishop who is to pay mr thumble  the income of the parish must be sequestrated and he must be paid out of that of course he must have the income while he does the work  but my dear i cannot sequestrate the mans income  i dont believe it bishop if the bishop cannot sequestrate who can but you are always timid in exercising the authority put into your hands for wise purposes not sequestrate the income of a man who has been proved to be a thief you leave that to us and we will manage it the us here named comprised mrs proudie and the bishops managing chaplain  then the bishop was left alone for an hour to write the letter which mr thumble was to carry over to mr crawleyand after a while he did write it before he commenced the task however he sat for some moments in his armchair close by the fireside asking himself whether it might not be possible for him to overcome his enemy in this matter how would it go with him suppose he were to leave the letter unwritten and send in a message by his chaplain to mrs proudie saying that as mr crawley was out on bail the parish might be left for the present without episcopal interference she could not make him interfere she could not force him to write the letter so at least he said to himself but as he said it he almost thought that she could do these things in the last thirty years or more she had ever contrived by some power latent in her to have her will effected but what would happen if now even now he were to rebel that he would personally become very uncomfortable he was well aware but he thought that he could bear that the food would become badmere ashes between his teeth the daily modicum of wine would lose its flavour the chimneys would all smoke the wind would come from the east and the servants would not answer the bell little miseries of that kind would crowd upon him he had arrived at a time of life in which such miseries make such men very miserable but yet he thought that he could endure them and what other wretchedness would come to him she would scold himfrightfully loudly scornfully and worse than all continually but of this he had so much habitually that anything added might be borne alsoif only he could be sure that the scoldings should go on in private that the world of the palace should not be allowed to hear the revilings to which he would be subjected but to be scolded publicly was the great evil which he dreaded beyond all evils he was well aware that the palace would know his misfortune that it was known and freely discussed by all from the examining chaplain down to the palace bootboynay that it was known to all the diocese but yet he could smile upon those around him and look as though he held his own like other menunless when open violence was displayed but when that voice was heard aloud along the corridors of the palace and when he was summoned imperiously by the woman calling for her bishop so that all barchester heard it and when he was compelled to creep forth from his study at the sound of that summons with distressed face and shaking hands and short hurrying stepsa being to be pitied even by a deaconnot venturing to assume an air of masterdom should he chance to meet a housemaid on the stairsthen at such moments as that he would feel that any submission was better than the misery which he suffered and he well knew that should he now rebel the whole house would be in a turmoil he would be bishoped here and bishoped there before the eyes of all palatial men and women till life would be a burden to him so he got up from his seat over the fire and went to his desk and wrote the letter the letter was as follows      the palace barchester  december 186     reverend sirhe left out the dear because he knew    that if he inserted it he would be compelled to write the    letter over again     i have heard today with the greatest trouble of spirit    that you have been taken before a bench of magistrates    assembled at silverbridge having been previously arrested    by the police in your parsonage house at hogglestock and    that the magistrates of silverbridge have committed you to    take your trial at the next assizes at barchester on a    charge of theft     far be it from me to prejudge the case you will    understand reverend sir that i express no opinion    whatever as to your guilt or innocence in this matter    if you have been guilty may the lord give you grace to    repent of your great sin and to make such amends as may    come from immediate acknowledgment and confession if you    are innocent may he protect you and make your innocence    to shine before all men in either case may the lord be    with you and keep your feet from further stumbling     but i write to you now as your bishop to explain to you    that circumstanced as you are you cannot with decency    perform the church services of your parish i have that    confidence in you that i doubt not you will agree with    me in this and will be grateful to me for relieving you    so far from the immediate perplexities of your position    i have therefore appointed the rev caleb thumble to    perform the duties of incumbent of hogglestock till such    time as a jury shall have decided upon your case at    barchester and in order that you may at once become    acquainted with mr thumble as will be most convenient    that you should do i will commission him to deliver this    letter into your hand personally tomorrow trusting that    you will receive him with that brotherly spirit in which    he is sent upon this painful mission     touching the remuneration to which mr thumble will become    entitled for his temporary ministrations in the parish    of hogglestock i do not at present lay down any strict    injunction he must at any rate be paid at a rate not    less than that ordinarily afforded for a curate     i will once again express my fervent hope that the lord    may bring you to see the true state of your own soul and    that he may fill you with the grace of repentance so that    the bitter waters of the present hour may not pass over    your head and destroy you     i have the honour to be    reverend sir    your faithful servant in christ     t barnum     baronum castrum having been the old roman name from which    the modern barchester is derived the bishops of the    diocese have always signed themselves barnum   the bishop had hardly finished his letter when mrs proudie returned to the study followed by the rev caleb thumble mr thumble was a little man about forty years of age who had a wife and children living in barchester and who existed on such chance clerical crumbs as might fall from the table of the bishops patronage people in barchester said that mrs thumble was a cousin of mrs proudies but as mrs proudie stoutly denied the connection it may be supposed that the people of barchester were wrong and had mr thumbles wife in truth been a cousin mrs proudie would surely have provided for him during the many years in which the diocese had been in her hands no such provision had been made and mr thumble who had now been living in the diocese for three years had received nothing else from the bishop than such chance employment as this which he was now to undertake at hogglestock he was a humble mildvoiced man when within the palace precincts and had so far succeeded in making his way among his brethren in the cathedral city as to be employed not unfrequently for absent minor canons in chanting the weekday services being remunerated for his work at the rate of about two shillings and sixpence a service  the bishop handed his letter to his wife observing in an offhand kind of way that she might as well see what he said of course i shall read it said mrs proudie and the bishop winced visibly because mr thumble was present quite right said mrs proudie quite right to let him know that you knew that he had been arrestedactually arrested by the police  i thought it proper to mention that because of the scandal said the bishop  oh it has been terrible in the city said mr thumble  never mind mr thumble said mrs proudie never mind that at present then she continued to read the letter whats this confession that must come out bishop it will never do that you should recommend confession to anybody under any circumstances  but my dear  it must come out bishop  my lord has not meant auricular confession suggested mr thumble then mrs proudie turned round and looked at mr thumble and mr thumble nearly sank amidst the tables and chairs i beg your pardon mrs proudie he said i didnt mean to intrude  the word must come out bishop repeated mrs proudie there should be no stumblingblocks prepared for feet that are only too ready to fall and the word did come out  now mr thumble said the lady as she gave the letter to her satellite the bishop and i wish you to be at hogglestock early tomorrow you should be there not later than ten certainly then she paused until mr thumble had given the required promise and we request that you will be very firm in the mission which is confided to you a mission which as of course you see is of a very delicate and important nature you must be firm  i will endeavour said mr thumble  the bishop and i both feel that this most unfortunate man must not under any circumstances be allowed to perform the services of the church while this charge is hanging over hima charge as to the truth of which no sane man can entertain a doubt  im afraid not mrs proudie said mr thumble  the bishop and i therefore are most anxious that you should make mr crawley understand at onceat once and the lady as she spoke lifted up her left hand with an eloquent violence which had its effect upon mr thumble that he is inhibitedthe bishop shook in his shoesinhibited from the performance of any of his sacred duties thereupon mr thumble promised obedience and went his way     chapter xii  mr crawley seeks for sympathy   illustration  matters went very badly indeed in the parsonage house at hogglestock on the friday morning the morning of the day after his committal mr crawley got up very early long before the daylight and dressing himself in the dark groped his way downstairs his wife having vainly striven to persuade him to remain where he was followed him into the cold room below with a lighted candle she found him standing with his hat on and with his old cloak as though he were prepared to go out why do you do this she said you will make yourself ill with the cold and the night air and then you and i too will be worse than we now are  we cannot be worse you cannot be worse and for me it does not signify let me pass  i will not let you pass josiah be a man and bear it ask god for strength instead of seeking it in an overindulgence of your own sorrow  indulgence  yes loveindulgence it is indulgence you will allow your mind to dwell on nothing for a moment but your own wrongs  what else have i that i can think of is not all the world against me  am i against you  sometimes i think you are when you accuse me of selfindulgence you are against meme who for myself have desired nothing but to be allowed to do my duty and to have bread enough to keep me alive and clothes enough to make me decent  is it not selfindulgence this giving way to grief who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others come love lay down your hat it cannot be fitting that you should go out into the wet and cold of the raw morning  for a moment he hesitated but as she raised her hand to take his cloak from him he drew back from her and would not permit it i shall find those up whom i want to see he said i must visit my flock and i dare not go through the parish by daylight lest they hoot after me as a thief  not one in hogglestock would say a word to insult you  would they not the very children in the school whisper at me let me pass i say it has not as yet come to that that i should be stopped in my egress and ingress they havebailed me and while their bail lasts i may go where i will  oh josiah what words to me have i ever stopped your liberty would i not give my life to secure it  let me go then now i tell you that i have business in hand  but i will go with you i will be ready in an instant  you go why should you go are there not the children for you to mind  there is only jane  stay with her then why should you go about the parish she still held him by the cloak and looked anxiously up into his face woman he said raising his voice what is it that you dread i command you to tell me what is it that you fear he had now taken hold of her by the shoulder slightly thrusting her from him so that he might see her face by the dim light of the single candle speak i say what is that you think that i shall do  dearest i know that you will be better at home better with me than you can be on such a morning as this out in the cold damp air  and is that all he looked hard at her while she returned his gaze with beseeching loving eyes is there nothing behind that you will not tell me  she paused for a moment before she replied she had never lied to him she could not lie to him i wish you knew my heart towards you she said with all and everything in it  i know your heart well but i want to know your mind why would you persuade me not to go out among my poor  because it will be bad for you to be out alone in the dark lanes in the mud and wet thinking of your sorrow you will brood over it till you will lose your senses through the intensity of your grief you will stand out in the cold air forgetful of everything around you till your limbs will be numbed and your blood chilled  and then  oh josiah do not hold me like that and look at me so angrily  and even then i will bear my burden till the lord in his mercy shall see fit to relieve me even then i will endure though a bare bodkin or a leaf of hemlock would put an end to it let me pass on you need fear nothing  she did let him pass without another word and he went out of the house shutting the door after him noiselessly and closing the wicketgate of the garden for a while she sat herself down on the nearest chair and tried to make up her mind how she might best treat him in his present state of mind as regarded the present morning her heart was at ease she knew that he would do now nothing of that which she had apprehended she could trust him not to be false in his word to her though she could not before have trusted him not to commit so much heavier a sin if he would really employ himself from morning till night among the poor he would be better sohis trouble would be easier of endurancethan with any other employment which he could adopt what she most dreaded was that he should sit idle over the fire and do nothing when he was so seated she could read his mind as though it was open to her as a book she had been quite right when she had accused him of overindulgence in his grief he did give way to it till it became a luxury to hima luxury which she would not have had the heart to deny him had she not felt it to be of all luxuries the most pernicious during these long hours in which he would sit speechless doing nothing he was telling himself from minute to minute that of all gods creatures he was the most heavily afflicted and was revelling in the sense of the injustice done to him he was recalling all the facts of his life his education which had been costly and as regarded knowledge successful his vocation to the church when in his youth he had determined to devote himself to the service of his saviour disregarding promotion or the favour of men the short sweet days of his early love in which he had devoted himself againthinking nothing of self but everything of her his diligent working in which he had ever done his very utmost for the parish in which he was placed and always his best for the poorest the success of other men who had been his compeers and as he too often told himself intellectually his inferiors then of his children who had been carried off from his love to the churchyardover whose graves he himself had stood reading out the pathetic words of the funeral service with unswerving voice and a bleeding heart and then of his children still living who loved their mother so much better than they loved him and he would recall all the circumstances of his povertyhow he had been driven to accept alms to fly from creditors to hide himself to see his chairs and tables seized before the eyes of those over whom he had been set as their spiritual pastor and in it all i think there was nothing so bitter to the man as the derogation from the spiritual grandeur of his position as priest among men which came as one necessary result from his poverty st paul could go forth without money in his purse or shoes to his feet or two suits to his back and his poverty never stood in the way of his preaching or hindered the veneration of the faithful st paul indeed was called upon to bear stripes was flung into prison encountered terrible dangers but mr crawleyso he told himselfcould have encountered all that without flinching the stripes and scorn of the unfaithful would have been nothing to him if only the faithful would have believed in him poor as he was as they would have believed in him had he been rich even they whom he had most loved treated him almost with derision because he was now different from them dean arabin had laughed at him because he had persisted in walking ten miles through the mud instead of being conveyed in the deans carriage and yet after that he had been driven to accept the deans charity no one respected him no one his very wife thought that he was a lunatic and now he had been publicly branded as a thief and in all likelihood would end his days in a gaol such were always his thoughts as he sat idle silent moody over the fire and his wife well knew their currents it would certainly be better that he should drive himself to some employment if any employment could be found possible to him  when she had been alone for a few minutes mrs crawley got up from her chair and going into the kitchen lighted the fire there and put the kettle over it and began to prepare such breakfast for her husband as the means in the house afforded then she called the sleeping servantgirl who was little more than a child and went into her own girls room and then she got into bed with her daughter  i have been up with your papa dear and i am cold  oh mamma poor mamma why is papa up so early  he has gone out to visit some of the brickmakers before they go to their work it is better for him to be employed  but mamma it is pitch dark  yes dear it is still dark sleep again for a while and i will sleep too i think grace will be here tonight and then there will be no room for me here  mr crawley went forth and made his way with rapid steps to a portion of his parish nearly two miles distant from his house through which was carried a canal affording water communication in some intricate way both to london and bristol and on the brink of this canal there had sprung up a colony of brickmakers the nature of the earth in those parts combining with the canal to make brickmaking a suitable trade the workmen there assembled were not for the most part nativeborn hogglestockians or folk descended from hogglestockian parents they had come thither from unknown regions as labourers of that class do come when they are needed some young men from that and neighbouring parishes had joined themselves to the colony allured by wages and disregarding the menaces of the neighbouring farmers but they were all in appearance and manners nearer akin to the race of navvies than to ordinary rural labourers they had a bad name in the country but it may be that their name was worse than their deserts the farmers hated them and consequently they hated the farmers they had a beershop and a grocers shop and a huxters shop for their own accommodation and were consequently vilified by the small oldestablished tradesmen around them they got drunk occasionally but i doubt whether they drank more than did the farmers themselves on marketday they fought among themselves sometimes but they forgave each other freely and seemed to have no objection to black eyes i fear that they were not always good to their wives nor were their wives always good to them but it should be remembered that among the poor especially when they live in clusters such misfortunes cannot be hidden as they may be amidst the decent belongings of more wealthy people that they worked very hard was certain and it was certain also that very few of their number ever came upon the poor rates what became of the old brickmakers no one knew who ever sees a wornout aged navvie  mr crawley ever since his first coming into hogglestock had been very busy among these brickmakers and by no means without success indeed the farmers had quarrelled with him because the brickmakers had so crowded the narrow parish church as to leave but scant room for decent people doo they folk pay tithes thats what i want un to tell me argued one farmernot altogether unnaturally believing as he did that mr crawley was paid by tithes out of his own pocket but mr crawley had done his best to make the brickmakers welcome at the church scandalizing the farmers by causing them to sit or stand in any portion of the church which was hitherto unappropriated he had been constant in his personal visits to them and had felt himself to be more a st paul with them than with any other of his neighbours around him  it was a cold morning but the rain of the preceding evening had given way to frost and the air though sharp was dry the ground under the feet was crisp having felt the wind and frost and was no longer clogged with mud in his present state of mind the walk was good for our poor pastor and exhilarated him but still as he went he thought always of his injuries his own wife believed that he was about to commit suicide and for so believing he was very angry with her and yet as he well knew the idea of making away with himself had flitted through his own mind a dozen times not from his own wife could he get real sympathy he would see what he could do with a certain brickmaker of his acquaintance  are you here dan he said knocking at the door of a cottage which stood alone close to the towingpath of the canal and close also to a forlorn corner of the muddy watery ugly disordered brickfield it was now just past six oclock and the men would be rising as in midwinter they commenced their work at seven the cottage was an unalluring straight brickbuilt tenement seeming as though intended to be one of a row which had never progressed beyond number one a voice answered from the interior inquiring who was the visitor to which mr crawley replied by giving his name then the key was turned in the lock and dan morris the brickmaker appeared with a candle in his hand he had been engaged in lighting the fire with a view to his own breakfast where is your wife dan asked mr crawley the man answered by pointing with a short poker which he held in his hand to the bed which was half screened from the room by a ragged curtain which hung from the ceiling halfway down to the floor and are the darvels here asked mr crawley then morris again using the poker pointed upwards showing that the darvels were still in their own allotted abode upstairs  youre early out muster crawley said morris and then he went on with his fire drat the sticks if they beant as wet as the old un hisself get up old woman and do you do it for i cant they wunt kindle for me nohow but the old woman having well noted the presence of mr crawley thought it better to remain where she was  mr crawley sat himself down by the obstinate fire and began to arrange the sticks dan dan said a voice from the bed sure you wouldnt let his reverence trouble himself with the fire  how be i to keep him from it if he chooses i didnt ax him then morris stood by and watched and after a while mr crawley succeeded in his attempt  how could it burn when you had not given the small spark a current of air to help it said mr crawley  in course not said the woman but he be such a stupid  the husband said no word in acknowledgment of this compliment nor did he thank mr crawley for what he had done nor appear as though he intended to take any notice of him he was going on with his work when mr crawley again interrupted him  how did you get back from silverbridge yesterday dan  footed itall the blessed way  its only eight miles  and i footed it there and thats sixteen and i paid oneandsixpence for beer and grubshelp me i did  dan said the voice from the bed rebuking him for the impropriety of his language  well i beg pardon but i did and they guv me two bobjust two plain shillings by   dan  and id ve arned threeandsix here at brickmaking easy thats what i would hows a poor man to live that way theyll not cotch me at barchester sizes at that price they may be sure of that look therethats what ive got for my day and he put his hand into his breechespocket and fetched out a sixpence hows a man to fill his belly out of that damnation  dan  well what did i say hold your jaw will you and not be halloaing at me that way i know what im a saying of and what im a doing of  i wish theyd given you something more with all my heart said crawley  we knows that said the woman from the bed we is sure of that your reverence  sixpence said the man scornfully if theyd have guv me nothing at all but the run of my teeth at the publichouse id ve taken it better but sixpence  then there was a pause and what have they given to me said mr crawley when the mans illhumour about his sixpence had so far subsided as to allow of his busying himself again about the premises  yes indeedyes indeed said the woman yes yes we feel that we do indeed mr crawley  i tell you what sir for another sixpence id ve sworn youd never guv me the paper at all and so i will now if it beant too latesixpence or no sixpence what do i care d them  dan  and why shouldnt i they haint got brains enough among them to winny the truth from the liesnot among the lot of em ill swear afore the judge that you didnt give it me at all if thatll do any good  man do you think i would have you perjure yourself even if that would do me a service and do you think that any man was ever served by a lie  faix among them chaps it dont do to tell them too much of the truth look at that and he brought out the sixpence again from his breechespocket and look at your reverence only that theyve let you out for a while theyve been nigh as hard on you as though you were one of us  if they think that i stole it they have been right said mr crawley  its been along of that chap soames said the woman the lord would ve paid the money out of his own pocket and never said not a word  if they think that ive been a thief theyve done right repeated mr crawley but how can they think so how can they think so have i lived like a thief among them  for the matter o that if a man aint paid for his work by them as is his employers he must pay hisself thems my notions look at that whereupon he again pulled out the sixpence and held it forth in the palm of his hand  you believe then said mr crawley speaking very slowly that i did steal the money speak out dan i shall not be angry as you go you are honest men and i want to know what such of you think about it  he dont think nothing of the kind said the woman almost getting out of bed in her energy if hed athought the like o that in his head id read un such a lesson hed never think again the longest day he had to live  speak out dan said the clergyman not attending to the woman you can understand that no good can come of a lie dan morris scratched his head speak out man when i tell you said crawley  illustration speak out dan  drat it all said dan wheres the use of so much jaw about it  say you know his reverence is as innocent as the babe as isnt born said the woman  no i wontsay nothing of the kind said dan  speak out the truth said crawley  they do say among em said dan that you picked it up and then got a woolgathering in your head till you didnt rightly know where it come from then he paused and after a bit you guv it me to get the money didnt you now  i did  and they do say if a poor man had done it itd been stealing for sartain  and im a poor manthe poorest in all hogglestock and therefore of course it is stealing of course i am a thief yes of course i am a thief when did not the world believe the worst of the poor having so spoken mr crawley rose from his chair and hurried out of the cottage waiting no further reply from dan morris or his wife and as he made his way slowly home not going there by the direct road but by a long circuit he told himself that there could be no sympathy for him anywhere even dan morris the brickmaker thought that he was a thief  and am i a thief he said to himself standing in the middle of the road with his hands up to his forehead     chapter xiii  the bishops angel   it was nearly nine before mr crawley got back to his house and found his wife and daughter waiting breakfast for him i should not wonder if grace were over here today said mrs crawley shed better remain where she is said he after this the meal passed almost without a word when it was over jane at a sign from her mother went up to her father and asked him whether she should read with him not now he said not just now i must rest my brain before it will be fit for any work then he got into the chair over the fire and his wife began to fear that he would remain there all the day  but the morning was not far advanced when there came a visitor who disturbed him and by disturbing him did him real service just at ten there arrived at the little gate before the house a man on a pony whom jane espied standing there by the ponys head and looking about for some one to relieve him from the charge of his steed this was mr thumble who had ridden over to hogglestock on a poor spavined brute belonging to the bishops stable and which had once been the bishops cob now it was the vehicle by which mrs proudies episcopal messages were sent backwards and forwards through a twelvemiles ride round barchester and so many were the ladys requirements that the poor animal by no means eat the hay of idleness mr thumble had suggested to mrs proudie after their interview with the bishop and the giving up of the letter to the clerical messengers charge that before hiring a gig from the dragon of wantley he should be glad to knowlooking as he always did to mary anne and the childrenwhence the price of the gig was to be returned to him mrs proudie had frowned at himnot with all the austerity of frowning which she could use when really angered but simply with a frown which gave her some little time for thought and would enable her to continue the rebuke if after thinking she should find that rebuke was needed but mature consideration showed her that mr thumbles caution was not without reason were the bishop energeticor even the bishops managing chaplain as energetic as he should be mr crawley might as mrs proudie felt assured be made in some way to pay for a conveyance for mr thumble but the energy was lacking and the price of the gig if the gig were ordered would certainly fall ultimately upon the bishops shoulders this was very sad mrs proudie had often grieved over the necessary expenditure of episcopal surveillance and had been heard to declare her opinion that a liberal allowance for secret service should be made in every diocese what better could the ecclesiastical commissioners do with all those rich revenues which they had stolen from the bishops but there was no such liberal allowance at present and therefore mrs proudie after having frowned at mr thumble for some seconds desired him to take the grey cob now mr thumble had ridden the grey cob before and would much have preferred a gig but even the grey cob was better than a gig at his own cost  mamma theres a man at the gate wanting to come in said jane i think hes a clergyman  mr crawley immediately raised his head though he did not at once leave his chair mrs crawley went to the window and recognized the reverend visitor my dear it is that mr thumble who is so much with the bishop  what does mr thumble want with me  nay my dear he will tell you that himself but mrs crawley though she answered him with a voice intended to be cheerful greatly feared the coming of this messenger from the palace she perceived at once that the bishop was about to interfere with her husband in consequence of that which the magistrates had done yesterday  mamma he doesnt know what to do with his pony said jane  tell him to tie it to the rail said mr crawley if he has expected to find menials here as he has them at the palace he will be wrong if he wants to come in here let him tie the beast to the rail so jane went out and sent a message to mr thumble by the girl and mr thumble did tie the pony to the rail and followed the girl into the house jane in the meantime had retired out by the back door to the school but mrs crawley kept her ground she kept her ground although she almost believed that her husband would prefer to have the field to himself as mr thumble did not at once enter the room mr crawley stalked to the door and stood with it open in his hand though he knew mr thumbles person he was not acquainted with him and therefore he simply bowed to the visitor bowing more than once or twice with a cold courtesy which did not put mr thumble altogether at his ease my name is mr thumble said the visitorthe reverend caleb thumble and he held the bishops letter in his hand mr crawley seemed to take no notice of the letter but motioned mr thumble with his hand into the room  i suppose you have come over from barchester this morning said mrs crawley  yes madamfrom the palace mr thumble though a humble man in positions in which he felt that humility would become hima humble man to his betters as he himself would have expressed ithad still about him something of that pride which naturally belonged to those clergymen who were closely attached to the palace at barchester had he been sent on a message to plumsteadcould any such message from barchester palace have been possible he would have been properly humble in his demeanour to the archdeacon or to mrs grantly had he been admitted to the august presence of that lady but he was aware that humility would not become him on his present mission he had been expressly ordered to be firm by mrs proudie and firm he meant to be and therefore in communicating to mrs crawley the fact that he had come from the palace he did load the tone of his voice with something of dignity which mr crawley might perhaps be excused for regarding as arrogance  and what does the palace want with me said mr crawley mrs crawley knew at once that there was to be a battle nay the battle had begun nor was she altogether sorry for though she could not trust her husband to sit alone all day in his armchair over the fire she could trust him to carry on a disputation with any other clergyman on any subject whatever what does the palace want with me and as mr crawley asked the question he stood erect and looked mr thumble full in the face mr thumble called to mind the fact that mr crawley was a very poor man indeedso poor that he owed money all round the country to butchers and bakers and the other fact that he mr thumble himself did not owe any money to any one his wife luckily having a little income of her own and strengthened by these remembrances he endeavoured to bear mr crawleys attack with gallantry  of course mr crawley you are aware that this unfortunate affair at silverbridge  i am not prepared sir to discuss the unfortunate affair at silverbridge with a stranger if you are the bearer of any message to me from the bishop of barchester perhaps you will deliver it  i have brought a letter said mr thumble then mr crawley stretched out his hand without a word and taking the letter with him to the window read it very slowly when he had made himself master of its contents he refolded the letter placed it again in the envelope and returned to the spot where mr thumble was standing i will answer the bishops letter he said i will answer it of course as it is fitting that i should do shall i ask you to wait for my reply or shall i send it by course of post  i think mr crawley as the bishop wishes me to undertake the duty  you will not undertake the duty mr thumble you need not trouble yourself for i shall not surrender my pulpit to you  but the bishop  i care nothing for the bishop in this matter so much he spoke in anger and then he corrected himself i crave the bishops pardon and yours as his messenger if in the heat occasioned by my strong feelings i have said aught which may savour of irreverence towards his lordships office i respect his lordships high position as bishop of this diocese and i bow to his commands in all things lawful but i must not bow to him in things unlawful nor must i abandon my duty before god at his bidding unless his bidding be given in accordance with the canons of the church and the laws of the land it will be my duty on the coming sunday to lead the prayers of my people in the church of my parish and to preach to them from my pulpit and that duty with gods assistance i will perform nor will i allow any clergyman to interfere with me in the performance of those sacred officesno not though the bishop himself should be present with the object of enforcing his illegal command mr crawley spoke these words without hesitation even with eloquence standing upright and with something of a noble anger gleaming over his poor wan face and i think that while speaking them he was happier than he had been for many a long day  mr thumble listened to him patiently standing with one foot a little in advance of the other with one hand folded over the other with his head rather on one side and with his eyes fixed on the corner where the wall and ceiling joined each other he had been told to be firm and he was considering how he might best display firmness he thought that he remembered some story of two parsons fighting for one pulpit and he thought also that he should not himself like to incur the scandal of such a proceeding in the diocese as to the law in the matter he knew nothing himself but he presumed that a bishop would probably know the law better than a perpetual curate that mrs proudie was intemperate and imperious he was aware had the message come from her alone he might have felt that even for her sake he had better give way but as the despotic arrogance of the lady had been in this case backed by the timid presence and hesitating words of her lord mr thumble thought that he must have the law on his side i think you will find mr crawley said he that the bishops inhibition is strictly legal he had picked up the powerful word from mrs proudie and flattered himself that it might be of use to him in carrying his purpose  it is illegal said mr crawley speaking somewhat louder than before and will be absolutely futile as you pleaded to me that you yourself and your own personal convenience were concerned in this matter i have made known my intentions to you which otherwise i should have made known only to the bishop if you please we will discuss the subject no further  am i to understand mr crawley that you refuse to obey the bishop  the bishop has written to me sir and i will make known my intention to the bishop by a written answer as you have been the bearer of the bishops letter to me i am bound to ask you whether i shall be indebted to you for carrying back my reply or whether i shall send it by course of post mr thumble considered for a moment and then made up his mind that he had better wait and carry back the epistle this was friday and the letter could not be delivered by post till the saturday morning mrs proudie might be angry with him if he should be the cause of loss of time he did not however at all like waiting having perceived that mr crawley though with language courteously worded had spoken of him as a mere messenger  i think he said that i may perhaps best further the object which we must all have in view that namely of providing properly for the sunday services of the church of hogglestock by taking your reply personally to the bishop  that provision is my care and need trouble no one else said mr crawley in a loud voice then before seating himself at his old desk he stood awhile pondering with his back turned to his visitor i have to ask your pardon sir said he looking round for a moment because by reason of the extreme poverty of this house my wife is unable to offer to you that hospitality which is especially due from one clergyman to another  oh dont mention it said mr thumble  if you will allow me sir i would prefer that it should be mentioned then he seated himself at his desk and commenced his letter  mr thumble felt himself to be awkwardly placed had there been no third person in the room he could have sat down in mr crawleys armchair and waited patiently till the letter should be finished but mrs crawley was there and of course he was bound to speak to her in what strain could he do so even he little as he was given to indulge in sentiment had been touched by the mans appeal to his own poverty and he felt moreover that mrs crawley must have been deeply moved by her husbands position with reference to the bishops order it was quite out of the question that he should speak of that as mr crawley would he was well aware immediately turn upon him at last he thought of a subject and spoke with a voice intended to be pleasant that was the schoolhouse i passed probably just as i came here mrs crawley told him that it was the schoolhouse ah yes i thought so have you a certified teacher here mrs crawley explained that no government aid had ever reached hogglestock besides themselves they had only a young woman whom they themselves had instructed ah that is a pity said mr thumble  ii am the certified teacher said mr crawley turning round upon him from his chair  oh ah yes said mr thumble and after that mr thumble asked no more questions about the hogglestock school soon afterwards mrs crawley left the room seeing the difficulty under which mr thumble was labouring and feeling sure that her presence would not now be necessary mr crawleys letter was written quickly though every now and then he would sit for a moment with his pen poised in the air searching his memory for a word but the words came to him easily and before an hour was over he had handed his letter to mr thumble the letter was as follows      the parsonage hogglestock dec 186     right reverend lord     i have received the letter of yesterdays date which your    lordship has done me the honour of sending to me by the    hands of the reverend mr thumble and i avail myself of    that gentlemans kindness to return to you an answer by    the same means moved thus to use his patience chiefly    by the consideration that in this way my reply to your    lordships injunctions may be in your hands with less    delay than would attend the regular course of the    mailpost     it is with deep regret that i feel myself constrained to    inform your lordship that i cannot obey the command which    you have laid upon me with reference to the services of my    church in this parish i cannot permit mr thumble or any    other delegate from your lordship to usurp my place in my    pulpit i would not have you to think if i can possibly    dispel such thoughts from your mind that i disregard your    high office or that i am deficient in that respectful    obedience to the bishop set over me which is due to the    authority of the crown as the head of the church in these    realms but in this as in all questions of obedience he    who is required to obey must examine the extent of the    authority exercised by him who demands obedience your    lordship might possibly call upon me using your voice as    bishop of the diocese to abandon altogether the freehold    rights which are now mine in this perpetual curacy the    judge of assize before whom i shall soon stand for my    trial might command me to retire to prison without a    verdict given by the jury the magistrates who committed    me so lately as yesterday upon whose decision in that    respect your lordship has taken action against me so    quickly might have equally strained their authority but    in no case in this land is he that is subject bound    to obey further than where the law gives authority and    exacts obedience it is not in the power of the crown    itself to inhibit me from the performance of my ordinary    duties in this parish by any such missive as that sent to    me by your lordship if your lordship think it right to    stop my mouth as a clergyman in your diocese you must    proceed to do so in an ecclesiastical court in accordance    with the laws and will succeed in your object or fail    in accordance with the evidences as to ministerial fitness    or unfitness which may be produced respecting me before    the proper tribunal     i will allow that much attention is due from a clergyman    to pastoral advice given to him by his bishop on that    head i must first express to your lordship my full    understanding that your letter has not been intended to    convey advice but an orderan inhibition as your    messenger the reverend mr thumble has expressed it    there might be a case certainly in which i should submit    myself to counsel though i should resist command no    counsel however has been givenexcept indeed that i    should receive your messenger in a proper spirit which    i hope i have done no other advice has been given me    and therefore there is now no such case as that i have    imagined but in this matter my lord i could not have    accepted advice from living man no not though the    hands of the apostles themselves had made him bishop    who tendered it to me and had set him over me for my    guidance i am in a terrible strait trouble and sorrow    and danger are upon me and mine it may well be as your    lordship says that the bitter waters of the present    hour may pass over my head and destroy me i thank    your lordship for telling me whither i am to look for    assistance truly i know not whether there is any to be    found for me on earth but the deeper my troubles the    greater my sorrow the more pressing my danger the    stronger is my need that i should carry myself in these    days with that outward respect of self which will teach    those around me to know that let who will condemn me i    have not condemned myself were i to abandon my pulpit    unless forced to do so by legal means i should in doing    so be putting a plea of guilty against myself upon the    record this my lord i will not do     i have the honour to be my lord    your lordships most obedient servant     josiah crawley   when he had finished writing his letter he read it over slowly and then handed it to mr thumble the act of writing and the current of the thoughts through his brain and the feeling that in every word written he was getting the better of the bishopall this joined to a certain manly delight in warfare against authority lighted up the mans face and gave to his eyes an expression which had been long wanting to them his wife at that moment came into the room and he looked at her with an air of triumph as he handed the letter to mr thumble if you will give that to his lordship with an assurance of my duty to his lordship in all things proper i will thank you kindly craving your pardon for the great delay to which you have been subjected  as to the delay that is nothing said mr thumble  it has been much but you as a clergyman will feel that it has been incumbent on me to speak my mind fully  oh yes of course mr crawley was standing up as also was mrs crawley it was evident to mr thumble that they both expected that he should go but he had been specially enjoined to be firm and he doubted whether hitherto he had been firm enough as far as this mornings work had as yet gone it seemed to him that mr crawley had had the play all to himself and that he mr thumble had not had his innings he from the palace had been as it were cowed by this man who had been forced to plead his own poverty it was certainly incumbent upon him before he went to speak up not only for the bishop but for himself also mr crawley he said hitherto i have listened to you patiently  nay said mr crawley smiling you have indeed been patient and i thank you but my words have been written not spoken  you have told me that you intend to disobey the bishops inhibition  i have told the bishop so certainly  may i ask you now to listen to me for a few minutes  mr crawley still smiling still having in his eyes the unwonted triumph which had lighted them up paused a moment and then answered him reverend sir you must excuse me if i say nonot on this subject  you will not let me speak  no not on this matter which is very private to me what should you think if i went into your house and inquired of you as to those things which were particularly near to you  but the bishop sent me  though ten bishops had sent mea council of archbishops if you will mr thumble started back appalled at the energy of the words used to him shall a man have nothing of his ownno sorrow in his heart no care in his family no thought in his breast so private and special to him but that if he happen to be a clergyman the bishop may touch it with his thumb  i am not the bishops thumb said mr thumble drawing himself up  i intended not to hint anything personally objectionable to yourself i will regard you as one of the angels of the church mr thumble when he heard this began to be sure that mr crawley was mad he knew of no angels that could ride about the barsetshire lanes on grey ponies and as such i will respect you but i cannot discuss with you the matter of the bishops message  oh very well i will tell his lordship  i will pray you to do so  and his lordship should he so decide will arm me with such power on my next coming as will enable me to carry out his lordships wishes  his lordship will abide by the law as will you also in speaking these last words he stood with the door in his hand and mr thumble not knowing how to increase or even to maintain his firmness thought it best to pass out and mount his grey pony and ride away  the poor man thought that you were laughing at him when you called him an angel of the church said mrs crawley coming up to him and smiling on him  had i told him he was simply a messenger he would have taken it worsepoor fool when they have rid themselves of me they may put him here in my church but not yetnot yet where is jane tell her that i am ready to commence the seven against thebes with her then jane was immediately sent for out of the school and the seven against thebes was commenced with great energy often during the next hour and a half mrs crawley from the kitchen would hear him reading out or rather saying by rote with sonorous rolling voice great passages from some chorus and she was very thankful to the bishop who had sent over to them a message and a messenger which had been so salutary in their effect upon her husband in truth an angel of the church she said to herself as she chopped up the onions for the muttonbroth and ever afterwards she regarded mr thumble as an angel     chapter xiv  major grantly consults a friend   grace crawley passed through silverbridge on her way to allington on the monday and on the tuesday morning major grantly received a very short note from miss prettyman telling him that she had done so dear siri think you will be glad to learn that our friend miss crawley went from us yesterday on a visit to her friend miss dale at allingtonyours truly annabella prettyman the note said no more than that major grantly was glad to get it obtaining from it that satisfaction which a man always feels when he is presumed to be concerned in the affairs of the lady with whom he is in love and he regarded miss prettyman with favourable eyesas a discreet and friendly woman nevertheless he was not altogether happy the very fact that miss prettyman should write to him on such a subject made him feel that he was bound to grace crawley he knew enough of himself to be sure that he could not give her up without making himself miserable and yet as regarded her father things were going from bad to worse everybody now said that the evidence was so strong against mr crawley as to leave hardly a doubt of his guilt even the ladies in silverbridge were beginning to give up his cause acknowledging that the money could not have come rightfully into his hands and excusing him on the plea of partial insanity he has picked it up and put it by for months and then thought that it was his own the ladies of silverbridge could find nothing better to say for him than that and when young mr walker remarked that such little mistakes were the customary causes of men being taken to prison the ladies of silverbridge did not know how to answer him it had come to be their opinion that mr crawley was affected with a partial lunacy which ought to be forgiven in one to whom the world had been so cruel and when young mr walker endeavoured to explain to them that a man must be sane altogether or mad altogether and that mr crawley must if sane be locked up as a thief and if mad locked up as a madman they sighed and were convinced that until the world should have been improved by a new infusion of romance and a stronger feeling of poetic justice mr john walker was right  and the result of this general opinion made its way out to major grantly and made its way also to the archdeacon at plumstead as to the major in giving him his due it must be explained that the more certain he became of the fathers guilt the more certain also he became of the daughters merits it was very hard the whole thing was cruelly hard it was cruelly hard upon him that he should be brought into this trouble and be forced to take upon himself the armour of a knighterrant for the redress of the wrong on the part of the young lady but when alone in his house or with his child he declared to himself that he would do so it might well be that he could not live in barsetshire after he had married mr crawleys daughter he had inherited from his father enough of that longing for ascendancy among those around him to make him feel that in such circumstances he would be wretched but he would be made more wretched by the selfknowledge that he had behaved badly to the girl he loved and the world beyond barsetshire was open to him he would take her with him to canada to new zealand or to some other faraway country and there begin his life again should his father choose to punish him for so doing by disinheriting him they would be poor enough but in his present frame of mind the major was able to regard such poverty as honourable and not altogether disagreeable  he had been out shooting all day at chaldicotes with dr thorne and a party who were staying in the house there and had been talking about mr crawley first with one man and then with another lord lufton had been there and young gresham from greshamsbury and mr robarts the clergyman and news had come among them of the attempt made by the bishop to stop mr crawley from preaching mr robarts had been of opinion that mr crawley should have given way and lord lufton who shared his mothers intense dislike of everything that came from the palace had sworn that he was right to resist the sympathy of the whole party had been with mr crawley but they had all agreed that he had stolen the money  i fear hell have to give way to the bishop at last lord lufton had said  and what on earth will become of his children said the doctor think of the fate of that pretty girl for she is a very pretty girl it will be ruin to her no man will allow himself to fall in love with her when her father shall have been found guilty of stealing a cheque for twenty pounds  we must do something for the whole family said the lord i say thorne you havent half the game here that there used to be in poor old sowerbys time  havent i said the doctor you see sowerby had been at it all his days and never did anything else i only began late in life  the major had intended to stay and dine at chaldicotes but when he heard what was said about grace his heart became sad and he made some excuse as to his child and returned home dr thorne had declared that no man could allow himself to fall in love with her but what if a man had fallen in love with her beforehand what if a man had not only fallen in love but spoken of his love had he been alone with the doctor he would i think have told him the whole of his trouble for in all the county there was no man whom he would sooner have trusted with his secret this dr thorne was known far and wide for his soft heart his open hand and his wellsustained indifference to the worlds opinions on most of those social matters with which the world meddles and therefore the words which he had spoken had more weight with major grantly than they would have had from other lips as he drove home he almost made up his mind that he would consult dr thorne upon the matter there were many younger men with whom he was very intimatefrank gresham for instance and lord lufton himself but this was an affair which he hardly knew how to discuss with a young man to dr thorne he thought that he could bring himself to tell the whole story  in the evening there came to him a messenger from plumstead with a letter from his father and some present for the child he knew at once that the present had been thus sent as an excuse for the letter his father might have written by the post of course but that would have given to his letter a certain air and tone which he had not wished it to bear after some message from the majors mother and some allusion to edith the archdeacon struck off upon the matter that was near his heart  i fear it is all up with that unfortunate man at hogglestock he said from what i hear of the evidence which came out before the magistrates there can i think be no doubt as to his guilt have you heard that the bishop sent over on the following day to stop him from preaching he did so and sent again on the sunday but crawley would not give way and so far i respect the man for as a matter of course whatever the bishop did or attempted to do he would do with an extreme of bad taste probably with gross ignorance as to his own duty and as to the duty of the man under him i am told that on the first day crawley turned out of his house the messenger sent to himsome stray clergyman whom mrs proudie keeps about the house and that on the sunday the stairs to the readingdesk and pulpit were occupied by a lot of brickmakers among whom the parson from barchester did not venture to attempt to make his way although he was fortified by the presence of one of the cathedral vergers and by one of the palace footmen i can hardly believe about the verger and the footman as for the rest i have no doubt it is all true i pity crawley from my heart poor unfortunate man the general opinion seems to be that he is not in truth responsible for what he has done as for his victory over the bishop nothing on earth could be better  your mother particularly wishes you to come over to us before the end of the week and to bring edith your grandfather will be here and he is becoming so infirm that he will never come to us for another christmas of course you will stay over the new year  though the letter was full of mr crawley and his affairs there was not a word in it about grace this however was quite natural major grantly perfectly well understood his fathers anxiety to carry his point without seeming to allude to the disagreeable subject my father is very clever he said to himself very clever but he isnt so clever but one can see how clever he is  on the next day he went into silverbridge intending to call on miss prettyman he had not quite made up his mind what he would say to miss prettyman nor was he called upon to do so as he never got as far as that ladys house while walking up the high street he saw mrs thorne in her carriage and as a matter of course he stopped to speak to her he knew mrs thorne quite as intimately as he did her husband and liked her quite as well major grantly she said speaking out loud to him half across the street i was very angry with you yesterday why did you not come up to dinner we had a room ready for you and everything  i was not quite well mrs thorne  fiddlestick dont tell me of not being well there was emily breaking her heart about you  im sure miss dunstable  to tell you the truth i think shell get over it it wont be mortal with her but do tell me major grantly what are we to think about this poor mr crawley it was so good of you to be one of his bailsmen  he would have found twenty in silverbridge if he had wanted them  and do you hear that he has defied the bishop i do so like him for that not but what poor mrs proudie is the dearest friend i have in the world and im always fighting a battle with old lady lufton on her behalf but one likes to see ones friends worsted sometimes you know  i dont quite understand what did happen at hogglestock on sunday said the major  some say he had the bishops chaplain put under the pump i dont believe that but there is no doubt that when the poor fellow tried to get into the pulpit they took him and carried him neck and heels out of the church but tell me major grantly what is to become of the family  heaven knows  is it not sad and that eldest girl is so nice they tell me that she is perfectnot only in beauty but in manners and accomplishments everybody says that she talks greek just as well as she does english and that she understands philosophy from the top to the bottom  at any rate she is so good and so lovely that one cannot but pity her now said the major  you know her then major grantly bytheby of course you do as you were staying with her at framley  yes i know her  what is to become of her im going your way you might as well get into the carriage and ill drive you home if he is sent to prisonand they say he must be sent to prisonwhat is to become of them then major grantly did get into the carriage and before he got out again he had told mrs thorne the whole story of his love  she listened to him with the closest attention only interrupting him now and then with little words intended to signify her approval he as he told his tale did not look her in the face but sat with his eyes fixed upon her muff and now he said glancing up at her almost for the first time as he finished his speech and now mrs thorne what am i to do  marry her of course said she raising her hand aloft and bringing it down heavily upon his knee as she gave her decisive reply  hshh he exclaimed looking back in dismay towards the servants  oh they never hear anything up there theyre thinking about the last pot of porter they had or the next theyre to get deary me i am so glad of course youll marry her  you forget my father  no i dont what has a father to do with it youre old enough to please yourself without asking your father besides lord bless me the archdeacon isnt the man to bear malice hell storm and threaten and stop the supplies for a month or so then hell double them and take your wife to his bosom and kiss her and bless her and all that kind of thing we all know what parental wrath means in such cases as that  but my sister  as for your sister dont talk to me about her i dont care two straws about your sister you must excuse me major grantly but lady hartletop is really too big for my powers of vision  and edithof course mrs thorne i cant be blind to the fact that in many ways such a marriage would be injurious to her no man wishes to be connected with a convicted thief  no major grantly but a man does wish to marry the girl that he loves at least i suppose so and what man ever was able to give a more touching proof of his affection than you can do now if i were you id be at allington before twelve oclock tomorrowi would indeed what does it matter about the trumpery cheque everybody knows it was a mistake if he did take it and surely you would not punish her for that  nono but i dont suppose shed think it a punishment  you go and ask her then and ill tell you what if she hasnt a house of her own to be married from she shall be married from chaldicotes well have such a breakfast and ill make as much of her as if she were the daughter of my old friend the bishop himselfi will indeed  this was mrs thornes advice before it was completed major grantly had been carried halfway to chaldicotes when he left his impetuous friend he was too prudent to make any promise but he declared that what she had said should have much weight with him  you wont mention it to anybody said the major  certainly not without your leave said mrs thorne dont you know that im the soul of honour     chapter xv  up in london   illustration  some kind and attentive reader may perhaps remember that miss grace crawley in a letter written by her to her friend miss lily dale said a word or two of a certain john if it can only be as john wishes it and the same reader if there be one so kind and attentive may also remember that miss lily dale had declared in reply that about that other subject she would rather say nothingand then she had added when one thinks of going beyond friendshipeven if one tries to do sothere are so many barriers from which words the kind and attentive reader if such reader be in such matters intelligent as well as kind and attentive may have learned a great deal with reference to miss lily dale  we will now pay a visit to the john in questiona certain mr john eames living in london a bachelor as the intelligent reader will certainly have discovered and cousin to miss grace crawley mr john eames at the time of our story was a young man some seven or eight and twenty years of age living in london where he was supposed by his friends in the country to have made his mark and to be something a little out of the common way but i do not know that he was very much out of the common way except in the fact that he had had some few thousand pounds left him by an old nobleman who had been in no way related to him but who had regarded him with great affection and who had died some two years since before this john eames had not been a very poor man as he filled the comfortable official position of private secretary to the chief commissioner of the incometax board and drew a salary of three hundred and fifty pounds a year from the resources of his country but when in addition to this source of official wealth he became known as the undoubted possessor of a hundred and twentyeight shares in one of the most prosperous jointstock banks in the metropolis which property had been left to him free of legacy duty by the lamented nobleman above named then mr john eames rose very high indeed as a young man in the estimation of those who knew him and was supposed to be something a good deal out of the common way his mother who lived in the country was obedient to his slightest word never venturing to impose upon him any sign of parental authority and to his sister mary eames who lived with her mother he was almost a god upon earth to sisters who have nothing of their ownnot even some special god for their own individual worshipgenerous affectionate unmarried brothers with sufficient incomes are gods upon earth  and even up in london mr john eames was somebody he was so especially at his office although indeed it was remembered by many a man how raw a lad he had been when he first came there not so very many years ago and how they had laughed at him and played him tricks and how he had customarily been known to be without a shilling for the last week before payday during which period he would borrow sixpence here and a shilling there with great energy from men who now felt themselves to be honoured when he smiled upon them little stories of his former days would often be told of him behind his back but they were not told with illnature because he was very constant in referring to the same matters himself and it was acknowledged by every one at the office that neither the friendship of the nobleman nor the fact of the private secretaryship nor the acquisition of his wealth had made him proud to his old companions or forgetful of old friendships to the young men lads who had lately been appointed he was perhaps a little cold but then it was only reasonable to conceive that such a one as mr john eames was now could not be expected to make an intimate acquaintance with every new clerk that might be brought into the office since competitive examinations had come into vogue there was no knowing who might be introduced and it was understood generally through the establishmentand i may almost say by the civil service at large so wide was his famethat mr eames was very averse to the whole theory of competition the devil take the hindmost scheme he called it and would then go on to explain that hindmost candidates were often the best gentlemen and that in this way the devil got the pick of the flock and he was respected the more for this opinion because it was known that on this subject he had fought some hard battles with the chief commissioner the chief commissioner was a great believer in competition wrote papers about it which he read aloud to various bodies of the civil servicenot at all to their delightwhich he got to be printed here and there and which he sent by post all over the kingdom more than once this chief commissioner had told his private secretary that they must part company unless the private secretary could see fit to alter his view or could at least keep his views to himself but the private secretary would do neither and nevertheless there he was still private secretary its because johnny has got money said one of the young clerks who was discussing this singular state of things with his brethren at the office when a chap has got money he may do what he likes johnny has got lots of money you know the young clerk in question was by no means on intimate terms with mr eames but there had grown up in the office a way of calling him johnny behind his back which had probably come down from the early days of his scrapes and his poverty  now the entire life of mr john eames was pervaded by a great secret and although he never in those days alluded to the subject in conversation with any man belonging to the office yet the secret was known to them all it had been historical for the last four or five years and was now regarded as a thing of course mr john eames was in love and his love was not happy he was in love and had long been in love and the lady of his love was not kind to him the little history had grown to be very touching and pathetic having received no doubt some embellishments from the imaginations of the gentlemen of the incometax office it was said of him that he had been in love from his early boyhood that at sixteen he had been engaged under the sanction of the nobleman now deceased and of the young ladys parents that contracts of betrothals had been drawn up and things done very unusual in private families in these days and that then there had come a stranger into the neighbourhood just as the young lady was beginning to reflect whether she had a heart of her own or not and that she had thrown her parents and the noble lord and the contract and poor johnny eames to the winds and had here the story took different directions as told by different men some said the lady had gone off with the stranger and that there had been a clandestine marriage which afterwards turned out to be no marriage at all others that the stranger suddenly took himself off and was no more seen by the young lady others that he owned at last to having another wifeand so on the stranger was very well known to be one mr crosbie belonging to another public office and there were circumstances in his life only half known which gave rise to these various rumours but there was one thing certain one point as to which no clerk in the incometax office had a doubt one fact which had conduced much to the high position which mr john eames now held in the estimation of his brother clerkshe had given this mr crosbie such a thrashing that no man had ever received such treatment before and had lived through it wonderful stories were told about that thrashing so that it was believed even by the least enthusiastic in such matters that the poor victim had only dragged on a crippled existence since the encounter for nine weeks he never said a word or eat a mouthful said one young clerk to a younger clerk who was just entering the office and even now he cant speak above a whisper and has to take all his food in pap it will be seen therefore that mr john eames had about him much of the heroic  that he was still in love and in love with the same lady was known to every one in the office when it was declared of him that in the way of amatory expressions he had never in his life opened his mouth to another woman there were those in the office who knew that this was an exaggeration mr cradell for instance who in his early years had been very intimate with john eames and who still kept up the old friendshipalthough being a domestic man with a wife and six young children and living on a small income he did not go much out among his friendscould have told a very different story for mrs cradell herself had in days before cradell had made good his claim upon her been not unadmired by cradells fellowclerk but the constancy of mr eamess present love was doubted by none who knew him it was not that he went about with his stockings ungartered or any of the old acknowledged signs of unrequited affection in his manner he was rather jovial than otherwise and seemed to live a happy somewhat luxurious life well contented with himself and the world around him but still he had this passion within his bosom and i am inclined to think that he was a little proud of his own constancy  it might be presumed that when miss dale wrote to her friend grace crawley about going beyond friendship pleading that there were so many barriers she had probably seen her way over most of them but this was not so nor did john eames himself at all believe that the barriers were in a way to be overcome i will not say that he had given the whole thing up as a bad job because it was the law of his life that the thing never should be abandoned as long as hope was possible unless miss dale should become the wife of somebody else he would always regard himself as affianced to her he had so declared to miss dale herself and to miss dales mother and to all the dale people who had ever been interested in the matter and there was an old lady living in miss dales neighbourhood the sister of the lord who had left johnny eames the bank shares who always fought his battles for him and kept a close lookout fully resolved that john eames should be rewarded at last this old lady was connected with the dales by family ties and therefore had means of close observation she was in constant correspondence with john eames and never failed to acquaint him when any of the barriers were in her judgment giving way the nature of some of the barriers may possibly be made intelligible to my readers by the following letter from lady julia de guest to her young friend      guestwick cottage  december 186     my dear john     i am much obliged to you for going to joness i send    stamps for two shillings and fourpence which is what i    owe you it used only to be two shillings and twopence    but they say everything has got to be dearer now and    i suppose pills as well as other things only think    of pritchard coming to me and saying she wanted her    wages raised after living with me for twenty years i    was very angry and scolded her roundly but as she    acknowledged she had been wrong and cried and begged my    pardon i did give her two guineas a year more     i saw dear lily just for a moment on sunday and upon my    word i think she grows prettier every year she had a    young friend with hera miss crawleywho i believe    is the cousin i have heard you speak of what is this sad    story about her father the clergyman mind you tell me    all about it     it is quite true what i told you about the de courcys old    lady de courcy is in london and mr crosbie is going to    law with her about his wifes money he has been at it    in one way or the other ever since poor lady alexandrina    died i wish she had lived with all my heart for though    i feel sure that our lily will never willingly see him    again yet the tidings of her death disturbed her and set    her thinking of things that were fading from her mind i    rated her soundly not mentioning your name however but    she only kissed me and told me in her quiet drolling way    that i didnt mean a word of what i said     you can come here whenever you please after the tenth of    january but if you come early in january you must go to    your mother first and come to me for the last week of    your holiday go to blackies in regent street and bring    me down all the colours in wool that i ordered i said you    would call and tell them at dollands the last spectacles    dont suit at all and i wont keep them they had better    send me down by you one or two more pairs to try and    you had better see smithers and smith in lincolns inn    fields no 57but you have been there beforeand beg    them to let me know how my poor dear brothers matters are    to be settled at last as far as i can see i shall be dead    before i shall know what income i have got to spend as    to my cousins at the manor i never see them and as to    talking to them about business i should not dream of it    she hasnt come to me since she first called and she may    be quite sure i shant go to her till she does indeed    i think we shall like each other apart quite as much as    we should together so let me know when youre coming    and pray dont forget to call at blackies nor yet at    dollands which is much more important than the wool    because of my eyes getting so weak but what i want you    specially to remember is about smithers and smith how is    a woman to live if she doesnt know how much she has got    to spend     believe me to be my dear john    your most sincere friend     julia de guest   lady julia always directed her letters for her young friend to his office and there he received the one now given to the reader when he had read it he made a memorandum as to the commissions and then threw himself back in his armchair to think over the tidings communicated to him all the facts stated he had known before that lady de courcy was in london and that her soninlaw mr crosbie whose wifelady alexandrinahad died some twelve months since at baden baden was at variance with her respecting money which he supposed to be due to him but there was that in lady julias letter which was wormwood to him lily dale was again thinking of this man whom she had loved in old days and who had treated her with monstrous perfidy it was all very well for lady julia to be sure that lily dale would never desire to see mr crosbie again but john eames was by no means equally certain that it would be so the tidings of her death disturbed her said johnny repeating to himself certain words out of the old ladys letter i know they disturbed me i wish she could have lived for ever if he ever ventures to show himself within ten miles of allington ill see if i cannot do better than i did the last time i met him then there came a knock at the door and the private secretary finding himself to be somewhat annoyed by the disturbance at such a moment bade the intruder enter in angry voice oh its you cradell is it what can i do for you mr cradell who now entered and who as before said was an old ally of john eames was a clerk of longer standing in the department than his friend in age he looked to be much older and he had left with him none of that appearance of the gloss of youth which will stick for many years to men who are fortunate in their worldly affairs indeed it may be said that mr cradell was almost shabby in his outward appearance and his brow seemed to be laden with care and his eyes were dull and heavy  i thought id just come in and ask you how you are said cradell  im pretty well thank you and how are you  oh im pretty wellin health that is you see one has so many things to think of when one has a large family upon my word johnny i think youve been lucky to keep out of it  i have kept out of it at any rate havent i  of course living with you as much as i used to do i know the whole story of what has kept you single  dont mind about that cradell what is it you want  i mustnt let you suppose johnny that im grumbling about my lot nobody knows better than you what a trump i got in my wife  of course you didan excellent woman  and if i cut you out a little there im sure you never felt malice against me for that  never for a moment old fellow  we all have our luck you know  your luck has been a wife and family my luck has been to be a bachelor  you may say a family said cradell im sure that amelia does the best she can but we are desperately pushed some timesdesperately pushed i never was so bad johnny as i am now  so you said the last time  did i i dont remember it i didnt think i was so bad then but johnny if you can let me have one more fiver now i have made arrangements with amelia how im to pay you off by thirty shillings a monthas i get my salary indeed i have ask her else  ill be shot if i do  dont say that johnny  its no good your johnnying me for i wont be johnnyed out of another shilling it comes too often and theres no reason why i should do it and whats more i cant afford it ive people of my own to help  but oh johnny we all know how comfortable you are and im sure no one rejoiced as i did when the money was left to you if it had been myself i could hardly have thought more of it upon my solemn word and honour if youll let me have it this time it shall be the last  upon my word and honour then i wont there must be an end to everything  although mr cradell would probably if pressed have admitted the truth of this last assertion he did not seem to think that the end had as yet come to his friends benevolence it certainly had not come to his own importunity dont say that johnny pray dont  but i do say it  when i told amelia yesterday evening that i didnt like to go to you again because of course a man has feelings she told me to mention her name im sure hed do it for my sake she said  i dont believe she said anything of the kind  upon my word she did you ask her  and if she did she oughtnt to have said it  oh johnny dont speak in that way of her shes my wife and you know what your own feelings were once but look herewe are in that state at home at this moment that i must get money somewhere before i go home i must indeed if youll let me have three pounds this once ill never ask you again ill give you a written promise if you like and ill pledge myself to pay it back by thirty shillings a time out of the two next months salary i will indeed and then mr cradell began to cry but when johnny at last took out his chequebook and wrote a cheque for three pounds mr cradells eyes glistened with joy upon my word i am so much obliged to you you are the best fellow that ever lived and amelia will say the same when she hears of it  i dont believe shell say anything of the kind cradell if i remember anything of her she has a stouter heart than that cradell admitted that his wife had a stouter heart than himself and then made his way back to his own part of the office  this little interruption to the current of mr eamess thoughts was i think for the good of the service as immediately on his friends departure he went to his work whereas had not he been thus called away from his reflections about miss dale he would have sat thinking about her affairs probably for the rest of the morning as it was he really did write a dozen notes in answer to as many private letters addressed to his chief sir raffle buffle in all of which he made excellentlyworded false excuses for the nonperformance of various requests made to sir raffle by the writers hes about the best hand at it that i know said sir raffle one day to the secretary otherwise you may be sure i shouldnt keep him there i will allow that he is clever said the secretary it isnt cleverness so much as tact its what i call tact i hadnt been long in the service before i mastered it myself and now that ive been at the trouble to teach him i dont want to have the trouble to teach another but upon my word he must mind his ps and qs upon my word he must and you had better tell him so the fact is mr kissing said the private secretary the next day to the secretarymr kissing was at that time secretary to the board of commissioners for the receipt of income taxthe fact is mr kissing sir raffle should never attempt to write a letter himself he doesnt know how to do it he always says twice too much and yet not half enough i wish youd tell him so he wont believe me from which it will be seen mr eames was proud of his special accomplishment but did not feel any gratitude to the master who assumed to himself the glory of having taught him on the present occasion john eames wrote all his letters before he thought again of lily dale and was able to write them without interruption as the chairman was absent for the day at the treasuryor perhaps at his club then when he had finished he rang his bell and ordered some sherry and sodawater and stretched himself before the fireas though his exertions in the public service had been very greatand seated himself comfortably in his armchair and lit a cigar and again took out lady julias letter  as regarded the cigar it may be said that both sir raffle and mr kissing had given orders that on no account should cigars be lit within the precincts of the incometax office mr eames had taken upon himself to understand that such orders did not apply to a private secretary and was well aware that sir raffle knew his habit to mr kissing i regret to say he put himself in opposition whenever and wherever opposition was possible so that men in the office said that one of the two must go at last but johnny can do anything you know because he has got money that was too frequently the opinion finally expressed among the men  so john eames sat down and drank his sodawater and smoked his cigar and read his letter or rather simply that paragraph of the letter which referred to miss dale the tidings of her death have disturbed her and set her thinking again of things that were fading from her mind he understood it all and yet how could it possibly be so how could it be that she should not despise a mandespise him if she did not hate himwho had behaved as this man had behaved to her it was now four years since this crosbie had been engaged to miss dale and had jilted her so heartlessly as to incur the disgust of every man in london who had heard the story he had married an earls daughter who had left him within a few months of their marriage and now mr crosbies noble wife was dead the wife was dead and simply because the man was free again he john eames was to be told that miss dales mind was disturbed and that her thoughts were going back to things which had faded from her memory and which should have been long since banished altogether from such holy ground  if lily dale were now to marry mr crosbie anything so perversely cruel as the fate of john eames would never yet have been told in romance that was his own idea on the matter as he sat smoking his cigar i have said that he was proud of his constancy and yet in some sort he was also ashamed of it he acknowledged the fact of his love and believed himself to have outjacobed jacob but he felt that it was hard for a man who had risen in the world as he had done to be made a plaything of by a foolish passion it was now four years agothat affair of crosbieand miss dale should have accepted him long since halfadozen times he had made up his mind to be very stern to her and he had written somewhat sternlybut the first moment that he saw her he was conquered again and now that brute will reappear and everything will be wrong again he said to himself if the brute did reappear something should happen of which the world should hear the tidings so he lit another cigar and began to think what that something should be  as he did so he heard a loud noise as of harsh rattling winds in the next room and he knew that sir raffle had come back from the treasury there was a creaking of boots and a knocking of chairs and a ringing of bells and then a loud angry voicea voice that was very harsh and on this occasion very angry why had not his twelveoclock letters been sent up to him to the west end why not mr eames knew all about it why did mr eames know all about it why had not mr eames sent them up where was mr eames let mr eames be sent to him all which mr eames heard standing with the cigar in his mouth and his back to the fire somebody has been bullying old buffle i suppose after all he has been at the treasury today said eames to himself but he did not stir till the messenger had been to him nor even then at once all right rafferty he said ill go in just now then he took halfadozen more whiffs from the cigar threw the remainder into the fire and opened the door which communicated between his room and sir raffles  the great man was standing with two unopened epistles in his hand eames said he here are letters then he stopped himself and began upon another subject did i not give express orders that i would have no smoking in the office  i think mr kissing said something about it sir  mr kissing it was not mr kissing at all it was i i gave the order myself  youll find it began with mr kissing  it did not begin with mr kissing it began and ended with me what are you going to do sir john eames had stepped towards the bell and his hand was already on the bellpull  i was going to ring for the papers sir  and who told you to ring for the papers i dont want the papers the papers wont show anything i suppose my word may be taken without the papers since youre so fond of mr kissing  im not fond of mr kissing at all  youll have to go back to him and let somebody come here who will not be too independent to obey my orders here are two most important letters have been lying here all day instead of being sent up to me at the treasury  of course they have been lying there i thought you were at the club  i told you i should go to the treasury i have been there all the morning with the chancellorwhen sir raffle spoke officially of the chancellor he was not supposed to mean the lord chancellorand here i find letters which i particularly wanted lying upon my desk now i must put an end to this kind of thing i must indeed if you like the outer office better say so at once and you can go  ill think about it sir raffle  think about it what do you mean by thinking about it but i cant talk about that now im very busy and shall be here till past seven i suppose you can stay  all night if you wish it sir  very well that will do for the presenti wouldnt have had these letters delayed for twenty pounds  i dont suppose it would have mattered one straw if both of them remained unopened till next week this last little speech however was not made aloud to sir raffle but by johnny to himself in the solitude of his own room  very soon after that he went away sir raffle having discovered that one of the letters in question required his immediate return to the west end ive changed my mind about staying i shant stay now i should have done if these letters had reached me as they ought  then i suppose i can go  you can do as you like about that said sir raffle  eames did do as he liked and went home or to his club and as he went he resolved that he would put an end and at once to the present trouble of his life lily dale should accept him or reject him and taking either the one or the other alternative she should hear a bit of his mind plainly spoken     chapter xvi  down at allington   it was christmastime down at allington and at three oclock on christmas eve just as the darkness of the early winter evening was coming on lily dale and grace crawley were seated together one above the other on the steps leading up to the pulpit in allington church they had been working all day at the decorations of the church and they were now looking round them at the result of their handiwork to an eye unused to the gloom the place would have been nearly dark but they could see every corner turned by the ivy sprigs and every line on which the hollyleaves were shining and the greeneries of the winter had not been stuck up in the oldfashioned idle way a bough just fastened up here and a twig inserted there but everything had been done with some meaning with some thought towards the original architecture of the building the gothic lines had been followed and all the lower arches which it had been possible to reach with an ordinary ladder had been turned as truly with the laurel cuttings as they had been turned originally with the stone  i wouldnt tie another twig said the elder girl for all the christmas pudding that was ever boiled  its lucky then that there isnt another twig to tie  i dont know about that i see a score of places where the work has been scamped this is the sixth time i have done the church and i dont think ill ever do it again when we first began it bell and i you knowbefore bell was marriedmrs boyce and the boycian establishment generally used to come and help or rather we used to help her now she hardly ever looks after it at all  she is older i suppose  shes a little older and a deal idler how idle people do get look at him since he has had a curate he hardly ever stirs round the parish and he is getting so fat that hsh here she is herselfcome to give her judgment upon us then a stout lady the wife of the vicar walked slowly up the aisle well girls she said you have worked hard and i am sure mr boyce will be very much obliged to you  mr boyce indeed said lily dale we shall expect the whole parish to rise from their seats and thank us why didnt jane and bessy come and help us  they were so tired when they came in from the coal club besides they dont care for this kind of thingnot as you do  jane is utilitarian to the backbone i know said lily and bessy doesnt like getting up ladders  as for ladders said mrs boyce defending her daughter i am not quite sure that bessy isnt right you dont mean to say that you did all those in the capitals yourself  every twig with hopkins to hold the ladder and cut the sticks and as hopkins is just a hundred and one years old we could have done it pretty nearly as well alone  i do not think that said grace  he has been grumbling all the time said lily and swears he never will have the laurels so robbed again five or six years ago he used to declare that death would certainly save him from the pain of such another desecration before the next christmas but he has given up that foolish notion now and talks as though he meant to protect the allington shrubs at any rate to the end of this century  i am sure we gave our share from the parsonage said mrs boyce who never understood a joke  all the best came from the parsonage as of course they ought said lily but hopkins had to make up the deficiency and as my uncle told him to take the haycart for them instead of the handbarrow he is brokenhearted  i am sure he was very goodnatured said grace  nevertheless he is brokenhearted and i am very goodnatured too and i am brokenbacked who is going to preach tomorrow morning mrs boyce  mr swanton will preach in the morning  tell him not to be long because of the childrens pudding tell mr boyce if he is long we wont any of us come next sunday  my dear how can you say such wicked things i shall not tell him anything of the kind  thats not wicked mrs boyce if i were to say i had eaten so much lunch that i didnt want any dinner youd understand that if mr swanton will preach for threequarters of an hour  he only preached for threequarters of an hour once lily  he has been over the halfhour every sunday since he has been here his average is over forty minutes and i say its a shame  it is not a shame at all lily said mrs boyce becoming very serious  look at my uncle he doesnt like to go to sleep and he has to suffer a purgatory in keeping himself awake  if your uncle is heavy how can mr swanton help it if mr dales mind were on the subject he would not sleep  come mrs boyce theres somebody else sleeps sometimes besides my uncle when mr boyce puts up his finger and just touches his nose i know as well as possible why he does it  lily dale you have no business to say so it is not true i dont know how you can bring yourself to talk in that way of your own clergyman if i were to tell your mamma she would be shocked  you wont be so illnatured mrs boyceafter all that ive done for the church  if youd think more about the clergyman lily and less about the church said mrs boyce very sententiously more about the matter and less about the manner more of the reality and less of the form i think youd find that your religion would go further with you miss crawley is the daughter of a clergyman and im sure shell agree with me  if she agrees with anybody in scolding me ill quarrel with her  i didnt mean to scold you lily  i dont mind it from you mrs boyce indeed i rather like it it is a sort of pastoral visitation and as mr boyce never scolds me himself of course i take it as coming from him by attorney then there was silence for a minute or two during which mrs boyce was endeavouring to discover whether miss dale was laughing at her or not as she was not quite certain she thought at last that she would let the suspected fault pass unobserved dont wait for us mrs boyce said lily we must remain till hopkins has sent gregory to sweep the church out and take away the rubbish well see that the key is left at mrs giless  thank you my dear then i may as well go i thought id come in and see that it was all right im sure mr boyce will be very much obliged to you and miss crawley goodnight my dear  goodnight mrs boyce and be sure you dont let mr swanton be long tomorrow to this parting shot mrs boyce made no rejoinder but she hurried out of the church somewhat the quicker for it and closed the door after her with something of a slam  of all persons clergymen are the most irreverent in the handling of things supposed to be sacred and next to them clergymens wives and after them those other ladies old or young who take upon themselves semiclerical duties and it is natural that it should be so for is it not said that familiarity does breed contempt when a parson takes his lay friend over his church on a week day how much less of the spirit of genuflexion and headuncovering the clergyman will display than the layman the parson pulls about the woodwork and knocks about the stonework as though it were mere wood and stone and talks aloud in the aisle and treats even the readingdesk as a common thing whereas the visitor whispers gently and carries himself as though even in looking at a church he was bound to regard himself as performing some service that was half divine now lily dale and grace crawley were both accustomed to churches and had been so long at work in this church for the last two days that the building had lost to them much of its sacredness and they were almost as irreverent as though they were two curates  i am so glad she has gone said lily we shall have to stop here for the next hour as gregory wont know what to take away and what to leave i was so afraid she was going to stop and see us off the premises  i dont know why you should dislike her  i dont dislike her i like her very well said lily dale but dont you feel that there are people whom one knows very intimately who are really friendsfor whom if they were dying one would grieve whom if they were in misfortune one would go far to help but with whom for all that one can have no sympathy and yet they are so near to one that they know all the events of ones life and are justified by unquestioned friendship in talking about things which should never be mentioned except where sympathy exists  yes i understand that  everybody understands it who has been unhappy that woman sometimes says things to me that make me wishwish that theyd make him bishop of patagonia and yet she does it all in friendship and mamma says that she is quite right  i liked her for standing up for her husband  but he does go to sleepand then he scratches his nose to show that hes awake i shouldnt have said it only she is always hinting at uncle christopher uncle christopher certainly does go to sleep when mr boyce preaches and he hasnt studied any scientific little movements during his slumbers to make the people believe that hes all alive i gave him a hint one day and he got so angry with me  i shouldnt have thought he could have been angry with you it seems to me from what you say that you may do whatever you please with him  he is very good to me if you knew it allif you could understand how good he has been ill try and tell you some day it is not what he has done that makes me love him sobut what he has thoroughly understood and what so understanding he has not done and what he has not said it is a case of sympathy if ever there was a gentleman uncle christopher is one and i used to dislike him so at one time  and why  chiefly because he would make me wear brown frocks when i wanted to have them pink or green and he kept me for six months from having them long and up to this day he scolds me if there is half an inch on the ground for him to tread upon  i shouldnt mind that if i were you  i dontnot now but it used to be serious when i was a young girl and we thought bell and i that he was cross to mamma he and mamma didnt agree at first you know as they do now it is quite true that he did dislike mamma when we first came here  i cant think how anybody could ever dislike mrs dale  but he did and then he wanted to make up a marriage between bell and my cousin bernard but neither of them cared a bit for the other and then he used to scold themand thenand thenand thenoh he was so good to me heres gregory at last gregory weve been waiting this hour and a half  it aint ten minutes since hopkins let me come with the barrows miss  then hopkins is a traitor never mind youd better begin nowup there at the steps itll be quite dark in a few minutes heres mrs giles with her broom come mrs giles we shall have to pass the night here if you dont make haste are you cold grace  no im not cold im thinking what they are doing now in the church at hogglestock  the hogglestock church is not prettylike this  oh no it is a very plain brick building with something like a pigeonhouse for a belfry and the pulpit is over the readingdesk and the readingdesk over the clerk so that papa when he preaches is nearly up to the ceiling and the whole place is divided into pews in which the farmers hide themselves when they come to church  so that nobody can see whether they go to sleep or no oh mrs giles you mustnt pull that down thats what we have been putting up all day  but it be in the way miss so that the minister cant budge in or out o the door  never mind then he must stay one side or the other that would be too much after all our trouble and miss dale hurried across the chancel to save some prettily arching boughs which in the judgment of mrs giles encroached too much on the vestry door as if it signified which side he was she said in a whisper to grace  i dont suppose theyll have anything in the church at home said grace  somebody will stick up a wreath or two i daresay  nobody will there never is anybody at hogglestock to stick up wreaths or to do anything for the prettinesses of life and now there will be less done than ever how can mamma look after hollyleaves in her present state and yet she will miss them too poor mamma sees very little that is pretty but she has not forgotten how pleasant pretty things are  i wish i knew your mother grace  i think it would be impossible for any one to know mamma nowfor any one who had not known her before she never makes even a new acquaintance she seems to think that there is nothing left for her in the world but to try and keep papa out of misery and she does not succeed in that poor papa  is he very unhappy about this wicked accusation  yes he is very unhappy but lily i dont know about its being wicked  but you know that it is untrue  of course i know that papa did not mean to take anything that was not his own but you see nobody knows where it came from and nobody except mamma and jane and i understand how very absent papa can be im sure he doesnt know the least in the world how he came by it himself or he would tell mamma do you know lily i think i have been wrong to come away  dont say that dear remember how anxious mrs crawley was that you should come  but i cannot bear to be comfortable here while they are so wretched at home it seems such a mockery every time i find myself smiling at what you say to me i think i must be the most heartless creature in the world  is it so very bad with them grace  indeed it is bad i dont think you can imagine what mamma has to go through she has to cook all that is eaten in the house and then very often there is no money in the house to buy anything if you were to see the clothes she wears even that would make your heart bleed i who have been used to being poor all my lifeeven i when i am at home am dismayed by what she has to endure  what can we do for her grace  you can do nothing lily but when things are like that at home you can understand what i feel in being here  mrs giles and gregory had now completed their task or had so nearly done so as to make miss dale think that she might safely leave the church we will go in now she said for it is dark and cold and what i call creepy do you ever fancy that perhaps you will see a ghost some day  i dont think i shall ever see a ghost but all the same i should be half afraid to be here alone in the dark  i am often here alone in the dark but i am beginning to think i shall never see a ghost now i am losing all my romance and getting to be an old woman do you know grace i do so hate myself for being such an old maid  but who says youre an old maid lily  i see it in peoples eyes and hear it in their voices and they all talk to me as if i were very steady and altogether removed from anything like fun and frolic it seems to be admitted that if a girl does not want to fall in love she ought not to care for any other fun in the world if anybody made out a list of the old ladies in these parts theyd put down lady julia and mamma and mrs boyce and me and old mrs hearne the very children have an awful respect for me and give over playing directly they see me well mamma weve done at last and i have had such a scolding from mrs boyce  i daresay you deserved it my dear  no i did not mamma ask grace if i did  was she not saucy to mrs boyce miss crawley  she said that mr boyce scratches his nose in church said grace  so he does and goes to sleep too  if you told mrs boyce that lily i think she was quite right to scold you  such was miss lily dale with whom grace crawley was stayinglily dale with whom mr john eames of the incometax office had been so long and so steadily in love that he was regarded among his fellowclerks as a miracle of constancywho had herself in former days been so unfortunate in love as to have been regarded among her friends in the country as the most illused of women as john eames had been able to be comfortable in lifethat is to say not utterly a wretchin spite of his love so had she managed to hold up her head and live as other young women live in spite of her misfortune but as it may be said also that his constancy was true constancy although he knew how to enjoy the good things of the world so also had her misfortune been a true misfortune although she had been able to bear it without much outer show of shipwreck for a few daysfor a week or two when the blow first struck her she had been knocked down and the friends who were nearest to her had thought that she would never again stand erect upon her feet but she had been very strong stout at heart of a fixed purpose and capable of resistance against oppression even her own mother had been astonished and sometimes almost dismayed by the strength of her will her mother knew well how it was with her now but they who saw her frequently and who did not know her as her mother knew herthe mrs boyces of her acquaintancewhispered among themselves that lily dale was not so soft of heart as people used to think  on the next day christmas day as the reader will remember grace crawley was taken up to dine at the big house with the old squire mrs dales eldest daughter with her husband dr crofts was to be there and also lilys old friend who was also especially the old friend of johnny eames lady julia de guest grace had endeavoured to be excused from the party pleading many pleas but the upshot of all her pleas was thisthat while her fathers position was so painful she ought not to go out anywhere in answer to this lily dale corroborated by her mother assured her that for her fathers sake she ought not to exhibit any such feeling that in doing so she would seem to express a doubt as to her fathers innocence then she allowed herself to be persuaded telling her friend however that she knew the day would be very miserable to her it will be very humdrum if you please said lily nothing can be more humdrum than christmas at the great house nevertheless you must go  coming out of church grace was introduced to the old squire he was a thin old man with grey hair and the smallest possible grey whiskers with a dry solemn face not carrying in his outward gait much of the customary jollity of christmas he took his hat off to grace and said some word to her as to hoping to have the pleasure of seeing her at dinner it sounded very cold to her and she became at once afraid of him i wish i was not going she said to lily again i know he thinks i ought not to go i shall be so thankful if you will but let me stay  illustration grace crawley is introduced to squire dale  dont be foolish grace it all comes from your not knowing him or understanding him and how should you understand him i give you my word that i would tell you if i did not know that he wishes you to go  she had to go of course i havent a dress fit how should i she said to lily how wrong it is of me to put myself up to such a thing as this  your dress is beautiful child we are none of us going in evening dresses pray believe that i will not make you do wrong if you wont trust me cant you trust mamma  of course she went when the three ladies entered the drawingroom of the great house they found that lady julia had arrived just before them lady julia immediately took hold of lily and led her apart having a word or two to say about the clerk in the incometax office i am not sure but what the dear old woman sometimes said a few more words than were expedient with a view to the object which she had so closely at heart john is to be with us the first week in february she said i suppose youll see him before that as hell probably be with his mother a few days before he comes to me  i daresay we shall see him quite in time lady julia said lily  now lily dont be illnatured  im the most goodnatured young woman alive lady julia and as for johnny he is always made as welcome at the small house as violets in march mamma purrs about him when he comes asking all manner of flattering questions as though he were a cabinet minister at least and i always admire some little knicknack that he has got a new ring or a stud or a button there isnt another man in all the world whose buttons id look at  it isnt his buttons lily  ah thats just it i can go as far as his buttons but come lady julia this is christmastime and christmas should be a holiday  in the meantime mrs dale was occupied with her married daughter and her soninlaw and the squire had attached himself to poor grace you have never been in this part of the country before miss crawley he said  no sir  it is rather pretty just about here and guestwick manor is a fine place in its way but we have not so much natural beauty as you have in barsetshire chaldicote chase is i think as pretty as anything in england  i never saw chaldicote chase sir it isnt pretty at all at hogglestock where we live  ah i forgot no it is not very pretty at hogglestock thats where the bricks come from  papa is clergyman at hogglestock  yes yes i remember your father is a great scholar i have often heard of him i am so sorry he should be distressed by this charge they have made but it will all come right at the assizes they always get at the truth there i used to be intimate with a clergyman in barsetshire of the name of grantlygrace felt that her ears were tingling and that her face was redarchdeacon grantly his father was bishop of the diocese  yes sir archdeacon grantly lives at plumstead  i was staying once with an old friend of mine mr thorne of ullathorne who lives close to plumstead and saw a good deal of them i remember thinking henry grantly was a very nice lad he married afterwards  yes sir but his wife is dead now and he has got a little girledith grantly  is there no other child  no sir only edith  you know him then  yes sir i know major grantlyand edith i never saw archdeacon grantly  then my dear you never saw a very famous pillar of the church i remember when people used to talk a great deal about archdeacon grantly but when his time came to be made a bishop he was not sufficiently newfangled and so he got passed by he is much better off as he is i should say bishops have to work very hard my dear  do they sir  so they tell me and the archdeacon is a wealthy man so henry grantly has got an only daughter i hope she is a nice child for i remember liking him well  she is a very nice child indeed mr dale she could not be nicer and she is so lovely then mr dale looked into his young companions face struck by the sudden animation of her words and perceived for the first time that she was very pretty  after this grace became accustomed to the strangeness of the faces round her and managed to eat her dinner without much perturbation of spirit when after dinner the squire proposed to her that they should drink the health of her papa and mamma she was almost reduced to tears and yet she liked him for doing it it was terrible to her to have them mentioned knowing as she did that every one who mentioned them must be aware of their miseryfor the misfortune of her father had become notorious in the country but it was almost more terrible to her that no allusion should be made to them for then she would be driven to think that her father was regarded as a man whom the world could not afford to mention papa and mamma she just murmured raising her glass to her lips grace dear said lily from across the table heres papa and mamma and the young man at marlborough who is carrying everything before him yes we wont forget the young man at marlborough said the squire grace felt this to be goodnatured because her brother at marlborough was the one bright spot in her familyand she was comforted  and we will drink the health of my friend john eames said lady julia  john eames health said the squire in a low voice  johnnys health said mrs dale but mrs dales voice was not very brisk  johns health said dr crofts and mrs crofts in a breath  heres the health of johnny eames said lily and her voice was the clearest and the boldest of them all but she made up her mind that if lady julia could not be induced to spare her for the future she and lady julia must quarrel no one can understand she said to her mother that evening how dreadful it isthis being constantly told before ones family and friends that one ought to marry a certain young man  she didnt say that my dear  i should much prefer that she should for then i could get up on my legs and answer her off the reel of course everybody there understood what she meantincluding old john bates who stood at the sideboard and coolly drank the toast himself  he always does that to all the family toasts on christmas day your uncle likes it  that wasnt a family toast and john bates had no right to drink it  after dinner they all played cardsa round gameand the squire put in the stakes now grace said lily you are the visitor and you must win or else uncle christopher wont be happy he always likes a young lady visitor to win  but i never played a game of cards in my life  go and sit next to him and hell teach you uncle christopher wont you teach grace crawley she never saw a pope joan board in her life before  come here my dear and sit next to me dear dear dear fancy henry grantly having a little girl what a handsome lad he was and it seems only yesterday if it was so that lily had said a word to her uncle about grace and the major the old squire had become on a sudden very sly be that as it may grace crawley thought that he was a pleasant old man and though while talking to him about edith she persisted in not learning to play pope joan so that he could not contrive that she should win nevertheless the squire took to her very kindly and told her to come up with lily and see him sometimes while she was staying at the small house the squire in speaking of his sisterinlaws cottage always called it the small house  only think of my winning said lady julia drawing together her wealth well im sure i want it bad enough for i dont at all know whether ive got any income of my own its all john eames fault my dear for he wont go and make those people settle it in lincolns inn fields poor lily who was standing on the hearthrug touched her mothers arm she knew that johnnys name was lugged in with reference to lady julias money altogether for her benefit i wonder whether she ever had a johnny of her own she said to her mother and if so whether she liked it when her friends sent the towncrier round to talk about him  she means to be goodnatured said mrs dale  of course she does but it is such a pity when people wont understand  my uncle didnt bite you after all grace said lily to her friend as they were going home at night by the pathway which led from the garden of one house to the garden of the other  i like mr dale very much said grace he was very kind to me  there is some queerlooking animal of whom they say that he is better than he looks and i always think of that saying when i think of my uncle  for shame lily said her mother your uncle for his age is as good a looking man as i know and he always looks like just what he isan english gentleman  i didnt mean to say a word against his dear old face and figure mamma but his heart and mind and general disposition as they come out in experience and days of trial are so much better than the samples of them which he puts out on the counter for men and women to judge by he wears well and he washes wellif you know what i mean grace  yes i think i know what you mean  the apollos of the worldi dont mean in outward looks mammabut the apollos in heart the menand the women toowho are so full of feeling so softnatured so kind who never say a cross word who never get out of bed on the wrong side in the morningit so often turns out that they wont wash  such was the expression of miss lily dales experience     chapter xvii  mr crawley is summoned to barchester   illustration  the scene which occurred in hogglestock church on the sunday after mr thumbles first visit to that parish had not been described with absolute accuracy either by the archdeacon in his letter to his son or by mrs thorne there had been no footman from the palace in attendance on mr thumble nor had there been a battle with the brickmakers neither had mr thumble been put under the pump but mr thumble had gone over taking his gown and surplice with him on the sunday morning and had intimated to mr crawley his intention of performing the service mr crawley in answer to this had assured mr thumble that he would not be allowed to open his mouth in the church and mr thumble not seeing his way to any further successful action had contented himself with attending the services in his surplice making thereby a silent protest that he and not mr crawley ought to have been in the readingdesk and the pulpit  when mr thumble reported himself and his failure at the palace he strove hard to avoid seeing mrs proudie but not successfully he knew something of the palace habits and did manage to reach the bishop alone on the sunday evening justifying himself to his lordship for such an interview by the remarkable circumstances of the case and the importance of his late mission mrs proudie always went to church on sunday evenings making a point of hearing three services and three sermons every sunday of her life on weekdays she seldom heard any having an idea that weekday services were an invention of the high church enemy and that they should therefore be vehemently discouraged services on saints days she regarded as rank papacy and had been known to accuse a clergymans wife to her face of idolatry because the poor lady had dated a letter st johns eve mr thumble on this sunday evening was successful in finding the bishop at home and alone but he was not lucky enough to get away before mrs proudie returned the bishop perhaps thought that the story of the failure had better reach his wifes ears from mr thumbles lips than from his own  well mr thumble said mrs proudie walking into the study armed in her full sundayevening winter panoply in which she had just descended from her carriage the church which mrs proudie attended in the evening was nearly half a mile from the palace and the coachman and groom never got a holiday on sunday night she was gorgeous in a dark brown silk dress of awful stiffness and terrible dimensions and on her shoulders she wore a short cloak of velvet and fur very handsome withal but so swelling in its proportions on all sides as necessarily to create more of dismay than of admiration in the mind of any ordinary man and her bonnet was a monstrous helmet with the beaver up displaying the awful face of the warrior always ready for combat and careless to guard itself from attack the large contorted bows which she bore were as a grisly crest upon her casque beautiful doubtless but majestic and fearcompelling in her hand she carried her armour all complete a prayerbook a bible and a book of hymns these the footman had brought for her to the study door but she had thought fit to enter her husbands room with them in her own custody  well mr thumble she said  mr thumble did not answer at once thinking probably that the bishop might choose to explain the circumstances but neither did the bishop say any thing  well mr thumble she said again and then she stood looking at the man who had failed so disastrously  i have explained to the bishop said he mr crawley has been contumaciousvery contumacious indeed  but you preached at hogglestock  no indeed mrs proudie nor would it have been possible unless i had had the police to assist me  then you should have had the police i never heard of anything so mismanaged in all my lifenever in all my life and she put her books down on the study table and turned herself round from mr thumble towards the bishop if things go on like this my lord she said your authority in the diocese will very soon be worth nothing at all it was not often that mrs proudie called her husband my lord but when she did do so it was a sign that terrible times had cometimes so terrible that the bishop would know that he must either fight or fly he would almost endure anything rather than descend into the arena for the purpose of doing battle with his wife but occasions would come now and again when even the alternative of flight was hardly left to him  but my dear began the bishop  am i to understand that this man has professed himself to be altogether indifferent to the bishops prohibition said mrs proudie interrupting her husband and addressing mr thumble  quite so he seemed to think that the bishop had no lawful power in the matter at all said mr thumble  do you hear that my lord said mrs proudie  nor have i any said the bishop almost weeping as he spoke  no authority in your own diocese  none to silence a man merely by my own judgment i thought and still think that it was for this gentlemans own interest as well as for the credit of the church that some provision should be made for his duties during his presentpresentdifficulties  difficulties indeed everybody knows that the man has been a thief  no my dear i do not know it  you never know anything bishop  i mean to say that i do not know it officially of course i have heard the sad story and though i hope it may not be the  there is no doubt about its truth all the world knows it he has stolen twenty pounds and yet he is to be allowed to desecrate the church and imperil the souls of the people the bishop got up from his chair and began to walk backwards and forwards through the room with short quick steps it only wants five days to christmas day continued mrs proudie and something must be done at once i say nothing as to the propriety or impropriety of his being out on bail as it is no affair of ours when i heard that he had been bailed by a beneficed clergyman of this diocese of course i knew where to look for the man who would act with so much impropriety of course i was not surprised when i found that that person belonged to framley but as i have said before that is no business of ours i hope mr thumble that the bishop will never be found interfering with the ordinary laws of the land i am very sure that he will never do so by my advice but when there comes a question of inhibiting a clergyman who has committed himself as this clergyman unfortunately has done then i say that that clergyman ought to be inhibited the bishop walked up and down the room throughout the whole of this speech but gradually his steps became quicker and his turns became shorter and now here is christmas day upon us and what is to be done with these words mrs proudie finished her speech  mr thumble said the bishop perhaps you had better now retire i am very sorry that you should have had so thankless and so disagreeable a task  why should mr thumble retire asked mrs proudie  i think it better said the bishop mr thumble good night then mr thumble did retire and mrs proudie stood forth in her full panoply of armour silent and awful with her helmet erect and vouchsafed no recognition whatever of the parting salutation with which mr thumble greeted her my dear the truth is you do not understand the matter said the bishop as soon as the door was closed you do not know how limited is my power  bishop i understand it a great deal better than some people and i understand also what is due to myself and the manner in which i ought to be treated by you in the presence of the subordinate clergy of the diocese i shall not however remain here to be insulted either in the presence or in the absence of any one then the conquered amazon collected together the weapons which she had laid upon the table and took her departure with majestic step and not without the clang of arms the bishop when he was left alone enjoyed for a few moments the triumph of his victory  but then he was left so very much alone when he looked round about him upon his solitude after the departure of his wife and remembered that he should not see her again till he should encounter her on ground that was all her own he regretted his own success and was tempted to follow her and to apologize he was unable to do anything alone he would not even know how to get his tea as the very servants would ask questions if he were to do so unaccustomed a thing as to order it to be brought up to him in his solitude they would tell him that mrs proudie was having tea in her little sittingroom upstairs or else that the things were laid in the drawingroom he did wander forth to the latter apartment hoping that he might find his wife there but the drawingroom was dark and deserted and so he wandered back again it was a grand thing certainly to have triumphed over his wife and there was a crumb of comfort in the thought that he had vindicated himself before mr thumble but the general result was not comforting and he knew from of old how shortlived his triumph would be  but wretched as he was during that evening he did employ himself with some energy after much thought he resolved that he would again write to mr crawley and summon him to appear at the palace in doing this he would at any rate be doing something there would be action and though mr crawley would as he thought decline to obey the order something would be gained even by that disobedience so he wrote his summonssitting very comfortless and all alone on that sunday eveningdating his letter however for the following day      palace december 20 186     reverend sir     i have just heard from mr thumble that you have declined    to accede to the advice which i thought it my duty to    tender to you as the bishop who has been set over you by    the church and that you yesterday insisted on what you    believed to be your right to administer the services in    the parish church of hogglestock this has occasioned me    the deepest regret it is i think unavailing that i    should further write to you my mind upon the subject as    i possess such strong evidence that my written word will    not be respected by you i have therefore no alternative    now but to invite you to come to me here and this i do    hoping that i may induce you to listen to that authority    which i cannot but suppose you acknowledge to be vested in    the office which i hold     i shall be glad to see you on tomorrow tuesday as near    the hour of two as you can make it convenient to yourself    to be here and i will take care to order that refreshment    shall be provided for yourself and your horse     i am reverend sir    c c c     thos barnum   my dear he said when he did again encounter his wife that night i have written to mr crawley and i thought i might as well bring up the copy of my letter  i wash my hands of the whole affair said mrs proudieof the whole affair  but you will look at the letter  certainly not why should i look at the letter my word goes for nothing i have done what i could but in vain now let us see how you will manage it yourself  the bishop did not pass a comfortable night but in the morning his wife did read his letter and after that things went a little smoother with him she was pleased to say that considering all things seeing as she could not help seeing that the matter had been dreadfully mismanaged and that great weakness had been displayedseeing that these faults had already been committed perhaps no better step could now be taken than that proposed in the letter  i suppose he will not come said the bishop  i think he will said mrs proudie and i trust that we may be able to convince him that obedience will be his best course he will be more humbleminded here than at hogglestock in saying this the lady showed some knowledge of the general nature of clergymen and of the world at large she understood how much louder a cock can crow in its own farmyard than elsewhere and knew that episcopal authority backed by all the solemn awe of palatial grandeur goes much further than it will do when sent under the folds of an ordinary envelope but though she understood ordinary human nature it may be that she did not understand mr crawleys nature  but she was at any rate right in her idea as to mr crawleys immediate reply the palace groom who rode over to hogglestock returned with an immediate answer  my lordsaid mr crawley      i will obey your lordships summons and unless    impediments should arise i will wait upon your lordship    at the hour you name tomorrow i will not trespass on    your hospitality for myself i rarely break bread in any    house but my own and as to the horse i have none     i have the honour to be    my lord c c     josiah crawley   of course i shall go he had said to his wife as soon as he had had time to read the letter and make known to her the contents i shall go if it be possible for me to get there i think that i am bound to comply with the bishops wishes in so much as that  but how will you get there josiah  i will walkwith the lords aid  now hogglestock was fifteen miles from barchester and mr crawley was as his wife well knew by no means fitted in his present state for great physical exertion but from the tone in which he had replied to her she well knew that it would not avail for her to remonstrate at the moment he had walked more than thirty miles in a day since they had been living at hogglestock and she did not doubt but that it might be possible for him to do it again any scheme which she might be able to devise for saving him from so terrible a journey in the middle of winter must be pondered over silently and brought to bear if not slyly at least deftly and without discussion she made no reply therefore when he declared that on the following day he would walk to barchester and backwith the lords aid nor did she see or ask to see the note which he sent to the bishop when the messenger was gone mr crawley was all alert looking forward with evident glee to his encounter with the bishopsnorting like a racehorse at the expected triumph of the coming struggle and he read much greek with jane on that afternoon pouring into her young ears almost with joyous rapture his appreciation of the glory and the pathos and the humanity as also of the awful tragedy of the story of oedipus his very soul was on fire at the idea of clutching the weak bishop in his hand and crushing him with his strong grasp  in the afternoon mrs crawley slipped out to a neighbouring farmers wife and returned in an hours time with a little story which she did not tell with any appearance of eager satisfaction she had learned well what were the little tricks necessary to the carrying of such a matter as that which she had now in hand mr mangle the farmer as it happened was going tomorrow morning in his taxcart as far as framley mill and would be delighted if mr crawley would take a seat he must remain at framley the best part of the afternoon and hoped that mr crawley would take a seat back again now framley mill was only half a mile off the direct road to barchester and was almost half way from hogglestock parsonage to the city this would at any rate bring the walk within a practicable distance mr crawley was instantly placed upon his guard like an animal that sees the bait and suspects the trap had he been told that farmer mangle was going all the way to barchester nothing would have induced him to get into the cart he would have felt sure that farmer mangle had been persuaded to pity him in his poverty and his strait and he would sooner have started to walk to london than have put a foot upon the step of the cart but this lift half way did look to him as though it were really fortuitous his wife could hardly have been cunning enough to persuade the farmer to go to framley conscious that the trap would have been suspected had the bait been made more full but i feari fear the dear good woman had been thus cunninghad understood how far the trap might be baited and had thus succeeded in catching her prey  on the following morning he consented to get into farmer mangles cart and was driven as far as framley mill i wouldnt think nowt your reverence of running you over into barchesterthat i wouldnt the powny is so mortial good said farmer mangle in his foolish goodnature  illustration farmer mangle and mr crawley  and how about your business here said mr crawley the farmer scratched his head remembering all mrs crawleys injunctions and awkwardly acknowledged that to be sure his own business with the miller was very pressing then mr crawley descended terribly suspicious and went on his journey  anyways your reverence will call for me coming back said farmer mangle but mr crawley would make no promise he bade the farmer not wait for him if they chanced to meet together on the road he might get up again if the man really had business at framley how could he have offered to go on to barchester were they deceiving him the wife of his bosom had deceived him in such matters before now but his trouble in this respect was soon dissipated by the pride of his anticipated triumph over the bishop he took great glory from the thought that he would go before the bishop with dirty bootswith boots necessarily dirtywith rusty pantaloons that he would be hot and mudstained with his walk hungry and an object to be wondered at by all who should see him because of the misfortunes which had been unworthily heaped upon his head whereas the bishop would be sleek and clean and wellfedpretty with all the prettinesses that are becoming to a bishops outward man and he mr crawley would be humble whereas the bishop would be very proud and the bishop would be in his own armchairthe cock in his own farmyard while he mr crawley would be seated afar off in the cold extremity of the room with nothing of outward circumstances to assist hima man called thither to undergo censure and yet he would take the bishop in his grasp and crush himcrush himcrush him as he thought of this he walked quickly through the mud and put out his long arm and his great hand far before him out into the air and there and then he crushed the bishop in his imagination yes indeed he thought it very doubtful whether the bishop would ever send for him a second time as all this passed through his mind he forgot his wifes cunning and farmer mangles sin and for the moment he was happy  as he turned a corner round by lord luftons park paling who should he meet but his old friend mr robarts the parson of framleythe parson who had committed the sin of being bail for himthe sin that is according to mrs proudies view of the matter he was walking with his hand still stretched outstill crushing the bishop when mr robarts was close upon him  what crawley upon my word i am very glad to see you you are coming up to me of course  thank you mr robarts no not today the bishop has summoned me to his presence and i am on my road to barchester  but how are you going  i shall walk  walk to barchester impossible  i hope not quite impossible mr robarts i trust i shall get as far before two oclock but to do so i must be on my road then he showed signs of a desire to go on upon his way without further parley  but crawley do let me send you over there is the horse and gig doing nothing  thank you mr robarts no i should prefer the walk today  and you have walked from hogglestock  nonot so a neighbour coming hither who happened to have business at your millhe brought me so far in his cart the walk home will be nothingnothing i shall enjoy it good morning mr robarts  but mr robarts thought of the dirty road and of the bishops presence and of his own ideas of what would be becoming for a clergymanand persevered you will find the lanes so very muddy and our bishop you know is apt to notice such things do be persuaded  notice what things demanded mr crawley in an indignant tone  he or perhaps she rather will say how dirty your shoes were when you came to the palace  if he or she can find nothing unclean about me but my shoes let them say their worst i shall be very indifferent i have long ceased mr robarts to care much what any man or woman may say about my shoes good morning then he stalked on clutching and crushing in his hand the bishop and the bishops wife and the whole dioceseand all the church of england dirty shoes indeed whose was the fault that there were in the church so many feet soiled by unmerited poverty and so many hands soiled by undeserved wealth if the bishop did not like his shoes let the bishop dare to tell him so so he walked on through the thick of the mud by no means picking his way  he walked fast and he found himself in the close half an hour before the time named by the bishop but on no account would he have rung the palace bell one minute before two oclock so he walked up and down under the towers of the cathedral and cooled himself and looked up at the pleasant plateglass in the windows of the house of his friend the dean and told himself how in their college days he and the dean had been quite equalquite equal except that by the voices of all qualified judges in the university he mr crawley had been acknowledged to be the riper scholar and now the mr arabin of those days was dean of barchestertravelling abroad luxuriously at this moment for his delight while he crawley was perpetual curate at hogglestock and had now walked into barchester at the command of the bishop because he was suspected of having stolen twenty pounds when he had fully imbued his mind with the injustice of all this his time was up and he walked boldly to the bishops gate and boldly rang the bishops bell     chapter xviii  the bishop of barchester is crushed   who inquires why it is that a little greased flour rubbed in among the hair on a footmans headjust one dab here and another theregives such a tone of high life to the family and seeing that the thing is so easily done why do not more people attempt it the tax on hairpowder is but thirteen shillings a year it may indeed be that the slightest dab in the world justifies the wearer in demanding hot meat three times a day and wine at any rate on sundays i think however that a bishops wife may enjoy the privilege without such heavy attendant expense otherwise the man who opened the bishops door to mr crawley would hardly have been so ornamented  the man asked for a card my name is mr crawley said our friend the bishop has desired me to come to him at this hour will you be pleased to tell him that i am here the man again asked for a card i am not bound to carry with me my name printed on a ticket said mr crawley if you cannot remember it give me pen and paper and i will write it the servant somewhat awed by the strangers manner brought the pen and paper and mr crawley wrote his name      the rev josiah crawley ma    perpetual curate of hogglestock   he was then ushered into a waitingroom but to his disappointment was not kept there waiting long within three minutes he was ushered into the bishops study and into the presence of the two great luminaries of the diocese he was at first somewhat disconcerted by finding mrs proudie in the room in the imaginary conversation with the bishop which he had been preparing on the road he had conceived that the bishop would be attended by a chaplain and he had suited his words to the joint discomfiture of the bishop and of the lower clergymanbut now the line of his battle must be altered this was no doubt an injury but he trusted to his courage and readiness to enable him to surmount it he had left his hat behind him in the waitingroom but he kept his old short cloak still upon his shoulders and when he entered the bishops room his hands and arms were hid beneath it there was something lowly in this constrained gait it showed at least that he had no idea of being asked to shake hands with the august persons he might meet and his head was somewhat bowed though his great bald broad forehead showed itself so prominent that neither the bishop nor mrs proudie could drop it from their sight during the whole interview he was a man who when seen could hardly be forgotten the deep angry remonstrant eyes the shaggy eyebrows telling tales of frequent angerof anger frequent but generally silentthe repressed indignation of the habitual frown the long nose and large powerful mouth the deep furrows on the cheek and the general look of thought and suffering all combined to make the appearance of the man remarkable and to describe to the beholders at once his true character no one ever on seeing mr crawley took him to be a happy man or a weak man or an ignorant man or a wise man  you are very punctual mr crawley said the bishop mr crawley simply bowed his head still keeping his hands beneath his cloak will you not take a chair nearer to the fire mr crawley had not seated himself but had placed himself in front of a chair at the extreme end of the roomresolved that he would not use it unless he were duly asked  thank you my lord he said i am warm with walking and if you please will avoid the fire  you have not walked mr crawley  yes my lord i have been walking  not from hogglestock  now this was a matter which mr crawley certainly did not mean to discuss with the bishop it might be well for the bishop to demand his presence in the palace but it could be no part of the bishops duty to inquire how he got there that my lord is a matter of no moment said he i am glad at any rate that i have been enabled to obey your lordships order in coming hither on this morning  hitherto mrs proudie had not said a word she stood back in the room near the firemore backward a good deal than she was accustomed to do when clergymen made their ordinary visits on such occasions she would come forward and shake hands with them graciouslygraciously even if proudly but she had felt that she must do nothing of that kind now there must be no shaking hands with a man who had stolen a cheque for twenty pounds it might probably be necessary to keep mr crawley at a distance and therefore she had remained in the background but mr crawley seemed to be disposed to keep himself in the background and therefore she could speak i hope your wife and children are well mr crawley she said  thank you madam my children are well and mrs crawley suffers no special ailment at present  that is much to be thankful for mr crawley whether he were or were not thankful for such mercies as these was no business of the bishop or of the bishops wife that was between him and his god so he would not even bow to this civility but sat with his head erect and with a great frown on his heavy brow  then the bishop rose from his chair to speak intending to take up a position on the rug but as he did so mr crawley who had seated himself on an intimation that he was expected to sit down rose also and the bishop found that he would thus lose his expected vantage will you not be seated mr crawley said the bishop mr crawley smiled but stood his ground then the bishop returned to his armchair and mr crawley also sat down again mr crawley began the bishop this matter which came the other day before the magistrates at silverbridge has been a most unfortunate affair it has given me i can assure you the most sincere pain  mr crawley had made up his mind how far the bishop should be allowed to go without a rebuke he had told himself that it would only be natural and would not be unbecoming that the bishop should allude to the meeting of the magistrates and to the alleged theft and that therefore such allusion should be endured with patient humility and moreover the more rope he gave the bishop the more likely the bishop would be to entangle himself it certainly was mr crawleys wish that the bishop should entangle himself he therefore replied very meekly it has been most unfortunate my lord  i have felt for mrs crawley very deeply said mrs proudie mr crawley had now made up his mind that as long as it was possible he would ignore the presence of mrs proudie altogether and therefore he made no sign that he had heard the latter remark  it has been most unfortunate continued the bishop i have never before had a clergyman in my diocese placed in so distressing a position  that is a matter of opinion my lord said mr crawley who at that moment thought of a crisis which had come in the life of another clergyman in the diocese of barchester with the circumstances of which he had by chance been made acquainted  exactly said the bishop and i am expressing my opinion mr crawley who understood fighting did not think that the time had yet come for striking a blow so he simply bowed again a most unfortunate position mr crawley continued the bishop far be it from me to express an opinion upon the matter which will have to come before a jury of your countrymen it is enough for me to know that the magistrates assembled at silverbridge gentlemen to whom no doubt you must be known as most of them live in your neighbourhood have heard evidence upon the subject  most convincing evidence said mrs proudie interrupting her husband mr crawleys black brow became a little blacker as he heard the word but still he ignored the woman he not only did not speak but did not turn his eye upon her  they have heard the evidence on the subject continued the bishop and they have thought it proper to refer the decision as to your innocence or your guilt to a jury of your countrymen  and they were right said mr crawley  very possibly i dont deny it probably said the bishop whose eloquence was somewhat disturbed by mr crawleys ready acquiescence  of course they were right said mrs proudie  at any rate it is so said the bishop you are in the position of a man amenable to the criminal laws of the land  there are no criminal laws my lord said mr crawley but to such laws as there are we are all amenableyour lordship and i alike  but you are so in a very particular way i do not wish to remind you what might be your condition now but for the interposition of private friends  i should be in the condition of a man not guilty before the lawguiltless as far as the law goesbut kept in durance not for faults of his own but because otherwise by reason of laches in the police his presence at the assizes might not be ensured in such a position a mans reputation is made to hang for awhile on the trust which some friends or neighbours may have in it i do not say that the test is a good one  you would have been put in prison mr crawley because the magistrates were of opinion that you had taken mr soamess cheque said mrs proudie on this occasion he did look at her he turned one glance upon her from under his eyebrows but he did not speak  with all that i have nothing to do said the bishop  nothing whatever my lord said mr crawley  but bishop i think that you have said mrs proudie the judgment formed by the magistrates as to the conduct of one of your clergymen makes it imperative upon you to act in the matter  yes my dear yes i am coming to that what mrs proudie says is perfectly true i have been constrained most unwillingly to take action in this matter it is undoubtedly the fact that you must at the next assizes surrender yourself at the courthouse yonder to be tried for this offence against the laws  that is true if i be alive my lord and have strength sufficient i shall be there  you must be there said mrs proudie the police will look to that mr crawley she was becoming very angry in that the man would not answer her a word on this occasion again he did not even look at her  yes you will be there said the bishop now that is to say the least of it an unseemly position for a beneficed clergyman  you said before my lord that it was an unfortunate position and the word methinks was better chosen  it is very unseemly very unseemly indeed said mrs proudie nothing could possibly be more unseemly the bishop might very properly have used a much stronger word  under these circumstances continued the bishop looking to the welfare of your parish to the welfare of the diocese and allow me to say mr crawley to the welfare of yourself also  and especially to the souls of the people said mrs proudie  the bishop shook his head it is hard to be impressively eloquent when one is interrupted at every best turned period even by a supporting voice yesand looking of course to the religious interests of your people mr crawley i came to the conclusion that it would be expedient that you should cease your ministrations for awhile the bishop paused and mr crawley bowed his head i therefore sent over to you a gentleman with whom i am well acquainted mr thumble with a letter from myself in which i endeavoured to impress upon you without the use of any severe language what my convictions were  severe words are often the best mercy said mrs proudie mr crawley had raised his hand with his finger out preparatory to answering the bishop but as mrs proudie had spoken he dropped his finger and was silent  mr thumble brought me back your written reply continued the bishop by which i was grieved to find that you were not willing to submit yourself to my counsel in the matter  i was most unwilling my lord submission to authority is at times a dutyand at times opposition to authority is a duty also  opposition to just authority cannot be a duty mr crawley  opposition to usurped authority is an imperative duty said mr crawley  and who is to be the judge demanded mrs proudie then there was silence for a while when as mr crawley made no reply the lady repeated her question will you be pleased to answer my question sir who in such a case is to be the judge but mr crawley did not please to answer her question the man is obstinate said mrs proudie  i had better proceed said the bishop mr thumble brought me back your reply which grieved me greatly  it was contumacious and indecent said mrs proudie  the bishop again shook his head and looked so unutterably miserable that a smile came across mr crawleys face after all others besides himself had their troubles and trials mrs proudie saw and understood the smile and became more angry than ever she drew her chair close to the table and began to fidget with her fingers among the papers she had never before encountered a clergyman so contumacious so indecent so unreverendso upsetting she had had to do with men difficult to managethe archdeacon for instance but the archdeacon had never been so impertinent to her as this man she had quarrelled once openly with a chaplain of her husbands a clergyman whom she herself had introduced to her husband and who had treated her very badlybut not so badly not with such unscrupulous violence as she was now encountering from this illclothed beggarly man this perpetual curate with his dirty broken boots this already halfconvicted thief such was her idea of mr crawleys conduct to her while she was fingering the paperssimply because mr crawley would not speak to her  i forget where i was said the bishop oh mr thumble came back and i received your letterof course i received it and i was surprised to learn from that that in spite of what had occurred at silverbridge you were still anxious to continue the usual sunday ministrations in your church  i was determined that i would do my duty at hogglestock as long as i might be left there to do it said mr crawley  duty said mrs proudie  just a moment my dear said the bishop when sunday came i had no alternative but to send mr thumble over again to hogglestock it occurred to usto me and mrs proudie  i will tell mr crawley just now what has occurred to me said mrs proudie  yesjust so and i am sure that he will take it in good part it occurred to me mr crawley that your first letter might have been written in haste  it was written in haste my lord your messenger was waiting  yesjust so well so i sent him again hoping that he might be accepted as a messenger of peace it was a most disagreeable mission for any gentleman mr crawley  most disagreeable my lord  and you refused him permission to obey the instructions which i had given him you would not let him read from your desk or preach from your pulpit  had i been mr thumble said mrs proudie i would have read from that desk and i would have preached from that pulpit  mr crawley waited a moment thinking that the bishop might perhaps speak again but as he did not but sat expectant as though he had finished his discourse and now expected a reply mr crawley got up from his seat and drew near to the table my lord he began it has all been just as you have said i did answer your first letter in haste  the more shame for you said mrs proudie  and therefore for aught i know my letter to your lordship may be so worded as to need some apology  of course it needs an apology said mrs proudie  but for the matter of it my lord no apology can be made nor is any needed i did refuse to your messenger permission to perform the services of my church and if you send twenty more i shall refuse them alltill the time may come when it will be your lordships duty in accordance with the laws of the churchas borne out and backed by the laws of the land to provide during my constrained absence for the spiritual wants of those poor people at hogglestock  poor people indeed said mrs proudie poor wretches  and my lord it may well be that it shall soon be your lordships duty to take due and legal steps for depriving me of my benefice at hogglestocknay probably for silencing me altogether as to the exercise of my sacred profession  of course it will sir your gown will be taken from you said mrs proudie the bishop was looking with all his eyes up at the great forehead and great eyebrows of the man and was so fascinated by the power that was exercised over him by the other mans strength that he hardly now noticed his wife  it may well be so continued mr crawley the circumstances are strong against me and though your lordship has altogether misunderstood the nature of the duty performed by the magistrates in sending my case for trialalthough as it seems to me you have come to conclusions in this matter in ignorance of the very theory of our laws  sir said mrs proudie  yet i can foresee the probability that a jury may discover me to have been guilty of theft  of course the jury will do so said mrs proudie  should such verdict be given then my lord your interference will be legal proper and necessary and you will find that even if it be within my power to oppose obstacles to your lordships authority i will oppose no such obstacle there is i believe no appeal in criminal cases  none at all said mrs proudie there is no appeal against your bishop you should have learned that before  but till that time shall come my lord i shall hold my own at hogglestock as you hold your own here at barchester nor have you more power to turn me out of my pulpit by your mere voice than i have to turn you out of your throne by mine if you doubt me my lord your lordships ecclesiastical court is open to you try it there  you defy us then said mrs proudie  my lord i grant your authority as bishop to be great but even a bishop can only act as the law allows him  god forbid that i should do more said the bishop  sir you will find that your wicked threats will fall back upon your own head said mrs proudie  peace woman mr crawley said addressing her at last the bishop jumped out of his chair at hearing the wife of his bosom called a woman but he jumped rather in admiration than in anger he had already begun to perceive that mr crawley was a man who had better be left to take care of the souls at hogglestock at any rate till the trial should come on  woman said mrs proudie rising to her feet as though she really intended some personal encounter  madam said mr crawley you should not interfere in these matters you simply debase your husbands high office the distaff were more fitting for you my lord good morning and before either of them could speak again he was out of the room and through the hall and beyond the gate and standing beneath the towers of the cathedral yes he had he thought in truth crushed the bishop he had succeeded in crumpling the bishop up within the clutch of his fist  he started in a spirit of triumph to walk back on his road towards hogglestock he did not think of the long distance before him for the first hour of his journey he had had his victory and the remembrance of that braced his nerves and gave elasticity to his sinews and he went stalking along the road with rapid strides muttering to himself from time to time as he went along some word about mrs proudie and her distaff mr thumble would not he thought come to him againnot at any rate till the assizes were drawing near and he had resolved what he would do then when the day of his trial was near he would himself write to the bishop and beg that provision might be made for his church in the event of the verdict going against him his friend dean arabin was to be home before that time and the idea had occurred to him of asking the dean to see to this but now the other would be the more independent course and the better and there was a matter as to which he was not altogether well pleased with the dean although he was so conscious of his own peculiarities as to know that he could hardly trust himself for a judgment but at any rate he would apply to the bishopto the bishop whom he had just left prostrate in his palacewhen the time of his trial should be close at hand  full of such thoughts as these he went along almost gaily nor felt the fatigue of the road till he had covered the first five miles out of barchester it was nearly four oclock and the thick gloom of the winter evening was making itself felt and then he began to be fatigued he had not as yet eaten since he had left his home in the morning and he now pulled a crust out of his pocket and leaned against a gate as he crunched it there were still ten miles before him and he knew that such an addition to the work he had already done would task him very severely farmer mangle had told him that he would not leave framley mill till five and he had got time to reach framley mill by that time but he had said that he would not return to framley mill and he remembered his suspicion that his wife and farmer mangle between them had cozened him no he would persevere and walkwalk though he should drop upon the road he was now nearer fifty than forty years of age and hardships as well as time had told upon him he knew that though his strength was good for the commencement of a hard days work it would not hold out for him as it used to do he knew that the last four miles in the dark night would be very sad with him but still he persevered endeavouring as he went to cherish himself with the remembrance of his triumph  he passed the turning going down to framley with courage but when he came to the further turning by which the cart would return from framley to the hogglestock road he looked wistfully down the road for farmer mangle but farmer mangle was still at the mill waiting in expectation that mr crawley might come to him but the poor traveller paused here barely for a minute and then went on stumbling through the mud striking his illcovered feet against the rough stones in the dark sweating in his weakness almost tottering at times and calculating whether his remaining strength would serve to carry him home he had almost forgotten the bishop and his wife before at last he grasped the wicket gate leading to his own door  oh mamma here is papa  but where is the cart i did not hear the wheels said mrs crawley  oh mamma i think papa is ill then the wife took her drooping husband by both arms and strove to look him in the face he has walked all the way and he is ill said jane  no my dear i am very tired but not ill let me sit down and give me some bread and tea and i shall recover myself then mrs crawley from some secret hoard got him a small modicum of spirits and gave him meat and tea and he was docile and obeying her behests allowed himself to be taken to his bed  i do not think the bishop will send for me again he said as she tucked the clothes around him     chapter xix  where did it come from   when christmas morning came no emissary from the bishop appeared at hogglestock to interfere with the ordinary performance of the days services i think we need fear no further disturbance mr crawley said to his wifeand there was no further disturbance  on the day after his walk from framley to barchester and from barchester back to hogglestock mr crawley had risen not much the worse for his labour and had gradually given to his wife a full account of what had taken place a poor weak man he said speaking of the bishop a poor weak creature and much to be pitied  i have always heard that she is a violent woman  very violent and very ignorant and most intrusive withal  and you did not answer her a word  at last my forbearance with her broke down and i bade her mind her distaff  whatreally did you say those words to her  nay as for my exact words i cannot remember them i was thinking more of the words with which it might be fitting that i should answer the bishop but i certainly told her that she had better mind her distaff  and how did she behave then  i did not wait to see the bishop had spoken and i had replied and why should i tarry to behold the womans violence i had told him that he was wrong in law and that i at least would not submit to usurped authority there was nothing to keep me longer and so i went without much ceremony of leavetaking there had been little ceremony of greeting on their part and there was less in the making of adieux on mine they had told me that i was a thief  no josiahsurely not so they did not use that very word  i say they didthey did use the very word but stop i am wrong i wrong his lordship and i crave pardon for having done so if my memory serve me no expression so harsh escaped from the bishops mouth he gave me indeed to understand more than once that the action taken by the magistrates was tantamount to a conviction and that i must be guilty because they had decided that there was evidence sufficient to justify a trial but all that arose from my lords ignorance of the administration of the laws of his country he was very ignorantpuzzlepated as you may call itled by the nose by his wife weak as water timid and vacillating but he did not wish i think to be insolent it was mrs proudie who told me to my face that i was athief  may she be punished for the cruel word said mrs crawley may the remembrance that she has spoken it come some day heavily upon her heart  vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord answered mr crawley we may safely leave all that alone and rid our minds of such wishes if it be possible it is well i think that violent offences when committed should be met by instant rebuke to turn the other cheek instantly to the smiter can hardly be suitable in these days when the hands of so many are raised to strike but the return blow should be given only while the smart remains she hurt me then but what is it to me now that she called me a thief to my face do i not know that all the country round men and women are calling me the same behind my back  no josiah you do not know that they say that the thing is very strangeso strange that it requires a trial but no one thinks you have taken that which was not your own  i think i did i myself think i took that which was not my own my poor head suffers soso many grievous thoughts distract me that i am like a child and know not what i do as he spoke thus he put both hands up to his head leaning forward as though in anxious thoughtas though he were striving to bring his mind to bear with accuracy upon past events it could not have been mine and yet then he sat silent and made no effort to continue his speech  and yetsaid his wife encouraging him to proceed if she could only learn the real truth she thought that she might perhaps yet save him with assistance from their friends  when i said that i had gotten it from that man i must have been mad  from which man love  from the man soameshe who accuses me and yet as the lord hears me i thought so then the truth is that there are times when i am notsane i am not a thiefnot before god but i ammad at times these last words he spoke very slowly in a whisperwithout any excitementindeed with a composure which was horrible to witness and what he said was the more terrible because she was so well convinced of the truth of his words of course he was no thief she wanted no one to tell her that as he himself had expressed it he was no thief before god however the money might have come into his possession that there were times when his reason once so fine and clear could not act could not be trusted to guide him right she had gradually come to know with fear and trembling but he himself had never before hinted his own consciousness of this calamity indeed he had been so unwilling to speak of himself and of his own state that she had been unable even to ask him a question about the moneylest he should suspect that she suspected him now he was speakingbut speaking with such heartrending sadness that she could hardly urge him to go on  you have sometimes been ill josiah as any of us may be she said and that has been the cause  there are different kinds of sickness there is sickness of the body and sickness of the heart and sickness of the spiritand then there is sickness of the mind the worst of all  with you josiah it has chiefly been the first  with me mary it has been all of themevery one my spirit is broken and my mind has not been able to keep its even tenour amidst the ruins but i will strive i will strive i will strive still and if god helps me i will prevail then he took up his hat and cloak and went forth among the lanes and on this occasion his wife was glad that he should go alone  this occurred a day or two before christmas and mrs crawley during those days said nothing more to her husband on the subject which he had so unexpectedly discussed she asked him no questions about the money or as to the possibility of his exercising his memory nor did she counsel him to plead that the false excuses given by him for his possession of the cheque had been occasioned by the sad slip to which sorrow had in those days subjected his memory and his intellect but the matter had always been on her mind might it not be her paramount duty to do something of this at the present moment might it not be that his acquittal or conviction would depend on what she might now learn from him it was clear to her that he was brighter in spirit since his encounter with the proudies than he had ever been since the accusation had been first made against him and she knew well that his present mood would not be of long continuance he would fall again into his moody silent ways and then the chance of learning aught from him would be past and perhaps for ever  he performed the christmas services with nothing of special despondency in his tone or manner and his wife thought that she had never heard him give the sacrament with more impressive dignity after the service he stood awhile at the churchyard gate and exchanged a word of courtesy as to the season with such of the families of the farmers as had stayed for the lords supper  i waited at framley for your reverence till arter sixso i did said farmer mangle  i kept the road and walked the whole way said mr crawley i think i told you that i should not return to the mill but i am not the less obliged by your great kindness  say nowt o that said the farmer no doubt i had business at the milllots to do at the mill nor did he think that the fib he was telling was at all incompatible with the holy sacrament in which he had just taken a part  the christmas dinner at the parsonage was not a repast that did much honour to the season but it was a better dinner than the inhabitants of that house usually saw on the board before them there was roast pork and mincepies and a bottle of wine as mrs crawley with her own hand put the meat upon the table and then as was her custom in their house proceeded to cut it up she looked at her husbands face to see whether he was scrutinizing the food with painful eye it was better that she should tell the truth at once than that she should be made to tell it in answer to a question everything on the table except the bread and potatoes had come in a basket from framley court pork had been sent instead of beef because people in the country when they kill their pigs do sometimes give each other porkbut do not exchange joints of beef when they slay their oxen all this was understood by mrs crawley but she almost wished that beef had been sent because beef would have attracted less attention he said however nothing to the meat but when his wife proposed to him that he should eat a mincepie he resented it the bare food said he is bitter enough coming as it does but that would choke me she did not press it but eat one herself as otherwise her girl would have been forced also to refuse the dainty  that evening as soon as jane was in bed she resolved to ask him some further questions you will have a lawyer josiahwill you not she said  why should i have a lawyer  because he will know what questions to ask and how questions on the other side should be answered  i have no questions to ask and there is only one way in which questions should be answered i have no money to pay a lawyer  but josiah in such a case as this where your honour and our very life depend upon it  depend on what  on your acquittal  i shall not be acquitted it is as well to look it in the face at once lawyer or no lawyer they will say that i took the money were i upon the jury trying the case myself knowing all that i know nowand as he said this he struck forth with his hands into the airi think that i should say so myself a lawyer will do no good it is here it is here and again he put his hands up to his head  so far she had been successful at this moment it had in truth been her object to induce him to speak of his own memory and not of the aid that a lawyer might give the proposition of the lawyer had been brought in to introduce the subject  but josiah  well  it was very hard for her to speak she could not bear to torment him by any allusion to his own deficiencies she could not endure to make him think that she suspected him of any frailty either in intellect or thought wifelike she desired to worship him and that he should know that she worshipped him but if a word might save him josiah where did it come from  yes said he yes that is the question where did it come fromand he turned sharp upon her looking at her with all the power of his eyes it is because i cannot tell you where it came from that i ought to beeither in bedlam as a madman or in the county gaol as a thief the words were so dreadful to her that she could not utter at the moment another syllable how is a manto think himselffitfor a mans work when he cannot answer his wife such a plain question as that then he paused again they should take me to bedlam at onceat onceat once that would not disgrace the children as the gaol will do  mrs crawley could ask no further questions on that evening     chapter xx  what mr walker thought about it   illustration  it had been suggested to mr robarts the parson of framley that he should endeavour to induce his old acquaintance mr crawley to employ a lawyer to defend him at his trial and mr robarts had not forgotten the commission which he had undertaken but there were difficulties in the matter of which he was well aware in the first place mr crawley was a man whom it had not at any time been easy to advise on matters private to himself and in the next place this was a matter on which it was very hard to speak to the man implicated let him be who he would mr robarts had come round to the generally accepted idea that mr crawley had obtained possession of the cheque illegallyacquitting his friend in his own mind of theft simply by supposing that he was woolgathering when the cheque came in his way but in speaking to mr crawley it would be necessaryso he thoughtto pretend a conviction that mr crawley was as innocent in fact as in intention  he had almost made up his mind to dash at the subject when he met mr crawley walking through framley to barchester but he had abstained chiefly because mr crawley had been too quick for him and had got away after that he resolved that it would be almost useless for him to go to work unless he should be provided with a lawyer ready and willing to undertake the task and as he was not so provided at present he made up his mind that he would go into silverbridge and see mr walker the attorney there mr walker always advised everybody in those parts about everything and would be sure to know what would be the proper thing to be done in this case so mr robarts got into his gig and drove himself into silverbridge passing very close to mr crawleys house on his road he drove at once to mr walkers office and on arriving there found that the attorney was not at that moment within but mr winthrop was within would mr robarts see mr winthrop now seeing mr winthrop was a very different thing from seeing mr walker although the two gentlemen were partners but still mr robarts said that he would see mr winthrop perhaps mr walker might return while he was there  is there anything i can do for you mr robarts asked mr winthrop mr robarts said that he had wished to see mr walker about that poor fellow crawley ah yes very sad case so much sadder being a clergyman mr robarts we are really quite sorry for himwe are indeed we wouldnt have touched the case ourselves if we could have helped ourselves we wouldnt indeed but we are obliged to take all that business here at any rate hell get nothing but fair usage from us  i am sure of that you dont know whether he has employed any lawyer as yet to defend him  i cant say we dont know you know i should say he hadprobably some barchester attorney borleys and bonstock in barchester are very good peoplevery good people indeedfor that sort of business i mean mr robarts i dont suppose they have much county property in their hands  mr robarts knew that mr winthrop was a fool and that he could get no useful advice from him so he suggested that he would take his gig down to the inn and call back again before long youll find that walker knows no more than i do about it said mr winthrop but of course hell be glad to see you if he happens to come in so mr robarts went to the inn put up his horse and then as he sauntered back up the street met mr walker coming out of the private door of his house  ive been at home all the morning he said but ive had a stiff job of work on hand and told them to say in the office that i was not in seen winthrop have you i dont suppose he did know that i was here the clerks often know more than the partners about mr crawley is it come into my diningroom mr robarts where we shall be alone yesit is a bad case a very bad case the pity is that anybody should ever have said anything about it lord bless me if id been soames id have let him have the twenty pounds lord lufton would never have allowed soames to lose it  but soames wanted to find out the truth  yesthat was just it soames couldnt bear to think that he should be left in the dark and then when the poor man said that soames had paid the cheque to him in the way of businessit was not odd that soames back should have been up was it but mr robarts i should have thought a deal about it before i should have brought such a man as mr crawley before a bench of magistrates on that charge  but between you and me mr walker did he steal the money  well mr robarts you know how im placed  mr crawley is my friend and of course i want to assist him i was under a great obligation to mr crawley once and i wish to befriend him whether he took the money or not but i could act so much better if i felt sure one way or the other  if you ask me i think he did take it  whatstole it  i think he knew it was not his own when he took it you see i dont think he meant to use it when he took it he perhaps had some queer idea that soames had been hard on him or his lordship and that the money was fairly his due then he kept the cheque by him till he was absolutely badgered out of his life by the butcher up the street there that was about the long and the short of it mr robarts  i suppose so and now what had he better do  well if you ask me he is in very bad health isnt he  no i should say not he walked to barchester and back the other day  did he but hes very queer isnt he  very oddmannered indeed  and does and says all manner of odd things  i think youd find the bishop would say so after that interview  well if it would do any good you might have the bishop examined  examined for what mr walker  if you could show you know that crawley has got a bee in his bonnet that the mens sana is not there in shorti think you might manage to have the trial postponed  but then somebody must take charge of his living  you parsons could manage that among youyou and the dean and the archdeacon the archdeacon has always got halfadozen curates about somewhere and thenafter the assizes mr crawley might come to his senses and i thinkmind its only an ideabut i think the committal might be quashed it would have been temporary insanity and though mind i dont give my word for it i think he might go on and keep his living i think so mr robarts  that has never occurred to me  noi daresay not you see the difficulty is this hes so stiffneckedwill do nothing himself well that will do for one proof of temporary insanity the real truth is mr robarts he is as mad as a hatter  upon my word ive often thought so  and you wouldnt mind saying so in evidencewould you well you see there is no helping such a man in any other way he wont even employ a lawyer to defend him  that was what i had come to you about  im told he wont now a man must be mad who wont employ a lawyer when he wants one you see the point we should gain would be thisif we tried to get him through as being a little touched in the upper storywhatever we could do for him we could do against his own will the more he opposed us the stronger our case would be he would swear he was not mad at all and we should say that that was the greatest sign of his madness but when i say we of course i mean you i must not appear in it  i wish you could mr walker  of course i cant but that wont make any difference  i suppose he must have a lawyer  yes he must have a lawyeror rather his friends must  and who should employ him ostensibly  ahtheres the difficulty his wife wouldnt do it i suppose she couldnt do him a better turn  he would never forgive her and she would never consent to act against him  could you interfere  if necessary i willbut i hardly know him well enough  has he no father or mother or uncles or aunts he must have somebody belonging to him said mr walker  then it occurred to mr robarts that dean arabin would be the proper person to interfere dean arabin and mr crawley had been intimate friends in early life and dean arabin knew more of him than did any man at least in those parts all this mr robarts explained to mr walker and mr walker agreed with him that the services of dean arabin should if possible be obtained mr robarts would at once write to dean arabin and explain at length all the circumstances of the case the worst of it is he will hardly be home in time said mr walker perhaps he would come a little sooner if you were to press it  but we could act in his name in his absence i supposeof course with his authority  i wish he could be here a month before the assizes mr robarts it would be better  and in the meantime shall i say anything to mr crawley myself about employing a lawyer  i think i would if he turns upon you as like enough he may and abuses you that will help us in one way if he should consent and perhaps he may that would help us in the other way im told hes been over and upset the whole coach at the palace  i shouldnt think the bishop got much out of him said the parson  i dont like crawley the less for speaking his mind free to the bishop said the attorney laughing and hell speak it free to you too mr robarts  he wont break any of my bones tell me mr walker what lawyer shall i name to him  you cant have a better man than mr mason up the street there  winthrop proposed borleys at barchester  no no no borleys and bonstock are capital people to push a fellow through on a charge of horsestealing or to squeeze a man for a little money but they are not the people for mr crawley in such a case as this mason is a better man and then mason and i know each other in saying which mr walker winked  there was then a discussion between them whether mr robarts should go at once to mr mason but it was decided at last that he should see mr crawley and also write to the dean before he did so the dean might wish to employ his own lawyer and if so the double expense should be avoided always remember mr robarts that when you go into an attorneys office door you will have to pay for it first or last in here you see the dingy old mahogany bare as it is makes you safe or else its the saltcellar which will not allow itself to be polluted by sixandeightpenny considerations but there is the other kind of tax to be paid you must go up and see mrs walker or you wont have her help in this matter  mr walker returned to his work either to some private den within his house or to his office and mr robarts was taken upstairs to the drawingroom there he found mrs walker and her daughter and miss anne prettyman who had just looked in full of the story of mr crawleys walk to barchester mr thumble had seen one of dr tempests curates and had told the whole storyhe mr thumble having heard mrs proudies version of what had occurred and having of course drawn his own deductions from her premises and it seemed that mr crawley had been watched as he passed through the close out of barchester a minor canon had seen him and had declared that he was going at the rate of a hunt swinging his arms on high and speaking very loud thoughas the minor canon said with regretthe words were hardly audible but there had been no doubt as to the man mr crawleys old hat and short rusty cloak and dirty boots had been duly observed and chronicled by the minor canon and mr thumble had been enabled to put together a not altogether false picture of what had occurred as soon as the greetings between mr robarts and the ladies had been made miss anne prettyman broke out again just where she had left off when mr robarts came in they say that mrs proudie declared that she will have him sent to botany bay  luckily mrs proudie wont have much to do in the matter said miss walker who ranged herself as to church matters in ranks altogether opposed to those commanded by mrs proudie  she will have nothing to do with it my dear said mrs walker and i daresay mrs proudie was not foolish enough to say anything of the kind  mamma she would be fool enough to say anything would she not mr robarts  you forget miss walker that mrs proudie is in authority over me  so she is for the matter of that said the young lady but i know very well what you all think of her and say of her too at framley your friend lady lufton loves her dearly i wish i could have been hidden behind a curtain in the palace to hear what mr crawley said to her  mr smillie declares said miss anne prettyman that the bishop has been ill ever since mr smillie went over to his mothers at barchester for christmas and took part of the cathedral duty and we had mr spooner over here in his place so mr smillie of course heard all about it only fancy poor mr crawley walking all the way from hogglestock to barchester and backand i am told he hardly had a shoe to his foot is it not a shame mr robarts  i dont think it was quite so bad as you say miss prettyman but upon the whole i do think it is a shame but what can we do  i suppose there are tithes at hogglestock why are they not given up to the church as they ought to be  my dear miss prettyman that is a very large subject and i am afraid it cannot be settled in time to relieve our poor friend from his distress then mr robarts escaped from the ladies in mr walkers house who as it seemed to him were touching upon dangerous ground and went back to the yard of the george inn for his gigthe george and vulture it was properly called and was the house in which the magistrates had sat when they committed mr crawley for trial  footed it every inch of the way blowed if he didnt the ostler was saying to a gentlemans groom whom mr robarts recognized to be the servant of his friend major grantly and mr robarts knew that they also were talking about mr crawley everybody in the county was talking about mr crawley at home at framley there was no other subject of discourse lady lufton the dowager was full of it being firmly convinced that mr crawley was innocent because the bishop was supposed to regard him as guilty there had been a family conclave held at framley court over that basket of provisions which had been sent for the christmas cheer of the hogglestock parsonage each of the three ladies the two lady luftons and mrs robarts having special views of their own how the pork had been substituted for the beef by old lady lufton young lady lufton thinking that after all the beef would be less dangerous and how a small turkey had been rashly suggested by mrs robarts and how certain small articles had been inserted in the bottom of the basket which mrs crawley had never shewn to her husband need not here be told at length but mr robarts as he heard the two grooms talking about mr crawley began to feel that mr crawley had achieved at least celebrity  the groom touched his hat as mr robarts walked up has the major returned home yet mr robarts asked the groom said that his master was still at plumstead and that he was to go over to plumstead to fetch the major and miss edith in a day or two then mr robarts got into his gig and as he drove out of the yard he heard the words of the men as they returned to the same subject footed it all the way said one and yet hes a genleman too said the other mr robarts thought of this as he drove on intending to call at hogglestock on that very day on his way home it was undoubtedly the fact that mr crawley was recognized to be a gentleman by all who knew him high or low rich or poor by those who thought well of him and by those who thought ill these grooms who had been telling each other that this parson who was to be tried as a thief had been constrained to walk from hogglestock to barchester and back because he could not afford to travel in any other way and that his boots were cracked and his clothes ragged had still known him to be a gentleman nobody doubted it not even they who thought he had stolen the money mr robarts himself was certain of it and told himself that he knew it by evidences which his own education made clear to him but how was it that the grooms knew it for my part i think that there are no better judges of the article than the grooms  thinking still of all which he had heard mr robarts found himself at mr crawleys gate at hogglestock     chapter xxi  mr robarts on his embassy   mr robarts was not altogether easy in his mind as he approached mr crawleys house he was aware that the task before him was a very difficult one and he had not confidence in himselfthat he was exactly the man fitted for the performance of such a task he was a little afraid of mr crawley acknowledging tacitly to himself that the man had a power of ascendancy with which he would hardly be able to cope successfully in old days he had once been rebuked by mr crawley and had been cowed by the rebuke and though there was no touch of rancour in his heart on this account no slightest remaining venombut rather increased respect and friendshipstill he was unable to overcome the remembrance of the scene in which the perpetual curate of hogglestock had undoubtedly had the mastery of him so when two dogs have fought and one has conquered the conquered dog will always show an unconscious submission to the conqueror  he hailed a boy on the road as he drew near to the house knowing that he would find no one at the parsonage to hold his horse for him and was thus able without delay to walk through the garden and knock at the door papa was not at home jane said papa was at the school but papa could certainly be summoned she herself would run across to the school if mr robarts would come in so mr robarts entered and found mrs crawley in the sittingroom mr crawley would be in directly she said and then hurrying on to the subject with confused haste in order that a word or two might be spoken before her husband came back she expressed her thanks and his for the good things which had been sent to them at christmastide  its old lady luftons doings said mr robarts trying to laugh the matter over  i knew that it came from framley mr robarts and i know how good you all are there i have not written to thank lady lufton i thought it better not to write your sister will understand why if no one else does but you will tell them from me i am sure that it was as they intended a comfort to us your sister knows too much of us for me to suppose that our great poverty can be secret from her and as far as i am concerned i do not now much care who knows it  there is no disgrace in not being rich said mr robarts  no and the feeling of disgrace which does attach itself to being so poor as we are is deadened by the actual suffering which such poverty brings with it at least it has become so with me i am not ashamed to say that i am very grateful for what you all have done for us at framley but you must not say anything to him about that  of course i will not mrs crawley  his spirit is higher than mine i think and he suffers more from the natural disinclination which we all have to receiving alms are you going to speak to him about this affair of thecheque mr robarts  i am going to ask him to put his case into some lawyers hands  oh i wish he would  and will he not  it is very kind of you your coming to ask him but  has he so strong an objection  he will tell you that he has no money to pay a lawyer  but surely if he were convinced that it was absolutely necessary for the vindication of his innocence he would submit to charge himself with an expense so necessary not only for himself but for his family  he will say it ought not to be necessary you know mr robarts that in some respects he is not like other men you will not let what i say of him set you against him  indeed no  it is most kind of you to make the attempt he will be here directly and when he comes i will leave you together  while she was yet speaking his step was heard along the gravelpath and he hurried into the room with quick steps i crave your pardon mr robarts he said that i should keep you waiting now mr robarts had not been there ten minutes and any such asking of pardon was hardly necessary and even in his own house mr crawley affected a mock humility as though either through his own debasement or because of the superior station of the other clergyman he were not entitled to put himself on an equal footing with his visitor he would not have shaken hands with mr robartsintending to indicate that he did not presume to do so while the present accusation was hanging over himhad not the action been forced upon him and then there was something of a protest in his manner as though remonstrating against a thing that was unbecoming to him mr robarts without analysing it understood it all and knew that behind the humility there was a crushing pridea pride which in all probability would rise up and crush him before he could get himself out of the room again it was perhaps after all a question whether the man was not served rightly by the extremities to which he was reduced there was something radically wrong within him which had put him into antagonism with all the world and which produced these neverdying grievances there were many clergymen in the country with incomes as small as that which had fallen to the lot of mr crawley but they managed to get on without displaying their sores as mr crawley displayed his they did not wear their old rusty cloaks with all that ostentatious bitterness of poverty which seemed to belong to that garment when displayed on mr crawleys shoulders such for a moment were mr robarts thoughts and he almost repented himself of his present mission but then he thought of mrs crawley and remembering that her sufferings were at any rate undeserved determined that he would persevere  mrs crawley disappeared almost as soon as her husband appeared and mr robarts found himself standing in front of his friend who remained fixed on the spot with his hands folded over each other and his neck slightly bent forward in token also of humility i regret he said that your horse should be left there exposed to the inclemency of the weather but  the horse wont mind it a bit said mr robarts a parsons horse is like a butchers and knows that he mustnt be particular about waiting in the cold  i never have had one myself said mr crawley now mr robarts had had more horses than one before now and had been thought by some to have incurred greater expense than was befitting in his stable comforts the subject therefore was a sore one and he was worried a little i just wanted to say a few words to you crawley he said and if i am not occupying too much of your time  my time is altogether at your disposal will you be seated  then mr robarts sat down and swinging his hat between his legs bethought himself how he should begin his work we had the archdeacon over at framley the other day he said of course you know the archdeacon  i never had the advantage of any acquaintance with dr grantly of course i know him well by name and also personallythat is by sight  and by character  nay i can hardly say so much as that but i am aware that his name stands high with many of his order  exactly that is what i mean you know that his judgment is thought more of in clerical matters than that of any other clergyman in the county  by a certain party mr robarts  well yes they dont think much of him i suppose at the palace but that wont lower him in your estimation  i by no means wish to derogate from dr grantlys high position in his own archdeaconryto which as you are aware i am not attachednor to criticize his conduct in any respect it would be unbecoming in me to do so but i cannot accept it as a point in a clergymans favour that he should be opposed to his bishop  now this was too much for mr robarts after all that he had heard of the visit paid by mr crawley to the palaceof the venom displayed by mrs proudie on that occasion and of the absolute want of subordination to episcopal authority which mr crawley himself was supposed to have shownmr robarts did feel it hard that his friend the archdeacon should be snubbed in this way because he was deficient in reverence for his bishop i thought crawley he said that you yourself were inclined to dispute orders coming to you from the palace the world at least says as much concerning you  what the world says of me i have learned to disregard very much mr robarts but i hope that i shall never disobey the authority of the church when properly and legally exercised  i hope with all my heart you never will nor i either and the archdeacon who knows to the breadth of a hair what a bishop ought to do and what he ought not and what he may do and what he may not will i should say be the last man in england to sin in that way  very probably i am far from contradicting you there pray understand mr robarts that i bring no accusation against the archdeacon why should i  i didnt mean to discuss him at all  nor did i mr robarts  i only mentioned his name because as i said he was over with us the other day at framley and we were all talking about your affair  my affair said mr crawley and then came a frown upon his brow and a gleam of fire into his eyes which effectually banished that look of extreme humility which he had assumed and may i ask why the archdeacon was discussingmy affair  simply from the kindness which he bears to you  i am grateful for the archdeacons kindness as a man is bound to be for any kindness whether displayed wisely or unwisely but it seems to me that my affair as you call it mr robarts is of that nature that they who wish well to me will better further their wishes by silence than by any discussion  then i cannot agree with you mr crawley shrugged his shoulders opened his hands a little and then closed them and bowed his head he could not have declared more clearly by any words that he differed altogether from mr robarts and that as the subject was one so peculiarly his own he had a right to expect that his opinion should be allowed to prevail against that of any other person if you come to that you know how is anybodys tongue to be stopped  that vain tongues cannot be stopped i am well aware i do not expect that peoples tongues should be stopped i am not saying what men will do but what good wishes should dictate  well perhaps youll hear me out for a minute mr crawley again bowed his head whether we were wise or unwise we were discussing this affair  whether i stole mr soamess money  no nobody supposed for a moment you had stolen it  i cannot understand how they should suppose anything else knowing as they do that the magistrates have committed me for the theft this took place at framley you say and probably in lord luftons presence  exactly  and lord lufton was chairman at the sitting of the magistrates at which i was committed how can it be that he should think otherwise  i am sure he has not an idea that you were guilty nor yet has dr thorne who was also one of the magistrates i dont suppose one of them then thought so  then their action to say the least of it was very strange  it was all because you had nobody to manage it for you i thoroughly believe that if you had placed the matter in the hands of a good lawyer you would never have heard a word more about it that seems to be the opinion of everybody i speak to on the subject  then in this country a man is to be punished or not according to his ability to fee a lawyer  i am not talking about punishment  and presuming an innocent man to have the ability and not the will to do so he is to be punished to be ruined root and branch self and family character and pocket simply because knowing his own innocence he does not choose to depend on the mercenary skill of a man whose trade he abhors for the establishment of that which should be clear as the sun at noonday you say i am innocent and yet you tell me i am to be condemned as a guilty man have my gown taken from me be torn from my wife and children be disgraced before the eyes of all men and be made a byword and a thing horrible to be mentioned because i will not fee an attorney to fee another man to come and lie on my behalf to browbeat witnesses to make false appeals and perhaps shed false tears in defending me you have come to me asking me to do this if i understand you telling me that the archdeacon would so advise me  that is my object mr crawley as he had spoken had in his vehemence risen from his seat and mr robarts was also standing  then tell the archdeacon said mr crawley that i will have none of his advice i will have no one there paid by me to obstruct the course of justice or to hoodwink a jury i have been in courts of law and know what is the work for which these gentlemen are hired i will have none of it and i will thank you to tell the archdeacon so with my respectful acknowledgments of his consideration and condescension i say nothing as to my own innocence or my own guilt but i do say that if i am dragged before that tribunal an innocent man and am falsely declared to be guilty because i lack money to bribe a lawyer to speak for me then the laws of this country deserve but little of that reverence which we are accustomed to pay to them and if i be guilty  nobody supposes you to be guilty  and if i be guilty continued mr crawley altogether ignoring the interruption except by the repetition of his words and a slight raising of his voice i will not add to my guilt by hiring any one to prove a falsehood or to disprove a truth  im sorry that you should say so mr crawley  i speak according to what light i have mr robarts and if i have been overwarm with youand i am conscious that i have been in fault in that directioni must pray you to remember that i am somewhat hardly tried my sorrows and troubles are so great that they rise against me and disturb me and drive me onwhither i would not be driven  but my friend is not that just the reason why you should trust in this matter to some one who can be more calm than yourself  i cannot trust to any onein a matter of conscience to do as you would have me is to me wrong shall i do wrong because i am unhappy  you should cease to think it wrong when so advised by persons you can trust  i can trust no one with my own consciencenot even the archdeacon great as he is  the archdeacon has meant only well to you  i will presume so i will believe so i do think so tell the archdeacon from me that i humbly thank himthat in a matter of church question i might probably submit my judgment to his even though he might have no authority over me knowing as i do that in such matters his experience has been great tell him also that though i would fain that this unfortunate affair might burden the tongue of none among my neighboursat least till i shall have stood before the judge to receive the verdict of the jury and if needful his lordships sentencestill i am convinced that in what he has spoken as also in what he has done he has not yielded to the idleness of gossip but has exercised his judgment with intended kindness  he has certainly intended to do you a service and as for its not being talked about that is out of the question  and for yourself mr robarts whom i have ever regarded as a friend since circumstances brought me into your neighbourhoodfor you whose sister i love tenderly in memory of past kindness though now she is removed so far above my sphere as to make it unfit that i should call her my friend  she does not think so at all  for yourself as i was saying pray believe me that though from the roughness of my manner being now unused to social intercourse i seem to be ungracious and forbidding i am grateful and mindful and that in the tablets of my heart i have written you down as one in whom i could trustwere it given to me to trust in men and women then he turned round with his face to the wall and his back to his visitor and so remained till mr robarts had left him at any rate i wish you well through your trouble said robarts and as he spoke he found that his own words were nearly choked by a sob that was rising in his throat  he went away without another word and got out to his gig without seeing mrs crawley during one period of the interview he had been very angry with the manso angry as to make him almost declare to himself that he would take no more trouble on his behalf then he had been brought to acknowledge that mr walker was right and that crawley was certainly mad he was so mad so far removed from the dominion of sound sense that no jury could say that he was guilty and that he ought to be punished for his guilt and as he so resolved he could not but ask himself the question whether the charge of the parish ought to be left in the hands of such a man but at last just before he went these feelings and these convictions gave way to pity and he remembered simply the troubles which seemed to have been heaped on the head of this poor victim to misfortune as he drove home he resolved that there was nothing left for him to do but to write to the dean it was known to all who knew them both that the dean and mr crawley had lived together on the closest intimacy at college and that that friendship had been maintained through lifethough from the peculiarity of mr crawleys character the two had not been much together of late years seeing how things were going now and hearing how pitiful was the plight in which mr crawley was placed the dean would no doubt feel it to be his duty to hasten his return to england he was believed to be at this moment in jerusalem and it would be long before a letter could reach him but there still wanted three months to the assizes and his return might be probably effected before the end of february  i never was so distressed in my life mark robarts said to his wife  and you think you have done no good  only this that i have convinced myself that the poor man is not responsible for what he does and that for her sake as well as for his own some person should be enabled to interfere for his protection then he told mrs robarts what mr walker had said also the message which mr crawley had sent to the archdeacon but they both agreed that that message need not be sent on any further     chapter xxii  major grantly at home   mrs thorne had spoken very plainly in the advice which she had given to major grantly if i were you id be at allington before twelve oclock tomorrow that had been mrs thornes advice and though major grantly had no idea of making the journey so rapidly as the lady had proposed still he thought that he would make it before long and follow the advice in spirit if not to the letter mrs thorne had asked him if it was fair that the girl should be punished because of the fathers fault and the idea had been sweet to him that the infliction or noninfliction of such punishment should be in his hands you go and ask her mrs thorne had said wellhe would go and ask her if it should turn out at last that he had married the daughter of a thief and that he was disinherited for doing soan arrangement of circumstances which he had to teach himself to regard as very probablehe would not love grace the less on that account or allow himself for one moment to repent what he had done as he thought of all this he became somewhat in love with a small income and imagined to himself what honours would be done to him by the mrs thornes of the county when they should come to know in what way he had sacrificed himself to his love yesthey would go and live at pau he thought pau would do he would have enough of income for thatand edith would get lessons cheaply and would learn to talk french fluently he certainly would do it he would go down to allington and ask grace to be his wife and bid her understand that if she loved him she could not be justified in refusing him by the circumstances of her fathers position  but he must go to plumstead before he could go to allington he was engaged to spend his christmas there and must go now at once there was not time for the journey to allington before he was due at plumstead and moreover though he could not bring himself to resolve that he would tell his father what he was going to doit would seem as though i were asking his leave he said to himselfhe thought that he would make a clean breast of it to his mother it made him sad to think that he should cut the rope which fastened his own boat among the other boats in the home harbour at plumstead and that he should go out all alone into strange watersturned adrift altogether as it were from the grantly fleet if he could only get the promise of his mothers sympathy for grace it would be something he understoodno one better than hethe tendency of all his family to an uprising in the world which tendency was almost as strong in his mother as in his father and he had been by no means without a similar ambition himself though with him the ambition had been only fitful not enduring he had a brother a clergyman a busy stirring eloquent london preacher who got churches built and was heard of far and wide as a rising man who had married a certain lady anne the daughter of an earl and who was already mentioned as a candidate for high places how his sister was the wife of a marquis and a leader in the fashionable world the reader already knows the archdeacon himself was a rich man so powerful that he could afford to look down upon a bishop and mrs grantly though there was left about her something of an old softness of nature a touch of the former life which had been hers before the stream of her days had run gold yet she too had taken kindly to wealth and high standing and was by no means one of those who construe literally that passage of scripture which tells us of the camel and the needles eye our henry grantly our major knew himself to be his mothers favourite childknew himself to have become so since something of coolness had grown up between her and her august daughter the augustness of the daughter had done much to reproduce the old freshness of which i have spoken in the mothers heart and had specially endeared to her the son who of all her children was the least subject to the family failing the clergyman charles grantlyhe who had married the lady annewas his fathers darling in these days the old archdeacon would go up to london and be quite happy in his sons house he met there the men whom he loved to meet and heard the talk which he loved to hear it was very fine having the marquis of hartletop for his soninlaw but he had never cared to be much at lady hartletops house indeed the archdeacon cared to be in no house in which those around him were supposed to be bigger than himself such was the little family fleet from out of which henry grantly was now proposing to sail alone with his little boattaking grace crawley with him at the helm my father is a just man at the bottom he said to himself and though he may not forgive me he will not punish edith  but there was still left one of the familynot a grantly indeed but one so nearly allied to them as to have his boat moored in the same harbourwho as the major well knew would thoroughly sympathize with him this was old mr harding his mothers fatherthe father of his mother and of his aunt mrs arabinwhose home was now at the deanery he was also to be at plumstead during this christmas and he at any rate would give a ready assent to such a marriage as that which the major was proposing for himself but then poor old mr harding had been thoroughly deficient in that ambition which had served to aggrandize the family into which his daughter had married he was a poor old man who in spite of good friendsfor the late bishop of the diocese had been his dearest friendhad never risen high in his profession and had fallen even from the moderate altitude which he had attained but he was a man whom all loved who knew him and it was much to the credit of his soninlaw the archdeacon that with all his tendencies to love rising suns he had ever been true to mr harding  major grantly took his daughter with him and on his arrival at plumstead she of course was the first object of attention mrs grantly declared that she had grown immensely the archdeacon complimented her red cheeks and said that cosby lodge was as healthy a place as any in the county while mr harding ediths greatgrandfather drew slowly from his pocket sundry treasures with which he had come prepared for the delight of the little girl charles grantly and lady anne had no children and the heir of all the hartletops was too august to have been trusted to the embraces of her mothers grandfather edith therefore was all that he had in that generation and of edith he was prepared to be as indulgent as he had been in their time of his grandchildren the grantlys and still was of his grandchildren the arabins and had been before that of his own daughters shes more like eleanor than any one else said the old man in a plaintive tone now eleanor was mrs arabin the deans wife and was at this timeif i were to say over forty i do not think i should be uncharitable no one else saw the special likeness but no one else remembered as mr harding did what eleanor had been when she was three years old  illustration shes more like eleanor than any one else  aunt nelly is in france said the child  yes my darling aunt nelly is in france and i wish she were at home aunt nelly has been away a long time  i suppose shell stay till the dean picks her up on his way home said mrs grantly  so she says in her letters i heard from her yesterday and i brought the letter as i thought youd like to see it mrs grantly took the letter and read it while her father still played with the child the archdeacon and the major were standing together on the rug discussing the shooting at chaldicotes as to which the archdeacon had a strong opinion im quite sure that a man with a place like that does more good by preserving than by leaving it alone the better head of game he has the richer the county will be generally it is just the same with pheasants as it is with sheep and bullocks a pheasant doesnt cost more than hes worth any more than a barndoor fowl besides a man who preserves is always respected by the poachers and the man who doesnt is not  theres something in that sir certainly said the major  more than you think for perhaps look at poor sowerby who went on there for years without a shilling how he was respected because he lived as the people around him expected a gentleman to live thorne will have a bad time of it if he tries to change things  only think exclaimed mrs grantly when eleanor wrote she had not heard of that affair of poor mr crawleys  does she say anything about him asked the major  ill read what she says i see in galignani that a clergyman in barsetshire has been committed for theft pray tell me who it is not the bishop i hope for the credit of the diocese  i wish it were said the archdeacon  for shame my dear said his wife  no shame at all if we are to have a thief among us id sooner find him in a bad man than a good one besides we should have a change at the palace which would be a great thing  but is it not odd that eleanor should have heard nothing of it said mrs grantly  its odd that you should not have mentioned it yourself  i did not certainly nor you papa i suppose  mr harding acknowledged that he had not spoken of it and then they calculated that perhaps she might not have received any letter from her husband written since the news had reached him besides why should he have mentioned it said the major he only knows as yet of the inquiry about the cheque and can have heard nothing of what was done by the magistrates  still it seems so odd that eleanor should not have known of it seeing that we have been talking of nothing else for the last week said mrs grantly  for two days the major said not a word of grace crawley to any one nothing could be more courteous and complaisant than was his fathers conduct to him anything that he wanted for edith was to be done for himself there was no trouble which would not be taken his hunting and his shooting and his fishing seemed to have become matters of paramount consideration to his father and then the archdeacon became very confidential about money mattersnot offering anything to his son which as he well knew would have been seen through as palpable bribery and corruptionbut telling him of this little scheme and of that of one investment and of anotherhow he contemplated buying a small property here and spending a few thousands on building there of course it is all for you and your brother said the archdeacon with that benevolent sadness which is used habitually by fathers on such occasions and i like you to know what it is that i am doing i told charles about the london property the last time i was up said the archdeacon and there shall be no difference between him and you if all goes well this was very goodnatured on the archdeacons part and was not strictly necessary as charles was the eldest son but the major understood it perfectly there shall be an elysium opened to you if only you will not do that terrible thing of which you spoke when last here the archdeacon uttered no such words as these and did not even allude to grace crawley but the words were as good as spoken and had they been spoken ever so plainly the major could not have understood them more clearly he was quite awake to the loveliness of the elysium opened before him he had had his moment of anxiety whether his father would or would not make an elder son of his brother charles the whole thing was now put before him plainly give up grace crawley and you shall share alike with your brother disgrace yourself by marrying her and your brother shall have everything there was the choice and it was still open to him to take which side he pleased were he never to go near grace crawley again no one would blame him unless it were miss prettyman or mrs thorne fill your glass henry said the archdeacon youd better i tell you for there is no more of it left then the major filled his glass and sipped the wine and swore to himself that he would go down to allington at once what did his father think to bribe him by giving him 20 port he would certainly go down to allington and he would tell his mother tomorrow morning or certainly on the next day what he was going to do pity it should be all gone isnt it sir said the archdeacon to his fatherinlaw it has lasted my time said mr harding and im very much obliged to it dear dear how well i remember your father giving the order for it there were two pipes and somebody said it was a heady wine if the prebendaries and rectors cant drink it said your father the curates will  curates indeed said the archdeacon its too good for a bishop unless one of the right sort  your father used to say those things but with him the poorer the guest the better the cheer when he had a few clergymen round him how he loved to make them happy  never talked shop to themdid he said the archdeacon  not after dinner at any rate goodness gracious when one thinks of it do you remember how we used to play cards  every night regularlythreepenny points and sixpence on the rubber said the archdeacon  dear dear how things are changed and i remember when the clergymen did more of the dancing in barchester than all the other young men in the city put together  and a good set they weregentlemen every one of them its well that some of them dont dance nowthat is for the girls sake  i sometimes sit and wonder said mr harding whether your fathers spirit ever comes back to the old house and sees the changesand if so whether he approves them  approves them said the archdeacon  wellyes i think he would upon the whole im sure of this he would not disapprove because the new ways are changed from his ways he never thought himself infallible and do you know my dear i am not sure that it isnt all for the best i sometimes think that some of us were very idle when we were young i was i know  i worked hard enough said the archdeacon  ah yes you but most of us took it very easily dear dear when i think of it and see how hard they work now and remember what pleasant times we used to havei dont feel sometimes quite sure  i believe the work was done a great deal better than it is now said the archdeacon there wasnt so much fuss but there was more reality and men were men and clergymen were gentlemen  yesthey were gentlemen  such a creature as that old woman at the palace couldnt have held his head up among us thats what has come from reform a reformed house of commons makes lord brock prime minister and then your prime minister makes dr proudie a bishop wellit will last my time i suppose  it has lasted minelike the wine said mr harding  theres one glass more and you shall have it sir then mr harding drank the last glass of the 1820 port and they went into the drawingroom  on the next morning after breakfast the major went out for a walk by himself his father had suggested to him that he should go over to shoot at framley and had offered him the use of everything the archdeaconry possessed in the way of horses dogs guns and carriages but the major would have none of these things he would go out and walk by himself hes not thinking of her is he said the archdeacon to his wife in a whisper i dont know i think he is said mrs grantly it will be so much the better for charles if he does said the archdeacon grimly and the look of his face as he spoke was by no means pleasant you will do nothing unjust archdeacon said his wife i will do as i like with my own said he and then he also went out and took a walk by himself  that evening after dinner there was no 1820 port and no recollections of old days they were rather dull the three of them as they sat togetherand dulness is always more unendurable than sadness old mr harding went to sleep and the archdeacon was cross henry he said you havent a word to throw to a dog ive got rather a headache this evening sir said the major the archdeacon drank two glasses of wine one after another quickly then he woke his fatherinlaw gently and went off is there anything the matter asked the old man nothing particular my father seems to be a little cross ah ive been to sleep and i oughtnt its my fault well go in and smooth him down but the archdeacon wouldnt be smoothed down on that occasion he would let his son see the difference between a father pleased and a father displeasedor rather between a father pleasant and a father unpleasant he hasnt said anything to you has he said the archdeacon that night to his wife not a wordas yet if he does it without the courage to tell us i shall think him a cur said the archdeacon but he did tell you said mrs grantly standing up for her favourite son and for the matter of that he has courage enough for anything if he does it i shall always say that he has been driven to it by your threats  thats sheer nonsense said the archdeacon  its not nonsense at all said mrs grantly  then i suppose i was to hold my tongue and say nothing said the archdeacon and as he spoke he banged the door between his dressingroom and mrs grantlys bedroom  on the first day of the new year major grantly spoke his mind to his mother the archdeacon had gone into barchester having in vain attempted to induce his son to go with him mr harding was in the library reading a little and sleeping a little and dreaming of old days and old friends and perhaps sometimes of the old wine mrs grantly was alone in a small sittingroom which she frequented upstairs when suddenly her son entered the room mother he said i think it better to tell you that i am going to allington  to allington henry she knew very well who was at allington and what must be the business which would take him there  yes mother miss crawley is there and there are circumstances which make it incumbent on me to see her without delay  what circumstances henry  as i intend to ask her to be my wife i think it best to do so now i owe it to her and to myself that she should not think that i am deterred by her fathers position  but would it not be reasonable that you should be deterred by her fathers position  no i think not i think it would be dishonest as well as ungenerous i cannot bring myself to brook such delay of course i am alive to the misfortune which has fallen upon herupon her and me too should she ever become my wife but it is one of those burdens which a man should have shoulders broad enough to bear  quite so if she were your wife or even if you were engaged to her then honour would require it of you as well as affection as it is your honour does not require it and i think you should hesitate for all our sakes and especially for ediths  it will do edith no harm and mother if you alone were concerned i think you would feel that it would not hurt you  i was not thinking of myself henry  as for my father the very threats which he has used make me conscious that i have only to measure the price he has told me that he will stop my allowance  but that may not be the worst think how you are situated you are the younger son of a man who will be held to be justified in making an elder son if he thinks fit to do so  i can only hope that he will be fair to edith if you will tell him that from me it is all that i will ask you to do  but you will see him yourself  no mother not till i have been to allington then i will see him again or not just as he pleases i shall stop at guestwick and will write to you a line from thence if my father decides on doing anything let me know at once as it will be necessary that i should get rid of the lease of my house  oh henry  i have thought a great deal about it mother and i believe i am right whether i am right or wrong i shall do it i will not ask you now for any promise or pledge but should miss crawley become my wife i hope that you at least will not refuse to see her as your daughter having so spoken he kissed his mother and was about to leave the room but she held him by his arm and he saw that her eyes were full of tears dearest mother if i grieve you i am sorry indeed  not me not me not me she said  for my father i cannot help it had he not threatened me i should have told him also as he has done so you must tell him but give him my kindest love  oh henry you will be ruined you will indeed can you not wait remember how headstrong your father is and yet how goodand how he loves you think of all that he has done for you when did he refuse you anything  he has been good to me but in this i cannot obey him he should not ask me  you are wrong you are indeed he has a right to expect that you will not bring disgrace upon the family  nor will iexcept such disgrace as may attend upon poverty goodby mother i wish you could have said one kind word to me  have i not said a kind word  not as yet mother  i would not for worlds speak unkindly to you if it were not for your father i would bid you bring whom you pleased home to me as your wife and i would be as a mother to her and if this girl should become your wife  it shall not be my fault if she does not  i will try to love hersome day  then the major went leaving edith at the rectory as requested by his mother his own dogcart and his servant were at plumstead and he drove himself home to cosby lodge  when the archdeacon returned the news was told to him at once henry has gone to allington to propose to miss crawley said mrs grantly  gonewithout speaking to me  he left his love and said that it was useless his remaining as he knew he should only offend you  he has made his bed and he must lie upon it said the archdeacon and then there was not another word said about grace crawley on that occasion     chapter xxiii  miss lily dales resolution   illustration  the ladies at the small house at allington breakfasted always at ninea liberal nine and the postman whose duty it was to deliver letters in that village at halfpast eight being also liberal in his ideas as to time always arrived punctually in the middle of breakfast so that mrs dale expected her letters and lily hers just before their second cup of tea as though the letters formed a part of the morning meal jane the maidservant always brought them in and handed them to mrs dalefor lily had in these days come to preside at the breakfasttable and then there would be an examination of the outsides before the envelopes were violated and as each knew pretty well all the circumstances of the correspondence of the other there would be some guessing as to what this or that epistle might contain and after that a reading out loud of passages and not unfrequently of the entire letter but now at the time of which i am speaking grace crawley was at the small house and therefore the common practice was somewhat in abeyance  on one of the first days of the new year jane brought in the letters as usual and handed them to mrs dale lily was at the time occupied with the teapot but still she saw the letters and had not her hands so full as to be debarred from the expression of her usual anxiety mamma im sure i see two there for me she said only one for you lily said mrs dale lily instantly knew from the tone of the voice that some letter had come which by the very aspect of the handwriting had disturbed her mother there is one for you my dear said mrs dale throwing a letter across the table to grace and one for you lily from bell the others are for me and whom are yours from mamma asked lily one is from mrs jones the other i think is a letter on business then lily said nothing further but she observed that her mother only opened one of her letters at the breakfasttable lily was very patientnot by nature i think but by exercise and practice she had once in her life been too much in a hurry and having then burned herself grievously she now feared the fire she did not therefore follow her mother after breakfast but sat with grace over the fire hemming diligently at certain articles of clothing which were intended for use in the hogglestock parsonage the two girls were making a set of new shirts for mr crawley but i know he will ask where they come from said grace and then mamma will be scolded but i hope hell wear them said lily sooner or later he will said grace because mamma manages generally to have her way at last then they went on for an hour or so talking about the home affairs at hogglestock but during the whole time lilys mind was intent upon her mothers letter  nothing was said about it at lunch and nothing when they walked out after lunch for lily was very patient but during the walk mrs dale became aware that her daughter was uneasy these two watched each other unconsciously with a closeness which hardly allowed a glance of the eye certainly not a tone of the voice to pass unobserved to mrs dale it was everything in the world that her daughter should be if not happy at heart at least tranquil and to lily who knew that her mother was always thinking of her and of her alone her mother was the only human divinity now worthy of adoration but nothing was said about the letter during the walk  when they came home it was nearly dusk and it was their habit to sit up for a while without candles talking till the evening had in truth set in and the unmistakable and enforced idleness of remaining without candles was apparent during this time lily demanding patience of herself all the while was thinking what she would do or rather what she would say about the letter that nothing could be done or said in the presence of grace crawley was a matter of course nor would she do or say anything to get rid of grace she would be very patient but she would at last ask her mother about the letter  and then as luck would have it grace crawley got up and left the room lily still waited for a few minutes and in order that her patience might be thoroughly exercised she said a word or two about her sister bell how the eldest childs whoopingcough was nearly well and how the baby was doing wonderful things with its first tooth but as mrs dale had already seen bells letter all this was not intensely interesting at last lily came to the point and asked her question mamma from whom was that other letter which you got this morning  our story will perhaps be best told by communicating the letter to the reader before it was discussed with lily the letter was as follows      general committee office  january 186   i should have said that mrs dale had not opened the letter till she had found herself in the solitude of her own bedroom and that then before doing so she had examined the handwriting with anxious eyes when she first received it she thought she knew the writer but was not sure then she had glanced at the impression over the fastening and had known at once from whom the letter had come it was from mr crosbie the man who had brought so much trouble into her house who had jilted her daughter the only man in the world whom she had a right to regard as a positive enemy to herself she had no doubt about it as she tore the envelope open and yet when the address given made her quite sure a new feeling of shivering came upon her and she asked herself whether it might not be better that she should send his letter back to him without reading it but she read it  madam the letter began      you will be very much surprised to hear from me and i    am quite aware that i am not entitled to the ordinary    courtesy of an acknowledgment from you should you be    pleased to throw my letter on one side as unworthy of your    notice but i cannot refrain from addressing you and must    leave it to you to reply to me or not as you may think    fit     i will only refer to that episode of my life with which    you are acquainted for the sake of acknowledging my great    fault and of assuring you that i did not go unpunished it    would be useless for me now to attempt to explain to you    the circumstances which led me into that difficulty which    ended in so great a blunder but i will ask you to believe    that my folly was greater than my sin     but i will come to my point at once you are no doubt    aware that i married a daughter of lord de courcy and    that i was separated from my wife a few weeks after our    unfortunate marriage it is now something over twelve    months since she died at badenbaden in her mothers    house i never saw her since the day we first parted i    have not a word to say against her the fault was mine in    marrying a woman whom i did not love and had never loved    when i married lady alexandrina i loved not her but your    daughter     i believe i may venture to say to you that your daughter    once loved me from the day on which i last wrote to you    that terrible letter which told you of my fate i have    never mentioned the name of lily dale to human ears it    has been too sacred for my mouthtoo sacred for the    intercourse of any friendship with which i have been    blessed i now use it for the first time to you in order    that i may ask whether it be possible that her old love    should ever live again mine has lived alwayshas never    faded for an hour making me miserable during the years    that have passed since i saw her but capable of making me    very happy if i may be allowed to see her again     you will understand my purpose now as well as though i    were to write pages i have no scheme formed in my head    for seeing your daughter again how can i dare to form a    scheme when i am aware that the chance of success must be    so strong against me but if you will tell me that there    can be a gleam of hope i will obey any commands that    you can put upon me in any way that you may point out i    am free againand she is free i love her with all my    heart and seem to long for nothing in the world but that    she should become my wife whether any of her old love may    still abide with her you will know if it do it may even    yet prompt her to forgive one who in spite of falseness    of conduct has yet been true to her in heart     i have the honour to be madam    your most obedient servant     adolphus crosbie   this was the letter which mrs dale had received and as to which she had not as yet said a word to lily or even made up her mind whether she would say a word or not dearly as the mother and daughter loved each other thorough as was the confidence between them yet the name of adolphus crosbie had not been mentioned between them oftener perhaps than halfadozen times since the blow had been struck mrs dale knew that their feelings about the man were altogether different she herself not only condemned him for what he had done believing it to be impossible that any shadow of excuse could be urged for his offence thinking that the fault had shown the man to be mean beyond redemptionbut she had allowed herself actually to hate him he had in one sense murdered her daughter and she believed that she could never forgive him but lily as her mother well knew had forgiven this man altogether had made excuses for him which cleansed his sin of all its blackness in her own eyes and was to this day anxious as ever for his welfare and his happiness mrs dale feared that lily did in truth love him still if it was so was she not bound to show her this letter lily was old enough to judge for herselfold enough and wise enough too mrs dale told herself halfascore of times that morning that she could not be justified in keeping the letter from her daughter  but yet she much wished that the letter had never been written and would have given very much to be able to put it out of the way without injustice to lily to her thinking it would be impossible that lily should be happy in marrying such a man such a marriage now would be as mrs dale thought a degradation to her daughter a terrible injury had been done to her but such reparation as this would in mrs dales eyes only make the injury deeper and yet lily loved the man and loving him how could she resist the temptation of his offer mamma from whom was that letter which you got this morning lily asked for a few moments mrs dale remained silent mamma continued lily i think i know whom it was from if you tell me to ask nothing further of course i will not  no lily i cannot tell you that  then mamma out with it at once what is the use of shivering on the brink  it was from mr crosbie  i knew it i cannot tell you why but i knew it and now mammaam i to read it  you shall do as you please lily  then i please to read it  listen to me a moment first for myself i wish that the letter had never been written it tells badly for the man as i think of it i cannot understand how any man could have brought himself to address either you or me after having acted as he acted  but mamma we differ about all that you know  now he has written and there is the letterif you choose to read it  lily had it in her hand but she still sat motionless holding it you think mamma i ought not to read it  you must judge for yourself dearest  and if i do not read it what shall you do mamma  i shall do nothingor perhaps i should in such a case acknowledge it and tell him that we have nothing more to say to him  that would be very stern  he has done that which makes some sternness necessary  then lily was again silent and still she sat motionless with the letter in her hand mamma she said at last if you tell me not to read it i will give it you back unread if you bid me exercise my own judgment i shall take it upstairs and read it  you must exercise your own judgment said mrs dale then lily got up from her chair and walked slowly out of the room and went to her mothers chamber the thoughts which passed through mrs dales mind while her daughter was reading the letter were very sad she could find no comfort anywhere lily she told herself would surely give way to this mans renewed expressions of affection and she mrs dale herself would be called upon to give her child to a man whom she could neither love nor respectwhom for aught she knew she could never cease to hate and she could not bring herself to believe that lily would be happy with such a man as for her own life desolate as it would beshe cared little for that mothers know that their daughters will leave them even widowed mothers mothers with but one child leftsuch a one as was this motherare aware that they will be left alone and they can bring themselves to welcome the sacrifice of themselves with something of satisfaction mrs dale and lily had indeed of late become bound together especially so that the mother had been justified in regarding the link which joined them as being firmer than that by which most daughters are bound to their mothersbut in all that she would have found no regret even now in these very days she was hoping that lily might yet be brought to give herself to john eames but she could not after all that was come and gone be happy in thinking that lily should be given to adolphus crosbie  when mrs dale went upstairs to her own room before dinner lily was not there nor were they alone together again that evening except for a moment when lily as was usual went into her mothers room when she was undressing but neither of them then said a word about the letter lily during dinner and throughout the evening had borne herself well giving no sign of special emotion keeping to herself entirely her own thoughts about the proposition made to her and afterwards she had progressed diligently with the fabrication of mr crawleys shirts as though she had no such letter in her pocket and yet there was not a moment in which she was not thinking of it to grace just before she went to bed she did say one word i wonder whether it can ever come to a person to be so placed that there can be no doing right let what will be donethat do or not do as you may it must be wrong  i hope you are not in such a condition said grace  i am something near it said lily but perhaps if i look long enough i shall see the light  i hope it will be a happy light at last said grace who thought that lily was referring only to john eames  at noon on the next day lily had still said nothing to her mother about the letter and then what she said was very little when must you answer mr crosbie mamma  when my dear  i mean how long may you take it need not be today  nocertainly not today  then i will talk over it with you tomorrow it wants some thinkingdoes it not mamma  it would not want much with me lily  but then mamma you are not i believing as i believe feeling as i feel it wants some thinking thats what i mean  i wish i could help you my dear  you shall help metomorrow the morrow came and lily was still very patient but she had prepared herself and had prepared the time also so that in the hour of the gloaming she was alone with her mother and sure that she might remain alone with her for an hour or so mamma sit there she said i will sit down here and then i can lean against you and be comfortable you can bear as much of me as thatcant you mamma then mrs dale put her arm over lilys shoulder and embraced her daughter and now mamma we will talk about this wonderful letter  i do not know dear that i have anything to say about it  but you must have something to say about it mamma you must bring yourself to have something to sayto have a great deal to say  you know what i think as well as though i talked for a week  that wont do mamma come you must not be hard with me  hard lily  i dont mean that you will hurt me or not give me any foodor that you will not go on caring about me more than anything else in the whole world ten times over and lily as she spoke tightened the embrace of her mothers arm round her neck im not afraid youll be hard in that way but you must soften your heart so as to be able to mention his name and talk about him and tell me what i ought to do you must see with my eyes and hear with my ears and feel with my heartand then when i know that you have done that i must judge with your judgment  i wish you to use your own  yesbecause you wont see with my eyes and hear with my ears thats what i call being hard though you should feed me with blood from your breast i should call you a hard pelican unless you could give me also the sympathy which i demand from you you see mamma we have never allowed ourselves to speak of this man  what need has there been dearest  only because we have been thinking of him out of the full heart the mouth speakeththat is the mouth does so when the full heart is allowed to have its own way comfortably  there are things which should be forgotten  forgotten mamma  the memory of which should not be fostered by much talking  i have never blamed you mamma never even in my heart i have known how good and gracious and sweet you have been but i have often accused myself of cowardice because i have not allowed his name to cross my lips either to you or to bell to talk of forgetting such an accident as that is a farce and as for fostering the memory of it do you think that i have ever spent a night from that time to this without thinking of him do you imagine that i have ever crossed our own lawn or gone down through the gardenpath there without thinking of the times when he and i walked there together there needs no fostering for such memories as those they are weeds which will grow rank and strong though nothing be done to foster them there is the earth and the rain and that is enough for them you cannot kill them if you would and they certainly will not die because you are careful not to hoe and rake the ground  lily you forget how short the time has been as yet  i have thought it very long but the truth is mamma that this nonfostering of memories as you call it has not been the real cause of our silence we have not spoken of mr crosbie because we have not thought alike about him had you spoken you would have spoken with anger and i could not endure to hear him abused that has been it  partly so lily  now you must talk of him and you must not abuse him we must talk of him because something must be done about his letter even if it be left unanswered it cannot be so left without discussion and yet you must say no evil of him  am i to think that he behaved well  no mamma you are not to think that but you are to look upon his fault as a fault that has been forgiven  it cannot be forgotten dear  but mamma when you go to heaven  my dear  but you will go to heaven mamma and why should i not speak of it you will go to heaven and yet i suppose you have been very wicked because we are all very wicked but you wont be told of your wickedness there you wont be hated there because you were this or that when you were here  i hope not lily but isnt your argument almost profane  no i dont think so we ask to be forgiven just as we forgive that is the way in which we hope to be forgiven and therefore it is the way in which we ought to forgive when you say that prayer at night mamma do you ever ask yourself whether you have forgiven him  i forgive him as far as humanity can forgive i would do him no injury  but if you and i are forgiven only after that fashion we shall never get to heaven lily paused for some further answer from her mother but as mrs dale was silent she allowed that portion of the subject to pass as completed and now mamma what answer do you think we ought to send to his letter  my dear how am i to say you know i have said already that if i could act on my own judgment i would send none  but that was said in the bitterness of gall  come lily say what you think yourself we shall get on better when you have brought yourself to speak do you think that you wish to see him again  i dont know mamma upon the whole i think not  then in heavens name let me write and tell him so  stop a moment mamma there are two persons here to be consideredor rather three  i would not have you think of me in such a question  i know you would not but never mind and let me go on the three of us are concerned at any rate you and he and i i am thinking of him now we have all suffered but i do believe that hitherto he has had the worst of it  and who has deserved the worst  mamma how can you go back in that way we have agreed that that should be regarded as done and gone he has been very unhappy and now we see what remedy he proposes to himself for his misery do i flatter myself if i allow myself to look at it in that way  perhaps he thinks he is offering a remedy for your misery  as this was said lily turned round slowly and looked up into her mothers face mamma she said that is very cruel i did not think you could be so cruel how can you who believe him to be so selfish think that  it is very hard to judge of mens motives i have never supposed him to be so black that he would not wish to make atonement for the evil he has done  if i thought that there certainly could be but one answer  who can look into a mans heart and judge all the sources of his actions there are mixed feelings there no doubt remorse for what he has done regret for what he has lostsomething perhaps of the purity of love  yes somethingi hope somethingfor his sake  but when a horse kicks and bites you know his nature and do not go near him when a man has cheated you once you think he will cheat you again and you do not deal with him you do not look to gather grapes from thistles after you have found that they are thistles  i still go for the roses though i have often torn my hand with thorns in looking for them  but you do not pluck those that have become cankered in the blowing  because he was once at fault will he be cankered always  i would not trust him  now mamma see how different we are or rather how different it is when one judges for oneself or for another if it were simply myself and my own future fate in life i would trust him with it all tomorrow without a word i should go to him as a gambler goes to the gamblingtable knowing that if i lost everything i could hardly be poorer than i was before but i should have a better hope than the gambler is justified in having that however is not my difficulty and when i think of him i can see a prospect of success for the gambler i think so well of myself that loving him as i doyes mamma do not be uneasyloving him as i do i believe i could be a comfort to him i think that he might be better with me than without me that is he would be so if he could teach himself to look back upon the past as i can do and to judge of me as i can judge of him  he has nothing at least for which to condemn you  but he would have were i to marry him now he would condemn me because i had forgiven him he would condemn me because i had borne what he had done to me and had still loved himloved him through it all he would feel and know the weaknessand there is weakness i have been weak in not being able to rid myself of him altogether he would recognize this after awhile and would despise me for it but he would not see what there is of devotion to him in my being able to bear the taunts of the world in going back to him and your taunts and my own taunts i should have to bear his alsonot spoken aloud but to be seen in his face and heard in his voiceand that i could not endure if he despised me and he would that would make us both unhappy therefore mamma tell him not to come tell him that he can never come but if it be possible tell him this tenderly then she got up and walked away as though she were going out of the room but her mother had caught her before the door was opened  lily she said if you think you can be happy with him he shall come  no mamma no i have been looking for the light ever since i read his letter and i think i see it and now mamma i will make a clean breast of it from the moment in which i heard that that poor woman was dead i have been in a state of flutter it has been weak of me and silly and contemptible but i could not help it i kept on asking myself whether he would ever think of me now well he has answered the question and has so done it that he has forced upon me the necessity of a resolution i have resolved and i believe that i shall be the better for it  the letter which mrs dale wrote to mr crosbie was as follows  mrs dale presents her compliments to mr crosbie and begs to assure him that it will not now be possible that he should renew the relations which were broken off three years ago between him and mrs dales family it was very short certainly and it did not by any means satisfy mrs dale but she did not know how to say more without saying too much the object of her letter was to save him the trouble of a futile perseverance and them from the annoyance of persecution and this she wished to do without mentioning her daughters name and she was determined that no word should escape her in which there was any touch of severity any hint of an accusation so much she owed to lily in return for all that lily was prepared to abandon there is my note she said at last offering it to her daughter i did not mean to see it said lily and mamma i will not read it now let it go i know you have been good and have not scolded him i have not scolded him certainly said mrs dale and then the letter was sent     chapter xxiv  mrs dobbs broughtons dinnerparty   mr john eames of the incometax office had in these days risen so high in the world that people in the westend of town and very respectable people toopeople living in south kensington in neighbourhoods not far from belgravia and in very handsome houses round bayswaterwere glad to ask him out to dinner money had been left to him by an earl and rumour had of course magnified that money he was a private secretary which is in itself a great advance on being a mere clerk and he had become the particularly intimate friend of an artist who had pushed himself into high fashion during the last year or twoone conway dalrymple whom the rich english world was beginning to pet and pelt with gilt sugarplums and who seemed to take very kindly to petting and gilt sugarplums i dont know whether the friendship of conway dalrymple had not done as much to secure john eames his position at the bayswater dinnertables as had either the private secretaryship or the earls money and yet when they had first known each other now only two or three years ago conway dalrymple had been the poorer man of the two some chance had brought them together and they had lived in the same rooms for nearly two years this arrangement had been broken up and the conway dalrymple of these days had a studio of his own somewhere near kensington palace where he painted portraits of young countesses and in which he had even painted a young duchess it was the peculiar merit of his picturesso at least said the artloving worldthat though the likeness was always good the stiffness of the modern portrait was never there there was also ever some story told in dalrymples pictures over and above the story of the portraiture this countess was drawn as a fairy with wings that countess as a goddess with a helmet the thing took for a time and conway dalrymple was picking up his gilt sugarplums with considerable rapidity  on a certain day he and john eames were to dine out together at a certain house in that bayswater district it was a large mansion if not made of stone yet looking very stony with thirty windows at least all of them with cutstone frames requiring let me say at least four thousand a year for its maintenance and its owner dobbs broughton a man very well known both in the city and over the grass in northamptonshire was supposed to have a good deal more than four thousand a year mrs dobbs broughton a very beautiful woman who certainly was not yet thirtyfive let her worst enemies say what they might had been painted by conway dalrymple as a grace there were of course three graces in the picture but each grace was mrs dobbs broughton repeated we all know how graces stand sometimes two graces looking one way and one the other in this picture mrs dobbs broughton as centre grace looked you full in the face the same lady looked away from you displaying her left shoulder as one side grace and displaying her right shoulder as the other side grace for this pretty toy mr conway dalrymple had picked up a gilt sugarplum to the tune of six hundred pounds and had moreover won the heart both of mr and mrs dobbs broughton upon my word johnny dalrymple had said to his friend hes a deuced good fellow has really a good glass of claretwhich is getting rarer and rarer every dayand will mount you for a day whenever you please down at market harboro come and dine with them johnny eames condescended and did go and dine with mr dobbs broughton i wonder whether he remembered when conway dalrymple was talking of the rarity of good claret how much beer the young painter used to drink when they were out together in the country as they used to be occasionally three years ago and how the painter had then been used to complain that bitter beer cost threepence a glass instead of twopence which had hitherto been the recognized price of the article in those days the sugarplums had not been gilt and had been much rarer  johnny eames and his friend went together to the house of mr dobbs broughton as dalrymple lived close to the broughtons eames picked him up in a cab filthy things these cabs are said dalrymple as he got into the hansom  i dont know about that said johnny theyre pretty good i think  foul things said conway dont you feel what a draught comes in here because the glass is cracked id have one of my own only i should never know what to do with it  the greatest nuisance on earth i should think said johnny  if you could always have it standing ready round the corner said the artist it would be delightful but one would want half a dozen horses and two or three men for that  i think the stands are the best said johnny  they were a little latea little later than they should have been had they considered that eames was to be introduced to his new acquaintances but he had already lived long enough before the world to be quite at his ease in such circumstances and he entered mrs broughtons drawingroom with his pleasantest smile upon his face but as he entered he saw a sight which made him look serious in spite of his efforts to the contrary mr adolphus crosbie secretary to the board at the general committee office was standing on the rug before the fire  who will be there eames had asked of his friend when the suggestion to go and dine with dobbs broughton had been made to him  impossible to say conway had replied a certain horrible fellow of the name of musselboro will almost certainly be there he always is when they have anything of a swell dinnerparty he is a sort of partner of broughtons in the city he wears a lot of chains and has elaborate whiskers and an elaborate waistcoat which is worse and he doesnt wash his hands as often as he ought to do  an objectionable party rather i should say said eames  well yes musselboro is objectionable hes very goodhumoured you know and goodlooking in a sort of way and goes everywhere that is among people of this sort of course hes not handandglove with lord derby and i wish he could be made to wash his hands they havent any other standing dish and you may meet anybody they always have a member of parliament they generally manage to catch a baronet and i have met a peer there on that august occasion musselboro was absent  so instructed eames on entering the room looked round at once for mr musselboro if i dont see the whiskers and chain he had said i shall know theres a peer mr musselboro was in the room but eames had descried mr crosbie long before he had seen mr musselboro  there was no reason for confusion on his part in meeting crosbie they had both loved lily dale crosbie might have been successful but for his own fault eames had on one occasion been thrown into contact with him and on that occasion had quarrelled with him and had beaten him giving him a black eye and in this way obtaining some mastery over him there was no reason why he should be ashamed of meeting crosbie and yet when he saw him the blood mounted all over his face and he forgot to make any further search for mr musselboro  i am so much obliged to mr dalrymple for bringing you said mrs dobbs broughton very sweetly only he ought to have come sooner naughty man i know it was his fault will you take miss demolines down miss demolinesmr eames  mr dobbs broughton was somewhat sulky and had not welcomed our hero very cordially he was beginning to think that conway dalrymple gave himself airs and did not sufficiently understand that a man who had horses at market harboro and 41 lafitte was at any rate as good as a painter who was pelted with gilt sugarplums for painting countesses but he was a man whose illhumour never lasted long and he was soon pressing his wine on johnny eames as though he loved him dearly  but there was yet a few minutes before they went down to dinner and johnny eames as he endeavoured to find something to say to miss demolineswhich was difficult as he did not in the least know miss demolines line of conversationwas aware that his efforts were impeded by thoughts of mr crosbie the man looked older than when he had last seen himso much older that eames was astonished he was bald or becoming bald and his whiskers were grey or were becoming grey and he was much fatter johnny eames who was always thinking of lily dale could not now keep himself from thinking of adolphus crosbie he saw at a glance that the man was in mourning though there was nothing but his shirtstuds by which to tell it and he knew that he was in mourning for his wife i wish she might have lived for ever johnny said to himself  he had not yet been definitely called upon by the entrance of the servant to offer his arm to miss demolines when crosbie walked across to him from the rug and addressed him  mr eames said he it is some time since we met and he offered his hand to johnny  yes it is said johnny accepting the proffered salutation i dont know exactly how long but ever so long  i am very glad to have the opportunity of shaking hands with you said crosbie and then he retired as it had become his duty to wait with his arm ready for mrs dobbs broughton having married an earls daughter he was selected for that honour there was a barrister in the room and mrs dobbs broughton ought to have known better as she professed to be guided in such matters by the rules laid down by the recognized authorities she ought to have been aware that a man takes no rank from his wife but she was entitled i think to merciful consideration for her error a woman situated as was mrs dobbs broughton cannot altogether ignore these terrible rules she cannot let her guests draw lots for precedence she must select some one for the honour of her own arm and amidst the intricacies of rank how is it possible for a woman to learn and to remember everything if providence would only send mrs dobbs broughton a peer for every dinnerparty the thing would go more easily but what woman will tell me offhand which should go out of a room first a cb an admiral of the blue the dean of barchester or the dean of arches who is to know who was everybodys father how am i to remember that young thompsons progenitor was made a baronet and not a knight when he was lord mayor perhaps mrs dobbs broughton ought to have known that mr crosbie could have gained nothing by his wifes rank and the barrister may be considered to have been not immoderately severe when he simply spoke of her afterwards as the silliest and most ignorant old woman he had ever met in his life eames with the lovely miss demolines on his arm was the last to move before the hostess mr dobbs broughton had led the way energetically with old lady demolines there was no doubt about lady demolinesas his wife had told him because her title marked her her husband had been a physician in paris and had been knighted in consequence of some benefit supposed to have been done to some french scion of royaltywhen such scions in france were royal and not imperial lady demolines rank was not much certainly but it served to mark her and was beneficial  illustration i am very glad to have the opportunity of shaking hands with you  as he went downstairs eames was still thinking of his meeting with crosbie and had as yet hardly said a word to his neighbour and his neighbour had not said a word to him now johnny understood dinners quite well enough to know that in a party of twelve among whom six are ladies everything depends on your next neighbour and generally on the next neighbour who specially belongs to you and as he took his seat he was a little alarmed as to his prospect for the next two hours on his other hand sat mrs ponsonby the barristers wife and he did not much like the look of mrs ponsonby she was fat heavy and goodlooking with a broad space between her eyes and light smooth haira youthful british matron every inch of her of whom any barrister with a young family of children might be proud now miss demolines though she was hardly to be called beautiful was at any rate remarkable she had large dark wellshaped eyes and very dark hair which she wore tangled about in an extraordinary manner and she had an expressive facea face made expressive by the owners will such power of expression is often attained by dint of labourthough it never reaches to the expression of anything in particular she was almost sufficiently goodlooking to be justified in considering herself to be a beauty  but miss demolines though she had said nothing as yet knew her game very well a lady cannot begin conversation to any good purpose in the drawingroom when she is seated and the man is standingnor can she know then how the table may subsequently arrange itself powder may be wasted and often is wasted and the spirit rebels against the necessity of commencing a second enterprise but miss demolines when she found herself seated and perceived that on the other side of her was mr ponsonby a married man commenced her enterprise at once and our friend john eames was immediately aware that he would have no difficulty as to conversation  dont you like winter dinnerparties began miss demolines this was said just as johnny was taking his seat and he had time to declare that he liked dinnerparties at all periods of the year if the dinner was good and the people pleasant before the host had muttered something which was intended to be understood to be a grace but i mean especially in winter continued miss demolines i dont think daylight should ever be admitted at a dinnertable and though you may shut out the daylight you cant shut out the heat and then there are always so many other things to go to in may and june and july dinners should be stopped by act of parliament for those three months i dont care what people do afterwards because we always fly away on the first of august  that is goodnatured on your part  im sure what i say would be for the good of societybut at this time of the year a dinner is warm and comfortable  very comfortable i think  and people get to know each otherin saying which miss demolines looked very pleasantly up into johnnys face  there is a great deal in that said he i wonder whether you and i will get to know each other  of course we shallthat is if im worth knowing  there can be no doubt about that i should say  time alone can tell but mr eames i see that mr crosbie is a friend of yours  hardly a friend  i know very well that men are friends when they step up and shake hands with each other it is the same as when women kiss  when i see women kiss i always think that there is deep hatred at the bottom of it  and there may be deep hatred between you and mr crosbie for anything i know to the contrary said miss demolines  the very deepest said johnny pretending to look grave  ah then i know he is your bosom friend and that you will tell him anything i say what a strange history that was of his marriage  so i have heardbut he is not quite bosom friend enough with me to have told me all the particulars i know that his wife is dead  dead oh yes she has been dead these two years i should say  not so long as that i should think  wellperhaps not but its ever so long agoquite long enough for him to be married again did you know her  i never saw her in my life  i knew hernot well indeed but i am intimate with her sister lady amelia gazebee and i have met her there none of that family have married what you may call well and now mr eames pray look at the menu and tell me what i am to eat arrange for me a little dinner of my own out of the great bill of fare provided i always expect some gentleman to do that for me mr crosbie you know only lived with his wife for one month  so ive been told  and a terrible month they had of it i used to hear of it he doesnt look that sort of man does he  wellno i dont think he does but what sort of man do you mean  why such a regular bluebeard of course you know how he treated another girl before he married lady alexandrina she died of itwith a broken heart absolutely died and there he is indifferent as possibleand would treat me in the same way tomorrow if i would let him  johnny eames finding it impossible to talk to miss demolines about lily dale took up the card of the dinner and went to work in earnest recommending his neighbour what to eat and what to pass by but youve skipped the pâté she said with energy  allow me to ask you to choose mine for me instead you are much more fit to do it and she did choose his dinner for him  they were sitting at a round table and in order that the ladies and gentlemen should alternate themselves properly mr musselboro was opposite to the host next to him on his right was old mrs van siever the widow of a dutch merchant who was very rich she was a ghastly thing to look at as well from the quantity as from the nature of the wiggeries which she wore she had not only a false front but long false curls as to which it cannot be conceived that she would suppose that any one would be ignorant as to their falseness she was very thin too and very small and putting aside her wiggeries you would think her to be all eyes she was a ghastly old woman to the sight and not altogether pleasant in her mode of talking she seemed to know mr musselboro very well for she called him by his name without any prefix he had indeed begun life as a clerk in her husbands office  why doesnt whatshisname have real silver forks she said to him now mrs whatshisnamemrs dobbs broughton we will call herwas sitting on the other side of mr musselboro between him and mr crosbie and so placed mr musselboro found it rather hard to answer the question more especially as he was probably aware that other questions would follow  whats the use said mr musselboro everybody has these plated things now whats the use of a lot of capital lying dead  everybody doesnt i dont you know as well as i do musselboro that the appearance of the thing goes for a great deal capital isnt lying dead as long as people know that youve got it  before answering this mr musselboro was driven to reflect that mrs dobbs broughton would probably hear his reply you wont find that there is any doubt on that head in the city as to broughton he said  i shant ask in the city and if i did i should not believe what people told me i think there are sillier folks in the city than anywhere else what did he give for that picture upstairs which the young man painted  what mrs dobbs broughtons portrait  you dont call that a portrait do you i mean the one with the three naked women mr musselboro glanced round with one eye and felt sure that mrs dobbs broughton had heard the question but the old woman was determined to have an answer how much did he give for it musselboro  six hundred pounds i believe said mr musselboro looking straight before him as he answered and pretending to treat the subject with perfect indifference  did he indeed now six hundred pounds and yet he hasnt got silver spoons how things are changed tell me musselboro who was that young man who came in with the painter  mr musselboro turned round and asked mrs broughton a mr john eames mrs van siever said mrs broughton whispering across the front of mr musselboro he is private secretary to lordlordlordi forget who some one of the ministers i know and he had a great fortune left him the other day by lordlordlord somebody else  all among the lords i see said mrs van siever then mrs dobbs broughton drew herself back remembering some little attack which had been made on her by mrs van siever when she herself had had the real lord to dine with her  there was a miss van siever there also sitting between crosbie and conway dalrymple conway dalrymple had been specially brought there to sit next to miss van siever theres no knowing how much shell have said mrs dobbs broughton in the warmth of her friendship but its all real it is indeed the mother is awfully rich  but shes awful in another way too said dalrymple  indeed she is conway mrs dobbs broughton had got into a way of calling her young friend by his christian name all the world calls him conway she had said to her husband once when her husband caught her doing so she is awful her husband made the business in the city when things were very different from what they are now and i cant help having her she has transactions of business with dobbs but theres no mistake about the money  she neednt leave it to her daughter i suppose  but why shouldnt she she has nobody else you might offer to paint her you know shed make an excellent picture so much character you come and see her  conway dalrymple had expressed his willingness to meet miss van siever saying something however as to his present position being one which did not admit of any matrimonial speculation then mrs dobbs broughton had told him with much seriousness that he was altogether wrong and that were he to forget himself or commit himself or misbehave himself there must be an end to their pleasant intimacy in answer to which mr dalrymple had said that his grace was surely of all graces the least gracious and now he had come to meet miss van siever and was seated next to her at table  miss van siever who at this time had perhaps reached her twentyfifth year was certainly a handsome young woman she was fair and large bearing no likeness whatever to her mother her features were regular and her full clear eyes had a brilliance of their own looking at you always stedfastly and boldly though very seldom pleasantly her mouth would have been beautiful had it not been too strong for feminine beauty her teeth were perfecttoo perfectlooking like miniature walls of carved ivory she knew the fault of this perfection and shewed her teeth as little as she could her nose and chin were finely chiselled and her head stood well upon her shoulders but there was something hard about it all which repelled you dalrymple when he saw her recoiled from her not outwardly but inwardly yes she was handsome as may be a horse or a tiger but there was about her nothing of feminine softness he could not bring himself to think of taking clara van siever as the model that was to sit before him for the rest of his life he certainly could make a picture of her as had been suggested by his friend mrs broughton but it must be as judith with the dissevered head or as jael using her hammer over the temple of sisera yeshe thought she would do as jael and if mrs van siever would throw him a sugarplumfor he would want the sugarplum seeing that any other result was out of the questionthe thing might be done such was the idea of mr conway dalrymple respecting miss van sieverbefore he led her down to dinner  at first he found it hard to talk to her she answered him and not with monosyllables but she answered him without sympathy or apparent pleasure in talking now the young artist was in the habit of being flattered by ladies and expected to have his small talk made very easy for him he liked to give himself little airs and was not generally disposed to labour very hard at the task of making himself agreeable  were you ever painted yet he asked her after they had both been sitting silent for two or three minutes  was i everever painted in what way  i dont mean rouged or enamelled or got up by madame rachel but have you ever had your portrait taken  i have been photographedof course  thats why i asked you if you had been paintedso as to make some little distinction between the two i am a painter by profession and do portraits  so mrs broughton told me  i am not asking for a job you know  i am quite sure of that  but i should have thought you would have been sure to have sat to somebody  i never did i never thought of doing so one does those things at the instigation of ones intimate friendsfathers mothers uncles and aunts and the like  or husbands perhapsor lovers  well yes my intimate friend is my mother and she would never dream of such a thing she hates pictures  hates pictures  and especially portraits and im afraid mr dalrymple she hates artists  good heavens how cruel i suppose there is some story attached to it there has been some fatal likenesssome terrible picturesomething in her early days  nothing of the kind mr dalrymple it is merely the fact that her sympathies are with ugly things rather than with pretty things i think she loves the mahogany dinnertable better than anything else in the house and she likes to have everything dark and plain and solid  and good  good of its kind certainly  if everybody was like your mother how would the artists live  there would be none  and the world you think would be none the poorer  i did not speak of myself i think the world would be very much the poorer i am very fond of the ancient masters though i do not suppose that i understand them  they are easier understood than the modern i can tell you perhaps you dont care for modern pictures  not in comparison certainly if that is uncivil you have brought it on yourself but i do not in truth mean anything derogatory to the painters of the day when their pictures are old theythat is the good ones among themwill be nice also  pictures are like wine and want age you think  yes and statues too and buildings above all things the colours of new paintings are so glaring and the faces are so bright and selfconscious that they look to me when i go to the exhibition like coloured prints in a childs new picturebook it is the same thing with buildings one sees all the points and nothing is left to the imagination  i find i have come across a real critic  i hope at any rate i am not a sham one and miss van siever as she said this looked very savage  i shouldnt take you to be a sham in anything  ah that would be saying a great deal for myself who can undertake to say that he is not a sham in anything  as she said this the ladies were getting up so miss van siever also got up and left mr conway dalrymple to consider whether he could say or could think of himself that he was not a sham in anything as regarded miss clara van siever he began to think that he should not object to paint her portrait even though there might be no sugarplum he would certainly do it as jael and he would if he dared insert dimly in the background some idea of the face of the mother halfappearing halfvanishing as the spirit of the sacrifice he was composing his picture while mr dobbs broughton was arranging himself and his bottles  musselboro he said ill come up between you and crosbie mr eames though i run away from you the claret shall remain or rather it shall flow backwards and forwards as rapidly as you will  ill keep it moving said johnny  do theres a good fellow its a nice glass of wine isnt it old ramsby who keeps as good a stock of stuff as any winemerchant in london gave me a hint three or four years ago that hed a lot of tidy bordeaux its 41 you know he had ninety dozen and i took it all  what was the figure broughton said crosbie asking the question which he knew was expected  well i only gave one hundred and four for it then its worth a hundred and twenty now i wouldnt sell a bottle of it for any money come dalrymple pass it round but fill your glass first  thank you no i dont like it ill drink sherry  dont like it said dobbs broughton  its strange isnt it but i dont  i thought you particularly told me to drink his claret said johnny to his friend afterwards  so i did said conway and wonderfully good wine it is but i make it a rule never to eat or drink anything in a mans house when he praises it himself and tells me the price of it  and i make it a rule never to cut the nose off my own face said johnny  before they went johnny eames had been specially invited to call on lady demolines and had said that he would do so we live in porchester gardens said miss demolines upon my word i believe that the farther london stretches in that direction the farther mamma will go she thinks the air so much better i know its a long way  distance is nothing to me said johnny i can always set off over night  conway dalrymple did not get invited to call on mrs van siever but before he left the house he did say a word or two more to his friend mrs broughton as to clara van siever she is a fine young woman he said she is indeed  you have found it out have you  yes i have found it out i do not doubt that some day shell murder her husband or her mother or startle the world by some newlyinvented crime but that only makes her the more interesting  and when you add to that all the old womans money said mrs dobbs broughton you think that she might do  for a picture certainly im speaking of her simply as a model could we not manage it get her once here without her mother knowing it or broughton or any one ive got the subjectjael and sisera you know i should like to put musselboro in as sisera with the nail half driven in mrs dobbs broughton declared that the scheme was a great deal too wicked for her participation but at last she promised to think of it  you might as well come up and have a cigar dalrymple said as he and his friend left mr broughtons house johnny said that he would go up and have a cigar or two and now tell me what you think of mrs dobbs broughton and her set said conway  well ill tell you what i think of them i think they stink of money as the people say but im not sure that theyve got any all the same  i should suppose he makes a large income  very likely and perhaps spends more than he makes a good deal of it looked to me like makebelieve theres no doubt about the claret but the champagne was execrable a man is a criminal to have such stuff handed round to his guests and there isnt the ring of real gold about the house  i hate the ring of the gold as you call it said the artist  so do ii hate it like poison but if it is there i like it to be true there is a sort of persons going nowand one meets them out here and there every day of ones lifewho are downright brummagem to the ear and to the touch and to the sight and we recognize them as such at the very first moment my honoured lord and master sir raffle is one such there is no mistaking him clap him down upon the counter and he rings dull and untrue at once pardon me my dear conway if i say the same of your excellent friend mr dobbs broughton  i think you go a little too far but i dont deny it what you mean is that hes not a gentleman  i mean a great deal more than that bless you when you come to talk of a gentleman who is to define the word how do i know whether or no im a gentleman myself when i used to be in burton crescent i was hardly a gentleman thensitting at the same table with mrs roper and the lupexesdo you remember them and the lovely amelia  i suppose you were a gentleman then as well as now  you if you had been painting duchesses then with a studio in kensington gardens would not have said so if you had happened to come across me i cant define a gentleman even in my own mindbut i can define the sort of man with whom i think i can live pleasantly  and poor dobbs doesnt come within the line  no not quite a very nice fellow im quite sure and im very much obliged to you for taking me there  i never will take you to any house again and what did you think of his wife  thats a horse of another colour altogether a pretty woman with such a figure as hers has got a right to be anything she pleases i see you are a great favourite  no im notnot especially i do like her she wants to make up a match between me and that miss van siever miss van is to have gold by the ingot and jewels by the bushel and a hatful of bank shares and a whole mine in cornwall for her fortune  and is very handsome into the bargain  yes shes handsome  so is her mother said johnny if you take the daughter ill take the mother and see if i cant do you out of a mine or two goodnight old fellow im only joking about old dobbs ill go and dine there again tomorrow if you like it     chapter xxv  miss madalina demolines   illustration  i dont think you care two straws about her conway dalrymple said to his friend john eames two days after the dinnerparty at mrs dobbs broughtons the painter was at work in his studio and the private secretary from the incometax office who was no doubt engaged on some special mission to the west end on the part of sir raffle buffle was sitting in a loungingchair and smoking a cigar  because i dont go about with my stockings crossgartered and do that kind of business  well yes because you dont do that kind of business more or less  it isnt in my line my dear fellow i know what you mean very well i daresay artistically speaking  dont be an ass johnny  well then poetically or romantically if you like that better i daresay that poetically or romantically i am deficient i eat my dinner very well and i dont suppose i ought to do that and if youll believe me i find myself laughing sometimes  i never knew a man who laughed so much youre always laughing  and that you think is a bad sign  i dont believe you really care about her i think you are aware that you have got a loveaffair on hand and that you hang on to it rather persistently having in some way come to a resolution that you would be persistent but there isnt much heart in it i daresay there was once  and that is your opinion  you are just like some of those men who for years past have been going to write a book on some new subject the intention has been sincere at first and it never altogether dies away but the wouldbe author though he still talks of his work knows that it will never be executed and is very patient under the disappointment all enthusiasm about the thing is gone but he is still known as the man who is going to do it some day you are the man who means to marry miss dale in five ten or twenty years time  now conway all that is thoroughly unfair the wouldbe author talks of his wouldbe book to everybody i have never talked of miss dale to any one but you and one or two very old family friends and from year to year and from month to month i have done all that has been in my power to win her i dont think i shall ever succeed and yet i am as determined about it as i was when i first began itor rather much more so if i do not marry lily i shall never marry at all and if anybody were to tell me tomorrow that she had made up her mind to have me i should well nigh go mad for joy but i am not going to give up all my life for love indeed the less i can bring myself to give up for it the better i shall think of myself now ill go away and call on old lady demolines  and flirt with her daughter  yesflirt with her daughter if i get the opportunity why shouldnt i flirt with her daughter  why not if you like it  i dont like itnot particularly that is because the young lady is not very pretty nor yet very graceful nor yet very wise  she is pretty after a fashion said the artist and if not wise she is at any rate clever  nevertheless i do not like her said john eames  then why do you go there  one has to be civil to people though they are neither pretty nor wise i dont mean to insinuate that miss demolines is particularly bad or indeed that she is worse than young ladies in general i only abused her because there was an insinuation in what you said that i was going to amuse myself with miss demolines in the absence of miss dale the one thing has nothing to do with the other thing nothing that i shall say to miss demolines will at all militate against my loyalty to lily  all right old fellowi didnt mean to put you on your purgation i want you to look at that sketch do you know for whom it is intended johnny took up a scrap of paper and having scrutinized it for a minute or two declared that he had not the slightest idea who was represented you know the subjectthe story that is intended to be told said dalrymple  upon my word i dont theres some old fellow seems to be catching it over the head but its all so confused i cant make much of it the woman seems to be uncommon angry  do you ever read your bible  ah dear not as often as i ought to do ah i see its sisera i never could quite believe that story jael might have killed captain sisera in his sleepfor which bytheby she ought to have been hung and she might possibly have done it with a hammer and a nail but she could not have driven it through and staked him to the ground  ive warrant enough for putting it into a picture at any rate my jael there is intended for miss van siever  miss van siever well it is like her has she sat for it  o dear no not yet i mean to get her to do so theres a strength about her which would make her sit the part admirably and i fancy she would like to be driving a nail into a fellows head i think i shall take musselboro for a sisera  youre not in earnest  he would just do for it but of course i shant ask him to sit as my jael would not like it she would not consent to operate on so base a subject so you really are going down to guestwick  yes i start tomorrow goodby old fellow ill come and sit for sisera if youll let meonly miss van jael shall have a blunted nail if you please  then johnny left the artists room and walked across from kensington to lady demolines house as he went he partly accused himself and partly excused himself in that matter of his love for lily dale there were moments of his life in which he felt that he would willingly die for herthat life was not worth having without herin which he went about inwardly reproaching fortune for having treated him so cruelly why should she not be his he half believed that she loved him she had almost told him so she could not surely still love that other man who had treated her with such vile falsehood as he considered the question in all its bearings he assured himself over and over again that there would be now no fear of that rivaland yet he had such fears and hated crosbie almost as much as ever it was a thousand pities certainly that the man should have been made free by the death of his wife but it could hardly be that he should seek lily again or that lily if so sought should even listen to him but yet there he was free once morean odious being whom johnny was determined to sacrifice to his vengeance if cause for such sacrifice should occur and thus thinking of the real truth of his love he endeavoured to excuse himself to himself from that charge of vagueness and laxness which his friend conway dalrymple had brought against him and then again he accused himself of the same sin if he had been positively in earnest with downright manly earnestness would he have allowed the thing to drag itself on with a weak uncertain life as it had done for the last two or three years lily dale had been a dream to him in his boyhood and he had made a reality of his dream as soon as he had become a man but before he had been able as a man to tell his love to the girl whom he had loved as a child another man had intervened and his prize had been taken from him then the wretched victor had thrown his treasure away and he john eames had been content to stoop to pick it upwas content to do so now but there was something which he felt to be unmanly in the constant stooping dalrymple had told him that he was like a man who is ever writing a book and yet never writes it he would make another attempt to get his book writtenan attempt into which he would throw all his strength and all his heart he would do his very best to make lily his own but if he failed now he would have done with it it seemed to him to be below his dignity as a man to be always coveting a thing which he could not obtain  johnny was informed by the boy in buttons who opened the door for him at lady demolines that the ladies were at home and he was shown up into the drawingroom here he was allowed full ten minutes to explore the knicknacks on the table and open the photograph book and examine the furniture before miss demolines made her appearance when she did come her hair was tangled more marvellously even than when he saw her at the dinnerparty and her eyes were darker and her cheeks thinner im afraid mamma wont be able to come down said miss demolines she will be so sorry but she is not quite well today the wind is in the east she says and when she says the wind is in the east she always refuses to be well  then i should tell her it was in the west  but it is in the east  ah there i cant help you miss demolines i never know which is east and which west and if i did i shouldnt know from which point the wind blew  at any rate mamma cant come downstairs and you must excuse her what a very nice woman mrs dobbs broughton is johnny acknowledged that mrs dobbs broughton was charming and mr broughton is so goodnatured johnny again assented i like him of all things said miss demolines so do i said johnnyi never liked anybody so much in my life i suppose one is bound to say that kind of thing oh you illnatured man said miss demolines i suppose you think that poor mr broughton is a littlejust a littleyou know what i mean  not exactly said johnny  yes you do you know very well what i mean and of course he is how can he help it  poor fellowno i dont suppose he can help it or he wouldwouldnt he  of course mr broughton had not the advantage of birth or much early education all his friends know that and make allowance accordingly when she married him she was aware of his deficiency and made up her mind to put up with it  it was very kind of her dont you think so  i knew maria clutterbuck for years before she was married of course she was very much my senior but nevertheless we were friends i think i was hardly more than twelve years old when i first began to correspond with maria she was then past twenty so you see mr eames i make no secret of my age  why should you  but never mind that everybody knows that maria clutterbuck was very much admired of course im not going to tell you or any other gentleman all her history  i was in hopes you were  then certainly your hopes will be frustrated mr eames but undoubtedly when she told us that she was going to take dobbs broughton we were a little disappointed maria clutterbuck had been used to a better kind of life you understand what i mean mr eames  oh exactlyand yet its not a bad kind of life either  no no that is true it has its attractions she keeps her carriage sees a good deal of company has an excellent house and goes abroad for six weeks every year but you know mr eames there is perhaps a little uncertainty about it  life is always uncertain miss demolines  youre quizzing now i know but dont you feel now really that city money is always very chancy it comes and goes so quick  as regards the going i think thats the same with all money said johnny  not with land or the funds mamma has every shilling laid out in a firstclass mortgage on land at four per cent that does make one feel so secure the land cant run away  but you think poor broughtons money may  its all speculation you know i dont believe she minds it i dont indeed she lives that kind of fevered life now that she likes excitement of course we all know that mr dobbs broughton is not what we can call an educated gentleman his manners are against him and he is very ignorant even dear maria would admit that  one would perhaps let that pass without asking her opinion at all  she has acknowledged it to me twenty times but he is very goodnatured and lets her do pretty nearly anything that she likes i only hope she wont trespass on his goodnature i do indeed  you mean spend too much money  no i didnt mean that exactly of course she ought to be moderate and i hope she is to that kind of fevered existence profuse expenditure is perhaps necessary but i was thinking of something else i fear she is a little giddy  dear me i should have thought she was tootootoo  you mean too old for anything of that kind maria broughton must be thirtythree if shes a day  that would make you just twentyfive said johnny feeling perfectly sure as he said so that the lady whom he was addressing was at any rate past thirty  never mind my age mr eames whether i am twentyfive or a hundredandfive has nothing to do with poor maria clutterbuck but now ill tell you why i mention all this to you you must have seen how foolish she is about your friend mr dalrymple  upon my word i havent  nonsense mr eames you have if she were your wife would you like her to call a man conway of course you would not i dont mean to say that theres anything in it i know marias principles too well to suspect that its merely because shes flighty and fevered  that fevered existence accounts for it all said johnny  no doubt it does said miss demolines with a nod of her head which was intended to show that she was willing to give her friend the full benefit of any excuse which could be offered for her but dont you think you could do something mr eames  i do something  yes you you and mr dalrymple are such friends if you were just to point out to him you know  point out what tell him that he oughtnt to be called conway because after all i suppose thats the worst of it if you mean to say that dalrymple is in love with mrs broughton you never made a greater mistake in your life  oh no not in love that would be terrible you know and miss demolines shook her head sadly but there may be so much mischief done without anything of that kind thoughtlessness you know mr eamespure thoughtlessness think of what i have said and if you can speak a word to your friend do and now i want to ask you something else im so glad you are come because circumstances have seemed to make it necessary that you and i should know each other we may be of so much use if we put our heads together johnny bowed when he heard this but made no immediate reply have you heard anything about a certain picture that is being planned johnny did not wish to answer this question but miss demolines paused so long and looked so earnestly into his face that he found himself forced to say something  what picture  a certain picture that is or perhaps that is not to be painted by mr dalrymple  i hear so much about dalrymples pictures you dont mean the portrait of lady glencora palliser that is nearly finished and will be in the exhibition this year  i dont mean that at all i mean a picture that has not yet been begun  a portrait i suppose  as to that i cannot quite say it is at any rate to be a likeness i am sure you have heard of it come mr eames it would be better that we should be candid with each other you remember miss van siever of course  i remember that she dined at the broughtons  and you have heard of jael i suppose and sisera  yes in a general wayin the bible  and now will you tell me whether you have not heard the names of jael and miss van siever coupled together i see you know all about it  i have heard of it certainly  of course you have so have i as you perceive now mr eamesand miss demolines voice became tremulously eager as she addressed himit is your duty and it is my duty to take care that that picture shall never be painted  but why should it not be painted  you dont know miss van siever yet  not in the least  nor mrs van siever  i never spoke a word to her  i do i know them bothwell there was something almost grandly tragic in miss demolines voice as she thus spoke yes mr eames i know them well if that scheme be continued it will work terrible mischief you and i must prevent it  but i dont see what harm it will do  think of conway dalrymple passing so many hours in marias sittingroom upstairs the picture is to be painted there you know  but miss van siever will be present wont that make it all right what is there wrong about miss van siever  i wont deny that clara van siever has a certain beauty of her own to me she is certainly the most unattractive woman that i ever came near she is simply repulsive hereupon miss demolines held up her hand as though she were banishing miss van siever for ever from her sight and shuddered slightly men think her handsome and she is handsome but she is false covetous malicious cruel and dishonest  what a fiend in petticoats  you may say that mr eames and then her mother her mother is not so bad her mother is very different but the mother is an odious woman too it was an evil day for maria clutterbuck when she first saw either the mother or the daughter i tell you that in confidence  but what can i do said johnny who began to be startled and almost interested by the eagerness of the woman  ill tell you what you can do dont let your friend go to mr broughtons house to paint the picture if he does do it there will mischief come of it of course you can prevent him  i should not think of trying to prevent him unless i knew why  shes a nasty proud minx and it would set her up ever so highto think that she was being painted by mr dalrymple but that isnt the reason maria would get into terrible trouble about it and there would be no end of mischief i must not tell you more now and if you do not believe me i cannot help it surely mr eames my word may be taken as going for something and when i ask you to help me in this i do expect that you will not refuse me by this time miss demolines was sitting close to him and had more than once put her hand upon his arm in the energy of her eloquence then as he remembered that he had never seen miss demolines till the other day or miss van siever or even mrs dobbs broughton he bethought himself that it was all very droll nevertheless he had no objection to miss demolines putting her hand upon his arm  i never like to interfere in anything that does not seem to be my own business said johnny  is not your friends business your own business what does friendship mean if it is not so and when i tell you that it is my business mine of right does that go for nothing with you i thought i might depend upon you mr eames i did indeed then again she put her hand upon his arm and as he looked into her eyes he began to think that after all she was goodlooking in a certain way at any rate she had fine eyes and there was something picturesque about the entanglement of her hair think of it and then come back and talk to me again said miss demolines  but i am going out of town tomorrow  for how long  for ten days  nothing can be done during that time clara van siever is going away in a day and will not be back for three weeks i happen to know that so we have plenty of time for working it would be very desirable that she should never even hear of it but that cannot be hoped as maria has such a tongue couldnt you see mr dalrymple tonight  well no i dont think i could  mind at least that you come to me as soon as ever you return  before he got out of the house which he did after a most affectionate farewell johnny felt himself compelled to promise that he would come to miss demolines again as soon as he got back to town and as the door was closed behind him by the boy in buttons he made up his mind that he certainly would call as soon as he returned to london its as good as a play he said to himself not that he cared in the least for miss demolines or that he would take any steps with the intention of preventing the painting of the picture miss demolines had some battle to fight and he would leave her to fight it with her own weapons if his friend chose to paint a picture of jael and take miss van siever as a model it was no business of his nevertheless he would certainly go and see miss demolines again because as he said she was as good as a play     chapter xxvi  the picture   on that same afternoon conway dalrymple rolled up his sketch of jael and sisera put it into his pocket dressed himself with some considerable care putting on a velvet coat which he was in the habit of wearing out of doors when he did not intend to wander beyond kensington gardens and the neighbourhood and which was supposed to become him well yellow gloves and a certain spanish hat of which he was fond and slowly sauntered across to the house of his friend mrs dobbs broughton when the door was opened to him he did not ask if the lady were at home but muttering some word to the servant made his way through the hall upstairs to a certain small sittingroom looking to the north which was much used by the mistress of the house it was quite clear that conway dalrymple had arranged his visit beforehand and that he was expected he opened the door without knocking and though the servant had followed him he entered without being announced im afraid im late he said as he gave his hand to mrs broughton but for the life i could not get away sooner  you are quite in time said the lady for any good that you are likely to do  what does that mean  it means this my friend that you had better give the idea up i have been thinking of it all day and i do not approve of it  what nonsense  of course you will say so conway i have observed of late that whatever i say to you is called nonsense i suppose it is the new fashion that gentlemen should so express themselves but i am not quite sure that i like it  you know what i mean i am very anxious about this picture and i shall be much disappointed if it cannot be done now it was you put it into my head first  i regret it very much i can assure you but it will not be generous in you to urge that against me  but why shouldnt it succeed  there are many reasonssome personal to myself  i do not know what they can be you hinted at something which i only took as having been said in joke  if you mean about miss van siever and yourself i was quite in earnest conway i do not think you could do better and i should be glad to see it of all things nothing would please me more than to bring miss van siever and you together  and nothing would please me less  but why so  becausebecause i can do nothing but tell you the truth carina because my heart is not free to present itself at miss van sievers feet  it ought to be free conway and you must make it free it will be well that you should be married and well for others besides yourself i tell you so as your friend and you have no truer friend sit where you are if you please you can say anything you have to say without stalking about the room  i was not going to stalkas you call it  you will be safer and quieter while you are sitting i heard a knock at the door and i do not doubt that it is clara she said she would be here  and you have told her of the picture  yes i have told her she said that it would be impossible and that her mother would not allow it here she is then miss van siever was shown into the room and dalrymple perceived that she was a girl the peculiarity of whose complexion bore daylight better even than candlelight there was something in her countenance which seemed to declare that she could bear any light to which it might be subjected without flinching from it and her bonnet which was very plain and her simple brown morning gown suited her well she was one who required none of the circumstances of studied dress to carry off aught in her own appearance she could look her best when other women look their worst and could dare to be seen at all times dalrymple with an artists eye saw this at once and immediately confessed to himself that there was something great about her he could not deny her beauty but there was ever present to him that look of hardness which had struck him when he first saw her he could not but fancy that though at times she might be playful and allow the fur of her coat to be stroked with goodhumourshe would be a dangerous plaything using her claws unpleasantly when the goodhumour should have passed away but not the less was she beautiful andbeyond that and better than that for his purposeshe was picturesque  clara said mrs broughton here is this mad painter and he says that he will have you on his canvas either with your will or without it  even if he could do that i am sure he would not said miss van siever  to prove to you that i can i think i need only show you the sketch said dalrymple taking the drawing out of his pocket as regards the face i know it so well by heart already that i feel certain i could produce a likeness without even a sitting what do you think of it mrs broughton  illustration what do you think of it mrs broughton  it is clever said she looking at it with all that enthusiasm which women are able to throw into their eyes on such occasions very clever the subject would just suit her i have never doubted that  eames says that it is confused said the artist  i dont see that at all said mrs broughton  of course a sketch must be rough this one has been rubbed about and alteredbut i think there is something in it  an immense deal said mrs broughton dont you think so clara  i am not a judge  but you can see the womans fixed purpose and her stealthiness as welland the man sleeps like a log what is that dim outline  nothing in particular said dalrymple but the dim outline was intended to represent mrs van siever  it is very goodunquestionably good said mrs dobbs broughton i do not for a moment doubt that you would make a great picture of it it is just the subject for you conway so much imagination and yet such a scope for portraiture it would be full of action and yet such perfect repose and the lights and shadows would be exactly in your line i can see at a glance how you would manage the light in the tent and bring it down just on the nail and then the pose of the woman would be so good so much strength and yet such grace you should have the bowl he drank the milk out of so as to tell the whole story no painter living tells a story so well as you do conway conway dalrymple knew that the woman was talking nonsense to him and yet he liked it and liked her for talking it  but mr dalrymple can paint his sisera without making me a jael said miss van siever  of course he can said mrs broughton  but i never will said the artist i conceived the subject as connected with you and i will never disjoin the two ideas  i think it no compliment i can assure you said miss van siever  and none was intended but you may observe that artists in all ages have sought for higher types of models in painting women who have been violent or criminal than have sufficed for them in their portraitures of gentleness and virtue look at all the judiths and the lucretias and the charlotte cordays how much finer the women are than the madonnas and the saint cecilias  after that clara you need not scruple to be a jael said mrs broughton  but i do scruplevery much so strongly that i know i never shall do it in the first place i dont know why mr dalrymple wants it  want it said conway i want to paint a striking picture  but you can do that without putting me into it  nonot this picture and why should you object it is the commonest thing in the world for ladies to sit to artists in that manner  people would know it  nobody would know it so that you need care about it what would it matter if everybody knew it we are not proposing anything improperare we mrs broughton  she shall not be pressed if she does not like it said mrs broughton you know i told you before clara came in that i was afraid it could not be done  and i dont like it said miss van siever with some little hesitation in her voice  i dont see anything improper in it if you mean that said mrs broughton  but mamma  well yes that is the difficulty no doubt the only question is whether your mother is not so very singular as to make it impossible that you should comply with her in everything  i am afraid that i do not comply with her in very much said miss van siever in her gentlest voice  oh clara  you drive me to say so as otherwise i should be a hypocrite of course i ought not to have said it before mr dalrymple  you and mr dalrymple will understand all about that i daresay before the picture is finished said mrs broughton  it did not take much persuasion on the part of conway dalrymple to get the consent of the younger lady to be painted or of the elder to allow the sitting to go on in her room when the question of easels and other apparatus came to be considered mrs broughton was rather flustered and again declared with energy that the whole thing must fall to the ground but a few more words from the painter restored her and at last the arrangements were made as mrs dobbs broughtons dear friend madalina demolines had said mrs dobbs broughton liked a fevered existence what will dobbs say she exclaimed more than once and it was decided at last that dobbs should know nothing about it as long as it could be kept from him of course he shall be told at last said his wife i wouldnt keep anything from the dear fellow for all the world but if he knew it at first it would be sure to get through musselboro to your mother  i certainly shall beg that mr broughton may not be taken into confidence if mr musselboro is to follow said clara and it must be understood that i must cease to sit immediately whatever may be the inconvenience should mamma speak to me about it  this stipulation was made and conceded and then miss van siever went away leaving the artist with mrs dobbs broughton and now if you please conway you had better go too said the lady as soon as there had been time for miss van siever to get downstairs and out of the halldoor  of course you are in a hurry to get rid of me  yes i am  a little while ago i improperly said that some suggestion of yours was nonsense and you rebuked me for my blunt incivility might not i rebuke you now with equal justice  do so if you willbut leave me i tell you conway that in these matters you must either be guided by me or you and i must cease to see each other it does not do that you should remain here with me longer than the time usually allowed for a morning call clara has come and gone and you also must go i am sorry to disturb you for you seem to be so very comfortable in that chair  i am comfortableand i can look at you comethere can be no harm in saying that if i say nothing else wellthere now i am gone whereupon he got up from his armchair  but you are not gone while you stand there  and you would really wish me to marry that girl  i doif you can love her  and what about her love  you must win it of course she is to be won like any other woman the fruit wont fall into your mouth merely because you open your lips you must climb the tree  still climbing trees in the hesperides said conway love does that you know but it is hard to climb the trees without the love it seems to me that i have done my climbinghave clomb as high as i knew how and that the boughs are breaking with me and that i am likely to get a fall do you understand me  i would rather not understand you  that is no answer to my question do you understand that at this moment i am getting a fall which will break every bone in my skin and put any other climbing out of the question as far as i am concerned do you understand that  no i do not said mrs broughton in a tremulous voice  then ill go and make love at once to clara van siever theres enough of pluck left in me to ask her to marry me and i suppose i could manage to go through the ceremony if she accepted me  but i want you to love her said mrs dobbs broughton  i daresay i should love her well enough after a bitthat is if she didnt break my head or comb my hair i suppose there will be no objection to my saying that you sent me when i ask her  conway you will of course not mention my name to her i have suggested to you a marriage which i think would tend to make you happy and would give you a stability in life which you want it is perhaps better that i should be explicit at once as an unmarried man i cannot continue to know you you have said words of late which have driven me to this conclusion i have thought about it muchtoo much perhaps and i know that i am right miss van siever has beauty and wealth and intellect and i think that she would appreciate the love of such a man as you are now go and mrs dobbs broughton standing upright pointed to the door conway dalrymple slowly took his spanish hat from off the marble slab on which he had laid it and left the room without saying a word the interview had been quite long enough and there was nothing else which he knew how to say with effect  croquet is a pretty game out of doors and chess is delightful in a drawingroom battledoor and shuttlecock and hunttheslipper have also their attractions proverbs are good and cross questions with crooked answers may be made very amusing but none of these games are equal to the game of lovemakingproviding that the players can be quite sure that there shall be no heart in the matter any touch of heart not only destroys the pleasure of the game but makes the player awkward and incapable and robs him of his skill and thus it is that there are many people who cannot play the game at all a deficiency of some needed internal physical strength prevents the owners of the heart from keeping a proper control over its valves and thus emotion sets in and the pulses are accelerated and feeling supervenes for such a one to attempt a game of lovemaking is as though your friend with the gout should insist on playing croquet a sense of the ridiculous if nothing else should in either case deter the afflicted one from the attempt there was no such absurdity with our friend mrs dobbs broughton and conway dalrymple their valves and pulses were all right they could play the game without the slightest danger of any inconvenient resultof any inconvenient result that is as regarded their own feelings blind people cannot see and stupid people cannot understandand it might be that mr dobbs broughton being both blind and stupid in such matters might perceive something of the playing of the game and not know that it was only a game of skill  when i say that as regarded these two lovers there was nothing of love between them and that the game was therefore so far innocent i would not be understood as asserting that these people had no hearts within their bosoms mrs dobbs broughton probably loved her husband in a sensible humdrum way feeling him to be a bore knowing him to be vulgar aware that he often took a good deal more wine than was good for him and that he was almost as uneducated as a hog yet she loved him and showed her love by taking care that he should have things for dinner which he liked to eat but in this alone there were to be found none of the charms of a fevered existence and therefore mrs dobbs broughton requiring those charms for her comfort played her little game with conway dalrymple and as regarded the artist himself let no reader presume him to have been heartless because he flirted with mrs dobbs broughton doubtless he will marry some day will have a large family for which he will work hard and will make a good husband to some stout lady who will be careful in looking after his linen but on the present occasion he fell into some slight trouble in spite of the innocence of his game as he quitted his friends room he heard the halldoor slammed heavily then there was a quick step on the stairs and on the landingplace above the first flight he met the master of the house somewhat flurried as it seemed and not looking comfortable either as regarded his person or his temper by george hes been drinking conway said to himself after the first glance now it certainly was the case that poor dobbs broughton would sometimes drink at improper hours  what the devil are you doing here said dobbs broughton to his friend the artist youre always here youre here a doosed sight more than i like husbands when they have been drinking are very apt to make mistakes as to the purport of the game  why dobbs said the painter theres something wrong with you  no there aint theres nothing wrong and if there was whats that to you i shant ask you to pay anything for me i suppose  welli hope not  i wont have you here and let that be an end of it its all very well when i choose to have a few friends to dinner but my wife can do very well without your fallalling here all day will you remember that if you please  conway dalrymple knowing that he had better not argue any question with a drunken man took himself out of the house shrugging his shoulders as he thought of the misery which his poor dear playfellow would now be called upon to endure     chapter xxvii  a hero at home   on the morning after his visit to miss demolines john eames found himself at the paddington station asking for a ticket for guestwick and as he picked up his change another gentleman also demanded a ticket for the same place had guestwick been as liverpool or manchester eames would have thought nothing about it it is a matter of course that men should always be going from london to liverpool and manchester but it seemed odd to him that two men should want firstclass tickets for so small a place as guestwick at the same moment and when afterwards he was placed by the guard in the same carriage with this other traveller he could not but feel some little curiosity the man was four or five years johnnys senior a goodlooking fellow with a pleasant face and the outward appurtenances of a gentleman the intelligent reader will no doubt be aware that the stranger was major grantly but the intelligent reader has in this respect had much advantage over john eames who up to this time had never even heard of his cousin grace crawleys lover i think you were asking for a ticket for guestwick said johnnywhereupon the major owned that such was the case i lived at guestwick the greater part of my life said johnny and its the dullest dearest little town in all england i never was there before said the major and indeed i can hardly say i am going there now i shall only pass through it then he got out his newspaper and johnny also got out his and for a time there was no conversation between them john remembered how holy was the errand upon which he was intent and gathered his thoughts together resolving that having so great a matter on his mind he would think about nothing else and speak about nothing at all he was going down to allington to ask lily dale for the last time whether she would be his wife to ascertain whether he was to be successful or unsuccessful in the one great wish of his life and as such was the case with himas he had in hand a thing so vital it could be nothing to him whether the chance companion of his voyage was an agreeable or a disagreeable person he himself in any of the ordinary circumstances of life was prone enough to talk with any one he might meet he could have travelled for twelve hours together with an old lady and could listen to her or make her listen to him without half an hours interruption but this journey was made on no ordinary occasion and it behoved him to think of lily therefore after the first little almost necessary effort at civility he fell back into gloomy silence he was going to do his best to win lily dale and this doing of his best would require all his thought and all his energy  and probably major grantlys mind was bent in the same direction he too had this work before him and could not look upon his work as a thing that was altogether pleasant he might probably get that which he was intent upon obtaining he knewhe almost knewthat he had won the heart of the girl whom he was seeking there had been that between him and her which justified him in supposing that he was dear to her although no expression of affection had ever passed from her lips to his ears men may know all that they require to know on that subject without any plainly spoken words grace crawley had spoken no word and yet he had knownat any rate had not doubted that he could have the place in her heart of which he desired to be the master she would never surrender herself altogether till she had taught herself to be sure of him to whom she gave herself but she had listened to him with silence that had not rebuked him and he had told himself that he might venture without fear of that rebuke as to which the minds of some men are sensitive to a degree which other men cannot even understand but for all this major grantly could not be altogether happy as to his mission he would ask grace crawley to be his wife but he would be ruined by his own success and the remembrance that he would be severed from all his own family by the thing that he was doing was very bitter to him in generosity he might be silent about this to grace but who can endure to be silent on such a subject to the woman who is to be his wife and then it would not be possible for him to abstain from explanation he was now following her down to allington a step which he certainly would not have taken but for the misfortune which had befallen her father and he must explain to her in some sort why he did so he must say to herif not in so many words still almost as plainly as words could speaki am here now to ask you to be my wife because you specially require the protection and countenance of the man who loves you in the present circumstances of your fathers affairs he knew that he was doing rightperhaps had some idea that he was doing nobly but this very appreciation of his own good qualities made the task before him the more difficult  major grantly had the times and john eames had the daily news and they exchanged papers one had the last saturday and the other the last spectator and they exchanged those also both had the pall mall gazette of which enterprising periodical they gradually came to discuss the merits and demerits thus falling into conversation at last in spite of the weight of the mission on which each of them was intent then at last when they were within halfanhour of the end of their journey major grantly asked his companion what was the best inn at guestwick he had at first been minded to go on to allington at onceto go on to allington and get his work done and then return home or remain there or find the nearest inn with a decent bed as circumstances might direct him but on reconsideration as he drew nearer to the scene of his future operations he thought that it might be well for him to remain that night at guestwick he did not quite know how far allington was from guestwick but he did know that it was still midwinter and that the days were very short the magpie was the best inn johnny said having lived at guestwick all his life and having a mother living there now he had never himself put up at the magpie but he believed it to be a good country inn they kept posthorses there he knew he did not tell the stranger that his late old friend lord de guest and his present old friend lady julia always hired posthorses from the magpie but he grounded his ready assertion on the remembrance of that fact i think i shall stay there tonight said the major youll find it pretty comfortable i dont doubt said johnny though indeed it always seems to me that a man alone at an inn has a very bad time of it reading is all very well but one gets tired of it at last and then i hate horsehair chairs it isnt very delightful said the major but beggars mustnt be choosers then there was a pause after which the major spoke again you dont happen to know which way allington lies  allington said johnny  yes allington is there not a village called allington  there is a village called allington certainly it lies over there and johnny pointed with his finger through the window as you do not know the country you can see nothing but i can see the allington trees at this moment  i suppose there is no inn at allington  theres a publichouse with a very nice clean bedroom it is called the red lion mrs forrard keeps it i would quite as soon stay there as at the magpie only if they dont expect you they wouldnt have much for dinner  then you know the village of allington  yes i know the village of allington very well i have friends living there indeed i may say i know everybody in allington  do you know mrs dale  mrs dale said johnny yes i know mrs dale i have known mrs dale pretty nearly all my life who could this man be who was going down to see mrs dalemrs dale and consequently lily dale he thought that he knew mrs dale so well that she could have no visitor of whom he would not be entitled to have some knowledge but major grantly had nothing more to say at the moment about mrs dale he had never seen mrs dale in his life and was now going to her house not to see her but a friend of hers he found that he could not very well explain this to a stranger and therefore at the moment he said nothing further but johnny would not allow the subject to be dropped have you known mrs dale long he asked  i have not the pleasure of knowing her at all said the major  i thought perhaps by your asking after her  i intend to call upon her that is all i suppose they will have an omnibus here from the magpie eames said that there no doubt would be an omnibus from the magpie and then they were at their journeys end  for the present we will follow john eames who went at once to his mothers house it was his intention to remain there for two or three days and then go over to the house or rather to the cottage of his great ally lady julia which lay just beyond guestwick manor and somewhat nearer to allington than to the town of guestwick he had made up his mind that he would not himself go over to allington till he could do so from guestwick cottage as it was called feeling that under certain untoward circumstancesshould untoward circumstances ariselady julias sympathy might be more endurable than that of his mother but he would take care that it should be known at allington that he was in the neighbourhood he understood the necessary strategy of his campaign too well to suppose that he could startle lily into acquiescence  with his own mother and sister john eames was in these days quite a hero he was a hero with them now because in his early boyish days there had been so little about him that was heroic then there had been a doubt whether he would ever earn his daily bread and he had been a very heavy burden on the slight family resources in the matter of jackets and trousers the pride taken in our johnny had not been great though the love felt for him had been warm but gradually things had changed and john eames had become heroic in his mothers eyes a chance circumstance had endeared him to earl de guest and from that moment things had gone well with him the earl had given him a watch and had left him a fortune and sir raffle buffle had made him a private secretary in the old days when johnnys love for lily dale was first discussed by his mother and sister they had thought it impossible that lily should ever bring herself to regard with affection so humble a suitorfor the dales have ever held their heads up in the world but now there is no misgiving on that score with mrs eames and her daughter their wonder is that lily dale should be such a fool as to decline the love of such a man so johnny was received with the respect due to a hero as well as with the affection belonging to a sonby which i mean it to be inferred that mrs eames had got a little bit of fish for dinner as well as a leg of mutton  a man came down in the train with me who says he is going over to allington said johnny i wonder who he can be he is staying at the magpie  a friend of captain dales probably said mary captain dale was the squires nephew and his heir  but this man was not going to the squires he was going to the small house  is he going to stay there  i suppose not as he asked about the inn then johnny reflected that the man might probably be a friend of crosbies and became melancholy in consequence crosbie might have thought it expedient to send an ambassador down to prepare the ground for him before he should venture again upon the scene himself if it were so would it not be well that he john eames should get over to lily as soon as possible and not wait till he should be staying with lady julia  it was at any rate incumbent upon him to call upon lady julia the next morning because of his commission the berlin wool might remain in his portmanteau till his portmanteau should go with him to the cottage but he would take the spectacles at once and he must explain to lady julia what the lawyers had told him about the income so he hired a saddlehorse from the magpie and started after breakfast on the morning after his arrival in his unheroic days he would have walkedas he had done scores of times over the whole distance from guestwick to allington but now in these grander days he thought about his boots and the mud and the formal appearance of the thing ah dear he said to himself as the nag walked slowly out of the town it used to be better with me in the old days i hardly hoped that she would ever accept me but at least she had never refused me and then that brute had not as yet made his way down to allington  he did not go very fast after leaving the town he trotted on for a mile or so but when he got to the palings of guestwick manor he let the animal walk again and his mind ran back over the incidents of his life which were connected with the place he remembered a certain long ramble which he had taken in those woods after lily had refused him that had been subsequent to the crosbie episode in his life and johnny had been led to hope by certain of his friendsespecially by lord de guest and his sisterthat he might then be successful but he had been unsuccessful and had passed the bitterest hour of his life wandering about in those woods since that he had been unsuccessful again and again but the bitterness of failure had not been so strong with him as on that first occasion he would try again now and if he failed he would fail for the last time as he was thinking of all this a gig overtook him on the road and on looking round he saw that the occupant of the gig was the man who had travelled with him on the previous day in the train major grantly was alone in the gig and as he recognized john eames he stopped his horse are you also going to allington he asked john eames with something of scorn in his voice replied that he had no intention of going to allington on that day he still thought that this man might be an emissary from crosbie and therefore resolved that but scant courtesy was due to him i am on my way there now said grantly and am going to the house of your friend may i tell her that i travelled with you yesterday  yes sir said johnny you may tell her that you came down with john eames  and are you john eames asked the major  if you have no objection said johnny but i can hardly suppose you have ever heard my name before  it is familiar to me because i have the pleasure of knowing a cousin of yours miss grace crawley  my cousin is at present staying at allington with mrs dale said johnny  just so said the major who now began to reflect that he had been indiscreet in mentioning grace crawleys name no doubt every one connected with the family all the crawleys all the dales and all the eameses would soon know the business which had brought him down to allington but he need not have taken the trouble of beginning the story against himself john eames in truth had never even heard major grantlys name and was quite unaware of the fortune which awaited his cousin even after what he had now been told he still suspected the stranger of being an emissary from his enemy but the major not giving him credit for his ignorance was annoyed with himself for having told so much of his own history i will tell the ladies that i had the pleasure of meeting you he said that is if i am lucky enough to see them and then he drove on  i know i should hate that fellow if i were to meet him anywhere again said johnny to himself as he rode on when i take an aversion to a fellow at first sight i always stick to it its instinct i suppose and he was still giving himself credit for the strength of his instincts when he reached lady julias cottage he rode at once into the stableyard with the privilege of an accustomed friend of the house and having given up his horse entered the cottage by the back door is my lady at home jemima he said to the maid  yes mr john she is in the drawingroom and friends of yours are with her then he was announced and found himself in the presence of lady julia lily dale and grace crawley  he was very warmly received lady julia really loved him dearly and would have done anything in her power to bring about a match between him and lily grace was his cousin and though she had not seen him often she was prepared to love him dearly as lilys lover and lilylily loved him dearly tooif only she could have brought herself to love him as he wished to be loved to all of them johnny eames was something of a hero at any rate in the eyes of all of them he possessed those virtues which seemed to them to justify them in petting him and making much of him  i am so glad youve comethat is if youve brought my spectacles said lady julia  my pockets are crammed with spectacles said johnny  and when are you coming to me  i was thinking of tuesday  no dont come till wednesday but i mean monday no monday wont do come on tuesdayearly and drive me out and now tell us the news  johnny swore that there was no news he made a brave attempt to be gay and easy before lily but he failed and he knew that he failedand he knew that she knew that he failed mamma will be so glad to see you said lily i suppose you havent seen bell yet  i only got to guestwick yesterday afternoon said he  and it will be so nice our having grace at the small housewont it uncle christopher has quite taken a passion for graceso that i am hardly anybody now in the allington world  bytheby said johnny i came down here with a friend of yours grace  a friend of mine said grace  so he says and he is at allington at this moment he passed me in a gig going there  and what was his name lily asked  i have not the remotest idea said johnny he is a man about my own age very goodlooking and apparently very well able to take care of himself he is shortsighted and holds a glass in one eye when he looks out of a carriagewindow thats all that i know about him  grace crawleys face had become suffused with blushes at the first mention of the friend and the gig but then grace blushed very easily lily knew all about it at onceat once divined who must be the friend in the gig and was almost beside herself with joy lady julia who had heard no more of the major than had johnny was still clever enough to perceive that the friend must be a particular friendfor she had noticed miss crawleys blushes and grace herself had no doubt as to the man the picture of her lover with the glass in his eye as he looked out of the window had been too perfect to admit of a doubt in her distress she put out her hand and took hold of lilys dress  and you say he is at allington now said lily  i have no doubt he is at the small house at this moment said johnny     chapter xxviii  showing how major grantly took a walk   illustration  major grantly drove his gig into the yard of the red lion at allington and from thence walked away at once to mrs dales house when he reached the village he had hardly made up his mind as to the way in which he would begin his attack but now as he went down the street he resolved that he would first ask for mrs dale most probably he would find himself in the presence of mrs dale and her daughter and of grace also at his first entrance and if so his position would be awkward enough he almost regretted now that he had not written to mrs dale and asked for an interview his task would be very difficult if he should find all the ladies together but he was strong in the feeling that when his purpose was told it would meet the approval at any rate of mrs dale and he walked boldly on and bravely knocked at the door of the small house as he had already learned that mrs dales residence was called by all the neighbourhood nobody was at home the servant said and then when the visitor began to make further inquiry the girl explained that the two young ladies had walked as far as guestwick cottage and that mrs dale was at this moment at the great house with the squire she had gone across soon after the young ladies had started the maid however was interrupted before she had finished telling all this to the major by finding her mistress behind her in the passage mrs dale had returned and had entered the house from the lawn  i am here now jane said mrs dale if the gentleman wishes to see me  then the major announced himself my name is major grantly said he and he was blundering on with some words about his own intrusion when mrs dale begged him to follow her into the drawingroom he had muttered something to the effect that mrs dale would not know who he was but mrs dale knew all about him and had heard the whole of graces story from lily she and lily had often discussed the question whether under existing circumstances major grantly should feel himself bound to offer his hand to grace and the mother and daughter had differed somewhat on the matter mrs dale had held that he was not so bound urging that the unfortunate position in which mr crawley was placed was so calamitous to all connected with him as to justify any man not absolutely engaged in abandoning the thoughts of such a marriage mrs dale had spoken of major grantlys father and mother and brother and sister and had declared her opinion that they were entitled to consideration but lily had opposed this idea very stoutly asserting that in an affair of love a man should think neither of father or brother or mother or sister if he is worth anything lily had said he will come to her nownow in her trouble and will tell her that she at least has got a friend who will be true to her if he does that then i shall think that there is something of the poetry and nobleness of love left in answer to this mrs dale had replied that women had no right to expect from men such selfdenying nobility as that i dont expect it mamma said lily and i am sure that grace does not indeed i am quite sure that grace does not expect even to see him ever again she never says so but i know that she has made up her mind about it still i think he ought to come it can hardly be that a man is bound to do a thing the doing of which as you confess would be almost more than noble said mrs dale and so the matter had been discussed between them but now as it seemed to mrs dale the man had come to do this noble thing at any rate he was there in her drawingroom and before either of them had sat down he had contrived to mention grace you may not probably have heard my name he said but i am acquainted with your friend miss crawley  i know your name very well major grantly my brotherinlaw who lives over yonder mr dale knows your father very wellor he did some years ago and i have heard him say that he remembers you  i recollect he used to be staying at ullathorne but that is a long time ago is he at home now  mr dale is almost always at home he very rarely goes away and i am sure would be glad to see you  then there was a little pause in the conversation they had managed to seat themselves and mrs dale had said enough to put her visitor fairly at his ease if he had anything special to say to her he must say itany request or proposition to make as to grace crawley he must make it and he did make it at once my object in coming to allington he said was to see miss crawley  she and my daughter have taken a long walk to call on a friend and i am afraid they will stay for lunch but they will certainly be home between three and four if that is not too long for you to remain at allington  o dear no said he it will not hurt me to wait  it certainly will not hurt me major grantly perhaps you will lunch with me  ill tell you what mrs dale if youll permit me ill explain to you why i have come here indeed i have intended to do so all through and i can only ask you to keep my secret if after all it should require to be kept  i will certainly keep any secret that you may ask me to keep said mrs dale taking off her bonnet  i hope there may be no need of one said major grantly the truth is mrs dale that i have known miss crawley for some timenearly for two years now andi may as well speak it out at oncei have made up my mind to ask her to be my wife that is why i am here considering the nature of the statement which must have been embarrassing i think that it was made with fluency and simplicity  of course major grantly you know that i have no authority with our young friend said mrs dale i mean that she is not connected with us by family ties she has a father and mother living as i believe in the same county with yourself  i know that mrs dale  and you may perhaps understand that as miss crawley is now staying with me i owe it in a measure to her friends to ask you whether they are aware of your intention  they are not aware of it  i know that at the present moment they are in great trouble  mrs dale was going on but she was interrupted by major grantly that is just it he said there are circumstances at present which make it almost impossible that i should go to mr crawley and ask his permission to address his daughter i do not know whether you have heard the whole story  as much i believe as grace could tell me  he is i believe in such a state of mental distress as to be hardly capable of giving me a considerate answer and i should not know how to speak to him or how not to speak to him about this unfortunate affair but mrs dale you will i think perceive that the same circumstances make it imperative upon me to be explicit to miss crawley i think i am the last man to boast of a womans regard but i had learned to think that i was not indifferent to grace if that be so what must she think of me if i stay away from her now  she understands too well the weight of the misfortune which has fallen upon her father to suppose that any one not connected with her can be bound to share it  that is just it she will think that i am silent for that reason i have determined that that shall not keep me silent and therefore i have come here i may perhaps be able to bring comfort to her in her trouble as regards my worldly positionthough indeed it will not be very goodas hers is not good either you will not think yourself bound to forbid me to see her on that head  certainly not i need hardly say that i fully understand that as regards money you are offering everything where you can get nothing  and you understand my feeling  indeed i doand appreciate the great nobility of your love for grace you shall see her here if you wish itand today if you choose to wait major grantly said that he would wait and would see grace on that afternoon mrs dale again suggested that he should lunch with her but this he declined she then proposed that he should go across and call upon the squire and thus consume his time but to this he also objected he was not exactly in the humour he said to renew so old and so slight an acquaintance at that time mr dale would probably have forgotten him and would be sure to ask what had brought him to allington he would go and take a walk he said and come again exactly at halfpast three mrs dale again expressed her certainty that the young ladies would be back by that time and major grantly left the house  mrs dale when she was left alone could not but compare the good fortune which was awaiting grace with the evil fortune which had fallen on her own child here was a man who was at all points a gentleman such at least was the character which mrs dale at once conceded to him and grace had chanced to come across this man and to please his eye and satisfy his taste and be loved by him and the result of that chance would be that grace would have everything given to her that the world has to give worth acceptance she would have a companion for her life whom she could trust admire love and of whom she could be infinitely proud mrs dale was not at all aware whether major grantly might have five hundred a year to spend or five thousandor what sum intermediate between the twonor did she give much of her thoughts at the moment to that side of the subject she knew without thinking of itor fancied that she knew that there were means sufficient for comfortable living it was solely the nature and character of the man that was in her mind and the sufficiency that was to be found in them for a wifes happiness but her daughter her lily had come across a man who was a scoundrel and as the consequence of that meeting all her life was marred could any credit be given to grace for her success or any blame attached to lily for her failure surely not the latter how was her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate or have avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked then many bitter thoughts passed through mrs dales mind and she almost envied grace crawley her lover lily was contented to remain as she was but lilys mother could not bring herself to be satisfied that her child should fill a lower place in the world than other girls it had ever been her ideaan idea probably never absolutely uttered even to herself but not the less practically conceivedthat it is the business of a woman to be married that her lily should have been won and not worn had been and would be a trouble to her for ever  major grantly went back to the inn and saw his horse fed and smoked a cigar and then finding that it was still only just one oclock he started for a walk he was careful not to go out of allington by the road he had entered it as he had no wish to encounter grace and her friend on their return into the village so he crossed a little brook which runs at the bottom of the hill on which the chief street of allington is built and turned into a fieldpath to the left as soon as he had got beyond the houses not knowing the geography of the place he did not understand that by taking that path he was making his way back to the squires house but it was so and after sauntering on for about a mile and crossing back again over the stream of which he took no notice he found himself leaning across a gate and looking into a paddock on the other side of which was the high wall of a gentlemans garden to avoid this he went on a little further and found himself on a farm road and before he could retrace his steps so as not to be seen he met a gentleman whom he presumed to be the owner of the house it was the squire surveying his home farm as was his daily custom but major grantly had not perceived that the house must of necessity be allington house having been aware that he had passed the entrance to the place as he entered the village on the other side im afraid im intruding he said lifting his hat i came up the path yonder not knowing that it would lead me so close to a gentlemans house  there is a right of way through the fields on to the guestwick road said the squire and therefore you are not trespassing in any sense but we are not particular about such things down here and you would be very welcome if there were no right of way if you are a stranger perhaps you would like to see the outside of the old house people think it picturesque  then major grantly became aware that this must be the squire and he was annoyed with himself for his own awkwardness in having thus come upon the house he would have wished to keep himself altogether unseen if it had been possibleand especially unseen by this old gentleman to whom now that he had met him he was almost bound to introduce himself but he was not absolutely bound to do so and he determined that he would still keep his peace even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there what would it matter but to proclaim himself at the present moment would be disagreeable to him he permitted the squire however to lead him to the front of the house and in a few moments was standing on the terrace hearing an account of the architecture of the mansion  illustration squire dale and major grantly  you can see the date still in the brickwork of one of the chimneysthat is if your eyes are very good you can see it1617 it was completed in that year and very little has been done to it since we think the chimneys are pretty  they are very pretty said the major indeed the house altogether is as graceful as it can be  those trees are old too said the squire pointing to two cedars which stood at the side of the house they say they are older than the house but i dont feel sure of it there was a mansion here before very nearly though not quite on the same spot  your own ancestors were living here before that i suppose said grantly meaning to be civil  well yes two or three hundred years before it i suppose if you dont mind coming down to the churchyard youll get an excellent view of the houseby far the best that there is bytheby would you like to step in and take a glass of wine  im very much obliged said the major but indeed id rather not then he followed the squire down to the churchyard and was shown the church as well as the view of the house and the vicarage and a view over to allington woods from the vicarage gate of which the squire was very fond and in this way he was taken back on to the guestwick side of the village and even down on to the road by which he had entered it without in the least knowing where he was he looked at his watch and saw that it was past two im very much obliged to you sir he said again taking off his hat to the squire and if i shall not be intruding ill make my way back to the village  what village said the squire  to allington said grantly  this is allington said the squire and as he spoke lily dale and grace crawley turned a corner from the guestwick road and came close upon them well girls i did not expect to see you said the squire your mamma told me you wouldnt be back till it was nearly dark lily  we have come back earlier than we intended said lily she of course had seen the stranger with her uncle and knowing the ways of the squire in such matters had expected to be introduced to him but the reader will be aware that no introduction was possible it never occurred to lily that this man could be the major grantly of whom she and grace had been talking during the whole length of the walk home but grace and her lover had of course known each other at once and grantly though he was abashed and almost dismayed by the meeting of course came forward and gave his hand to his friend grace in taking it did not utter a word  perhaps i ought to have introduced myself to you as major grantly said he turning to the squire  major grantly dear me i had no idea that you were expected in these parts  i have come without being expected  you are very welcome im sure i hope your father is well i used to know him some years ago and i daresay he has not forgotten me then while the girls stood by in silence and while grantly was endeavouring to escape the squire invited him very warmly to send his portmanteau up to the house well have the ladies up from the house below and make it as little dull for you as possible but this would not have suited grantlyat any rate would not suit him till he should know what answer he was to have he excused himself therefore pleading a positive necessity to be at guestwick that evening and then explaining that he had already seen mrs dale he expressed his intention of going back to the small house in company with the ladies if they would allow him the squire who did not as yet quite understand it all bade him a formal adieu and lily led the way home down behind the churchyard wall and through the bottom of the gardens belonging to the great house she of course knew now who the stranger was and did all in her power to relieve grace of her embarrassment grace had hitherto not spoken a single word since she had seen her lover nor did she say a word to him in their walk to the house and in truth he was not much more communicative than grace lily did all the talking and with wonderful female skill contrived to have some words ready for use till they all found themselves together in mrs dales drawingroom i have caught a major mamma and landed him said lily laughing but im afraid from what i hear that you had caught him first     chapter xxix  miss lily dales logic   lady julia de guest always lunched at one exactly and it was not much past twelve when john eames made his appearance at the cottage he was of course told to stay and of course said that he would stay it had been his purpose to lunch with lady julia but then he had not expected to find lily dale at the cottage lily herself would have been quite at her ease protected by lady julia and somewhat protected also by her own powers of fence had it not been that grace was there also but grace crawley from the moment that she had heard the description of the gentleman who looked out of the window with his glass in his eye had by no means been at her ease lily saw at once that she could not be brought to join in any conversation and both john and lady julia in their ignorance of the matter in hand made matters worse  so that was major grantly said john i have heard of him before i think he is a son of the old archdeacon is he not  i dont know about old archdeacon said lady julia the archdeacon is the son of the old bishop whom i remember very well and it is not so very long since the bishop died either  i wonder what hes doing at allington said johnny  i think he knows my uncle said lily  but hes going to call on your mother he said then johnny remembered that the major had said something as to knowing miss crawley and for the moment he was silent  i remember when they talked of making the son a bishop also said lady julia  whatthis same man who is now a major said johnny  no you goose he is not the son he is the grandson they were going to make the archdeacon a bishop and i remember hearing that he was terribly disappointed he is getting to be an old man now i suppose and yet dear me how well i remember his father  he didnt look like a bishops son said johnny  how does a bishops son look lily asked  i suppose he ought to have some sort of clerical tinge about him but this fellow had nothing of that kind  but then this fellow as you call him said lily is only the son of an archdeacon  that accounts for it i suppose said johnny  but during all this time grace did not say a word and lily perceived it then she bethought herself as to what she had better do grace she knew could not be comfortable where she was nor indeed was it probable that grace would be very comfortable in returning home there could not be much ease for grace till the coming meeting between her and major grantly should be over but it would be better that grace should go back to allington at once and better also perhaps for major grantly that it should be so lady julia she said i dont think well mind stopping for lunch today  nonsense my dear you promised  i think we must break our promise i do indeed you mustnt be angry with us and lily looked at lady julia as though there were something which lady julia ought to understand which she lily could not quite explain i fear that lily was false and intended her old friend to believe that she was running away because john eames had come there  but you will be famished said lady julia  we shall live through it said lily  it is out of the question that i should let you walk all the way here from allington and all the way back without taking something  we shall just be home in time for lunch if we go now said lily will not that be best grace  grace hardly knew what would be best she only knew that major grantly was at allington and that he had come thither to see her the idea of hurrying back after him was unpleasant to her and yet she was so flurried that she felt thankful to lily for taking her away from the cottage the matter was compromised at last they remained for half an hour and ate some biscuits and pretended to drink a glass of wine and then they started john eames who in truth believed that lily dale was running away from him was by no means well pleased and when the girls were gone did not make himself so agreeable to his old friend as he should have done what a fool i am to come here at all he said throwing himself into an armchair as soon as the front door was closed  thats very civil to me john  you know what i mean lady julia i am a fool to come near her until i can do so without thinking more of her than i do of any other girl in the county  i dont think you have anything to complain of as yet said lady julia who had in some sort perceived that lilys retreat had been on graces account and not on her own it seems to me that lily was very glad to see you and when i told her that you were coming to stay here and would be near them for some days she seemed to be quite pleasedshe did indeed  then why did she run away the moment i came in said johnny  i think it was something you said about that man who has gone to allington  what difference can the man make to her the truth is i despise myselfi do indeed lady julia only think of my meeting crosbie at dinner the other day and his having the impertinence to come up and shake hands with me  i suppose he didnt say anything about what happened at the paddington station  no he didnt speak about that i wish i knew whether she cares for him still if i thought she did i would never speak another word to heri mean about myself of course i am not going to quarrel with them i am not such a fool as that then lady julia tried to comfort him and succeeded so far that he was induced to eat the mince veal that had been intended for the comfort and support of the two young ladies who had run away  do you think it is he were the first words which grace said when they were fairly on their way back together  i should think it must be what other man can there be of that sort who would be likely to come to allington to see you  his coming is not likely i cannot understand that he should come he let me leave silverbridge without seeing meand i thought that he was quite right  and i think he is quite right to come here i am very glad he has come it shows that he has really something like a heart inside him had he not come or sent or written or taken some step before the trial comes on to make you know that he was thinking of you i should have said that he was as hardas hard as any other man that i ever heard of men are so hard but i dont think he is now i am beginning to regard him as the one chevalier sans peur et sans reproche and to fancy that you ought to go down on your knees before him and kiss his highnesss shoebuckle in judging of men ones mind vacillates so quickly between the scorn which is due to a false man and the worship which is due to a true man then she was silent for a moment but grace said nothing and lily continued i tell you fairly grace that i shall expect very much from you now  much in what way lily  in the way of worship i shall not be content that you should merely love him if he has come here as he must have done to say that the moment of the worlds reproach is the moment he has chosen to ask you to be his wife i think that you will owe him more than love  i shall owe him more than love and i will pay him more than love said grace there was something in the tone of her voice as she spoke which made lily stop her and look up into her face there was a smile there which lily had never seen before and which gave a beauty to her which was wonderful to lilys eyes surely this lover of graces must have seen her smile like that and therefore had loved her and was giving such wonderful proof of his love yes continued grace standing and looking at her friend you may stare at me lily but you may be sure that i will do for major grantly all the good that i can do for him  what do you mean grace  never mind what i mean you are very imperious in managing your own affairs and you must let me be so equally in mine  but i tell you everything  do you suppose that ififif in real truth it can possibly be the case that major grantly shall have come here to offer me his hand when we are all ground down into the dust as we are do you think that i will let him sacrifice himself would you  certainly why not there will be no sacrifice he will be asking for that which he wishes to get and you will be bound to give it to him  if he wants it where is his nobility if it be as you say he will have shown himself noble and his nobility will have consisted in this that he has been willing to take that which he does not want in order that he may succour one whom he loves i also will succour one whom i love as best i know how then she walked on quickly before her friend and lily stood for a moment thinking before she followed her they were now on a fieldpath by which they were enabled to escape the road back to allington for the greater part of the distance and grace had reached a stile and had clambered over it before lily had caught her  you must not go away by yourself said lily  i dont wish to go away by myself  i want you to stop a moment and listen to me i am sure you are wrong in thiswrong for both your sakes you believe that he loves you  i thought he did once and if he has come here to see me i suppose he does still  if that be the case and if you also love him  i do i make no mystery about that to you i do love him with all my heart i love him today now that i believe him to be here and that i suppose i shall see him perhaps this very afternoon and i loved him yesterday when i thought that i should never see him again i do love him i do i love him so well that i will never do him an injury  that being so if he makes you an offer you are bound to accept it i do not think that you have an alternative  i have an alternative and i shall use it why dont you take my cousin john  because i like somebody else better if you have got as good a reason i wont say another word to you  and why dont you take that other person  because i cannot trust his love that is why it is not very kind of you opening my sores afresh when i am trying to heal yours  oh lily am i unkindunkind to you who have been so generous to me  ill forgive you all that and a deal more if you will only listen to me and try to take my advice because this major of yours does a generous thing which is for the good of you boththe infinite good of both of youyou are to emulate his generosity by doing a thing which will be for the good of neither of you that is about it yes it is grace you cannot doubt that he has been meaning this for some time past and of course if he looks upon you as his ownand i daresay if the whole truth is to be told he does  but i am not his own  yes you are in one sense you have just said so with a great deal of energy and if it is solet me see where was i  oh lily you need not mind where you were  but i do mind and i hate to be interrupted in my arguments yes just that if he saw his cow sick hed try to doctor the cow in her sickness he sees that you are sick and of course he comes to your relief  i am not major grantlys cow  yes you are  nor his dog nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is his exceptexcept lily the dearest friend that he has on the face of the earth he cannot have a friend that will go further for him than i will he will never know how far i will go to serve him you dont know his people nor do i know them but i know what they are his sister is married to a marquis  what has that to do with it said lily sharply if she were married to an archduke what difference would that make  and they are proud peopleall of themand rich and they live with high persons in the world  i didnt care though they lived with the royal family and had the prince of wales for their bosom friend it only shows how much better he is than they are  but think what my family ishow we are situated when my father was simply poor i did not care about it because he has been born and bred a gentleman but now he is disgraced yes lily he is i am bound to say so at any rate to myself when i am thinking of major grantly and i will not carry that disgrace into a family which would feel it so keenly as they would do lily however went on with her arguments and was still arguing when they turned the corner of the lane and came upon lilys uncle and the major himself     chapter xxx  showing what major grantly did after his walk   in going down from the church to the small house lily dale had all the conversation to herself during some portion of the way the path was only broad enough for two persons and here major grantly walked by lilys side while grace followed them then they found their way into the house and lily made her little speech to her mother about catching the major yes my dear i have seen major grantly before said mrs dale i suppose he has met you on the road but i did not expect that any of you would have returned so soon some little explanation followed as to the squire and as to major grantlys walk and after that the great thing was to leave the two lovers alone you will dine here of course major grantly mrs dale said but this he declined he had learned he said that there was a nighttrain up to london and he thought that he would return to town by that he had intended when he left london to get back as soon as possible then mrs dale having hesitated for two or three seconds got up and left the room and lily followed it seems very odd and abrupt said mrs dale to her daughter but i suppose it is best of course it is best mamma do as one would be done bythats the only rule it will be much better for her that she should have it over  grace was seated on a sofa and major grantly got up from his chair and came and stood opposite to her grace he said i hope you are not angry with me for coming down to see you here  no i am not angry she said  i have thought a great deal about it and your friend miss prettyman knew that i was coming she quite approves of my coming  she has written to me but did not tell me of it said grace not knowing what other answer to make  noshe could not have done that she had no authority i only mention her name because it will have weight with you and because i have not done that which under other circumstances perhaps i should have been bound to do i have not seen your father  poor papa said grace  i have felt that at the present moment i could not do so with any success it has not come of any want of respect either for him or for you of course grace you know why i am here he paused and then remembering that he had no right to expect an answer to such a question he continued i have come here dearest grace to ask you to be my wife and to be a mother to edith i know that you love edith  i do indeed  and i have hoped sometimesthough i suppose i ought not to say sobut i have hoped and almost thought sometimes that you have been willing toto love me too it is better to tell the truth simply is it not  i suppose so said grace  and therefore and because i love you dearly myself i have come to ask you to be my wife saying which he opened out his hand and held it to her but she did not take it there is my hand grace if your heart is as i would have it you can give me yours and i shall want nothing else to make me happy but still she made no motion towards granting him his request if i have been too sudden he said you must forgive me for that i have been sudden and abrupt but as things are no other way has been open to me can you not bring yourself to give me some answer grace his hand had now fallen again to his side but he was still standing before her  she had said no word to him as yet except that one in which she had acknowledged her love for his child and had expressed no surprise even in her countenance at his proposal and yet the idea that he should do such a thing since the idea that he certainly would do it had become clear to her had filled her with a world of surprise no girl ever lived with any beauty belonging to her who had a smaller knowledge of her own possession than grace crawley nor had she the slightest pride in her own acquirements that she had been taught in many things more than had been taught to other girls had come of her poverty and of the desolation of her home she had learned to read greek and italian because there had been nothing else for her to do in that sad house and subsequently accuracy of knowledge had been necessary for the earning of her bread i think that grace had at times been weak enough to envy the idleness and almost to envy the ignorance of other girls her figure was light perfect in symmetry full of grace at all points but she had thought nothing of her figure remembering only the poverty of her dress but remembering also with a brave resolution that she would never be ashamed of it and as her acquaintance with major grantly had begun and had grown and as she had learned to feel unconsciously that his company was pleasanter to her than that of any other person she knew she had still told herself that anything like love must be out of the question but then words had been spoken and there had been glances in his eye and a tone in his voice and a touch upon his fingers of which she could not altogether refuse to accept the meaning and others had spoken to her of it the two miss prettymans and her friend lily yet she would not admit to herself that it could be so and she would not allow herself to confess to herself that she loved him then had come the last killing misery to which her father had been subjected he had been accused of stealing money and had been committed to be tried for the theft from that moment at any rate any hope if there had been a hope must be crushed but she swore to herself bravely that there had been no such hope and she assured herself also that nothing had passed which had entitled her to expect anything beyond ordinary friendship from the man of whom she certainly had thought much even if those touches and those tones and those glances had meant anything all such meaning must be annihilated by this disgrace which had come upon her she might know that her father was innocent she might be sure at any rate that he had been innocent in intention but the world thought differently and she her brother and sister and her mother and her poor father must bend to the worlds opinion if those dangerous joys had meant anything they must be taken as meaning nothing more  thus she had argued with herself and fortified by such selfteachings she had come down to allington since she had been with her friends there had come upon her from day to day a clear conviction that her arguments had been undoubtedly truea clear conviction which had been very cold to her heart in spite of all her courage she had expected nothing hoped for nothing and yet when nothing came she was sad she thought of one special halfhour in which he had said almost all that he might have saidmore than he ought to have saidof a moment during which her hand had remained in his of a certain pressure with which he had put her shawl upon her shoulders if he had only written to her one word to tell her that he believed her father was innocent but no she had no right to expect anything from him and then lily had ceased to talk of him and she did expect nothing now he was there before her asking her to come to him and be his wife yes she would kiss his shoebuckles only that the kissing of his shoebuckles would bring upon him that injury which he should never suffer from her hands he had been generous and her selfpride was satisfied but her other pride was touched and she also would be generous can you not bring yourself to give me some answer he had said to her of course she must give him an answer but how should she give it  you are very kind she said  i would be more than kind  so you are kind is a cold word when used to such a friend at such a time  i would be everything on earth to you that a man can be to a woman  i know i ought to thank you if i knew how my heart is full of thanks it is indeed  and is there no room for love there  there is no room for love in our house major grantly you have not seen papa  no but if you wish it i will do so at once  it would do no goodnone i only asked you because you can hardly know how sad is our state at home  but i cannot see that that need deter you if you can love me  can you not if you saw him and the house and my mother you would not say so in the bible it is said of some season that it is not a time for marrying or for giving in marriage and so it is with us  i am not pressing you as to a day i only ask you to say that you will be engaged to meso that i may tell my own people and let it be known  i understand all that i know how good you are but major grantly you must understand me also when i assure you that it cannot be so  do you mean that you refuse me altogether  yes altogether  and why  must i answer that question ought i to be made to answer it but i will tell you fairly without touching on anything else that i feel that we are all disgraced and that i will not take disgrace into another family  grace do you love me  i love no one nowthat is as you mean i can love no one i have no room for any feeling except for my father and mother and for us all i should not be here now but that i save my mother the bread that i should eat at home  is it as bad as that  yes it is as bad as that it is much worse than that if you knew it all you cannot conceive how low we have fallen and now they tell me that my father will be found guilty and will be sent to prison putting ourselves out of the question what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances what would you think of a girl who would allow herself to be in love in such a position had i been ten times engaged to you i would have broken it off then she got up to leave him  but he stopped her holding her by the arm what you have said will make me say what i certainly should never have said without it i declare that we are engaged  no we are not said grace  you have told me that you loved me  i never told you so  there are other ways of speaking than the voice and i will boast to you though to no one else that you have told me so i believe you love me i shall hold myself as engaged to you and i shall think you false if i hear that you listen to another man now goodby gracemy own grace  no i am not your own she said through her tears  you are my own my very own god bless you dear dear dearest grace you shall hear from me in a day or two and shall see me as soon as this horrid trial is over then he took her in his arms before she could escape from him and kissed her forehead and her lips while she struggled in his arms after that he left the room and the house as quickly as he could and was seen no more of the dales upon that occasion     chapter xxxi  showing how major grantly returned to guestwick   grace when she was left alone threw herself upon the sofa and hid her face in her hands she was weeping almost hysterically and had been utterly dismayed and frightened by her lovers impetuosity things had gone after a fashion which her imagination had not painted to her as possible surely she had the power to refuse the man if she pleased and yet she felt as she lay there weeping that she did in truth belong to him as part of his goods and that her generosity had been foiled she had especially resolved that she would not confess to any love for him she had made no such confession she had guarded herself against doing so with all the care which she knew how to use but he had assumed the fact and she had been unable to deny it could she have lied to him and have sworn that she did not love him could she have so perjured herself even in support of her generosity yes she would have done soso she told herselfif a moment had been given to her for thought she ought to have done so and she blamed herself for being so little prepared for the occasion the lie would be useless now indeed she would have no opportunity for telling it for of course she would not answerwould not even read his letter though he might know that she loved him yet she would not be his wife he had forced her secret from her but he could not force her to marry him she did love him but he should never be disgraced by her love  after a while she was able to think of his conduct and she believed that she ought to be very angry with him he had taken her roughly in his arms and had insulted her he had forced a kiss from her she had felt his arms warm and close and strong about her and had not known whether she was in paradise or in purgatory she was very angry with him she would send back his letter to him without reading itwithout opening it if that might be possible he had done that to her which nothing could justify but yetyetyet how dearly she loved him was he not a prince of men he had behaved badly of course but had any man ever behaved so badly before in so divine a way was it not a thousand pities that she should be driven to deny anything to a lover who so richly deserved everything that could be given to him he had kissed her hand as he let her go and now not knowing what she did she kissed the spot on which she had felt his lips his arm had been round her waist and the old frock which she wore should be kept by her for ever because it had been so graced  what was she now to say to lily and to lilys mother of one thing there was no doubt she would never tell them of her lovers wicked audacity that was a secret never to be imparted to any ears she would keep her resentment to herself and not ask the protection of any vicarious wrath he could never so sin again that was certain and she would keep all knowledge and memory of the sin for her own purposes but how could it be that such a man as that one so good though so sinful so glorious though so great a trespasser should have come to such a girl as her and have asked for her love then she thought of her fathers poverty and the misery of her own condition and declared to herself that it was very wonderful  lily was the first to enter the room and she before she did so learned from the servant that major grantly had left the house i heard the door miss and then i saw the top of his hat out of the pantry window armed with this certain information lily entered the drawingroom and found grace in the act of rising from the sofa  am i disturbing you said lily  no not at all i am glad you have come kiss me and be good to me and she twined her arms about lily and embraced her  am i not always good to you you simpleton has he been good  i dont know what you mean  and have you been good to him  as good as i knew how lily  and where is he  he has gone away i shall never see him any more lily  then she hid her face upon her friends shoulder and broke forth again into hysterical tears  but tell me grace what he saidthat is if you mean to tell me  i will tell you everythingthat is everything i can and grace blushed as she thought of the one secret which she certainly would not tell  has hehas he done what i said he would do come speak out boldly has he asked you to be his wife  yes said grace barely whispering the word  and you have accepted him  no lily i have not indeed i have not i did not know how to speak because i was surprisedand he of course could say what he liked but i told him as well as i could that i would not marry him  and whydid you tell him why  yes because of papa  then if he is the man i take him to be that answer will go for nothing of course he knew all that before he came here he did not think you were an heiress with forty thousand pounds if he is in earnest that will go for nothing and i think he is in earnest  and so was i in earnest  well gracewe shall see  i suppose i may have a will of my own lily  do not be so sure of that women are not allowed to have wills of their own on all occasions some man comes in a girls way and she gets to be fond of him just because he does come in her way well when that has taken place she has no alternative but to be taken if he chooses to take her or to be left if he chooses to leave her  lily dont say that  but i do say it a man may assure himself that he will find for himself a wife who shall be learned or beautiful or six feet high if he wishes it or who has red hair or red eyes or red cheeksjust what he pleases and he may go about till he finds it as you can go about and match your worsteds you are a fool if you buy a colour you dont want but we can never match our worsteds for that other piece of work but are obliged to take any colour that comesand therefore it is that we make such a jumble of it heres mamma we must not be philosophical before her mamma major grantly hasskedaddled  oh lily what a word  but oh mamma what a thing fancy his going away and not saying a word to anybody  if he had anything to say to grace i suppose he said it  he asked her to marry him of course we none of us had any doubt about that he swore to her that she and none but she should be his wifeand all that kind of thing but he seems to have done it in the most prosaic wayand now he has gone away without saying a word to any of us i shall never speak to him againunless grace asks me  grace my dear may i congratulate you said mrs dale  grace did not answer as lily was too quick for her oh she has refused him of course but major grantly is a man of too much sense to expect that he should succeed the first time let me see this is the fourteenth these clocks run fourteen days and therefore you may expect him again about the twentyeighth for myself i think you are giving him an immense deal of unnecessary trouble and that if he left you in the lurch it would only serve you right but you have the world with you im told a girl is supposed to tell a man two fibs before she may tell him one truth  i told him no fib lily i told him that i would not marry him and i will not  but why not dear grace said mrs dale  because the people say that papa is a thief having said this grace walked slowly out of the room and neither mrs dale nor lily attempted to follow her  shes as good as gold said lily when the door was closed  and hewhat of him  i think he is good too but she has told me nothing yet of what he has said to her he must be good or he would not have come down here after her but i dont wonder at his coming because she is so beautiful once or twice as we were walking back today i thought her face was the most lovely that i had ever seen and did you see her just now as she spoke of her father  oh yesi saw her  think what she will be in two or three years time when she becomes a woman she talks french and italian and hebrew for anything that i know and she is perfectly beautiful i never saw a more lovely figureand she has spirit enough for a goddess i dont think that major grantly is such a fool after all  i never took him for a fool  i have no doubt all his own people door they will when they hear of it but mamma she will grow to be big enough to walk atop of all the lady hartletops in england it will all come right at last  you think it will  oh yes why should it not if he is worth having it willand i think he is worth having he must wait till this horrid trial is over it is clear to me that grace thinks that her father will be convicted  but he cannot have taken the money  i think he took it and i think it wasnt his but i dont think he stole it i dont know whether you can understand the difference  i am afraid a jury wont understand it  a jury of men will not i wish they could put you and me on it mamma i would take my best boots and eat them down to the heels for graces sake and for major grantlys what a goodlooking man he is  yes he is  and so like a gentleman ill tell you what mamma we wont say anything to her about him for the present her heart will be so full she will be driven to talk and we can comfort her better in that way the mother and daughter agreed to act upon these tactics and nothing more was said to grace about her lover on that evening  major grantly walked from mrs dales house to the inn and ordered his gig and drove himself out of allington almost without remembering where he was or whither he was going he was thinking solely of what had just occurred and of what on his part should follow as the result of that meeting half at least of the noble deeds done in this world are due to emulation rather than to the native nobility of the actors a young man leads a forlorn hope because another young man has offered to do so jones in the huntingfield rides at an impracticable fence because he is told that smith took it three years ago and walker puts his name down for ten guineas at a charitable dinner when he hears thompsons read out for five and in this case the generosity and selfdenial shown by grace warmed and cherished similar virtues within her lovers breast some few weeks ago major grantly had been in doubt as to what his duty required of him in reference to grace crawley but he had no doubt whatsoever now in the fervour of his admiration he would have gone straight to the archdeacon had it been possible and have told him what he had done and what he intended to do nothing now should stop himno consideration that is either as regarded money or position he had pledged himself solemnly and he was very glad that he had pledged himself he would write to grace and explain to her that he trusted altogether in her fathers honour and innocence but that no consideration as to that ought to influence either him or her in any way if independently of her father she could bring herself to come to him and be his wife she was bound to do so now let the position of her father be what it might and thus as he drove his gig back towards guestwick he composed a very pretty letter to the lady of his love  and as he went at the corner of the lane which led from the main road up to guestwick cottage he again came upon john eames who was also returning to guestwick there had been a few words spoken between lady julia and johnny respecting major grantly after the girls had left the cottage and johnny had been persuaded that the strange visitor to allington could have no connection with his archenemy and why has he gone to allington john demanded somewhat sternly of his hostess  well if you ask me i think he has gone there to see your cousin grace crawley  he told me that he knew grace said john looking as though he were conscious of his own ingenuity in putting two and two together very cleverly  your cousin grace is a very pretty girl said lady julia  its a long time since ive seen her said johnny  why you saw her just this minute said lady julia  i didnt look at her said johnny therefore when he again met major grantly having continued to put two and two together with great ingenuity he felt quite sure that the man had nothing to do with the archenemy and he determined to be gracious did you find them at home at allington he said raising his hat  how do you do again said the major yes i found your friend mrs dale at home  but not her daughter or my cousin they were up therewhere ive come from but perhaps they had got back before you left  i saw them both they found me on the road with mr dale  whatthe squire then you have seen everybody  everybody i wished to see at allington  but you wouldnt stay at the red lion  well no i remembered that i wanted to get back to london and as i had seen my friends i thought i might as well hurry away  you knew mrs dale before then  no i didnt i never saw her in my life before but i knew the old squire when i was a boy however i should have said friend i went to see one friend and i saw her  john eames perceived that his companion put a strong emphasis on the word her as though he were determined to declare boldly that he had gone to allington solely to see grace crawley he had not the slightest objection to recognizing in major grantly a suitor for his cousins hand he could only reflect what an unusually fortunate girl grace must be if such a thing could be true of those poor crawleys he had only heard from time to time that their misfortunes were as numerous as the sands on the seashore and as unsusceptible of any fixed and permanent arrangement but as regarded grace here would be a very permanent arrangement tidings had reached him that grace was a great scholar but he had never heard much of her beauty it must probably be the case that major grantly was fond of greek there was he reminded himself no accounting for tastes but as nothing could be more respectable than such an alliance he thought that it would become him to be civil to the major  i hope you found her quite well i had barely time to speak to her myself  yes she was very well this is a sad thing about her father  very sad said johnny perhaps the major had heard about the accusation for the first time today and was going to find an escape on that plea if such was the case it would not be so well to be particularly civil  i believe mr crawley is a cousin of yours said the major  his wife is my mothers firstcousin their mothers were sisters  she is an excellent woman  i believe so i dont know much about them myselfthat is personally of course i have heard of this charge that has been made against him it seems to me to be a great shame  well i cant exactly say that it is a shame i do not know that there has been anything done with a feeling of persecution or of cruelty it is a great mystery and we must have it cleared up if we can  i dont suppose he can have been guilty said johnny  certainly not in the ordinary sense of the word i heard all the evidence against him  oh you did  yes said the major i live near them in barsetshire and i am one of his bailsmen  then you are an old friend i suppose  not exactly that but circumstances make me very much interested about them i fancy that the cheque was left in his house by accident and that it got into his hands he didnt know how and that when he used it he thought it was his  thats queer said johnny  he is very odd you know  but its a kind of oddity that they dont like at the assizes  the great cruelty is said the major that whatever may be the result the punishment will fall so heavily upon his wife and daughters i think the whole county ought to come forward and take them by the hand well goodby ill drive on as im a little in a hurry  goodby said johnny im very glad to have had the pleasure of meeting you hes a good sort of a fellow after all he said to himself when the gig had passed on he wouldnt have talked in that way if he had meant to hang back     chapter xxxii  mr toogood   illustration  mr crawley had declared to mr robarts that he would summon no legal aid to his assistance at the coming trial the reader may perhaps remember the impetuosity with which he rejected the advice on this subject which was conveyed to him by mr robarts with all the authority of archdeacon grantlys name tell the archdeacon he had said that i will have none of his advice and then mr robarts had left him fully convinced that any further interference on his part could be of no avail nevertheless the words which had then been spoken were not without effect this coming trial was ever present to mr crawleys mind and though when driven to discuss the subject he would speak of it with high spirit as he had done both to the bishop and to mr robarts yet in his long hours of privacy or when alone with his wife his spirit was anything but high it will kill me he would say to her i shall get salvation thus death will relieve me and i shall never be called upon to stand before those cruel eager eyes then would she try to say words of comfort sometimes soothing him as though he were a child and at others bidding him be a man and remember that as a man he should have sufficient endurance to bear the eyes of any crowd that might be there to look at him  i think i will go up to london he said to her one evening very soon after the day of mr robartss visit  go up to london josiah mr crawley had not been up to london once since they had been settled at hogglestock and this sudden resolution on his part frightened his wife go up to london dearest and why  i will tell you why they all say that i should speak to some man of the law whom i may trust about this coming trial i trust no one in these parts not mark you that i say that they are untrustworthy god forbid that i should so speak or even so think of men whom i know not but the matter has become so common in mens mouths at barchester and at silverbridge that i cannot endure to go among them and to talk of it i will go up to london and i will see your cousin mr john toogood of grays inn now in this scheme there was an amount of everyday prudence which startled mrs crawley almost as much as did the prospect of the difficulties to be overcome if the journey were to be made her husband in the first place had never once seen mr john toogood and in days very long back when he and she were making their first gallant strugglefor in those days it had been gallantdown in their cornish curacy he had reprobated certain toogood civilitiesprofessional civilitieswhich had been proffered perhaps with too plain an intimation that on the score of relationship the professional work should be done without payment the mr toogood of those days who had been mrs crawleys uncle and the father of mrs eames and grandfather of our friend johnny eames had been much angered by some correspondence which had grown up between him and mr crawley and from that day there had been a cessation of all intercourse between the families since those days that toogood had been gathered to the ancient toogoods of old and the son reigned on the family throne in raymonds buildings the present toogood was therefore firstcousin to mrs crawley but there had been no intimacy between them mrs crawley had not seen her cousin since her marriageas indeed she had seen none of her relations having been estranged from them by the singular bearing of her husband she knew that her cousin stood high in his profession the firm of toogood and crumpcrump and toogood it should have been properly called in these dayshaving always held its head up high above all dirty work and she felt that her husband could look for advice from no better source but how would such a one as he manage to tell his story to a stranger nay how would he find his way alone into the lawyers room to tell his story at allso strange was he to the world and then the expense if you do not wish me to apply to your cousin say so and there shall be an end of it said mr crawley in an angry tone  of course i would wish it i believe him to be an excellent man and a good lawyer  then why should i not go to his chambers in formâ pauperis i must go to him and must tell him so i cannot pay him for the labour of his counsel nor for such minutes of his time as i shall use  oh josiah you need not speak of that  but i must speak of it can i go to a professional man who keeps as it were his shop open for those who may think fit to come and purchase of him and take of his goods and afterwards when the goods have been used tell him that i have not the price in my hand i will not do that mary you think that i am mad that i know not what i do yesi see it in your eyes and you are sometimes partly right but i am not so mad but that i know what is honest i will tell your cousin that i am sore straitened and brought down into the very dust by misfortune and i will beseech him for what of ancient feeling of family he may bear to you to listen to me for a while and i will be very short and if need be will bide his time patiently and perhaps he may say a word to me that may be of use  there was certainly very much in this to provoke mrs crawley it was not only that she knew well that her cousin would give ample and immediate attention and lend himself thoroughly to the matter without any idea of paymentbut that she could not quite believe that her husbands humility was true humility she strove to believe it but knew that she failed after all it was only a feeling on her part there was no argument within herself about it an unpleasant taste came across the palate of her mind as such a savour will sometimes from some unexpected source come across the palate of the mouth well she could only gulp at it and swallow it and excuse it among the salad that comes from your garden a bitter leaf will now and then make its way into your saladbowl alas there were so many bitter leaves ever making their way into her bowl what i mean is josiah that no long explanation will be needed i think from what i remember of him that he would do for us anything that he could do  then i will go to the man and will humble myself before him even that hard as it is to me may be a duty that i owe mr crawley as he said this was remembering the fact that he was a clergyman of the church of england and that he had a rank of his own in the country which did he ever do such a thing as go out to dinner in company would establish for him a certain right of precedence whereas this attorney of whom he was speaking was so to say nobody in the eyes of the world  there need be no humbling josiah other than that which is due from man to man in all circumstances but never mind we will not talk about that if it seems good to you go to mr toogood i think that it is good may i write to him and say that you will go  i will write myself it will be more seemly  then the wife paused before she asked the next questionpaused for some minute or two and then asked it with anxious doubtand may i go with you josiah  why should two go when one can do the work he answered sharply have we money so much at command  indeed no  you should go and do it all for you are wiser in these things than i am were it not that i may not dare to showthat i submit myself to my wife  nay my dear  but it is ay my dear it is so this is a thing such as men do not such as women do unless they be forlorn and unaided of men i know that i am weak where you are strong that i am crazed where you are clearwitted  i meant not that josiah it was of your health that i thought  nevertheless it is as i say but for all that it may not be that you should do my work there are those watching me who would say lo he confesses himself incapable and then some one would whisper something of a madhouse mary i fear that worse than a prison  may god in his mercy forbid such cruelty  but i must look to it my dear do you think that that woman who sits there at barchester in high places disgracing herself and that puny ecclesiastical lord who is her husbanddo you think that she would not immure me if she could she is a shewolfonly less reasonable than the dumb brute as she sharpens her teeth in malice coming from anger and not in malice coming from hunger as do the outer wolves of the forest i tell you mary that if she had a colourable ground for her action she would swear tomorrow that i am mad  you shall go alone to london  yes i will go alone they shall not say that i cannot yet do my own work as a man should do it i stood up before him the puny man who is called a bishop and before her who makes herself great by his littleness and i scorned them both to their faces though the shoes which i had on were all broken as i myself could not but see when i stood yet i was greater than they were with all their purple and fine linen  but josiah my cousin will not be harsh to you  welland if he be not  illusage you can bear and violent illusage such as that which mrs proudie allowed herself to exhibit you can repay with interest but kindness seems to be too heavy a burden for you  i will struggle i will endeavour i will speak but little and if possible i will listen much now my dear i will write to this man and you shall give me the address that is proper for him then he wrote the letter not accepting a word in the way of dictation from his wife but craving the great kindness of a short interview for which he ventured to become a solicitor urged thereto by his wifes assurance that one with whom he was connected by family ties would do as much as this for the possible preservation of the honour of the family in answer to this mr toogood wrote back as followsdear mr crawley i will be at my office all thursday morning next from ten to two and will take care that you shant be kept waiting for me above ten minutes you parsons never like waiting but hadnt you better come and breakfast with me and maria at nine then wed have a talk as we walk to the office yours always thomas toogood and the letter was dated from the attorneys private house in tavistock square  i am sure he means to be kind said mrs crawley  doubtless he means to be kind but his kindness is roughi will not say unmannerly as the word would be harsh i have never even seen the lady whom he calls maria  she is his wife  so i would venture to suppose but she is unknown to me i will write again and thank him and say that i will be with him at ten to the moment  there were still many things to be settled before the journey could be made mr crawley in his first plan proposed that he should go up by night mail train travelling in the third class having walked over to silverbridge to meet it that he should then walk about london from 5 am to 10 am and afterwards come down by an afternoon train to which a third class was also attached but at last his wife persuaded him that such a task as that performed in the middle of the winter would be enough to kill any man and that if attempted it would certainly kill him and he consented at last to sleep the night in townbeing specially moved thereto by discovering that he could in conformity with this scheme get in and out of the train at a station considerably nearer to him than silverbridge and that he could get a returnticket at a thirdclass fare the whole journey he found could be done for a pound allowing him seven shillings for his nights expenses in london and out of the resources of the family there were produced two sovereigns so that in the event of accident he would not utterly be a castaway from want of funds  so he started on his journey after an early dinner almost hopeful through the new excitement of a journey to london and his wife walked with him nearly as far as the station do not reject my cousins kindness were the last words she spoke  for his professional kindness if he will extend it to me i will be most thankful he replied she did not dare to say more nor had she dared to write privately to her cousin asking for any special help lest by doing so she should seem to impugn the sufficiency and stability of her husbands judgment he got up to town late at night and having made inquiry of one of the porters he hired a bed for himself in the neighbourhood of the railway station here he had a cup of tea and a morsel of breadandbutter and in the morning he breakfasted again on the same fare no i have no luggage he had said to the girl at the publichouse who had asked him as to his travelling gear if luggage be needed as a certificate of respectability i will pass on elsewhere said he the girl stared and assured him that she did not doubt his respectability i am a clergyman of the church of england he had said but my circumstances prevent me from seeking a more expensive lodging they did their best to make him comfortable and i think almost disappointed him in not heaping further misfortunes on his head  he was in raymonds buildings at halfpast nine and for half an hour walked up and down the umbrageous pavementit used to be umbrageous but perhaps the trees have gone nowbefore the doors of the various chambers he could hear the clock strike from grays inn and the moment that it had struck he was turning in but was encountered in the passage by mr toogood who was equally punctual with himself strange stories about mr crawley had reached mr toogoods household and that maria the mention of whose christian name had been so offensive to the clergyman had begged her husband not to be a moment late poor mr toogood who on ordinary days did perhaps take a few minutes grace was thus hurried away almost with his breakfast in his throat and as we have seen just saved himself perhaps sir you are mr crawley he said in a goodhumoured cheery voice he was a goodhumoured cheerylooking man about fifty years of age with grizzled hair and sunburnt face and large whiskers nobody would have taken him to be a partner in any of those great houses of which we have read in historythe quirk gammon and snaps of the profession or the dodson and foggs who are immortal  that is my name sir said mr crawley taking off his hat and bowing low and i am here by appointment to meet mr toogood the solicitor whose name i see affixed upon the doorpost  i am mr toogood the solicitor and i hope i see you quite well mr crawley then the attorney shook hands with the clergyman and preceded him upstairs to the front room on the first floor here we are mr crawley and pray take a chair i wish you could have made it convenient to come and see us at home we are rather long as my wife sayslong in family she means and therefore are not very well off for spare beds  oh sir  ive twelve of em living mr crawleyfrom eighteen years the eldesta girl down to eighteen months the youngesta boy and they go in and out boy and girl boy and girl like the cogs of a wheel they aint such far away distant cousins from your own young onesonly first once as we call it  i am aware that there is a family tie or i should not have ventured to trouble you  blood is thicker than water isnt it i often say that i heard of one of your girls only yesterday she is staying somewhere down in the country not far from where my sister livesmrs eames the widow of poor john eames who never did any good in this world i daresay youve heard of her  the name is familiar to me mr toogood  of course it is ive a nephew down there just now and he saw your girl the other dayvery highly he spoke of her too let me seehow many is it you have  three living mr toogood  ive just four times threethats the difference but i comfort myself with the text about the quiver you know and i tell them that when theyve eat up all the butter theyll have to take their bread dry  i trust the young people take your teaching in a proper spirit  i dont know much about spirit theres spirit enough my second girl lucy told me that if i came home today without tickets for the pantomime i shouldnt have any dinner allowed me thats the way they treat me but we understand each other at home were all pretty good friends there thank god and there isnt a sick chick among the boiling  you have many mercies for which you should indeed be thankful said mr crawley gravely  yes yes yes thats true i think of that sometimes though perhaps not so much as i ought to do but the best way to be thankful is to use the goods the gods provide you the lovely thais sits beside you take the goods the gods provide you i often say that to my wife till the children have got to calling her thais the children have it pretty much their own way with us mr crawley  by this time mr crawley was almost beside himself and was altogether at a loss how to bring in the matter on which he wished to speak he had expected to find a man who in the hurry of london business might perhaps just manage to spare him five minuteswho would grapple instantly with the subject that was to be discussed between them would speak to him halfadozen hard words of wisdom and would then dismiss him and turn on the instant to other matters of important businessbut here was an easy familiar fellow who seemed to have nothing on earth to do and who at this first meeting had taken advantage of a distant family connexion to tell him everything about the affairs of his own household and then how peculiar were the domestic traits which he told what was mr crawley to say to a man who had taught his own children to call their mother thais of thais mr crawley did know something and he forgot to remember that perhaps mr toogood knew less he felt it however to be very difficult to submit the details of his case to a gentleman who talked in such a strain about his own wife and children  but something must be done mr crawley in his present frame of mind could not sit and talk about thais all day sir he said the picture of your home is very pleasant and i presume that plenty abounds there  well you know pretty tollloll for that with twelve of em mr crawley i neednt tell you they are not all going to have castles and parks of their own unless they can get em off their own bats but i pay upwards of a hundred a year each for my eldest three boys schooling and ive been paying eighty for the girls put that and that together and see what it comes to educate educate educate thats my word  no better word can be spoken sir  i dont think theres a girl in tavistock square that can beat pollyshes the eldest called after her mother you knowthat can beat her at the piano and lucy has read lord byron and tom moore all through every word of em by jove i believe she knows most of tom moore by heart and the young uns are coming on just as well  perhaps sir as your time is no doubt precious  just at this time of the day we dont care so much about it mr crawley and one doesnt catch a new cousin every day you know  however if you will allow me  well tackle to very well so be it now mr crawley let me hear what it is that i can do for you of a sudden as mr toogood spoke these last words the whole tone of his voice seemed to change and even the position of his body became so much altered as to indicate a different kind of man you just tell your story in your own way and i wont interrupt you till youve done thats always the best  i must first crave your attention to an unfortunate preliminary said mr crawley  and what is that  i come before you in formâ pauperis here mr crawley paused and stood up before the attorney with his hands crossed one upon the other bending low as though calling attention to the poorness of his raiment i know that i have no justification for my conduct i have nothing of reason to offer why i should trespass upon your time i am a poor man and cannot pay you for your services  oh bother said mr toogood jumping up out of his chair  i do not know whether your charity will grant me that which i ask  dont lets have any more of this said the attorney we none of us like this kind of thing at all if i can be of any service to you youre as welcome to it as flowers in may and as for billing my firstcousin which your wife is i should as soon think of sending in an account to my own  but mr toogood  do you go on now with your story ill put the rest all right  i was bound to be explicit mr toogood  very well now you have been explicit with a vengeance and you may heave ahead lets hear the story and if i can help you i will when ive said that you may be sure i mean it ive heard something of it before but let me hear it all from you  then mr crawley began and told the story mr toogood was actually true to his promise and let the narrator go on with his narrative without interruption when mr crawley came to his own statement that the cheque had been paid to him by mr soames and went on to say that that statement had been falsei told him that but i told him so wrongly and then paused thinking that the lawyer would ask some question mr toogood simply said go on go on ill come back to all that when youve done and he merely nodded his head when mr crawley spoke of his second statement that the money had come from the dean we had been bound together by close ties of early familiarity said mr crawley and in former years our estates in life were the same but he has prospered and i have failed and when creditors were importunate i consented to accept relief in money which had previously been often offered and i must acknowledge mr toogood while saying this that i have knownhave known with heartfelt agonythat at former times my wife has taken that from my friend mr arabin with hand halfhidden from me which i have refused whether it be better to eatthe bread of charityor not to eat bread at all i for myself have no doubt he said but when the want strikes ones wife and children and the charity strikes only oneself then there is a doubt when he spoke thus mr toogood got up and thrusting his hands into his waistcoat pockets walked about the room exclaiming by george by george by george but he still let the man go on with his story and heard him out at last to the end  and they committed you for trial at the next barchester assizes said the lawyer  they did  and you employed no lawyer before the magistrates  nonei refused to employ any one  you were wrong there mr crawley i must be allowed to say that you were wrong there  i may possibly have been so from your point of view mr toogood but permit me to explain i  its no good explaining now of course you must employ a lawyer for your defencean attorney who will put the case into the hands of counsel  but that i cannot do mr toogood  you must do it if you dont do it your friends should do it for you if you dont do it everybody will say youre mad there isnt a single solicitor you could find within half a mile of you at this moment who wouldnt give you the same advicenot a single man either who has got a head on his shoulders worth a turnip  when mr crawley was told that madness would be laid to his charge if he did not do as he was bid his face became very black and assumed something of that look of determined obstinacy which it had worn when he was standing in the presence of the bishop and mrs proudie it may be so he said it may be as you say mr toogood but these neighbours of yours as to whose collected wisdom you speak with so much certainty would hardly recommend me to indulge in a luxury for which i have no means of paying  who thinks about paying under such circumstances as these  i do mr toogood  the wretchedest costermonger that comes to grief has a barrister in a wig and gown to give him his chance of escape  but i am not a costermonger mr toogoodthough more wretched perhaps than any costermonger now in existence it is my lot to have to endure the sufferings of poverty and at the same time not to be exempt from those feelings of honour to which poverty is seldom subject i cannot afford to call in legal assistance for which i cannot payand i will not do it  ill carry the case through for you it certainly is not just my line of businessbut ill see it carried through for you  out of your own pocket  never mind when i say ill do a thing ill do it  no mr toogood this thing you can not do but do not suppose i am the less grateful  what is it i can do then why do you come to me if you wont take my advice  after this the conversation went on for a considerable time without touching on any point which need be brought palpably before the readers eye the attorney continued to beg the clergyman to have his case managed in the usual way and went so far as to tell him that he would be illtreating his wife and family if he continued to be obstinate but the clergyman was not shaken from his resolve and was at last able to ask mr toogood what he had better dohow he had better attempt to defend himselfon the understanding that no legal aid was to be employed when this question was at last asked in such a way as to demand an answer mr toogood sat for a moment or two in silence he felt that an answer was not only demanded but almost enforced and yet there might be much difficulty in giving it  mr toogood said mr crawley seeing the attorneys hesitation i declare to you before god that my only object will be to enable the jury to know about this sad matter all that i know myself if i could open my breast to them i should be satisfied but then a prisoner can say nothing and what he does say is ever accounted false  that is why you should have legal assistance  we had already come to a conclusion on that matter as i thought said mr crawley  mr toogood paused for another moment or two and then dashed at his answer or rather dashed at a counter question mr crawley where did you get the cheque you must pardon me you know or if you wish it i will not press the question but so much hangs on that you know  every thing would hang on itif i only knew  you mean that you forget  absolutely totally i wish mr toogood i could explain to you the toilsome perseverance with which i have cudgelled my poor brains endeavouring to extract from them some scintilla of memory that would aid me  could you have picked it up in the house  nono that i did not do dull as i am i know so much it was mine of right from whatever source it came to me i know myself as no one else can know me in spite of the wise mans motto had i picked up a cheque in my house or on the road i should not have slept till i had taken steps to restore it to the seeming owner so much i can say but otherwise i am in such matters so shandypated that i can trust myself to be sure of nothing i thoughti certainly thought  you thought what  i thought that it had been given to me by my friend the dean i remember well that i was in his library at barchester and i was somewhat provoked in spirit there were lying on the floor hundreds of volumes all glittering with gold and reeking with new leather from the binders he asked me to look at his toys why should i look at them there was a time but the other day it seemed when he had been glad to borrow from me such treasures as i had and it seemed to me that he was heartless in showing me these things well i need not trouble you with all that  go ongo on let me hear it all and i shall learn something  i know now how vain how vile i was i always know afterwards how low the spirit has grovelled i had gone to him then because i had resolved to humble myself and for my wifes sake to ask my friendfor money with words which were very awkwardwhich no doubt were ungraciousi had asked him and he had bid me follow him from his hall into his library there he left me awhile and on returning told me with a smile that he had sent for moneyand if i can remember the sum he named was fifty pounds  but it has turned out as you say that you have paid fifty pounds with his moneybesides the cheque  that is truethat is quite true there is no doubt of that but as i was sayingthen he fell to talking about the books and i was angered i was very sore in my heart from the moment in which the words of beggary had passed from my lips i had repented and he had laughed and had taken it gaily i turned upon him and told him that i had changed my mind i was grateful but i would not have his money and so i prepared to go but he argued with me and would not let me gotelling me of my wife and of my children and while he argued there came a knock at the door and something was handed in and i knew that it was the hand of his wife  it was the money i suppose  yes mr toogood it was the money and i became the more uneasy because she herself is rich i liked it the less because it seemed to come from her hand but i took it what could i do when he reminded me that i could not keep my parish unless certain sums were paid he gave me a little parcel in a cover and i took itand left him sorrowing i had never before come quite to thatthough indeed it had in fact been often so before what was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wifes  you are too touchy about it all mr crawley  of course i am do you try it and see whether you will be touchy you have worked hard at your profession i daresay  well yes pretty well to tell the truth i have worked hard by george yes its not so bad now as it used to be  but you have always earned your bread bread for yourself and bread for your wife and little ones you can buy tickets for the play  i couldnt always buy tickets mind you  i have worked as hard and yet i cannot get bread i am older than you and i cannot earn my bare bread look at my clothes if you had to go and beg from mr crump would not you be touchy  as it happens crump isnt so well off as i am  never mind but i took it and went home and for two days i did not look at it and then there came an illness upon me and i know not what passed but two men who had been hard on me came to the house when i was out and my wife was in a terrible state and i gave her the money and she went into silverbridge and paid them  and this cheque was with what you gave her  no i gave her money in notesjust fifty pounds when i gave it her i thought i gave it all and yet afterwards i thought i remembered that in my illness i had found the cheque with the deans money but it was not so  you are sure of that  he has said that he put five notes of £10 each into the cover and such notes i certainly gave to my wife  where then did you get the cheque mr crawley again paused before he answered surely if you will exert your mind you will remember said the lawyer where did you get the cheque  i do not know  mr toogood threw himself back in his chair took his knee up into his lap to nurse it and began to think of it he sat thinking of it for some minutes without a wordperhaps for five minutes though the time seemed to be much longer to mr crawley who was however determined that he would not interrupt him and mr toogoods thoughts were at variance with mr toogoods former words perhaps after all this scheme of mr crawleysor rather the mode of defence on which he had resolved without any schememight be the best of which the case admitted it might be well that he should go into court without a lawyer he has convinced me of his innocence mr toogood said to himself and why should he not convince a jury he has convinced me not because i am specially soft or because i love the manfor as to that i dislike him rather than otherwisebut because there is either real truth in his words or else so wellfeigned a show of truth that no jury can tell the difference i think it is true by george i think he did get the twenty pounds honestly and that he does not this moment know where he got it he may have put his finger into my eye but if so why not also into the eyes of a jury then he released his leg and spoke something of his thoughts aloud its a sad story he said a very sad story  well yes its sad enough if you could see my house youd say so  i havent a doubt but what youre as innocent as i am mr toogood as he said this felt a little twinge of conscience he did believe mr crawley to be innocent but he was not so sure of it as his words would seem to imply nevertheless he repeated the words againas innocent as i am  i dont know said mr crawley i dont know i think i am but i dont know  i believe you are but you see the case is a very distressing one a jury has a right to say that the man in possession of a cheque for twenty pounds should account for his possession of it if i understand the story aright mr soames will be able to prove that he brought the cheque into your house and as far as he knows never took it out again  i suppose so all the same if he brought it in then did he also take it out again  i am saying what he will proveor in other words what he will state upon oath you cant contradict him you cant get into the box to do iteven if that would be of any avail and i am glad that you cannot as it would be of no avail and you can put no one else into the box who can do so  no no  that is to say we think you cannot do so people can do so many things that they dont think they can do and cant do so many things that they think that they can do when will the dean be home  i dont know  before the trial  i dont know i have no idea  its almost a tossup whether hed do more harm or good if he were there  i wish he might be there if he has anything to say whether it might be for harm or good  and mrs arabinshe is with him  they tell me she is not she is in europe he is in palestine  in palestine is he  so they tell me a dean can go where he likes he has no cure of souls to stand in the way of his pleasures  he hasnthasnt he i wish i were a dean that is if i were not a lawyer might i write a line to the deanand to mrs dean if it seemed fit you wouldnt mind that as you have come to see your cousin at lastand very glad i am that you haveyou must leave him a little discretion i wont say anything i oughtnt to say mr crawley opposed this scheme for some time but at last consented to the proposition and ill tell you what mr crawley i am very fond of cathedrals i am indeed and i have long wanted to see barchester theres a very fine whatyoumaycallem isnt there well ill just run down at the assizes we have nothing to do in london when the judges are in the countryof course mr toogood looked into mr crawleys eyes as he said this to see if his iniquity were detected but the perpetual curate was altogether innocent in these matters yes ill just run down for a mouthful of fresh air of course i shant open my mouth in court but i might say one word to the dean if hes thereand one word to mr soames who is conducting the prosecution mr crawley said that mr walker was doing so walker walker walker ohyes walker and winthrop isnt it a decent sort of man i suppose  i have heard nothing to his discredit mr toogood  and thats saying a great deal for a lawyer well mr crawley if nothing else comes out between this and thatnothing that is that shall clear your memory about that unfortunate bit of paper you must simply tell your story to the jury as youve told it to me i dont think any twelve men in england would convict youi dont indeed  you think they would not  of course ive only heard one side mr crawley  nonono that is true  but judging as well as i can judge from one side i dont think a jury can convict you at any rate ill see you at barchester and ill write a line or two before the trial just to find out anything that can be found out and youre sure you wont come and take a bit of mutton with us in the square the girls would be delighted to see you and so would maria mr crawley said that he was quite sure he could not do that and then having tendered reiterated thanks to his new friend in words which were touching in spite of their oldfashioned gravity he took his leave and walked back again to the publichouse at paddington  he returned home to hogglestock on the same afternoon reaching that place at nine in the evening during the whole of the day after leaving raymonds buildings he was thinking of the lawyer and of the words which the lawyer had spoken although he had been disposed to quarrel with mr toogood on many points although he had been more than once disgusted by the attorneys bad taste shocked by his low morality and almost insulted by his easy familiarity still when the interview was over he liked the attorney when first mr toogood had begun to talk he regretted very much that he had subjected himself to the necessity of discussing his private affairs with such a windbag of a man but when he left the chamber he trusted mr toogood altogether and was very glad that he had sought his aid he was tired and exhausted when he reached home as he had eaten nothing but a biscuit or two since his breakfast but his wife got him food and tea and then asked him as to his success was my cousin kind to you  very kindmore than kindperhaps somewhat too pressing in his kindness but i find no fault god forbid that i should he is i think a good man and certainly has been good to me  and what is to be done  he will write to the dean  i am glad of that  and he will be at barchester  thank god for that  but not as my lawyer  nevertheless i thank god that some one will be there who will know how to give you assistance and advice     chapter xxxiii  the plumstead foxes   the letters had been brought into the breakfastparlour at plumstead rectory one morning and the archdeacon had inspected them all and then thrown over to his wife her share of the spoilas was the custom of the house as to most of mrs grantlys letters he never made any further inquiry to letters from her sister the deans wife he was profoundly indifferent and rarely made any inquiry as to those which were directed in writing with which he was not familiar but there were others as to which as mrs grantly knew he would be sure to ask her questions if she did not show them no note ever reached her from lady hartletop as to which he was not curious and yet lady hartletops notes very seldom contained much that was of interest now on this morning there came a letter which as a matter of course mrs grantly read at breakfast and which she knew would not be allowed to disappear without inquiry nor indeed did she wish to keep the letter from her husband it was too important to be so treated but she would have been glad to gain time to think in what spirit she would discuss the contents of the letterif only such time might be allowed to her but the archdeacon would allow her no time what does henry say my dear he asked before the breakfast things had been taken away  what does he say well he says ill give you his letter to read byandby  and why not now  i thought id read it again myself first  but if you have read it i suppose you know whats in it  not very clearly as yet however there it is she knew very well that when she had once been asked for it no peace would be allowed to her till he had seen it and alas there was not much probability of peace in the house for some time after he should see it  the archdeacon read the three or four first lines in silenceand then he burst out he has has he then by heavens  stop dearest stop said his wife rising from her chair and coming over to him do not say words which you will surely repent  i will say words which shall make him repent he shall never have from me a sons portion  do not make threats in anger do not you know that it is wrong if he has offended you say nothing about iteven to yourselfas to threatened punishments till you can judge of the offence in cool blood  i am cool said the archdeacon  no my dear no you are angry and you have not even read his letter through  i will read his letter  you will see that the marriage is not imminent it may be that even yet it will never take place the young lady has refused him  psha  you will see that she has done so he tells us so himself and she has behaved very properly  why has she refused him  there can be no doubt about the reason she feels that with this charge hanging over her father she is not in a position to become the wife of any gentleman you cannot but respect her for that  then the archdeacon finished his sons letter uttering sundry interjections and ejaculations as he did so  of course i knew it i understood it all he said at last ive nothing to do with the girl i dont care whether she be good or bad  oh my dear  i care not at allwith reference to my own concerns of course i would wish that the daughter of a neighbouring clergymanthat the daughter of any neighbourthat the daughter of any one whatsoevershould be good rather than bad but as regards henry and me and our mutual relation her goodness can make no difference let her be another grizel and still such a marriage must estrange him from me and me from him  but she has refused him  yes and what does he saythat he has told her that he will not accept her refusal of course we know what it all means the girl i am not judging the girl i will not judge but my own son to whom i have ever done a fathers duty with a fathers affectionate indulgencehim i will judge i have warned him and he declares himself to be careless of my warning i shall take no notice of this letter i shall neither write to him about it or speak to him about it but i charge you to write to him and tell him that if he does this thing he shall not have a childs portion from me it is not that i will shorten that which would have been his but he shall havenothing then having spoken these words with a solemnity which for the moment silenced his wife he got up and left the room he left the room and closed the door but before he had gone half the length of the hall towards his own study he returned and addressed his wife again you understand my instructions i hope  what instructions  that you write to henry and tell him what i say  i will speak again to you about it byandby  i will speak no more about itnot a word more let there be not a word more said but oblige me by doing as i ask you  then he was again about to leave the room but she stopped him wait a moment my dear  why should i wait  that you may listen to me surely you will do that when i ask you i will write to henry of course if you bid me and i will give him your message whatever it may be but not today my dear  why not today  because the sun shall go down upon your wrath before i become its messenger if you choose to write today yourself i cannot help it i cannot hinder you if i am to write to him on your behalf i will take my instructions from you tomorrow morning when tomorrow morning comes you will not be angry with me because of the delay  the archdeacon was by no means satisfied but he knew his wife too well and himself too well and the world too well to insist on the immediate gratification of his passion over his bosoms mistress he did exercise a certain marital controlwhich was for instance quite sufficiently fixed to enable him to look down with thorough contempt on such a one as bishop proudie but he was not a despot who could exact a passive obedience to every fantasy his wife would not have written the letter for him on that day and he knew very well that she would not do so he knew also that she was rightand yet he regretted his want of power his anger at the present moment was very hotso hot that he wished to wreak it he knew that it would cool before the morrowand no doubt knew also theoretically that it would be most fitting that it should cool but not the less was it a matter of regret to him that so much good hot anger should be wasted and that he could not have his will of his disobedient son while it lasted he might no doubt have written himself but to have done so would not have suited him even in his anger he could not have written to his son without using the ordinary terms of affection and in his anger he could not bring himself to use those terms you will find that i shall be of the same mind tomorrowexactly he said to his wife i have resolved about it long since and it is not likely that i shall change in a day then he went out about his parish intending to continue to think of his sons iniquity so that he might keep his anger hotred hot then he remembered that the evening would come and that he would say his prayers and he shook his head in regretin a regret of which he was only half conscious though it was very keen and which he did not attempt to analyzeas he reflected that his rage would hardly be able to survive that ordeal how common with us it is to repine that the devil is not stronger over us than he is  the archdeacon who was a very wealthy man had purchased a property in plumstead contiguous to the glebeland and had thus come to exercise in the parish the double duty of rector and squire and of this estate in barsetshire which extended beyond the confines of plumstead into the neighbouring parish of eiderdown and which comprised also an outlying farm in the parish of stogpingumstoke pinguium would have been the proper name had not barbarous saxon tongues clipped it of its proper proportionshe had always intended that his son henry should enjoy the inheritance there was other property both in land and in money for his elder son and other again for the maintenance of his wifefor the archdeacons father had been for many years bishop of barchester and such a bishopric as that of barchester had been in those days was worth money of his intention in this respect he had never spoken in plain language to either of his sons but the major had for the last year or two enjoyed the shooting of the barsetshire covers giving what orders he pleased about the game and the father had encouraged him to take something like the management of the property into his hands there might be some fifteen hundred acres of it altogether and the archdeacon had rejoiced over it with his wife scores of times saying that there was many a squire in the county whose elder son would never find himself half so well placed as would his own younger son now there was a string of narrow woods called plumstead coppices which ran from a point near the church right across the parish dividing the archdeacons land from the ullathorne estate and these coppices or belts of woodland belonged to the archdeacon on the morning of which we are speaking the archdeacon mounted on his cob still thinking of his sons iniquity and of his own fixed resolve to punish him as he had said that he would punish him opened with his whip a woodland gate from which a green muddy lane led through the trees up to the house of his gamekeeper the mans wife was ill and in his ordinary way of business the archdeacon was about to call and ask after her health at the door of the cottage he found the man who was woodman as well as gamekeeper and was responsible for fences and faggots as well as for foxes and pheasants eggs  hows martha flurry said the archdeacon  thanking your reverence she be a deal improved since the mistress was herelast tuesday it was i think  im glad of that it was only rheumatism i suppose  just a tich of fever with it your reverence the doctor said  tell her i was asking after it i wont mind getting down today as i am rather busy she has had what she wanted from the house  the mistress has been very good in that way she always is god bless her  goodday to you flurry ill ask mr sims to come and read to her a bit this afternoon or tomorrow morning the archdeacon kept two curates and mr sims was one of them  shell take it very kindly your reverence but while you are here sir theres just a word id like to say i didnt happen to catch mr henry when he was here the other day  never mind mr henry what is it you have to say  illustration never mind mr henry  i do think i do indeed sir that mr thornes man aint dealing fairly along of the foxes i wouldnt say a word about it only that mr henry is so particular  what about the foxes what is he doing with the foxes  well sir hes a trapping on em he is indeed your reverence i wouldnt speak if i warnt well nigh mortial sure  now the archdeacon had never been a hunting man though in his early days many a clergyman had been in the habit of hunting without losing his clerical character by doing so but he had lived all his life among gentlemen in a hunting county and had his own very strong ideas about the trapping of foxes foxes first and pheasants afterwards had always been the rule with him as to any land of which he himself had had the management and no man understood better than he did how to deal with keepers as to this matter of foxpreserving or knew better that keepers will in truth obey not the words of their employers but their sympathies wish them to have foxes and pay them and they will have them mr sowerby of chaldicotes used to say and he in his day was reckoned to be the best preserver of foxes in barsetshire tell them to have them and dont wish it and pay them well and you wont have a fox to interfere with your game i dont care what a man says to me i can read it all like a book when i see his covers drawn that was what poor mr sowerby of chaldicotes used to say and the archdeacon had heard him say it a score of times and had learned the lesson but now his heart was not with the foxesand especially not with the foxes on behalf of his son henry i cant have any meddling with mr thorne he said i cant and i wont  but i dont suppose it can be mr thornes order your reverence and mr henry is so particular  of course it isnt mr thornes order mr thorne has been a hunting man all his life  but he have guv up now your reverence he aint a hunted these two years  im sure he wouldnt have the foxes trapped  not if he knowed it he wouldnt your reverence a gentleman of the likes of him whos been a hunting over fifty year wouldnt do the likes of that but the foxes is trapped and mr henry ll be a putting it on me if i dont speak out they is plumstead foxes too and a vixen was trapped just across the field yonder in goshall springs no later than yesterday morning flurry was now thoroughly in earnest and indeed the trapping of a vixen in february is a serious thing  goshall springs dont belong to me said the archdeacon  no your reverence theyre on the ullathorne property but a word from your reverence would do it mr henry thinks more of the foxes than anything the last word he told me was that it would break his heart if he saw the coppices drawn blank  then he must break his heart the words were pronounced but the archdeacon had so much command over himself as to speak them in such a voice that the man should not hear them but it was incumbent on him to say something that the man should hear i will have no meddling in the matter flurry whether there are foxes or whether there are not is matter of no great moment i will not have a word said to annoy mr thorne then he rode away back through the wood and out on to the road and the horse walked with him leisurely on whither the archdeacon hardly knewfor he was thinking thinking thinking wellif that aint the darndest thing that ever was said flurry but ill tell the squire about thornes mandarned if i dont now the squire was young squire gresham the master of the east barsetshire hounds  but the archdeacon went on thinking thinking thinking he could have heard nothing of his son to stir him more in his favour than this strong evidence of his partiality for foxes i do not mean it to be understood that the archdeacon regarded foxes as better than active charity or a contented mind or a meek spirit or than selfdenying temperance no doubt all these virtues did hold in his mind their proper places altogether beyond contamination of foxes but he had prided himself on thinking that his son should be a country gentleman and probably nothing doubting as to the majors active charity and other virtues was delighted to receive evidence of those tastes which he had ever wished to encourage in his sons character or rather such evidence would have delighted him at any other time than the present now it only added more gall to his cup why should he teach himself to care for such things when he has not the spirit to enjoy them said the archdeacon to himself he is a foola fool a man that has been married once to go crazy after a little girl that has hardly a dress to her back and who never was in a drawingroom in her life charles is the eldest and he shall be the eldest it will be better to keep it together it is the way in which the country has become what it is he was out nearly all day and did not see his wife till dinnertime her father mr harding was still with them but had breakfasted in his own room not a word therefore was said about henry grantly between the father and mother on that evening  mrs grantly was determined that unless provoked she would say nothing to him till the following morning he should sleep upon his wrath before she spoke to him again and he was equally unwilling to recur to the subject had she permitted it the next morning would have passed away and no word would have been spoken but this would not have suited her she had his orders to write and she had undertaken to obey these orderswith the delay of one day were she not to write at allor in writing to send no message from the father there would be cause for further anger and yet this i think was what the archdeacon wished  archdeacon she said i shall write to henry today  very well  and what am i to say from you  i told you yesterday what are my intentions  i am not asking about that now we hope there will be years and years to come in which you may change them and shape them as you will what shall i tell him now from you  i have nothing to say to himnothing not a word he knows what he has to expect from me for i have told him he is acting with his eyes open and so am i if he marries miss crawley he must live on his own means i told him that myself so plainly that he can want no further intimation then mrs grantly knew that she was absolved from the burden of yesterdays message and she plumed herself on the prudence of her conduct on the same morning the archdeacon wrote the following note      dear thorne     my man tells me that foxes have been trapped on darvells    farm just outside the coppices i know nothing of it    myself but i am sure youll look to it     yours always     t grantly     chapter xxxiv  mrs proudie sends for her lawyer   illustration  there was great dismay in barchester palace after the visit paid to the bishop and mrs proudie by that terrible clerical offender mr crawley it will be remembered perhaps how he had defied the bishop with spoken words and how he had defied the bishops wife by speaking no words to her for the moment no doubt mr crawley had the best of it mrs proudie acknowledged to herself that this was the case but as she was a woman who had never yet succumbed to an enemy who had neverif on such an occasion i may be allowed to use a schoolboys slangtaken a licking from any one it was not likely that mr crawley would be long allowed to enjoy his triumph in peace it would be odd if all the weight of the palace would not be able to silence a wretch of a perpetual curate who had already been committed to take his trial for thievingand mrs proudie was determined that all the weight of the palace should be used as for the bishop though he was not as angry as his wife he was quite as unhappy and therefore quite as hostile to mr crawley and was fully conscious that there could be no peace for him now until mr crawley should be crushed if only the assizes would come at once and get him condemned out of the way what a blessed thing it would be but unluckily it still wanted three months to the assizes and during those three months mr crawley would be at large and subject only to episcopal authority during that time he could not be silenced by the arm of the civil law his wife was not long in expressing her opinion after mr crawley had left the palace you must proceed against him in the court of archesand that at once said mrs proudie you can do that of course i know that it will be expensive of course it will be expensive i suppose it may cost us some hundreds of pounds but duty is duty my lord and in such a case as this your duty as a bishop is paramount  the poor bishop knew that it was useless to explain to her the various mistakes which she madewhich she was ever makingas to the extent of his powers and the modes of procedure which were open to him when he would do so she would only rail at him for being lukewarm in his office poor in spirit and afraid of dealing roundly with those below him on the present occasion he did say a word but she would not even hear him to the end dont tell me about rural deans as if i didnt know the rural dean has nothing to do with such a case the man has been committed for trial send for mr chadwick at once and let steps be taken before you are an hour older  but my dear mr chadwick can do nothing  then i will see mr chadwick and in her anger she did sit down and write a note to mr chadwick begging him to come over to her at the palace  mr chadwick was a lawyer living in barchester who earned his bread from ecclesiastical business his father and his uncle and his grandfather and granduncles had all been concerned in the affairs of the diocese of barchester his uncle had been bailiff to the episcopal estates or steward as he had been called in bishop grantlys time and still contrived to draw his income in some shape from the property of the see the nephew had also been the legal assistant of the bishop in his latter days and had been continued in that position by bishop proudie not from love but from expediency mr john chadwick was one of those gentlemen two or three of whom are to be seen in connection with every seewho seem to be hybridshalflay halfcleric they dress like clergymen and affect that mixture of clerical solemnity and clerical waggishness which is generally to be found among minor canons and vicar chorals of a cathedral they live or at least have their offices half in the close and half out of itdwelling as it were just on the borders of holy orders they always wear white neckhandkerchiefs and black gloves and would be altogether clerical in their appearance were it not that as regards the outward man they impinge somewhat on the characteristics of the undertaker they savour of the church but the savour is of the churchs exterior any stranger thrown into chance contact with one of them would from instinct begin to talk of things ecclesiastical without any reference to things theological or things religious they are always most worthy men much respected in the society of the close and i never heard of one of them whose wife was not comfortable or whose children were left without provision  such a one was mr john chadwick and as it was a portion of his duties to accompany the bishop to consecrations and ordinations he knew dr proudie very well having been brought up as it were under the very wing of bishop grantly it could not well be that he should love bishop grantlys successor the old bishop and the new bishop had been so different that no man could like or even esteem them both but mr chadwick was a prudent man who knew well the source from which he earned his bread and he had never quarrelled with bishop proudie he knew mrs proudie alsoof necessityand when i say of him that he had hitherto avoided any open quarrel with her it will i think be allowed that he was a man of prudence and sagacity  but he had sometimes been sorely tried and he felt when he got her note that he was now about to encounter a very sore trial he muttered something which might have been taken for an oath were it not that the outward signs of the man gave warranty that no oath could proceed from such a one then he wrote a short note presenting his compliments to mrs proudie and saying that he would call at the palace at eleven oclock on the following morning  but in the meantime mrs proudie who could not be silent on the subject for a moment did learn something of the truth from her husband the information did not come to her in the way of instruction but was teased out of the unfortunate man i know that you can proceed against him in the court of arches under the church discipline act she said  no my dear no said the bishop shaking his head in his misery  or in the consistorial court its all the same thing  there must be an inquiry firstby his brother clergy there must indeed its the only way of proceeding  but there has been an inquiry and he has been committed  that doesnt signify my dear thats the civil law  and if the civil law condemns him and locks him up in prisonas it most certainly will do  but it hasnt done so yet my dear i really think that as it has gone so far it will be best to leave it as it is till he has taken his trial  what leave him there after what occurred this morning in this palace the palace with mrs proudie was always a palace and never a house no no ten thousand times no are you not aware that he insulted you and grossly most grossly insulted me i was never treated with such insolence by any clergyman before since i first came to this palacenever never and we know the man to be a thiefwe absolutely know it think my lord of the souls of his people  oh dear oh dear oh dear said the bishop  why do you fret yourself in that way  because you will get me into trouble i tell you the only thing to be done is to issue a commission with the rural dean at the head of it  then issue a commission  and they will take three months  why should they take three months why should they take more than three daysor three hours it is all plain sailing  these things are never plain sailing my dear when a bishop has to oppose any of his clergy it is always made as difficult as possible  more shame for them who make it so  but it is so if i were to take legal proceedings against him it would costoh dearmore than a thousand pounds i should say  if it costs two you must do it mrs proudies anger was still very hot or she would not have spoken of an unremunerative outlay of money in such language as that  in this manner she did come to understand before the arrival of mr chadwick that her husband could take no legal steps towards silencing mr crawley until a commission of clergymen had been appointed to inquire into the matter and that that commission should be headed by the rural dean within the limits of whose rural deanery the parish of hogglestock was situated or by some beneficed parochial clergyman of repute in the neighbourhood now the rural dean was dr tempest of silverbridgewho had held that position before the coming of dr proudie to the diocese and there had grown up in the bosom of mrs proudie a strong feeling that undue mercy had been shown to mr crawley by the magistrates of silverbridge of whom dr tempest had been one these magistrates had taken bail for his appearance at the assizes instead of committing him to prison at onceas they were bound to do when such an offence as that had been committed by a clergyman but noeven though there was a clergyman among them they had thought nothing of the souls of the poor people in such language mrs proudie had spoken of the affair at silverbridge and having once committed herself to such an opinion of course she thought that dr tempest would go through fire and waterwould omit no stretch of what little judicial power might be committed to his handswith the view of opposing his bishop and maintaining the culprit in his position in such a case as this can not you name an acting rural dean yourself dr tempest you know is very old no my dear no i cannot you can ask mr chadwick at any rate and then you could name mr thumble but mr thumble doesnt even hold a living in the diocese oh dear oh dear oh dear and so the matter rested until mr chadwick came  mrs proudie had no doubt intended to have mr chadwick all to herselfat any rate so to encounter him in the first instance but having been at length convinced that the inquiry by the rural dean was really necessary as a preliminary and having also slept upon the question of expenditure she gave directions that the lawyer should be shown into the bishops study and she took care to be absent at the moment of his arrival of course she did not intend that mr chadwick should leave the palace without having heard what she had to say but she thought that it would be well that he should be made to conceive that though the summons had been written by her it had really been intended on the part of the bishop mr chadwick will be with you at eleven bishop she said as she got up from the breakfasttable at which she left his lordship with two of his daughters and with a married soninlaw a clergyman who was staying in the house very well my dear said the bishop with a smilefor he was anxious not to betray any vexation at his wifes interference before his daughters or the rev mr tickler but he understood it all mr chadwick had been sent for with reference to mr crawley and he was drivenabsolutely driven to propose to his lawyer that this commission of inquiry should be issued  punctually at eleven mr chadwick came wearing a very long face as he entered the palace doorfor he felt that he would in all probability be now compelled to quarrel with mrs proudie much he could bear but there was a limit to his endurance she had never absolutely sent for him before though she had often interfered with him i shall have to tell her a bit of my mind he said as he stepped across the close habited in his best suit of black with most exact white cravat and yet looking not quite like a clergymanwith some touch of the undertaker in his gait when he found that he was shown into the bishops room and that the bishop was thereand the bishop onlyhis mind was relieved it would have been better that the bishop should have written himself or that the chaplain should have written in his lordships name that however was a trifle  but the bishop did not know what to say to him if he intended to direct an inquiry to be made by the rural dean it would be by no means becoming that he should consult mr chadwick as to doing so it might be well or if not well at any rate not improper that he should make the application to dr tempest through mr chadwick but in that case he must give the order at once and he still wished to avoid it if it were possible since he had been in the diocese no case so grave as this had been pushed upon him the intervention of the rural dean in an ordinary way he had usedhad been made to usemore than once by his wife a vicar had been absent a little too long from one parish and there had been rumours about brandyandwater in another once he had been very nearly in deep water because mrs proudie had taken it in dudgeon that a certain young rector who had been left a widower had a very pretty governess for his children and there had been that case sadly notorious in the diocese at the time of our excellent friend mr robarts of framley when the bailiffs were in his house because he couldnt pay his debtsor rather the debts of his friend for whom he had signed bills but in all these cases some good fortune had intervened and he had been saved from the terrible necessity of any ulterior process but nownow he was being driven beyond himself and all to no purpose if mrs proudie would only wait three months the civil law would do it all for him but here was mr chadwick in the room and he knew that it would be useless for him to attempt to talk to mr chadwick about other matters and so dismiss him the wife of his bosom would be down upon them before chadwick could be out of the room  hmha how dye do mr chadwickwont you sit down mr chadwick thanked his lordship and sat down its very cold isnt it mr chadwick  a hard frost my lord but a beautiful day  wont you come near the fire the bishop knew that mrs proudie was on the road and had an eye to the proper strategical position of his forces mrs proudie would certainly take up her position in a certain chair from whence the light enabled her to rake her husband thoroughly what advantage she might have from this he could not preventbut he could so place mr chadwick that the lawyer should be more within the reach of his eye than that of his wife so the bishop pointed to an armchair opposite to himself and near the fire and mr chadwick seated himself accordingly  this is a very sad affair about mr crawley said the bishop  very sad indeed said the lawyer i never pitied a man so much in my life my lord  this was not exactly the line which the bishop was desirous of taking of course he is to be pitiedof course he is but from all i hear mr chadwick i am afraidi am afraid we must not acquit him  as to that my lord he has to stand his trial of course  but you see mr chadwick regarding him as a beneficed clergymanwith a cure of soulsthe question is whether i should be justified in leaving him where he is till his trial shall come on  of course your lordship knows best about that but  i know there is a difficulty i know that but i am inclined to think that in the interests of the parish i am bound to issue a commission of inquiry  i believe your lordship has attempted to silence him and that he has refused to comply  i thought it better for everybodys sakeespecially for his own that he should for a while be relieved from his duties but he is an obstinate man a very obstinate man i made the attempt with all consideration for his feelings  he is hard put to it my lord i know the man and his pride the dean has spoken of him to me more than once and nobody knows him so well as the dean if i might venture to offer an opinion  good morning mr chadwick said mrs proudie coming into the room and taking her accustomed seat no thank you no i will stay away from the fire if you please his lordship has spoken to you no doubt about this unfortunate wretched man  we are speaking of him now my dear  something must of course be done to put a stop to the crying disgrace of having such a man preaching from a pulpit in this diocese when i think of the souls of the people in that poor village my hair literally stands on end and then he is disobedient  that is the worst of it said the bishop it would have been so much better for himself if he would have allowed me to provide quietly for the services till the trial be over  i could have told you my lord that he would not do that from what i knew of him said mr chadwick  but he must do it said mrs proudie he must be made to do it  his lordship will find it difficult said mr chadwick  i can issue a commission you know to the rural dean said the bishop mildly  yes you can do that and dr tempest in two months time will have named his assessors  dr tempest must not name them the bishop must name them said mrs proudie  it is customary to leave that to the rural dean said mr chadwick the bishop no doubt can object to any one named  and can specially select any clergyman he pleases from the archdeaconry said the bishop i have known it done  the rural dean in such case has probably been an old man and not active said the lawyer  and dr tempest is a very old man said mrs proudie and in such a matter not at all trustworthy he was one of the magistrates who took bail  his lordship could hardly set him aside said the lawyer at any rate i would not recommend him to try i think you might suggest a commission of five and propose two of the number yourself i do not think that in such a case dr tempest would raise any question  at last it was settled in this way mr chadwick was to prepare a letter to dr tempest for the bishops signature in which the doctor should be requested as the rural dean to whom mr crawley was subject to hold a commission of five to inquire into mr crawleys conduct the letter was to explain to dr tempest that the bishop moved by his solicitude for the souls of the people of hogglestock had endeavoured in a friendly way to induce mr crawley to desist from his ministrations but that having failed through mr crawleys obstinacy he had no alternative but to proceed in this way you had better say that his lordship as bishop of the diocese can take no heed of the coming trial said mrs proudie i think his lordship had better say nothing at all about the trial said mr chadwick i think that will be best said the bishop  but if they report against him said mr chadwick you can only then proceed in the ecclesiastical courtat your own expense  hell hardly be so obstinate as that said the bishop  im afraid you dont know him my lord said the lawyer the bishop thinking of the scene which had taken place in that very room only yesterday felt that he did know mr crawley and felt also that the hope which he had just expressed was one in which he himself put no trust but something might turn up and it was devoutly to be hoped that dr tempest would take a long time over his inquiry the assizes might come on as soon as it was terminated or very shortly afterwards and then everything might be well you wont find dr tempest very ready at it said mr chadwick the bishop in his heart was comforted by the words but he must be made to be ready to do his duty said mrs proudie imperiously mr chadwick shrugged his shoulders then got up spoke his farewell little speeches and left the palace     chapter xxxv  lily dale writes two words in her book   john eames saw nothing more of lily dale till he packed up his portmanteau left his mothers house and went to stay for a few days with his old friend lady julia and this did not happen till he had been above a week at guestwick mrs dale repeatedly said that it was odd that johnny did not come to see them and grace speaking of him to lily asked why he did not come lily in her funny way declared that he would come soon enough but even while she was joking there was something of halfexpressed consciousness in her wordsas though she felt it to be foolish to speak of his coming as she might of that of any other young man before people who knew her whole story hell come quick enough he knows and i know that his coming will do no good of course i shall be glad to see him why shouldnt i be glad to see him ive known him and liked him all my life i liked him when there did not seem to be much about him to like and now that he is clever and agreeable and goodlookingwhich he never was as a ladwhy shouldnt i go on liking him hes more like a brother to me than anybody else ive got jamesjames was her brotherinlaw dr croftsthinks of nothing but his patients and his babies and my cousin bernard is much too grand a person for me to take the liberty of loving him i shall be very glad to see johnny eames from all which mrs dale was led to believe that johnnys case was still hopeless and how should it not be hopeless had lily not confessed within the last week or two that she still loved adolphus crosbie  mrs eames also and mary were surprised that john did not go over to allington you havent seen mrs dale yet or the squire said his mother  i shall see them when i am at the cottage  yesno doubt but it seems strange that you should be here so long without going to them  theres time enough said he i shall have nothing else to do when im at the cottage then when mary had spoken to him again in private expressing a hope that there was nothing wrong he had been very angry with his sister what do you mean by wrong what rubbish you girls talk and you never have any delicacy of feeling to make you silent  oh john dont say such hard things as that of me  but i do say them youll make me swear among you some day that i will never see lily dale again as it is i wish i never had seen hersimply because i am so dunned about it in all of which i think that johnny was manifestly wrong when the humour was on him he was fond enough of talking about lily dale had he not taught her to do so i doubt whether his sister would ever have mentioned lilys name to him i did not mean to dun you john said mary meekly  but at last he went to lady julias and was no sooner there than he was ready to start for allington when lady julia spoke to him about lily he did not venture to snub her indeed of all his friends lady julia was the one with whom on this subject he allowed himself the most unrestricted confidence he came over one day just before dinner and declared his intention of walking over to allington immediately after breakfast on the following morning its the last time lady julia he said  so you say johnny  and so i mean it whats the good of a man frittering away his life whats the good of wishing for what you cant get  jacob was not in such a hurry when he wished for rachel  that was all very well for an old patriarch who had seven or eight hundred years to live  my dear john you forget your bible jacob did not live half as long as that  he lived long enough and slowly enough to be able to wait fourteen yearsand then he had something to comfort him in the meantime and after all lady julia its more than seven years since i first thought lily was the prettiest girl i ever saw  how old are you now  twentysevenand shes twentyfour  youve time enough yet if youll only be patient  ill be patient for tomorrow lady julia but never again not that i mean to quarrel with her im not such a fool as to quarrel with a girl because she cant like me i know how it all is if that scoundrel had not come across my path just when he didin that very nick of time all might have been right betwixt her and me i couldnt have offered to marry her before when i hadnt as much income as would have found her in breadandbutter and then just as better times came to me he stepped in i wonder whether it will be expected of me that i should forgive him  as far as that goes you have no right to be angry with him  but i amall the same  and so was ibut not for stepping in as you call it  you and i are different lady julia i was angry with him for stepping in but i couldnt show it then he stepped out and i did manage to show it and now i shouldnt wonder if he doesnt step in again after all why should he have such a power it was simply the nick of time which gave it to him that john eames should be able to find some consolation in this consideration is devoutly to be hoped by us all  there was nothing said about lily dale the next morning at breakfast lady julia observed that john was dressed a little more neatly than usualthough the change was not such as to have called for her special observation had she not known the business on which he was intent  you have nothing to send to the dales he said as he got up from the table  nothing but my love johnny  no worsted or embroidery workor a pot of special jam for the squire  no sir nothing though i should like to make you carry a pair of panniers if i could  they would become me well said johnny for i am going on an asss errand then without waiting for the word of affection which was on the old womans lips he got himself out of the room and started on his journey  the walk was only three miles and the weather was dry and frosty and he had come to the turn leading up to the church and the squires house almost before he remembered that he was near allington here he paused for a moment to think if he continued his way down by the red lion and through allington street he must knock at mrs dales door and ask for admission by means of the servantas would be done by any ordinary visitor but he could make his way on to the lawn by going up beyond the wall of the churchyard and through the squires garden he knew the path wellvery well and he thought that he might take so much liberty as that both with the squire and with mrs dale although his visits to allington were not so frequent now as they used to be in the days of his boyhood he did not wish to be admitted by the servant and therefore he went through the gardens luckily he did not see the squire who would have detained him and he escaped from hopkins the old gardener with little more than a word im going down to see the ladies hopkins i suppose i shall find them and then while hopkins was arranging his spade so that he might lean upon it for a little chat johnny was gone and had made his way into the other garden he had thought it possible that he might meet lily out among the walks by herself and such a meeting as this would have suited him better than any other and as he crossed the little bridge which separated the gardens he thought of more than one such meetingof one especial occasion on which he had first ventured to tell her in plain words that he loved her but before that day crosbie had come there and at the moment in which he was speaking of his love she regarded crosbie as an angel of light upon the earth what hope could there have been for him then what use was there in his telling such a tale of love at that time when he told it he knew that crosbie had been before him he knew that crosbie was at that moment the angel of light but as he had never before been able to speak of his love so was he then unable not to speak of it he had spoken and of course had been simply rebuked since that day crosbie had ceased to be an angel of light and he john eames had spoken often but he had spoken in vain and now he would speak once again  he went through the garden and over the lawn belonging to the small house and saw no one he forgot i think that ladies do not come out to pick roses when the ground is frozen and that croquet is not often in progress with the hoarfrost on the grass so he walked up to the little terrace before the drawingroom and looking in saw mrs dale and lily and grace at their morning work lily was drawing and mrs dale was writing and grace had her needle in her hand as it happened no one at first perceived him and he had time to feel that after all he would have managed better if he had been announced in the usual way as however it was now necessary that he should announce himself he knocked at the window and they all immediately looked up and saw him its my cousin john said grace oh johnny how are you at last said mrs dale but it was lily who without speaking opened the window for him who was the first to give him her hand and who led him through into the room  its a great shame my coming in this way said john and letting all the cold air in upon you  we shall survive it said mrs dale i suppose you have just come down from my brotherinlaw  no i have not seen the squire as yet i will do so before i go back of course but it seemed such a commonplace sort of thing to go round by the village  we are very glad to see you by whatever way you comeare we not mamma said lily  im not so sure of that we were only saying yesterday that as you had been in the country a fortnight without coming to us we did not think we would be at home when you did come  but i have caught you you see said johnny  and so they went on chatting of old times and of mutual friends very comfortably for full an hour and there was some serious conversation about graces father and his affairs and john declared his opinion that mr crawley ought to go to his uncle thomas toogood not at all knowing at that time that mr crawley himself had come to the same opinion and john gave them an elaborate description of sir raffle buffle standing up with his back to the fire with his hat on his head and speaking with a loud harsh voice to show them the way in which he declared that that gentleman received his inferiors and then bowing and scraping and rubbing his hands together and simpering with wouldbe softnessdeclaring that after that fashion sir raffle received his superiors and they were very merryso that no one would have thought that johnny was a despondent lover now bent on throwing the dice for his last stake or that lily was aware that she was in the presence of one lover and that she was like to fall to the ground between two stoolshaving two lovers neither of whom could serve her turn  how can you consent to serve him if hes such a man as that said lily speaking of sir raffle  i do not serve him i serve the queenor rather the public i dont take his wages and he does not play his tricks with me he knows that he cant he has tried it and has failed and he only keeps me where i am because ive had some money left me he thinks it fine to have a private secretary with a fortune i know that he tells people all manner of lies about it making it out to be five times as much as it is dear old huffle snuffle he is such an ass and yet hes had wit enough to get to the top of the tree and to keep himself there he began the world without a penny now he has got a handle to his name and hell live in clover all his life its very odd isnt it mrs dale  i suppose he does his work  when men get so high as that theres no knowing whether they work or whether they dont there isnt much for them to do as far as i can see they have to look beautiful and frighten the young ones  and does sir raffle look beautiful lily asked  after a fashion he does there is something imposing about such a man till youre used to it and can see through it of course its all padding there are men who work no doubt but among the bigwigs and bishops and cabinet ministers i fancy that the looking beautiful is the chief part of it dear me you dont mean to say its luncheon time  but it was luncheon time and not only had he not as yet said a word of all that which he had come to say but had not as yet made any move towards getting it said how was he to arrange that lily should be left alone with him lady julia had said that she should not expect him back till dinnertime and he had answered her lackadaisically i dont suppose i shall be there above ten minutes ten minutes will say all ive got to say and do all ive got to do and then i suppose i shall go and cut names about upon bridgeseh lady julia lady julia understood his words for once upon a former occasion she had found him cutting lilys name on the rail of a wooden bridge in her brothers grounds but he had now been a couple of hours at the small house and had not said a word of that which he had come to say  are you going to walk out with us after lunch said lily  he will have had walking enough said mrs dale  well convoy him back part of the way said lily  im not going yet said johnny unless you turn me out  but we must have our walk before it is dark said lily  you might go up with him to your uncle said mrs dale indeed i promised to go up myself and so did you grace to see the microscope i heard mr dale give orders that one of those longlegged reptiles should be caught on purpose for your inspection  mrs dales little scheme for bringing the two together was very transparent but it was not the less wise on that account schemes will often be successful let them be ever so transparent little intrigues become necessary not to conquer unwilling people but people who are willing enough who nevertheless cannot give way except under the machinations of an intrigue  i dont think ill mind looking at the longlegged creature today said johnny  i must go of course said grace  lily said nothing at the moment either about the longlegged creature or the walk that which must be must be she knew well why john eames had come there she knew that the visits to his mother and to lady julia would never have been made but that he might have this interview and he had a right to demand at any rate as much as that that which must be must be and therefore when both mrs dale and grace stoutly maintained their purpose of going up to the squire lily neither attempted to persuade john to accompany them nor said that she would do so herself  i will convoy you home myself she said and grace when she has done with the beetle shall come and meet me wont you grace  certainly  we are not helpless young ladies in these parts nor yet timorous continued lily we can walk about without being afraid of ghosts robbers wild bulls young men or gipsies come the field path grace i will go as far as the big oak with him and then i shall turn back and i shall come in by the stile opposite the church gate and through the garden so you cant miss me  i daresay hell come back with you said grace  no he wont he will do nothing of the kind hell have to go on and open lady julias bottle of port wine for his own drinking  all this was very good on lilys part and very good also on the part of mrs dale and john was of course very much obliged to them but there was a lack of romance in it all which did not seem to him to argue well as to his success he did not think much about it but he felt that lily would not have been so ready to arrange their walk had she intended to yield to his entreaty no doubt in these latter days plain good sense had become the prevailing mark of her characterperhaps as johnny thought a little too strongly prevailing but even with all her plain good sense and determination to dispense with the absurdities of romance in the affairs of her life she would not have proposed herself as his companion for a walk across the fields merely that she might have an opportunity of accepting his hand he did not say all this to himself but he instinctively felt that it was so and he felt also that it should have been his duty to arrange the walk or the proper opportunity for the scene that was to come she had done it insteadshe and her mother between them thereby forcing upon him a painful conviction that he himself had not been equal to the occasion i always make a mull of it he said to himself when the girls went up to get their hats  they went down together through the garden and parted where the paths led away one to the great house and the other towards the church ill certainly come and call upon the squire before i go back to london said johnny  well tell him so said mrs dale he would be sure to hear that you had been with us even if we said nothing about it  of course he would said lily hopkins has seen him then they separated and lily and john eames were together  hardly a word was said perhaps not a word till they had crossed the road and got into the field opposite to the church and in this first field there was more than one path and the children of the village were often there and it had about it something of a public nature john eames felt that it was by no means a fitting field to say that which he had to say in crossing it therefore he merely remarked that the day was very fine for walking then he added one special word and it is so good of you lily to come with me  i am very glad to come with you i would do more than that john to show how glad i am to see you then they had come to the second little gate and beyond that the fields were really fields and there were stiles instead of wicketgates and the business of the day must be begun  lily whenever i come here you say you are glad to see me  and so i amvery glad only you would take it as meaning what it does not mean i would tell you that of all my friends living away from the reach of my daily life you are the one whose coming is ever the most pleasant to me  oh lily  it was i think only yesterday that i was telling grace that you are more like a brother to me than any one else i wish it might be so i wish we might swear to be brother and sister id do more for you then than walk across the fields with you to guestwick cottage your prosperity would then be the thing in the world for which i should be most anxious and if you should marry  illustration lily wishes that they might swear to be brother and sister  it can never be like that between us said johnny  can it not i think it can perhaps not this year or next year perhaps not in the next five years but i make myself happy with thinking that it may be so some day i shall wait for it patiently very patiently even though you should rebuff me again and againas you have done now  i have not rebuffed you  not maliciously or injuriously or offensively i will be very patient and take little rebuffs without complaining this is the worst stile of all when grace and i are here together we can never manage it without tearing ourselves all to pieces it is much nicer to have you to help me  let me help you always he said keeping her hands in his after he had aided her to jump from the stile to the ground  yes as my brother  that is nonsense lily  is it nonsense nonsense is a hard word  it is nonsense as coming from you to me lily i sometimes think that i am persecuting you writing to you coming after you as i am doing nowtelling the same whining storyasking asking and asking for that which you say you will never give me and then i feel ashamed of myself and swear that i will do it no more  do not be ashamed of yourself but yet do it no more  and then he continued without minding her words at other times i feel that it must be my own fault that if i only persevered with sufficient energy i must be successful at such times i swear that i will never give it up  oh john if you could only know how little worthy of such pursuit it is  leave me to judge of that dear when a man has taken a month or perhaps only a week or perhaps not more than half an hour to make up his mind it may be very well to tell him that he doesnt know what he is about ive been in the office now for over seven years and the first day i went i put an oath into a book that i would come back and get you for my wife when i had got enough to live upon  did you john  yes i can show it you i used to come and hover about the place in the old days before i went to london when i was such a fool that i couldnt speak to you if i met you i am speaking of a time long beforebefore that man came down here  do not speak of him johnny  i must speak of him a man isnt to hold his tongue when everything he has in the world is at stake i suppose he loved you after a fashion once  pray pray do not speak ill of him  i am not going to abuse him you can judge of him by his deeds i cannot say anything worse of him than what they say i suppose he loved you but he certainly did not love you as i have done i have at any rate been true to you yes lily i have been true to you i am true to you he did not know what he was about i do i am justified in saying that i do i want you to be my wife it is no use your talking about it as though i only half wanted it  i did not say that  is not a man to have any reward of course if you had married him there would have been an end of it he had come in between me and my happiness and i must have borne it as other men bear such sorrows but you have not married him and of course i cannot but feel that i may yet have a chance lily answer me this do you believe that i love you but she did not answer him you can at any rate tell me that do you think that i am in earnest  yes i think you are in earnest  and do you believe that i love you with all my heart and all my strength and all my soul  oh john  but do you  i think you love me  think what am i to say or to do to make you understand that my only idea of happiness is the idea that sooner or later i may get you to be my wife lily will you say that it shall be so speak lily there is no one that will not be glad your uncle will consenthas consented your mother wishes it bell wishes it my mother wishes it lady julia wishes it you would be doing what everybody about you wants you to do and why should you not do it it isnt that you dislike me you wouldnt talk about being my sister if you had not some sort of regard for me  i have a regard for you  then why will you not be my wife oh lily say the word now here at once say the word and youll make me the happiest fellow in all england as he spoke he took her by both arms and held her fast she did not struggle to get away from him but stood quite still looking into his face while the first sparkle of a salt tear formed itself in each eye lily one little word will do ithalf a word a nod a smile just touch my arm with your hand and i will take it for a yes i think that she almost tried to touch him that the word was in her throat and that she almost strove to speak it but there was no syllable spoken and her fingers did not loose themselves to fall upon his sleeve lily lily what can i say to you  i wish i could she whisperedbut the whisper was so hoarse that he hardly recognized the voice  and why can you not what is there to hinder you there is nothing to hinder you lily  yes john there is that which must hinder me  and what is it  i will tell you you are so good and so true and so excellentsuch a dear dear dear friend that i will tell you everything so that you may read my heart i will tell you as i tell mammayou and her and no one elsefor you are the choice friend of my heart i cannot be your wife because of the love i bear for another man  and that man is hehe who came here  of course it is he i think johnny you and i are alike in this that when we have loved we cannot bring ourselves to change you will not change though it would be so much better you should do so  no i will never change  nor can i when i sleep i dream of him when i am alone i cannot banish him from my thoughts i cannot define what it is to love him i want nothing from himnothing nothing but i move about through my little world thinking of him and i shall do so to the end i used to feel proud of my love though it made me so wretched that i thought it would kill me i am not proud of it any longer it is a foolish poorspirited weaknessas though my heart had been only half formed in the making do you be stronger john a man should be stronger than a woman  i have none of that sort of strength  nor have i what can we do but pity each other and swear that we will be friendsdear friends there is the oaktree and i have got to turn back we have said everything that we can sayunless you will tell me that you will be my brother  no i will not tell you that  goodby then johnny  he paused holding her by the hand and thinking of another question which he longed to put to herconsidering whether he would ask her that question or not he hardly knew whether he were entitled to ask itwhether or no the asking of it would be ungenerous she had said that she would tell him everythingas she had told everything to her mother of course he said i have no right to expect to know anything of your future intentions  you may know them allas far as i know them myself i have said that you should read my heart  if this man whose name i cannot bear to mention should come again  if he were to come again he would come in vain john she did not say that he had come again she could tell her own secret but not that of another person  you would not marry him now that he is free  she stood and thought a while before she answered him no i should not marry him now i think not then she paused again nay i am sure i would not after what has passed i could not trust myself to do it there is my hand on it i will not  no lily i do not want that  but i insist i will not marry mr crosbie but you must not misunderstand me john thereall that is over for me now all those dreams about love and marriage and of a house of my own and childrenand a cross husband and a weddingring growing always tighter as i grow fatter and older i have dreamed of such things as other girls domore perhaps than other girls more than i should have done and now i accept the thing as finished you wrote something in your book you dear johnsomething that could not be made to come true dear john i wish for your sake it was otherwise i will go home and i will write in my book this very day lilian dale old maid if ever i make that false do you come and ask me for the page  let it remain there till i am allowed to tear it out  i will write it and it shall never be torn out you i cannot marry him i will not marry you may believe me johnny when i say there can never be a third  and is that to be the end of it  yesthat is to be the end of it not the end of our friendship old maids have friends  it shall not be the end of it there shall be no end of it with me  but john  do not suppose that i will trouble you againat any rate not for a while in five years time perhaps  now johnny you are laughing at me and of course it is the best way if there is not grace and she has caught me before i have turned back goodby dear dear john god bless you i think you the finest fellow there is in the world i do and so does mamma remember always that there is a temple at allington in which your worship is never forgotten then she pressed his hand and turned away from him to meet grace crawley john did not stop to speak a word to his cousin but pursued his way alone  that cousin of yours said lily is simply the dearest warmesthearted finest creature that ever was seen in the shape of a man  have you told him that you think him so said grace  indeed i have said lily  but have you told this finest warmest dearest creature that he shall be rewarded with the prize he covets  no grace i have told him nothing of the kind i think he understands it all now if he does not it is not for the want of my telling him i dont suppose any lady was ever more openspoken to a gentleman than i have been to him  and why have you sent him away disappointed you know you love him  you see my dear said lily you allow yourself for the sake of your argument to use a word in a double sense and you attempt to confound me by doing so but i am a great deal too clever for you and have thought too much about it to be taken in in that way i certainly love your cousin john and so i do love mr boyce the vicar  you love johnny much better than you do mr boyce  true very much better but it is the same sort of love however it is a great deal too deep for you to understand youre too young and i shant try to explain it but the long and the short of it isi am not going to marry your cousin  i wish you were said grace with all my heart  john eames as he returned to the cottage was by no means able to fall back upon those resolutions as to his future life which he had formed for himself and communicated to his friend dalrymple and which he had intended to bring at once into force in the event of his being again rejected by lily dale i will cleanse my mind of it altogether he had said and though i may not forget her i will live as though she were forgotten if she declines my proposal again i will accept her word as final i will not go about the world any longer as a stricken deerto be pitied or else bullied by the rest of the herd on his way down to guestwick he had sworn twenty times that it should be so he would make one more effort and then he would give it up but now after his interview with lily he was as little disposed to give it up as ever  he sat upon a gate in a paddock through which there was a back entrance into lady julias garden and there swore a thousand oaths that he would never give her up he was at any rate sure that she would never become the wife of any one else he was equally sure that he would never become the husband of any other wife he could trust her yes he was sure of that but could he trust himself communing with himself he told himself that after all he was but a poor creature circumstances had been very good to him but he had done nothing for himself he was vain and foolish and unsteady so he told himself while sitting upon the gate but he had at any rate been constant to lily and constant he would remain  he would never more mention her name to any oneunless it were to lady julia tonight to dalrymple he would not open his mouth about her but would plainly ask his friend to be silent on that subject if her name should be mentioned by him but morning and evening he would pray for her and in his prayers he would always think of her as his wife he would never speak to another girl without remembering that he was bound to lily he would go nowhere into society without recalling to mind the fact that he was bound by the chains of a solemn engagement if he knew himself he would be constant to lily  and then he considered in what manner it would be best and most becoming that he should still prosecute his endeavour and repeat his offer he thought that he would write to her every year on the same day of the year year after year it might be for the next twenty years and his letters should be very simple sitting there on the gate he planned the wording of his lettersof his first letter and of his second and of his third they should be very like to each othershould hardly be more than a repetition of the same words if now you are ready for me then lily am i as ever still ready for you and then if now again and again if nowand still if now when his hair should be grey and the wrinkles on his cheeksay though they should be on hers he would still continue to tell her from year to year that he was ready to take her surely some day that if now would prevail and should it never prevail the merit of his constancy should be its own reward  such letters as those she would surely keep then he looked forward down into the valley of coming years and fancied her as she might sit reading them in the twilight of some long eveningletters which had been written all in vain he thought that he could look forward with some satisfaction towards the close of his own career in having been the hero of such a lovestory at any rate if such a story were to be his story the melancholy attached to it should arise from no fault of his own he would still press her to be his wife and then as he remembered that he was only twentyseven and that she was twentyfour he began to marvel at the feeling of grey old age which had come upon him and tried to make himself believe that he would have her yet before the bloom was off her cheek  he went into the cottage and made his way at once into the room in which lady julia was sitting she did not speak at first but looked anxiously into his face and he did not speak but turned to a table near the window and took up a bookthough the room was too dark for him to see to read the words john at last said lady julia  well my lady  have you nothing to tell me john  nothing on earthexcept the same old story which has now become a matter of course  but john will you not tell me what she has said  lady julia she has said no simply no it is a very easy word to say and she has said it so often that it seems to come from her quite naturally then he got a candle and sat down over the fire with a volume of a novel it was not yet past five and lady julia did not go upstairs to dress till six and therefore there was an hour during which they were together john had at first been rather grand to his old friend and very uncommunicative but before the dressing bell had rung he had been coaxed into a confidential strain and had told everything i suppose it is wrong and selfish he said i suppose i am a dog in a manger but i do own that there is a consolation to me in the assurance that she will never be the wife of that scoundrel  i could never forgive her if she were to marry him now said lady julia  i could never forgive him but she has said that she will not and i know that she will not forswear herself i shall go on with it lady julia i have made up my mind to that i suppose it will never come to anything but i shall stick to it i can live an old bachelor as well as another man at any rate i shall stick to it then the good silly old woman comforted him and applauded him as though he were a hero among men and did reward him as lily had predicted by one of those now rare bottles of superexcellent port which had come to her from her brothers cellar  john eames stayed out his time at the cottage and went over more than once again to allington and called on the squire on one occasion dining with him and meeting the three ladies from the small house and he walked with the girls comporting himself like any ordinary man but he was not again alone with lily dale nor did he learn whether she had in truth written those two words in her book but the reader may know that she did write them there on the evening of the day on which the promise was made lilian daleold maid  and when johns holiday was over he returned to his duties at the elbow of sir raffle buffle     chapter xxxvi  grace crawley returns home   illustration  about this time grace crawley received two letters the first of them reaching her while john eames was still at the cottage and the other immediately after his return to london they both help to tell our story and our reader shall therefore read them if he so pleaseor rather he shall read the first and as much of the second as is necessary for him graces answer to the first letter he shall see also her answer to the second will be told in a very few words the first was from major grantly and the task of answering that was by no means easy to grace      cosby lodge  february 186     dearest grace     i told you when i parted from you that i should write    to you and i think it best to do so at once in order    that you may fully understand me spoken words are soon    forgotten  i shall never forget his words grace said to herself as she read this     and are not always as plain as they might be dear grace    i suppose i ought not to say so but i fancied when i    parted from you at allington that i had succeeded in    making myself dear to you i believe you to be so true in    spirit that you were unable to conceal from me the fact    that you love me i shall believe that this is so till i    am deliberately and solemnly assured by yourself that it    is not soand i conjure you to think what is due both to    yourself and to myself before you allow yourself to think    of making such an assurance unless it be strictly true     i have already told my own friends that i have asked you    to be my wife i tell you this in order that you may    know how little effect your answer to me has had towards    inducing me to give you up what you said about your    father and your family has no weight with me and ought    ultimately to have none with you this business of your    fathers is a great misfortuneso great that probably    had we not known each other before it happened it might    have prevented our becoming intimate when we chanced to    meet but we had met before it happened and before it    happened i had determined to ask you to be my wife what    should i have to think of myself if i allowed my heart to    be altered by such a cause as that     i have only further to say that i love you better than any    one in the world and that it is my best hope that you    will be my wife i will not press you till this affair of    your fathers has been settled but when that is over i    shall look for my reward without reference to its result    not that i doubt the result if there be anything like    justice in england but that your debt to me if you owe    me any debt will be altogether irrespective of that if    as i suppose you will remain at allington for some time    longer i shall not see you till after the trial is over    as soon as that is done i will come to you wherever you    are in the meantime i shall look for an answer to this    and if it be true that you love me dear dear grace pray    have the courage to tell me so     most affectionately your own     henry grantly   when the letter was given to grace across the breakfasttable both mrs dale and lily suspected that it came from major grantly but not a word was spoken about it when grace with hesitating hand broke the envelope neither of her friends looked at her lily had a letter of her own and mrs dale opened the newspaper but still it was impossible not to perceive that her face became red with blushes and then they knew that the letter must be from major grantly grace herself could not read it though her eye ran down over the two pages catching a word here and a word there she had looked at the name at once and had seen the manner of his signature most affectionately your own what was she to say to him twice thrice as she sat at the breakfasttable she turned the page of the letter and at each turning she read the signature and she read the beginning dearest grace more than that she did not really read till she had got the letter away with her into the seclusion of her own room  illustration she read the beginningdearest grace  not a word was said about the letter at breakfast poor grace went on eating or pretending to eat but could not bring herself to utter a word mrs dale and lily spoke of various matters which were quite indifferent to them but even with them the conversation was so difficult that grace felt it to be forced and was conscious that they were thinking about her and her lover as soon as she could make an excuse she left the room and hurrying upstairs took the letter from her pocket and read it in earnest  that was from major grantly mamma said lily  i daresay it was my dear  and what had we better do or what had we better say  nothingi should say let him fight his own battle if we interfere we may probably only make her more stubborn in clinging to her old idea  i think she will cling to it  for a time she will i daresay and it will be best that she should he himself will respect her for it afterwards thus it was agreed between them that they should say nothing to grace about the letter unless grace should first speak to them  grace read her letter over and over again it was the first loveletter she had ever hadthe first letter she had ever received from any man except her father and brotherthe first almost that had ever been written to her by any other than her own old special friends the words of it were very strange to her ear he had told her when he left her that he would write to her and therefore she had looked forward to the event which had now come but she had thought that it would be much more distantand she had tried to make herself believe that when it did come it would be very different from this letter which she now possessed he will tell me that he has altered his mind he ought to do so it is not proper that he should still think of me when we are in such disgrace but now the letter had come and she acknowledged the truth of his saying that written words were clearer in their expression than those simply spoken not that i could ever forget a syllable that he said yet as she held the letter in her hand she felt that it was a possession it was a thing at which she could look in coming years when he and she might be far aparta thing at which she could look with pride in remembering that he had thought her worthy of it  neither on that day nor on the next did she think of her answer nor on the third or the fourth with any steady thinking she knew that an answer would have to be written and she felt that the sooner it was written the easier might be the writing but she felt also that it should not be written too quickly a week should first elapse she thought and therefore a week was allowed to elapse and then the day for writing her answer came she had spoken no word about it either to mrs dale or to lily she had longed to do so but had feared even though she should speak to lily she could not be led by lilys advice her letter whatever it might be must be her own letter she would admit of no dictation she must say her own say let her say it ever so badly as to the manner of saying it lilys aid would have been invaluable but she feared that she could not secure that aid without compromising her own power of actionher own individuality and therefore she said no word about the letter either to lily or to lilys mother  on a certain morning she fixed herself at her desk to write her letter she had known that the task would be difficult but she had little known how difficult it would be on that day of her first attempt she did not get it written at all how was she to begin he had called her dearest grace and this mode of beginning seemed as easy as it was sweet it is very easy for a gentleman she said to herself because he may say just what he pleases she wrote the words dearest henry on a scrap of paper and immediately tore it into fragments as though she were ashamed of having written them she knew that she would not dare to send away a letter beginning with such words she would not even have dared to let such words in her own handwriting remain within the recesses of her own little desk dear major grantly she began at length it seemed to her to be very ugly but after much consideration she believed it to be correct on the second day the letter was written as follows      allington thursday     my dear major grantly     i do not know how i ought to answer your kind letter but    i must tell you that i am very much flattered by your    great goodness to me i cannot understand why you should    think so much of me but i suppose it is because you have    felt for all our misfortunes i will not say anything    about what might have happened if it had not been for    papas sorrow and disgrace and as far as i can help it    i will not think of it but i am sure that i ought not to    think about loving any one that is in the way you mean    while we are in such trouble at home i should not dare to    meet any of your great friends knowing that i had brought    nothing with me but disgrace and i should feel that i was    doing an injury to dear edith which would be worse to    me than anything     pray believe that i am quite in earnest about this i know    that a gentleman ought not to marry any girl to do himself    and his family an injury by it and i know that if i    were to make such a marriage i should be unhappy ever    afterwards even though i loved the man ever so dearly    with all my heart  these last words she had underscored at first but the doing so had been the unconscious expression of her own affection and had been done with no desire on her part to convey that expression to him but on reading the words she discovered their latent meaning and wrote it all again     therefore i know that it will be best that i should wish    you goodby and i do so thanking you again and again for    your goodness to me     believe me to be    yours very sincerely     grace crawley   the letter when it was written was hateful to her but she had tried her hand at it again and again and had found that she could do nothing better there was much in his letter that she had not attempted to answer he had implored her to tell him whether or no she did in truth love him of course she loved him he knew that well enough why should she answer any such question there was a way of answering it indeed which might serve her turnor rather serve his of which she was thinking more than of her own she might say that she did not love him it would be a lie and he would know that it would be a lie but still it might serve the turn she did not like the idea of writing such a lie as that but nevertheless she considered the matter it would be very wicked but still if it would serve the turn might it not be well to write it but at last she reflected that after all the doing of the thing was in her own hands she could refuse to marry this man without burdening her conscience with any lie about it it only required that she should be firm she abstained therefore from the falsehood and left her lovers question unanswered so she put up her letter and directed it and carried it herself to the village postoffice  on the day after this she got the second letter and that she showed immediately to mrs dale it was from her mother and was written to tell her that her father was seriously ill he went up to london to see a lawyer about this weary work of the trial said mrs crawley the fatigue was very great and on the next day he was so weak that he could not leave his bed dr turner who has been very kind says that we need not frighten ourselves but he thinks it must be some time before he can leave the house he has a low fever on him and wants nourishment his mind has wandered once or twice and he has asked for you and i think it will be best love that you should come home i know you will not mind it when i say that i think he would like to have you here dr turner says that the illness is chiefly owing to his not having proper food  of course she would go at once dear mrs dale she said i must go home can you send me to the station then mrs dale read the letter of course they would send her would she go on that day or on the next might it not be better to write first and say that she was going but grace would go at once i know it will be a comfort to mamma and i know that he is worse than mamma says of course there was no more to be said and she was despatched to the station before she went mrs dale asked after her purse if there is any trouble about moneyfor your journey or anything you will not scruple to come to me as to an old friend but grace assured her that there was no trouble about moneyfor her journey then lily took her aside and produced two clean new fivepound notes grace dear you wont be illnatured you know i have a little fortune of my own you know i can give them without missing them grace threw herself into her friends arms and wept but would have none of her money buy a present from me for your motherwhom i love though i do not know her i will give her your love grace said but nothing else and then she went     chapter xxxvii  hook court   mr dobbs broughton and mr musselboro were sitting together on a certain morning at their office in the city discussing the affairs of their joint business the city office was a very poor place indeed in comparison with the fine house which mr dobbs occupied at the west end but then city offices are poor places and there are certain city occupations which seem to enjoy the greater credit the poorer are the material circumstances by which they are surrounded turning out of a lane which turns out of lombard street there is a desolate forlornlooking dark alley which is called hook court the entrance to this alley is beneath the firstfloor of one of the houses in the lane and in passing under this covered way the visitor to the place finds himself in a small paved square court at the two further corners of which there are two open doors for in hook court there are only two houses there is no 1 hook court and no 2 hook court the entire premises indicated by no 1 are occupied by a firm of wine and spirit merchants in connexion with whose trade one side and two angles of the court are always lumbered with crates hampers and wooden cases and nearly in the middle of the court though somewhat more to the winemerchants side than to the other there is always gaping open a trapdoor leading down to vaults below and over the trap there is a great board with a bright advertisement in very large letters     burton and bangles    himalaya wines    22s 6d per dozen  and this notice is so bright and so large and the trapdoor is so conspicuous in the court that no visitor even to no 2 ever afterwards can quite divest his memory of those names burton and bangles himalaya wines it may therefore be acknowledged that burton and bangles have achieved their object in putting up the notice the house no 2 small as it seems to be standing in the jamb of a corner is divided among different occupiers whose names are painted in small letters upon the very dirty posts of the doorway nothing can be more remarkable than the contrast between burton and bangles and these other city gentlemen in the method taken by them in declaring their presence to visitors in the court the names of dobbs broughton and of a musselborothe christian name of mr musselboro was augustuswere on one of those dirty posts not joined together by any visible and so as to declare boldly that they were partners but in close vicinityshowing at least that the two gentlemen would be found in apartments very near to each other and on the firstfloor of this house dobbs broughton and his friend did occupy three roomsor rather two rooms and a closetbetween them the larger and front room was tenanted by an old clerk who sat within a rail in one corner of it and there was a broad short counter which jutted out from the wall into the middle of the room intended for the use of such of the public as might come to transact miscellaneous business with dobbs broughton or augustus musselboro but any one accustomed to the look of offices might have seen with half an eye that very little business was ever done on that counter behind this large room was a smaller one belonging to dobbs broughton in the furnishing and arrangement of which some regard had been paid to comfort the room was carpeted and there was a sofa in it though a very old one and two armchairs and a mahogany officetable and a cellaret which was generally well supplied with wine which dobbs broughton did not get out of the vaults of his neighbours burton and bangles behind this again but with a separate entrance from the passage was the closet and this closet was specially devoted to the use of mr musselboro closet as it wasor cupboard as it might almost have been calledit contained a table and two chairs and it had a window of its own which opened out upon a blank wall which was distant from it not above four feet as the house to which this wall belonged was four stories high it would sometimes happen that mr musselboros cupboard was rather dark but this mattered the less as in these days mr musselboro seldom used it mr musselboro who was very constant at his place of businessmuch more constant than his friend dobbs broughtonwas generally to be found in his friends room only on some special occasions on which it was thought expedient that the commercial world should be made to understand that mr augustus musselboro had an individual existence of his own did that gentleman really seat himself in the dark closet mr dobbs broughton had he been asked what was his trade would have said that he was a stockbroker and he would have answered truly for he was a stockbroker a man may be a stockbroker though he never sells any stock as he may be a barrister though he has no practice at the bar i do not say that mr broughton never sold any stock but the buying and selling of stock for other people was certainly not his chief business and had mr musselboro been asked what was his trade he would have probably given an evasive answer at any rate in the city and among people who understood city matters he would not have said that he was a stockbroker both mr broughton and mr musselboro bought and sold a good deal but it was chiefly on account the shares which were bought and sold very generally did not pass from hand to hand but the difference in the price of the shares did do so and then they had another little business between them they lent money on interest and in this business there was a third partner whose name did not appear on the dirty doorpost that third partner was mrs van siever the mother of clara van siever whom mr conway dalrymple intended to portray as jael driving a nail into siseras head  on a certain morning mr broughton and mr musselboro were sitting together in the office which has been described they were in mr broughtons room and occupied each an armchair on the different sides of the fire mr musselboro was sitting close to the table on which a ledger was open before him and he had a pen and ink before him as though he had been at work dobbs broughton had a small bettingbook in his hand and was seated with his feet up against the side of the fireplace both men wore their hats and the aspect of the room was not the aspect of a place of business they had been silent for some minutes when broughton took his cigarcase out of his pocket and nibbled off the end of a cigar preparatory to lighting it  you had better not smoke here this morning dobbs said musselboro  why shouldnt i smoke in my own room  because shell be here just now  what do i care if you think im going to be afraid of mother van youre mistaken let come what may im not going to live under her thumb so he lighted his cigar  all right said musselboro and he took up his pen and went to work at his book  what is she coming here for this morning asked broughton  to look after her money what should she come for  she gets her interest i dont suppose theres better paid money in the city  she hasnt got what was coming to her at christmas yet  and this is february what would she have she had better put her dirty money into the three per cents if she is frightened at having to wait a week or two  can she have it today  what the whole of it of course she cant you know that as well as i do she can have four hundred pounds if she wants it but seeing all she gets out of the concern she has no right to press for it in that way she is the  old usurer i ever came across in my life  of course she likes her money  likes her money by george she does her own and anybody elses that she can get hold of for a downright leech recommend me always to a woman when a woman does go in for it she is much more thorough than any man then broughton turned over the little pages of his book and musselboro pondered over the big pages of his book and there was silence for a quarter of an hour  theres something about nine hundred and fifteen pounds due to her said musselboro  i daresay there is  it would be a very good thing to let her have it if youve got it the whole of it this morning i mean  if yes if said broughton  i know theres more than that at the bank  and im to draw out every shilling that there is ill see mother vanfurther first she can have £500 if she likes itand the rest in a fortnight or she can have my noteofhand for it all at fourteen days  she wont like that at all said musselboro  then she must lump it im not going to bother myself about her ive pretty nearly as much money in it as she has and were in a boat together if she comes here bothering youd better tell her so  youll see her yourself  not unless she comes within the next ten minutes i must go down to the court i said id be there by twelve ive got somebody i want to see  id stay if i were you  why should i stay for her if she thinks that im going to make myself her clerk shes mistaken it may be all very well for you mussy but it wont do for me im not dependent on her and i dont want to marry her daughter  it will simply end in her demanding to have her money back again  and how will she get it said dobbs broughton i havent a doubt in life but shed take it tomorrow if she could put her hands upon it and then after a bit when she began to find that she didnt like four per cent shed bring it back again but nobody can do business after such a fashion as that for the last three years shes drawn close upon two thousand a year for less than eighteen thousand pounds when a woman wants to do that she cant have her money in her pocket every monday morning  but youve done better than that yourself dobbs  of course i have and who has made the connexion and who has done the work i suppose she doesnt think that im to have all the sweat and that she is to have all the profit  if you talk of work dobbs it is i that have done the most of it this mr musselboro said in a very serious voice and with a look of much reproach  and youve been paid for what youve done come mussy youd better not turn against me youll never get your change out of that even if you marry the daughter that wont give you the mothers money shell stick to every shilling of it till she dies and shed take it with her then if she knew how having said this he got up from his chair put his little book into his pocket and walked out of the office he pushed his way across the court which was more than ordinarily crowded with the implements of burton and bangles trade and as he passed under the covered way he encountered at the entrance an old woman getting out of a cab the old woman was of course mother van as her partner mr dobbs broughton irreverently called her mrs van siever how dye do let me give you a hand fare from south kensington i always give the fellows three shillings  you dont mean to tell me its six miles and she tendered a florin to the man  cant take that maam said the cabman  cant take it but you must take it broughton just get a policeman will you dobbs broughton satisfied the driver out of his own pocket and the cab was driven away what did you give him said mrs van siever  just another sixpence there never is a policeman anywhere about here  itll be out of your own pocket then said mrs van but youre not going away  i must be at capel court by halfpast twelvei must indeed if it wasnt real business id stay  i told musselboro i should be here  hes up there and he knows all about the business just as well as i do when i found that i couldnt stay for you i went through the account with him and its all settled good morning ill see you at the west end in a day or two then he made his way out into lombard street and mrs van siever picked her steps across the yard and mounted the stairs and made her way into the room in which mr musselboro was sitting  somebodys been smoking gus she said almost as soon as she had entered the room  thats nothing new here he replied as he got up from his chair  theres no good being done when men sit and smoke over their work is it you or he or both of you  wellit was broughton was smoking just now i dont smoke of a morning myself  what made him get up and run away when i came  how can i tell mrs van siever said musselboro laughing if he did run away when you came i suppose it was because he didnt want to see you  and why shouldnt he want to see me gus i expect the truth from you how are things going on here to this question mr musselboro made no immediate answer but tilted himself back in his chair and took his hat off and put his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat and looked his patroness full in the face gus she said again i do expect the truth from you how are things going on here  thered be a good businessif hed only keep things together  but hes idle isnt he idle  confoundedly idle said musselboro  and he drinksdont he drink in the day  like the mischiefsome days but that isnt the worst of it  and what is the worst of it  newmarketthats the rock hes going to pieces on  you dont mean to say he takes the money out of the business for that and mrs van sievers face as she asked the question expressed almost a tragic horror if i thought that i wouldnt give him an hours mercy  when a man bets he doesnt well know what money he uses i cant say that he takes money that is not his own situated as i am i dont know what is his own and what isnt if your money was in my name i could keep a hand on itbut as it is not i can do nothing i can see that what is put out is put out fairly well and when i think of it mrs van siever it is quite wonderful that weve lost so little it has been next to nothing that has been my doingand thats about all that i can do  you must know whether he has used my money for his own purposes or not  if you ask me i think he has said mr musselboro  then ill go into it and ill find it out and if it is so as sure as my names van siever ill sew him up having uttered which terrible threat the old woman drew a chair to the table and seated herself fairly down as though she were determined to go through all the books of the office before she quitted that room mrs van siever in her present habiliments was not a thing so terrible to look at as she had been in her wiggeries at mrs dobbs broughtons dinnertable her curls were laid aside altogether and she wore simply a front beneath her close bonnetand a very old front too which was not loudly offensive because it told no lies her eyes were as bright and her little wizen face was as sharp as ever but the wizen face and the bright eyes were not so much amiss as seen together with the old dark brown silk dress which she now wore as they had been with the wiggeries and the evening finery even now in her morning costume in her workaday business dress as we may call it she looked to be very oldso old that nobody could guess her age people attempting to guess would say that she must be at least over eighty and yet she was wiry and strong and nimble it was not because she was feeble that she was thought to be so old they who so judged of her were led to their opinion by the extreme thinness of her face and by the brightness of her eyes joined to the depth of the hollows in which they lay and the red margin by which they were surrounded it was not really the fact that mrs van siever was so very aged for she had still some years to live before she would reach eighty but that she was such a weird old woman so small so ghastly and so ugly ill sew him up if hes been robbing me she said i will indeed and she stretched out her hand to grab at the ledger which musselboro had been using  you wont understand anything from that said he pushing the book over to her  you can explain it to me  thats all straight sailing that is  and where does he keep the figures that aint straight sailing thats the book i want to see  there is no such book  look here gusif i find you deceiving me ill throw you overboard as sure as im a living woman i will indeed ill have no mercy ive stuck to you and made a man of you and i expect you to stick to me  not much of a man said musselboro with a touch of scorn in his voice  youve never had a shilling yet but what i gave you  yes i have ive had what ive worked forand worked confounded hard too  look here musselboro if youre going to throw me over just tell me so and let us begin fair  im not going to throw you over ive always been on the square with you why dont you trust me out and out and then i could do a deal better for you you ask me now about your money i dont know about your money mrs van siever how am i to know anything about your money mrs van siever you dont give me any power of keeping a hand upon dobbs broughton i suppose you have security from dobbs broughton but i dont know what security you have mrs van siever he owes you now £915 16s 2d on last years account  why doesnt he give me a cheque for the money  he says he cant spare it you may have £500 and the rest when he can give it you or hell give you his noteofhand at fourteen days for the whole  bother his noteofhand why should i take his noteofhand  do as you like mrs van siever  its the interest on my own money why dont he give it me i suppose he has had it  you must ask him that mrs van siever youre in partnership with him and he can tell you nobody else knows anything about it if you were in partnership with me then of course i could tell you but youre not youve never trusted me mrs van siever  the lady remained there closeted with mr musselboro for an hour after that and did i think at length learn something more as to the details of her partners business than her faithful servant mr musselboro had at first found himself able to give to her and at last they came to friendly and confidential terms in the midst of which the personal welfare of mr dobbs broughton was i fear somewhat forgotten not that mr musselboro palpably and plainly threw his friend overboard he took his friends partalleging excuses for him and pleading some facts of course you know a man like that is fond of pleasure mrs van siever hes been at it more or less all his life i dont suppose he ever missed a derby or an oaks or the cup at ascot or the goodwood in his life hell have to miss them before long im thinking said mrs van siever and as to not cashing up you must remember mrs van siever that ten per cent wont come in quite as regularly as four or five when you go for high interest there must be hitches here and there there must indeed mrs van siever i know all about it said mrs van siever if he gave it me as soon as he got it himself i shouldnt complain never mind hes only got to give me my little bit of money out of the business and then he and i will be all square you come and see clara this evening gus  then mr musselboro put mrs van siever into another cab and went out upon changehanging about the bank and standing in threadneedle street talking to other men just like himself when he saw dobbs broughton he told that gentleman that mrs van siever had been in her tantrums but that he had managed to pacify her before she left hook court im to take her the cheque for the five hundred tonight he said     chapter xxxviii  jael   on the first of march conway dalrymples easel was put up in mrs dobbs broughtons boudoir upstairs the canvas was placed upon it on which the outlines of jael and sisera had been already drawn and mrs broughton and clara van siever and conway dalrymple were assembled with the view of steady artwork but before we see how they began their work together we will go back for a moment to john eames on his return to his london lodgings the first thing every man does when he returns home after an absence is to look at his letters and john eames looked at his there were not very many there was a note marked immediate from sir raffle buffle in which sir r had scrawled in four lines a notification that he should be driven to an extremity of inconvenience if eames were not at his post at halfpast nine on the following morning i think i see myself there at that hour said john there was a notification of a house dinner which he was asked to join at his club and a card for an evening gathering at lady glencora pallisersprocured for him by his friend conwayand an invitation to dinner at the house of his uncle mr toogood and there was a scented note in the handwriting of a lady which he did not recognize my nearest and dearest friend m d m he said as he opened the note and looked at the signature then he read the letter from miss demolines      my dear mr eames     pray come to me at once i know that you are to be back    tomorrow do not lose an hour if you can help it i shall    be at home at halfpast five i fear what you know of has    been begun but it certainly shall not go on in one way    or another it must be prevented i wont say another word    till i see you but pray come at once     yours always     m d m     thursday     poor mamma isnt very well so you had better ask for me   beautiful said johnny as he read the note theres nothing i like so much as a mysteryespecially if its about nothing i wonder why she is so desperately anxious that the picture should not be painted id ask dalrymple only i should spoil the mystery then he sat himself down and began to think of lily there could be no treason to lily in his amusing himself with the freaks of such a woman as miss demolines  at eleven oclock on the morning of the 1st of marchthe day following that on which miss demolines had written her notethe easel was put up and the canvas was placed on it in mrs broughtons room mrs broughton and clara were both there and when they had seen the outlines as far as it had been drawn they proceeded to make arrangements for their future operations the period of work was to begin always at eleven and was to be continued for an hour and a half or for two hours on the days on which they met i fear that there was a little improper scheming in this against the two persons whom the ladies were bound to obey mr dobbs broughton invariably left his house soon after ten in the morning it would sometimes happen though not frequently that he returned home early in the dayat four perhaps or even before that and should he chance to do so while the picture was going on he would catch them at their work if the work were postponed till after luncheon and then again mrs van siever would often go out in the morning and when she did so would always go without her daughter on such occasions she went into the city or to other resorts of business at which in some manner quite unintelligible to her daughter she looked after her money but when she did not go out in the morning she did go out in the afternoon and she would then require her daughters company there was some place to which she always went of a friday morning and at which she stayed for two or three hours friday therefore was a fitting day on which to begin the work at mrs broughtons house all this was explained between the three conspirators mrs dobbs broughton declared that if she entertained the slightest idea that her husband would object to the painting of the picture in her room nothing on earth would induce her to lend her countenance to it but yet it might be well not to tell him just at first perhaps not till the sittings were overperhaps not till the picture was finished as otherwise tidings of the picture might get round to ears which were not intended to hear it poor dear dobbs is so careless with a secret miss van siever explained her motives in a very different way i know mamma would not let me do it if she knew it and therefore i shall not tell her my dear clara said mrs broughton with a smile you are so outspoken and why not said miss van siever i am old enough to judge for myself if mamma does not want to be deceived she ought not to treat me like a child of course shell find it out sooner or later but i dont care about that conway dalrymple said nothing as the two ladies were thus excusing themselves how delightful it must be not to have a master said mrs broughton addressing him but then a man has to work for his own bread said he i suppose it comes about equal in the long run  very little drawing or painting was done on that day in the first place it was necessary that the question of costume should be settled and both mrs broughton and the artist had much to say on the subject it was considered proper that jael should be dressed as a jewess and there came to be much question how jewesses dressed themselves in those very early days mrs broughton had prepared her jewels and raiment of many colours but the painter declared that the wife of heber the kenite would have no jewels but when mrs broughton discovered from her bible that heber had been connected by family ties with moses she was more than ever sure that hebers wife would have in her tent much of the spoilings of the egyptians and when clara van siever suggested that at any rate she would not have worn them in a time of confusion when soldiers were loose flying about the country mrs broughton was quite confident that she would have put them on before she invited the captain of the enemys host into her tent the artist at last took the matter into his own hand by declaring that miss van siever would sit the subject much better without jewels and therefore all mrs broughtons gewgaws were put back into their boxes and then on four different times the two ladies had to retire into mrs broughtons room in order that jael might be arrayed in various costumesand in each costume she had to kneel down taking the hammer in her hand and holding the pointed stick which had been prepared to do duty as the nail upon the forehead of a dummy sisera at last it was decided that her raiment should be altogether white and that she should wear twisted round her head and falling over her shoulder a roman silk scarf of various colours where jael could have gotten it i dont know said clara you may be sure that there were lots of such things among the egyptians said mrs broughton and that moses brought away all the best for his own family  and who is to be sisera asked mrs broughton in one of the pauses in their work  im thinking of asking my friend john eames to sit  of course we cannot sit together said miss van siever  theres no reason why you should said dalrymple i can do the second figure in my own room then there was a bargain made that sisera should not be a portrait it would never do said mrs broughton shaking her head very gravely  though there was really very little done to the picture on that day the work was commenced and mrs broughton who had at first objected strongly to the idea and who had said twenty times that it was quite out of the question that it should be done in her house became very eager in her delight about it nobody should know anything of the picture till it should be exhibited that would be best and it should be the picture of the year she was a little heartbroken when dalrymple assured her that it could not possibly be finished for exhibition in that may but she came to again when he declared that he meant to put out all his strength upon it there will be five or six months work in it he said will there indeed and how much work was there in the graces the graces as will perhaps be remembered was the triple portrait of mrs dobbs broughton herself this question the artist did not answer with absolute accuracy but contented himself with declaring that with such a model as mrs broughton the picture had been comparatively easy  mrs broughton having no doubt that ultimate object of which she had spoken to her friend conway steadily in view took occasion before the sitting was over to leave the room so that the artist might have an opportunity of speaking a word in private to his modelif he had any such word to speak and mrs broughton as she did this felt that she was doing her duty as a wife a friend and a christian she was doing her duty as a wife because she was giving the clearest proof in the worldthe clearest at any rate to herselfthat the intimacy between herself and her friend conway had in it nothing that was improper and she was doing her duty as a friend because clara van siever with her large expectations would be an eligible wife and she was doing her duty as a christian because the whole thing was intended to be moral miss demolines had declared that her friend maria clutterbuckas miss demolines delighted to call mrs broughton in memory of dear old innocent dayshad high principles and the reader will see that she was justified in her declaration it will be better so said mrs broughton as she sat upon her bed and wiped a tear from the corner of her eye yes it will be better so there is a pang of course theres a pang but it will be better so acting upon this high principle she allowed conway dalrymple five minutes to say what he had to say to clara van siever then she allowed herself to indulge in some very savage feelings in reference to her husbandaccusing her husband in her thoughts of great crueltynay of brutality because of certain sharp words that he had said as to conway dalrymple but of course he cant understand said mrs broughton to herself how is it to be expected that he should understand  but she allowed her friend on this occasion only five minutes thinking probably that so much time might suffice a woman when she is jealous is apt to attribute to the other woman with whom her jealousy is concerned both weakness and timidity and to the man both audacity and strength a woman who has herself taken perhaps twelve months in the winning will think that another woman is to be won in five minutes it is not to be supposed that mrs dobbs broughton had ever been won by any one except by mr dobbs broughton at least let it not be supposed that she had ever acknowledged a spark of love for conway dalrymple but nevertheless there was enough of jealousy in her present mood to make her think poorly of miss van sievers capacity for standing a siege against the artists eloquence otherwise having left the two together with the object which she had acknowledged to herself she would hardly have returned to them after so very short an interval  i hope you wont dislike the trouble of all this said dalrymple to his model as soon as mrs broughton was gone  i cannot say that i like it very much said miss van siever  im afraid it will be a borebut i hope youll go through with it  i shall if i am not prevented said miss van siever when ive said that ill do a thing i like to do it  there was a pause in the conversation which took up a considerable portion of the five minutes miss van siever was not holding her nail during these moments but was sitting in a commonplace way on her chair while dalrymple was scraping his palette i wonder what it was that first induced you to sit said he  oh i dont know i took a fancy for it  im very glad you did take the fancy youll make an excellent model if you wont mind posing again for a few minutesi will not weary you today your right arm a little more forward  but i should tumble down  not if you lean well on to the nail  but that would have woken sisera before she had struck a blow  never mind that let us try it then mrs broughton returned with that pleasant feeling in her bosom of having done her duty as a wife a friend and a christian mrs broughton continued the painter just steady miss van sievers shoulder with your hand and now bring the arm and the elbow a little more forward  but jael did not have a friend to help her in that way said miss van siever  at the end of an hour and a half the two ladies retired and jael disrobed herself and miss van siever put on her customary raiment it was agreed among them that they had commenced their work auspiciously and that they would meet again on the following monday the artist begged to be allowed an hour to go on with his work in mrs broughtons room and the hour was conceded to him it was understood that he could not take the canvas backwards and forwards with him to his own house and he pointed out that no progress whatever could be made unless he were occasionally allowed some such grace as this mrs broughton doubted and hesitated made difficulties and lifted up her hands in despair it is easy for you to say why not but i know very well why not but at last she gave way honi soit qui mal y pense she said that must be my protection so she followed miss van siever downstairs leaving mr dalrymple in possession of her boudoir i shall give you just one hour she said and then i shall come and turn you out so she went down and as miss van siever would not stay to lunch with her she ate her lunch by herself sending a glass of sherry and a biscuit up to the poor painter at his work  exactly at the end of the hour she returned to him now conway you must go she said  but why in such a hurry  because i say that it must be so when i say so pray let that be sufficient but still dalrymple went on working conway she said how can you treat me with so much disdain  disdain mrs broughton  yes disdain have i not begged you to understand that i cannot allow you to remain here and yet you pay no attention to my wishes  i have done now and he began to put his brushes and paints together i suppose all these things may remain here  yes they may remain they must do so of course there if you will put the easel in the corner with the canvas behind it they will not be seen if he should chance to come into the room  he would not be angry i suppose if he saw them  there is no knowing men are so unreasonable all men are i think all those are whom i have had the fortune to know women generally say that men are selfish i do not complain so much that they are selfish as that they are thoughtless they are headstrong and do not look forward to results now youi do not think you would willingly do me an injury  i do not think i would  i am sure you would notbut yet you would forget to save me from one  what injury  oh never mind i am not thinking of anything in particular from myself for instance but we will not talk about that that way madness lies tell me conwaywhat do you think of clara van siever  she is very handsome certainly  and clever  decidedly clever i should think she has a temper of her own  what woman is there worth a straw that has not if clara van siever were illused she would resent it i do not doubt that for a moment i should not like to be the man who would do it  nor i either said conway  but there is plenty of feminine softness in that character if she were treated with love and kindness conway if you will take my advice you will ask clara van siever to be your wife but perhaps you have already  who i  yes you  i have not done it yet certainly mrs broughton  and why should you not do it  there are two or three reasonsbut perhaps none of any great importance do you know of none mrs broughton  i know of none said mrs broughton in a very seriousin almost a tragic toneof none that should weigh for a moment as far as i am concerned nothing would give me more pleasure  that is so kind of you  i mean to be kind i do indeed conway i know it will be better for you that you should be settledvery much better and it will be better for me i do not mind admitting thatthough in saying so i trust greatly to your generosity to interpret my words properly  i shall not flatter myself if you mean that  there is no question of flattery conway the question is simply of truth and prudence do you not know that it would be better that you should be married  not unless a certain gentleman were to die first said conway dalrymple as he deposited the last of his painting paraphernalia in the recess which had been prepared for them by mrs broughton  conway how can you speak in that wicked wicked way  i can assure you i do not wish the gentleman in question the slightest harm in the world if his welfare depended on me he should be as safe as the bank of england  and you will not take my advice  what advice  about clara  mrs broughton matrimony is a very important thing  indeed it isoh who can say how important there was a time conway when i thought you had given your heart to madalina demolines  heaven forbid  and i grieved because i thought that she was not worthy of you  there was never anything in that mrs broughton  she thought that there was at any rate she said so i know that for certain she told me so herself but let that pass clara van siever is in every respect very different from madalina clara i think is worthy of you and conwayof course it is not for me to dictate to you but this i must tell you then she paused as though she did not know how to finish her sentence  what must you tell me  i will tell you nothing more if you cannot understand what i have said you must be more dull of comprehension than i believe you to be now go why are you not gone this halfhour  how could i go while you were giving me all this good advice  i have not asked you to stay go now at any rate and remember conway if this picture is to go on i will not have you remaining here after the work is done will you remember that and she held him by the hand while he declared that he would remember it  mrs dobbs broughton was no more in love with conway dalrymple than she was in love with king charles on horseback at charing cross and over and beyond the protection which came to her in the course of nature from unimpassioned feelings in this special phase of her lifeand indeed i may say in every phase of her lifeit must be acknowledged on her behalf that she did enjoy that protection which comes from what we call principlethough the principle was not perhaps very high of its kind madalina demolines had been right when she talked of her friend marias principles dobbs broughton had been so far lucky in that jump in the dark which he had made in taking a wife to himself that he had not fallen upon a really vicious woman or upon a woman of strong feeling if it had come to be the lot of mrs dobbs broughton to have six hours work to do every day of her life i think that the work would have been done badly but that it would have kept her free from all danger as it was she had nothing to do she had no child she was not given to much reading she could not sit with a needle in her hand all day she had no aptitude for may meetings or the excitement of charitable good works life with her was very dull and she found no amusement within her reach so easy and so pleasant as the amusement of pretending to be in love if all that she did and all that she said could only have been taken for its worth and for nothing more by the different persons concerned there was very little in it to flatter mr dalrymple or to give cause for tribulation to mr broughton she probably cared but little for either of them she was one of those women to whom it is not given by nature to care very much for anybody but of the two she certainly cared the most for mr dobbs broughtonbecause mr dobbs broughton belonged to her as to leaving mr dobbs broughtons house and putting herself into the hands of another manno imogen of a wife was ever less likely to take a step so wicked so dangerous and so generally disagreeable to all the parties concerned  but conway dalrymplethough now and again he had got a side glance at her true character with clearseeing eyesdid allow himself to be flattered and deceived he knew that she was foolish and ignorant and that she often talked wonderful nonsense he knew also that she was continually contradicting herselfas when she would strenuously beg him to leave her while she would continue to talk to him in a strain that prevented the possibility of his going but nevertheless he was flattered and he did believe that she loved him as to his love for herhe knew very well that it amounted to nothing now and again perhaps twice a week if he saw her as often he would say something which would imply a declaration of affection he felt that as much as that was expected from him and that he ought not to hope to get off cheaper and now that this little play was going on about miss van siever he did think that mrs dobbs broughton was doing her very best to overcome an unfortunate attachment it is so gratifying to a young mans feelings to suppose that another mans wife has conceived an unfortunate attachment for him conway dalrymple ought not to have been fooled by such a woman but i fear that he was fooled by her  as he returned home today from mrs broughtons house to his own lodgings he rambled out for a while into kensington gardens and thought of his position seriously i dont see why i should not marry her he said to himself thinking of course of miss van siever if maria is not in earnest it is not my fault and it would be my wish that she should be in earnest if i suppose her to be so and take her at her word she can have no right to quarrel with me poor maria at any rate it will be better for her for no good can come of this kind of thing and by heavens with a woman like that of strong feelings one never knows what may happen and then he thought of the condition he would be in if he were to find her some fine day in his own rooms and if she were to tell him that she could not go home again and that she meant to remain with him  in the meantime mrs dobbs broughton had gone down into her own drawingroom had tucked herself up on the sofa and had fallen fast asleep     chapter xxxix  a new flirtation   illustration  john eames sat at his office on the day after his return to london and answered the various letters which he had found waiting for him at his lodgings on the previous evening to miss demolines he had already written from his cluba single line which he considered to be appropriate to the mysterious necessities of the occasion i will be with you at a quarter to six tomorrowj e just returned there was not another word and as he scrawled it at one of the club tables while two or three men were talking to him he felt rather proud of his correspondence it was capital fun he said and after allthe all on this occasion being lily dale and the sadness of his disappointment at allingtonafter all let a fellow be ever so down in the mouth a little amusement should do him good and he reflected further that the more a fellow be down in the mouth the more good the amusement would do him he sent off his note therefore with some little inward rejoicingand a word or two also of spoken rejoicing what fun women are sometimes he said to one of his friendsa friend with whom he was very intimate calling him always fred and slapping his back but whom he never by any chance saw out of his club  whats up now johnny some good fortune  good fortune no i never have good fortunes of that kind but ive got hold of a young womanor rather a young woman has got hold of me who insists on having a mystery with me in the mystery itself there is not the slightest interest but the mysteriousness of it is charming i have just written to her three words to settle an appointment for tomorrow we dont sign our names lest the postmastergeneral should find out all about it  is she pretty  wellshe isnt ugly she has just enough of good looks to make the sort of thing pass off pleasantly a mystery with a downright ugly young woman would be unpleasant  after this fashion the note from miss demolines had been received and answered at once but the other letters remained in his pocket till he reached his office on the following morning sir raffle had begged him to be there at halfpast nine this he had sworn he would not do but he did seat himself in his room at ten minutes before ten finding of course the whole building untenanted at that early hourthat unearthly hour as johnny called it himself i shouldnt wonder if he really is here this morning johnny said as he entered the building just that he may have an opportunity of jumping on me but sir raffle was not there and then johnny began to abuse sir raffle if ever i come here early to meet him again because he says he means to be here himself i hope i may be  blessed on that especial morning it was twelve before sir raffle made his appearance and johnny avenged himselfi regret to have to tell itby a fib that sir raffle fibbed first was no valid excuse whatever for eames  ive been at it ever since six oclock said sir raffle  at what said johnny  work to be sureand very hard work too i believe the chancellor of the exchequer thinks that he can call upon me to any extent that he pleasesjust any extent that he pleases he doesnt give me credit for a desire to have a single hour to myself  what would he do sir raffle if you were to get ill or wear yourself out  he knows im not one of the wearingout sort you got my note last night  yes i got your note  im sorry that i troubled you but i couldnt help it i didnt expect to get a box full of papers at eleven oclock last night  you didnt put me out sir raffle i happened to have business of my own which prevented the possibility of my being here early  this was the way in which john eames avenged himself sir raffle turned his face upon his private secretary and his face was very black johnny bore the gaze without dropping an eyelid im not going to stand it and he may as well know that at once johnny said to one of his friends in the office afterwards if he ever wants any thing really done ill do itthough it should take me twelve hours at a stretch but im not going to pretend to believe all the lies he tells me about the chancellor of the exchequer if that is to be part of the private secretarys business he had better get somebody else but now sir raffle was very angry and his countenance was full of wrath as he looked down upon his subordinate minister if i had come here mr eames and had found you absent i should have been very much annoyed very much annoyed indeed after having written as i did  you would have found me absent at the hour you named as i wasnt here then i think its only fair to say so  im afraid you begrudge your time to the service mr eames  i do begrudge it when the service doesnt want it  at your age mr eames thats not for you to judge if i had acted in that way when i was young i should never have filled the position i now hold i always remembered in those days that as i was the hand and not the head i was bound to hold myself in readiness whether work might be required from me or not  if im wanted as hand now sir raffle im ready  thats all very wellbut why were you not here at the hour i named  well sir raffle i cannot say that the chancellor of the exchequer detained mebut there was business as ive been here for the last two hours i am happy to think that in this instance the public service will not have suffered from my disobedience  sir raffle was still standing with his hat on and with his back to the fire and his countenance was full of wrath it was on his tongue to tell johnny that he had better return to his former work in the outer office he greatly wanted the comfort of a private secretary who would believe in himor at least pretend to believe in him there are men who though they have not sense enough to be true have nevertheless sense enough to know that they cannot expect to be really believed in by those who are near enough to them to know them sir raffle buffle was such a one he would have greatly delighted in the services of some one who would trust him implicitlyof some young man who would really believe all that he said of himself and of the chancellor of the exchequer but he was wise enough to perceive that no such young man was to be had or that any such young mancould such a one be foundwould be absolutely useless for any purposes of work he knew himself to be a liar whom nobody trusted and he knew himself also to be a bullythough he could not think so low of himself as to believe that he was a bully whom nobody feared a private secretary was at the least bound to pretend to believe in him there is a decency in such things and that decency john eames did not observe he thought that he must get rid of john eames in spite of certain attractions which belonged to johnnys appearance and general manners and social standing and reputed wealth but it would not be wise to punish a man on the spot for breaking an appointment which he himself had not kept and therefore he would wait for another opportunity you had better go to your own room now he said i am engaged on a matter connected with the treasury in which i will not ask for your assistance he knew that eames would not believe a word as to what he said about the treasurynot even some very trifling base of truth which did exist but the boast gave him an opportunity of putting an end to the interview after his own fashion then john eames went to his own room and answered the letters which he had in his pocket  to the club dinner he would not go whats the use of paying two guineas for a dinner with fellows you see every day of your life he said to lady glencoras he would go and he wrote a line to his friend dalrymple proposing that they should go together and he would dine with his cousin toogood in tavistock square one meets the queerest people in the world there he said but tommy toogood is such a good fellow himself after that he had his lunch then he read the paper and before he went away he wrote a dozen or two of private notes presenting sir raffles compliments right and left and giving in no one note a single word of information that could be of any use to any person having thus earned his salary by halfpast four oclock he got into a hansom cab and had himself driven to porchester terrace miss demolines was at home of course and he soon found himself closeted with that interesting young woman  i thought you never would have come these were the first words she spoke  my dear miss demolines you must not forget that i have my bread to earn  fiddlestickbread as if i didnt know that you can get away from your office when you choose  but indeed i cannot  what is there to prevent you mr eames  im not tied up like a dog certainly but who do you suppose will do my work if i do not do it myself it is a fact though the world does not believe it that men in public offices have got something to do  now you are laughing at me i know but you are welcome if you like it its the way of the world just at present that ladies should submit to that sort of thing from gentlemen  what sort of thing miss demolines  chaffas you call it courtesy is out of fashion and gallantry has come to signify quite a different kind of thing from what it used to do  the sir charles grandison business is done and gone thats what you mean i suppose dont you think we should find it very heavy if we tried to get it back again  im not going to ask you to be a sir charles grandison mr eames but never mind all that now do you know that that girl has absolutely had her first sitting for the picture  has she indeed  she has you may take my word for it i know it as a fact what a fool that young man is  which young man  which young man conway dalrymple to be sure artists are always weak of all men in the world they are the most subject to flattery from women and we all know that conway dalrymple is very vain  upon my word i didnt know it said johnny  yes you do you must know it when a man goes about in a purple velvet coat of course he is vain  i certainly cannot defend a purple velvet coat  that is what he wore when this girl sat to him this morning  this morning was it  yes this morning they little think that they can do nothing without my knowing it he was there for nearly four hours and she was dressed up in a white robe as jael with a turban on her head jael indeed i call it very improper and i am quite astonished that maria clutterbuck should have lent herself to such a piece of work that maria was never very wise of course we all know but i thought that she had principle enough to have kept her from this kind of thing  its her fevered existence said johnny  that is just it she must have excitement it is like dramdrinking and then you know they are always living in the crater of a volcano  who are living in the crater of a volcano  the dobbs broughtons are of course they are there is no saying what day a smash may come these city people get so used to it that they enjoy it the risk is every thing to them  they like to have a little certainty behind the risk i fancy  im afraid there is very little thats certain with dobbs broughton but about this picture mr eames i look to you to assist me there it must be put a stop to as to that i am determined it must beput astop to and as miss demolines repeated these last words with tremendous emphasis she leant with both her elbows on a little table that stood between her and her visitor and looked with all her eyes into his face i do hope that you agree with me in that said she  upon my word i do not see the harm of the picture said he  you do not  indeed no why should not dalrymple paint miss van siever as well as any other lady it is his special business to paint ladies  look here mr eames and now miss demolines as she spoke drew her own seat closer to that of her companion and pushed away the little table do you suppose that conway dalrymple in the usual way of his business paints pictures of young ladies of which their mothers know nothing do you suppose that he paints them in ladies rooms without their husbands knowledge and in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures  but what is all that to you and me miss demolines  is the welfare of your friend nothing to you would you like to see him become the victim of the artifice of such a girl as clara van siever  upon my word i think he is very well able to take care of himself  and would you wish to see that poor creatures domestic hearth ruined and broken up  which poor creature  dobbs broughton to be sure  i cant pretend that i care very much for dobbs broughton said john eames and you see i know so little about his domestic hearth  oh mr eames  besides her principles will pull her through you told me yourself that mrs broughton has high principles  god forbid that i should say a word against maria clutterbuck said miss demolines fervently maria clutterbuck was my early friend and though words have been spoken which never should have been spoken and though things have been done which never should have been even dreamed of still i will not desert maria clutterbuck in her hour of need no never  im sure youre what one may call a trump to your friends miss demolines  i have always endeavoured to be so and always shall you will find me sothat is if you and i ever become intimate enough to feel that sort of friendship  theres nothing on earth i should like better said johnny as soon as the words were out of his mouth he felt ashamed of himself he knew that he did not in truth desire the friendship of miss demolines and that any friendship with such a one would mean something different from friendshipsomething that would be an injury to lily dale a week had hardly passed since he had sworn a lifes constancy to lily dalehad sworn it not to her only but to himself and now he was giving way to a flirtation with this woman not because he liked it himself but because he was too weak to keep out of it  if that is true said miss demolines  oh yes its quite true said johnny  then you must earn my friendship by doing what i ask of you that picture must not be painted you must tell conway dalrymple as his friend that he must cease to carry on such an intrigue in another mans house  you would hardly call painting a picture an intrigue would you  certainly i would when its kept a secret from the husband by the wifeand from the mother by the daughter if it cannot be stopped in any other way i must tell mrs van sieveri must indeed i have such an abhorrence of the old woman that i could not bring myself to speak to herbut i should write to her thats what i should do  but whats the reason you might as well tell me the real reason had miss demolines been christened mary or fanny or jane i think that john eames would now have called her by either of those names but madalina was such a mouthful that he could not bring himself to use it at once he had heard that among her intimates she was called maddy he had an idea that he had heard dalrymple in old times talk of her as maddy mullins and just at this moment the idea was not pleasant to him at any rate he could not call her maddy as yet how am i to help you he said unless i know all about it  i hate that girl like poison said miss demolines confidentially drawing herself very near to johnny as she spoke  but what has she done  what has she done i cant tell you what she has done i could not demean myself by repeating it of course we all know what she wants she wants to catch conway dalrymple thats as plain as anything can be not that i care about that  of course not said johnny  not in the least its nothing to me i have known mr dalrymple no doubt for a year or two and i should be sorry to see a young man who has his good points sacrificed in that sort of way but it is mere acquaintance between mr dalrymple and me and of course i cannot interfere  shell have a lot of money you know  he thinks so does he i suppose that is what maria has told him oh mr eames you dont know the meanness of women you dont indeed men are so much more noble  are they do you think  than some women i see women doing things that really disgust me i do indeedthings that i wouldnt do myself were it ever sostriving to catch men in every possible way and for such purposes i wouldnt have believed it of maria clutterbuck i wouldnt indeed however i will never say a word against her because she has been my friend nothing shall ever induce me  john eames before he left porchester terrace had at last succeeded in calling his fair friend madalina and had promised that he would endeavour to open the artists eyes to the folly of painting his picture in broughtons house without broughtons knowledge     chapter xl  mr toogoods ideas about society   a day or two after the interview which was described in the last chapter john eames dined with his uncle mr thomas toogood in tavistock square he was in the habit of doing this about once a month and was a great favourite both with his cousins and with their mother mr toogood did not give dinnerparties always begging those whom he asked to enjoy his hospitality to take pot luck and telling young men whom he could treat with familiaritysuch as his nephewthat if they wanted to be regaled à la russe they must not come to number 75 tavistock square a leg of mutton and trimmings that will be about the outside of it he would say but he would add in a whisperand a glass of port such as you dont get every day of your life polly and lucy toogood were pretty girls and merry withal and certain young men were well contented to accept the attorneys invitationswhether attracted by the promised leg of mutton or the port wine or the young ladies i will not attempt to say but it had so happened that one young man a clerk from john eames office had partaken so often of the pot luck and port wine that polly toogood had conquered him by her charms and he was now a slave waiting an appropriate time for matrimonial sacrifice william summerkin was the young mans name and as it was known that mr summerkin was to inherit a fortune amounting to five thousand pounds from his maiden aunt it was considered that polly toogood was not doing amiss ill give you three hundred pounds my boy just to put a few sheets on the beds said toogood the father and when the old birds are both dead shell have a thousand pounds out of the nest thats the extent of pollys fortuneso now you know summerkin was however quite contented to have his own money settled on his darling polly and the whole thing was looked at with pleasant and propitious eyes by the toogood connection  when john eames entered the drawingroom summerkin and polly were already there summerkin blushed up to his eyes of course but polly sat as demurely as though she had been accustomed to having lovers all her life mamma will be down almost immediately john said polly as soon as the first greetings were over and papa has come in i know  summerkin said johnny im afraid you left the office before four oclock  no i did not said summerkin i deny it  polly said her cousin you should keep him in better order he will certainly come to grief if he goes on like this i suppose you could do without him for half an hour  i dont want him i can assure you said polly  i have only been here just five minutes said summerkin and i came because mrs toogood asked me to do a commission  thats civil to you polly said john  its quite as civil as i wish him to be said polly and as for you john everybody knows that youre a goose and that you always were a goose isnt he always doing foolish things at the office william but as john eames was rather a great man at the incometax office summerkin would not fall into his sweethearts joke on this subject finding it easier and perhaps safer to twiddle the bodkins in pollys workbasket then toogood and mrs toogood entered the room together and the lovers were able to be alone again during the general greeting with which johnny was welcomed  you dont know the silverbridge peopledo you asked mr toogood eames said that he did not he had been at silverbridge more than once but did not know very much of the silverbridgians because walker is coming to dine here walker is the leading man in silverbridge  and what is walkerbesides being leading man in silverbridge  hes a lawyer walker and winthrop everybody knows walker in barsetshire ive been down at barchester since i saw you  have you indeed said johnny  and ill tell you what ive been about you know mr crawley dont you  the hogglestock clergyman that has come to grief i dont know him personally hes a sort of cousin by marriage you know  of course he is said mr toogood his wife is my firstcousin and your mothers firstcousin he came here to me the other dayor rather to the shop i had never seen the man before in my life and a very queer fellow he is too he came to me about this trouble of his and of course i must do what i can for him i got myself introduced to walker who has the management of the prosecution and i asked him to come here and dine today  and what sort of fellow did you find crawley uncle tom  such a queer fishso unlike anybody else in the world  but i suppose he did take the money said johnny  i dont know what to say about it i dont indeed if he took it he didnt mean to steal it im as sure that man didnt mean to steal twenty pounds as i ever could be of anything perhaps i shall get something about it out of walker after dinner then mr walker entered the room this is very kind of you mr walker very indeed i take it quite as a compliment your coming in in this sort of way its just pot luck you know and nothing else mr walker of course assured his host that he was delighted just a leg of mutton and a bottle of old port mr walker continued toogood we never get beyond that in the way of dinnergiving do we maria  but maria was at this moment descanting on the good luck of the family to her nephewand on one special piece of good luck which had just occurred mr summerkins maiden aunt had declared her intention of giving up the fortune to the young people at once she had enough to live upon she said and would therefore make two lovers happy and theyre to be married on the first of may said lucythat lucy of whom her father had boasted to mr crawley that she knew byron by heartand wont that be jolly mamma is going out to look for a house for them tomorrow fancy polly with a house of her own wont it be stunning i wish you were going to be married too johnny  dont be a fool lucy  of course i know that you are in love i hope you are not going to give over being in love johnny because it is such fun  wait till youre caught yourself my girl  i dont mean to be caught till some great swell comes this way and as great swells never do come into tavistock square i shant have a chance ill tell you what i would like id like to have a corsairor else a giaouri think a giaour would be nicest only a giaour wouldnt be a giaour here you know fancy a lover who thundering comes on blackest steed with slackened bit and hoof of speed were not those the days to live in but all that is over now you know and young people take houses in woburn place instead of being locked up or drowned or married to a hideous monster behind a veil i suppose its better as it is for some reasons  i think it must be more jolly as you call it lucy  im not quite sure i know id go back and be medora if i could mamma is always telling polly that she must be careful about williams dinner but conrad didnt care for his dinner light toil to cull and dress thy frugal fare see i have plucked the fruit that promised best  and how often do you think conrad got drunk  i dont think he got drunk at all there is no reason why he should any more than william come along and take me down to dinner after all papas leg of mutton is better than medoras apples when one is as hungry as i am  the leg of mutton on this occasion consisted of soup fish and a bit of roast beef and a couple of boiled fowls if i had only two children instead of twelve mr walker said the host id give you a dinner à la russe  i dont begrudge mrs toogood a single arrow in her quiver on that score said mr walker  people are getting to be so luxurious that one cant live up to them at all said mrs toogood we dined out here with some new comers in the square only last week we had asked them before and they came quite in a quiet wayjust like this and when we got there we found theyd four kinds of ices after dinner  and not a morsel of food on the table fit to eat said toogood i never was so poisoned in my life as for soupit was just the washings of the pastrycooks kettle next door  and how is one to live with such people mr walker continued mrs toogood of course we cant ask them back again we cant give them four kinds of ices  but would that be necessary perhaps they havent got twelve children  they havent got any said toogood triumphing not a chick belonging to them but you see one must do as other people do i hate anything grand i wouldnt want more than this for myself if banknotes were as plenty as curlpapers  nobody has any curlpapers now papa said lucy  but i cant bear to be outdone said mr toogood i think its very unpleasantpeople living in that sort of way its all very well telling me that i neednt live so tooand of course i dont i cant afford to have four men in from the confectioners dressed a sight better than myself at ten shillings a head i cant afford it and i dont do it but the worst of it is that i suffer because other people do it it stands to reason that i must either be driven along with the crowd or else be left behind now i dont like either and whats the end of it why im half carried away and half left behind  upon my word papa i dont think youre carried away at all said lucy  yes i am and im ashamed of myself mr walker i dont dare to ask you to drink a glass of wine with me in my own housethats what i dontbecause its the proper thing for you to wait till somebody brings it you and then to drink it by yourself there is no knowing whether i mightnt offend you and mr toogood as he spoke grasped the decanter at his elbow mr walker grasped another at his elbow and the two attorneys took their glass of wine together  a very queer case this is of my cousin crawleys said toogood to walker when the ladies had left the diningroom  a most distressing case i never knew anything so much talked of in our part of the country  he cant have been a popular man i should say  no not popularnot in the ordinary wayanything but that nobody knew him personally before this matter came up  but a good clergyman probably im interested in the case of course as his wife is my firstcousin you will understand however that i know nothing of him my father tried to be civil to him once but crawley wouldnt have it at all we all thought he was mad then i suppose he has done his duty in his parish  he has quarrelled with the bishop you knowout and out  has he indeed but im not sure that i think so very much about bishops mr walker  that depends very much on the particular bishop some people say ours isnt all that a bishop ought to be while others are very fond of him  and mr crawley belongs to the former set thats all said mr toogood  no mr toogood that isnt all the worst of your cousin is that he has an aptitude to quarrel with everybody he is one of those men who always think themselves to be illused now our dean dr arabin has been his very old friendand as far as i can learn a very good friend but it seems that mr crawley has done his best to quarrel with him too  he spoke of the dean in the highest terms to me  he may do thatand yet quarrel with him hed quarrel with his own right hand if he had nothing else to quarrel with that makes the difficulty you see hell take nobodys advice he thinks that were all against him  i suppose the world has been heavy on him mr walker  the world has been very heavy on him said john eames who had now been left free to join the conversation mr summerkin having gone away to his ladylove you must not judge him as you do other men  that is just it said mr walker and to what result will that bring us  that we ought to stretch a point in his favour said toogood  but why asked the attorney from silverbridge what do we mean when we say that one man isnt to be trusted as another we simply imply that he is not what we call responsible  and i dont think mr crawley is responsible said johnny  then how can he be fit to have charge of a parish said mr walker you see where the difficulty is how it embarrasses one all round the amount of evidence as to the cheque is i think sufficient to get a verdict in an ordinary case and the crown has no alternative but so to treat it then his friends come forwardand from sympathy with his sufferings i desire to be ranked among the numberand say ah but you should spare this man because he is not responsible were he one who filled no position requiring special responsibility that might be very well his friends might undertake to look after him and the prosecution might perhaps be smothered but mr crawley holds a living and if he escape he will be triumphantespecially triumphant over the bishop now if he has really taken this money and if his only excuse be that he did not know when he took it whether he was stealing or whether he was notfor the sake of justice that ought not to be allowed so spoke mr walker  you think he certainly did steal the money said johnny  you have heard the evidence no doubt said mr walker  i dont feel quite sure about it yet said mr toogood  quite sure of what said mr walker  that the cheque was dropped in his house  it was at any rate traced to his hands  i have no doubt about that said toogood  and he cant account for it said walker  a man isnt bound to show where he got his money said johnny suppose that sovereign is marked and johnny produced a coin from his pocket and i dont know but what it is and suppose it is proved to have belonged to some one who lost it and then to be traced to my handshow am i to say where i got it if i were asked i should simply decline to answer  but a cheque is not a sovereign mr eames said walker it is presumed that a man can account for the possession of a cheque it may be that a man should have a cheque in his possession and not be able to account for it and should yet be open to no grave suspicion in such a case a jury has to judge here is the fact that mr crawley has the cheque and brings it into use some considerable time after it is drawn and the additional fact that the drawer of the cheque had lost it as he thought in mr crawleys house and had looked for it there soon after it was drawn and long before it was paid a jury must judge but as a lawyer i should say that the burden of disproof lies with mr crawley  did you find out anything mr walker said toogood about the man who drove mr soames that day  nonothing  the trap was from the dragon at barchester i think  yesfrom the dragon of wantly  a respectable sort of house  pretty well for that i believe ive heard that the people are poor said mr walker  somebody told me that theyd had a queer lot about the house and that three or four of them left just then i think i heard that two or three men from the place went to new zealand together it just came out in conversation while i was in the innyard  i have never heard anything of it said mr walker  i dont say that it can help us  i dont see that it can said mr walker  after that there was a pause and mr toogood pushed about the old port and made some very stinging remarks as to the claretdrinking propensities of the age gladstone claret the most of it is i fancy said mr toogood i find that port wine which my father bought in the wood fiveandtwenty years ago is good enough for me mr walker said that it was quite good enough for him almost too good and that he thought that he had had enough of it the host threatened another bottle and was up to draw the corkrather to the satisfaction of john eames who liked his uncles portbut mr walker stopped him not a drop more for me he said you are quite sure quite sure and mr walker moved towards the door  its a great pity mr walker said toogood going back to the old subject that this dean and his wife should be away  i understand that they will both be home before the trial said mr walker  yesbut you know how very important it is to learn beforehand exactly what your witnesses can prove and what they cant prove and moreover though neither the dean nor his wife might perhaps be able to tell us anything themselves they might help to put us on the proper scent i think ill send somebody after them i think i will  it would be a heavy expense mr toogood  yes said toogood mournfully thinking of the twelve children it would be a heavy expense but i never like to stick at a thing when it ought to be done i think i shall send a fellow after them  ill go said johnny  how can you go  ill make old snuffle give me leave  but will that lessen the expense said mr walker  well yes i think it will said john modestly  my nephew is a rich man mr walker said toogood  that alters the case said mr walker and thus before they left the diningroom it was settled that john eames should be taught his lesson and should seek both mrs arabin and dr arabin on their travels     chapter xli  grace crawley at home   on the morning after his return from london mr crawley showed symptoms of great fatigue and his wife implored him to remain in bed but this he would not do he would get up and go out down to the brickfields he had specially bound himselfhe said to see that the duties of the parish did not suffer by being left in his hands the bishop had endeavoured to place them in other hands but he had persisted in retaining them as he had done so he could allow no weariness of his own to interfereand especially no weariness induced by labours undertaken on his own behalf the day in the week had come round on which it was his wont to visit the brickmakers and he would visit them so he dragged himself out of his bed and went forth amidst the cold storm of a harsh wet march morning his wife well knew when she heard his first word on that morning that one of those terrible moods had come upon him which made her doubt whether she ought to allow him to go anywhere alone latterly there had been some improvement in his mental health since the day of his encounter with the bishop and mrs proudie though he had been as stubborn as ever he had been less apparently unhappy less depressed in spirits and the journey to london had done him good his wife had congratulated herself on finding him able to set about his work like another man and he himself had experienced a renewal if not of hope at any rate of courage which had given him a comfort which he had recognized his commonsense had not been very striking in his interview with mr toogood but yet he had talked more rationally then and had given a better account of the matter in hand than could have been expected from him for some weeks previously but now that the labour was over a reaction had come upon him and he went away from his house having hardly spoken a word to his wife after the speech which he made about his duty to his parish  i think that at this time nobody saw clearly the working of his mindnot even his wife who studied it very closely who gave him credit for all his high qualities and who had gradually learned to acknowledge to herself that she must distrust his judgment in many things she knew that he was good and yet weak that he was afflicted by false pride and supported by true pride that his intellect was still very bright yet so dismally obscured on many sides as almost to justify people in saying that he was mad she knew that he was almost a saint and yet almost a castaway through vanity and hatred of those above him but she did not know that he knew all this of himself also she did not comprehend that he should be hourly telling himself that people were calling him mad and were so calling him with truth it did not occur to her that he could see her insight into him she doubted as to the way in which he had got the chequenever imagining however that he had wilfully stolen itthinking that his mind had been so much astray as to admit of his finding it and using it without wilful guiltthinking also alas that a man who could so act was hardly fit for such duties as those which were entrusted to him but she did not dream that this was precisely his own idea of his own state and of his own positionthat he was always inquiring of himself whether he was not mad whether if mad he was not bound to lay down his office that he was ever taxing himself with improper hostility to the bishopnever forgetting for a moment his wrath against the bishop and the bishops wife still comforting himself with his triumph over the bishop and the bishops wifebut for all that accusing himself of a heavy sin and proposing to himself to go to the palace and there humbly to relinquish his clerical authority such a course of action he was proposing to himself but not with any realized idea that he would so act he was as a man who walks along a rivers bank thinking of suicide calculating how best he might kill himselfwhether the river does not offer an opportunity too good to be neglected telling himself that for many reasons he had better do so suggesting to himself that the water is pleasant and cool and that his ears would soon be deaf to the harsh noises of the worldbut yet knowing or thinking that he knows that he never will kill himself so it was with mr crawley though his imagination pictured to himself the whole scenehow he would humble himself to the ground as he acknowledged his unfitness how he would endure the smallvoiced triumph of the little bishop how from the abjectness of his own humility even from the ground on which he would be crouching he would rebuke the loudmouthed triumph of the bishops wife though there was no touch wanting to the picture which he thus drewhe did not really propose to himself to commit this professional suicide his wife too had considered whether it might be in truth becoming that he should give up his clerical duties at any rate for a while but she had never thought that the idea was present to his mind also  mr toogood had told him that people would say that he was mad and mr toogood had looked at him when he declared for the second time that he had no knowledge whence the cheque had come to him as though his words were to be regarded as the words of some sick child mad he said to himself as he walked home from the station that night well yes and what if i am mad when i think of all that i have endured my wonder is that i should not have been mad sooner and then he prayedyes prayed that in his madness the devil might not be too strong for him and that he might be preserved from some terrible sin of murder or violence what if the idea should come to him in his madness that it would be well for him to slay his wife and his children only that was wanting to make him of all men the most unfortunate  he went down among the brickmakers on the following morning leaving the house almost without a morsel of food and he remained at hoggle end for the greater part of the day there were sick persons there with whom he prayed and then he sat talking with rough men while they ate their dinners and he read passages from the bible to women while they washed their husbands clothes and for a while he sat with a little girl in his lap teaching the child her alphabet if it were possible for him he would do his duty he would spare himself in nothing though he might suffer even to fainting and on this occasion he did sufferalmost to fainting for as he returned home in the afternoon he was forced to lean from time to time against the banks on the roadside while the cold sweat of weakness trickled down his face in order that he might recover strength to go on a few yards but he would persevere if god would but leave to him mind enough for his work he would go on no personal suffering should deter him he told himself that there had been men in the world whose sufferings were sharper even than his own of what sort had been the life of the man who had stood for years on the top of a pillar but then the man on the pillar had been honoured by all around him and thus though he had thought of the man on the pillar to encourage himself by remembering how lamentable had been that mans suffering he came to reflect that after all his own sufferings were perhaps keener than those of the man on the pillar  when he reached home he was very ill there was no doubt about it then he staggered to his armchair and stared at his wife first then smiled at her with a ghastly smile he trembled all over and when food was brought to him he could not eat it early on the next morning the doctor was by his bedside and before that evening came he was delirious he had been at intervals in this state for nearly two days when mrs crawley wrote to grace and though she had restrained herself from telling everything she had written with sufficient strength to bring grace at once to her fathers bedside  he was not so ill when grace arrived but that he knew her and he seemed to receive some comfort from her coming before she had been in the house an hour she was reading greek to him and there was no wandering in his mind as to the due emphasis to be given to the plaints of the injured heroines or as to the proper meaning of the choruses and as he lay with his head half buried in the pillows he shouted out long passages lines from tragic plays by the score and for a while seemed to have all the enjoyment of a dear old pleasure placed newly within his reach but he tired of this after a while and then having looked round to see that his wife was not in the room he began to talk of himself  so you have been at allington my dear  yes papa  is it a pretty place  yes papavery pretty  and they were good to you  yes papavery good  had they heard anything there aboutme of this trial that is to come on  yes papa they had heard of it  and what did they say you need not think that you will shock me by telling me they cannot say worse there than people have said hereor think worse  they dont think at all badly of you at allington papa  but they must think badly of me if the magistrates were right  they suppose that there has been a mistakeas we all think  they do not try men at the assizes for mistakes  that you have been mistaken i meanand the magistrates mistaken  both cannot have been mistaken grace  i dont know how to explain myself papa but we all know that it is very sad and are quite sure that you have never meant for one moment to do anything that was wrong  but people when they areyou know what i mean grace when they are not themselvesdo things that are wrong without meaning it then he paused while she remained standing by him with her hand on the back of his she was looking at his face which had been turned towards her while they were reading together but which now was so far moved that she knew that his eyes could not be fixed upon hers of course if the bishop orders it it shall be so he said it is quite enough for me that he is the bishop  what has the bishop ordered papa  nothing at all it is she who does it he has given no opinion about it of course not he has none to give it is the woman you go and tell her from me that in such a matter i will not obey the word of any woman living go at once when i tell you  then she knew that her fathers mind was wandering and she knelt down by the bedside still holding his hand  grace he said  yes papa i am here  why do you not do what i tell you and he sat upright in his bed i suppose you are afraid of the woman  i should be afraid of her dear papa  i was not afraid of her when she spoke to me i would have nothing to say to hernot a word not a wordnot a word as he said this he waved his hands about but as for himif it must be it must i know im not fit for it of course i am not who is but what has he ever done that he should be a dean i beat him at everything almost at everything he got the newdegate and that was about all upon my word i think that was all  but dr arabin loves you truly dear papa  love me psha does he ever come here to tea as he used to do no i remember buttering toast for him down on my knees before the fire because he liked itand keeping all the cream for him he should have had my hearts blood if he wanted it but nowlook at his books grace its the outside of them he cares about they are all gilt but i doubt if he ever reads as for heri will not allow any woman to tell me my duty noby my maker not even your mother who is the best of women and as for her with her little husband dangling at her apronstrings as a callwhistle to be blown into when she pleasesthat she should dare to teach me my duty no the men in the jurybox may decide it how they will if they can believe a plain story let them if notlet them do as they please i am ready to bear it all  dear papa you are tired will you not try to sleep  tell mrs proudie what i say and as for arabins money i took it i know i took it what would you have had me do shall isee themallstarve then he fell back upon his bed and did sleep  the next day he was better and insisted upon getting out of bed and on sitting in his old armchair over the fire and the greek books were again had out and grace not at all unwillingly was put through her facings if you dont take care my dear he said jane will beat you yet she understands the force of the verbs better than you do  i am very glad that she is doing so well papa i am sure i shall not begrudge her her superiority  ah but you should begrudge it her jane was sitting by at the time and the two sisters were holding each other by the hand always to be bestalways to be in advance of others that should be your motto  but we cant both be best papa said jane  you can both strive to be best but grace has the better voice i remember when i knew the whole of the antigone by heart you girls should see which can learn it first  it would take such a long time said jane  you are young and what can you do better with your leisure hours fie jane i did not expect that from you when i was learning it i had eight or nine pupils and read an hour a day with each of them but i think that nobody works now as they used to work then where is your mamma tell her i think i could get out as far as mrs coxs if she would help me to dress soon after this he was in bed again and his head was wandering but still they knew that he was better than he had been  you are more of a comfort to your papa than i can be said mrs crawley to her eldest daughter that night as they sat together when everybody else was in bed  do not say that mamma papa does not think so  i cannot read greek plays to him as you can do i can only nurse him in his illness and endeavour to do my duty do you know grace that i am beginning to fear that he half doubts me  oh mamma  that he half doubts me and is half afraid of me he does not think as he used to do that i am altogether heart and soul on his side i can see it in his eye as he watches me he thinks that i am tired of himtired of his sufferings tired of his poverty tired of the evil which men say of him i am not sure but what he thinks that i suspect him  of what mamma  of general unfitness for the work he has to do the feeling is not strong as yet but i fear that he will teach himself to think that he has an enemy at his hearthnot a friend it will be the saddest mistake he ever made  he told me today that you were the best of women those were his very words  were they my dear i am glad at least that he should say so to you he has been better since you camea great deal better for one day i was frightened but i am sorry now that i sent for you  i am so glad mamma so very glad  you were happy thereand comfortable and if they were glad to have you why should i have brought you away  but i was not happyeven though they were very good to me how could i be happy there when i was thinking of you and papa and jane here at home whatever there is here i would sooner share it with you than be anywhere elsewhile this trouble lasts  my darlingit is a great comfort to see you again  only that i knew that one less in the house would be a saving to you i should not have gone when there is unhappiness people should stay togethershouldnt they mamma they were sitting quite close to each other on an old sofa in a small upstairs room from which a door opened into the larger chamber in which mr crawley was lying it had been arranged between them that on this night mrs crawley should remain with her husband and that grace should go to her bed it was now past one oclock but she was still there clinging to her mothers side with her mothers arm drawn round her mamma she said when they had both been silent for some ten minutes i have got something to tell you  illustration mamma ive got something to tell you  tonight  yes mamma tonight if you will let me  but you promised that you would go to bed you were up all last night  i am not sleepy mamma  of course you shall tell me what you please dearest is it a secret is it something i am not to repeat  you must say how that ought to be mamma i shall not tell it to any one else  well dear  sit comfortably mammathere like that and let me have your hand its a terrible story to have to tell  a terrible story grace  i mean that you must not draw away from me i shall want to feel that you are quite close to me mamma while i was at allington major grantly came there  did he my dear  yes mamma  did he know them before  no mamma not at the small house but he came thereto see me he asked meto be his wife dont move mamma  my darling child i wont move dearest well and what did you say to him god bless him at any rate may god bless him because he has seen with a true eye and felt with a noble instinct it is something grace to have been wooed by such a man at such a time  mamma it did make me feel proud it did  you had known him well beforeof course i knew that you and he were friends grace  yes we were friends i always liked him i used not to know what to think about him miss anne prettyman told me that it would be so and once before i thought so myself  and had you made up your mind what to say to him  yes i had then but i did not say it  did not say what you had made up your mind to say  that was before all this had happened to papa  i understand you dearest  when miss anne prettyman told me that i should be ready with my answer and when i saw that miss prettyman herself used to let him come to the house and seemed to wish that i should see him when he came and when he once wasso very gentle and kind and when he said that he wanted me to love edith oh mamma  yes darling i know of course you loved him  yes mamma and i do love him how could one not love him  i love himfor loving you  but mamma one is bound not to do a harm to any one that one loves so when he came to allington i told him that i could not be his wife  did you my dear  yes i did was i not right ought i to go to him to bring a disgrace upon all the family just because he is so good that he asks me shall i injure him because he wants to do me a service  if he loves you grace the service he will require will be your love in return  that is all very well mammain books but i do not believe it in reality being in love is very nice and in poetry they make it out to be everything but i do not think i should make major grantly happy if when i became his wife his own father and mother would not see him i know i should be so wretched myself that i could not live  but would it be so  yesi think it would and the archdeacon is very rich and can leave all his money away from major grantly if he pleases think what i should feel if i were the cause of edith losing her fortune  but why do you suppose these terrible things  i have a reason for supposing them this must be a secret miss anne prettyman wrote to me  i wish miss anne prettymans hand had been in the fire  no mamma no she was right would not i have wished do you think to have learned all the truth about the matter before i answered him besides it made no difference i could have made no other answer while papa is under such a terrible ban it is no time for us to think of being in love we have got to love each other isnt it so mamma the mother did not answer in words but slipping down on her knees before her child threw her arms round her girls body in a close embrace dear mamma dearest mamma this is what i wantedthat you should love me  love you my angel  and trust meand that we should understand each other and stand close by each other we can do so much to comfort one anotherbut we cannot comfort other people  he must know that best himself gracebut what did he say more to you  i dont think he said anything more  he just left you then  he said one thing more  and what was that  he saidbut he had no right to say it  what was it dear  that he knew i loved him and that therefore but mamma do not think of that i will never be his wifenever in opposition to his family  but he did not take your answer  he must take it mamma he shall take it if he can be stubborn so can i if he knows how to think of me more than himself i can think of him and edith more than of myself that is not quite all mamma then he wrote to me there is his letter  mrs crawley read the letter i suppose you answered it  yes i answered it it was very bad my letter i should think after that he will never want to have anything more to say to me i tried for two days but i could not write a nice letter  but what did you say  i dont in the least remember it does not in the least signify now but it was such a bad letter  i daresay it was very nice  it was terribly stiff and all about a gentleman  all about a gentleman what do you mean my dear  gentleman is such a frightful word to have to use to a gentleman but i did not know what else to say mamma if you please we wont talk about itnot about the letter i mean as for him ill talk about him for ever if you like it i dont mean to be a bit brokenhearted  it seems to me that he is a gentleman  yes mamma that he is and it is that which makes me so proud when i think of it i can hardly hold myself but now ive told you everything and ill go away and go to bed     chapter xlii  mr toogood travels professionally   illustration  mr toogood paid another visit to barsetshire in order that he might get a little further information which he thought would be necessary before despatching his nephew upon the traces of dean arabin and his wife he went down to barchester after his work was over by an evening train and put himself up at the dragon of wantly intending to have the whole of the next day for his work mr walker had asked him to come and take a return potluck dinner with mrs walker at silverbridge and this he had said that he would do after having rummaged about for tidings in barchester as he called it he would take the train for silverbridge and would get back to town in time for business on the third day one day wont be much you know he said to his partner as he made half an apology for absenting himself on business which was not to be in any degree remunerative that sort of thing is very well when one does it without any expense said crump so it is said toogood and the expense wont make it any worse he had made up his mind and it was not probable that anything mr crump might say would deter him  he saw john eames before he started youll be ready this day week will you john eames promised that he would it will cost you some forty pounds i should say by georgeif you have to go on to jerusalem it will cost you more in answer to this johnny pleaded that it would be as good as any other tour to him he would see the world ill tell you what said toogood ill pay half only you mustnt tell crump and it will be quite as well not to tell maria but johnny would hear nothing of this scheme he would pay the entire cost of his own journey he had lots of money he said and would like nothing better then ill run down said toogood and rummage up what tidings i can as for writing to the dean whats the good of writing to a man when you dont know where he is business letters always lie at hotels for two months and then come back with double postage from all i can hear youll stumble on her before you find him if we do nothing else but bring him back it will be a great thing to have the support of such a friend in the court a barchester jury wont like to find a man guilty who is handandglove with the dean  mr toogood reached the dragon about eleven oclock and allowed the boots to give him a pair of slippers and a candlestick but he would not go to bed just at that moment he would go into the coffeeroom first and have a glass of hot brandyandwater so the hot brandyandwater was brought to him and a cigar and as he smoked and drank he conversed with the waiter the man was a waiter of the ancient class a grayhaired waiter with seedy clothes and a dirty towel under his arm not a dapper waiter with black shiny hair and dressed like a guest for a dinnerparty there are two distinct classes of waiters and as far as i have been able to perceive the special status of the waiter in question cannot be decided by observation of the class of waiter to which he belongs in such a town as barchester you may find the old waiter with the dirty towel in the head inn or in the secondclass inn and so you may the dapper waiter or you may find both in each and not know which is senior waiter and which junior waiter but for service i always prefer the old waiter with the dirty towel and i find it more easy to satisfy him in the matter of sixpences when my relations with the inn come to an end  have you been here long john said mr toogood  a goodish many years sir  so i thought by the look of you one can see that you belong in a way to the place you do a good deal of business here i suppose at this time of the year  well sir pretty fair the house aint what it used to be sir  times are bad at barchesterare they  i dont know much about the times its the people is worse than the times i think they used to like to have a little bit of dinner now and again at a hoteland a drop of something to drink after it  and dont they like it now  i think they like it well enough but they dont do it i suppose its their wives as dont let em come out and enjoy theirselves there used to be the goose and glee clubthat was once a month theyve gone and clean done away with themselvesthat club has theres old bumpter in the high streethes the last of the old geese they died off you see and when mr biddle died they wouldnt choose another president a club for having dinner sir aint nothing without a president  i suppose not  and theres the freemasons they must meet you know sir in course because of the dooties but if youll believe me sir they dont so much as wet their whistles they dont indeed it always used to be a supper and that was once a month now they pays a rent for the use of the room who is to get a living out of that sirnot in the way of a waiter that is  if thats the way things are going on i suppose the servants leave their places pretty often  i dont know about that sir a man may do a deal worse than the dragon of wantly them as goes away to better themselves often worses themselves as i call it ive seen a good deal of that  and you stick to the old shop  yes sir ive been here fifteen year i think it is theres a many goes away as doesnt go out of their own heads you know sir  they get the sack you mean  theres words between them and masteror more likely missus thats where it is servants is so foolish i often tell em how wrong folks are to say that soft words butter no parsnips and hard words break no bones  i think youve lost some of the old hands here since this time last year john  you knows the house then sir  wellive been here before  there was four of them went i think its just about twelve months back sir  there was a man in the yard i used to know and last time i was down here i found that he was gone  there was one of em out of the yard and two out of the house master and them had got to very high words there was poor scuttle who had been postboy at the compasses before he came here  he went away to new zealand didnt he  bleve he did sir or to some foreign parts and anne as was underchambermaid here she went with him fool as she was they got theirselves married and went off and he was well nigh as old as me but seems hed saved a little money and that goes a long way with any girl  was he the man who drove mr soames that day the cheque was lost mr toogood asked this question perhaps a little too abruptly at any rate he obtained no answer to it the waiter said he knew nothing about mr soames or the cheque and the lawyer suspecting that the waiter was suspecting him finished his brandyandwater and went to bed  illustration mr toogood and the old waiter  early on the following morning he observed that he was specially regarded by a shabbylooking man dressed in black but in a black suit that was very old with a red nose whom he had seen in the hotel on the preceding day and he learned that this man was a cousin of the landlordone dan stringerwho acted as a clerk in the hotel bar he took an opportunity also of saying a word to mr stringer the landlordwhom he found to be a somewhat forlorn and gouty individual seated on cushions in a little parlour behind the bar after breakfast he went out and having twice walked round the cathedral close and inspected the front of the palace and looked up at the windows of the prebendaries houses he knocked at the door of the deanery the dean and mrs arabin were on the continent he was told then he asked for mr harding having learned that mr harding was mrs arabins father and that he lived at the deanery mr harding was at home but was not very well the servant said mr toogood however persevered sending up his card and saying that he wished to have a few minutes conversation with mr harding on very particular business he wrote a word upon his card before giving it to the servantabout mr crawley in a few minutes he was shown into the library and had hardly time while looking at the shelves to remember what mr crawley had said of his anger at the beautiful bindings before an old man very thin and very pale shuffled into the room he stooped a good deal and his black clothes were very loose about his shrunken limbs he was not decrepit nor did he seem to be one who had advanced to extreme old age but yet he shuffled rather than walked hardly raising his feet from the ground mr toogood as he came forward to meet him thought that he had never seen a sweeter face there was very much of melancholy in it of that soft sadness of age which seems to acknowledge and in some sort to regret the waning oil of life but the regret to be read in such faces has in it nothing of the bitterness of grief there is no repining that the end has come but simply a touch of sorrow that so much that is dear must be left behind mr harding shook hands with his visitor and invited him to sit down and then seated himself folding his hands together over his knees and he said a few words in a very low voice as to the absence of his daughter and of the dean  i hope you will excuse my troubling you said mr toogood  it is no trouble at allif i could be of any use i dont know whether it is proper but may i ask whether you call asasas a friend of mr crawleys  altogether as a friend mr harding  im glad of that though of course i am well aware that the gentlemen engaged on the prosecution must do their duty stilli dont knowsomehow i would rather not hear them speak of this poor gentleman before the trial  you know mr crawley then  very slightlyvery slightly indeed he is a gentleman not much given to social habits and has been but seldom here but he is an old friend whom my soninlaw loves dearly  im glad to hear you say that mr harding perhaps before i go any further i ought to tell you that mrs crawley and i are firstcousins  oh indeed then you are a friend  i never saw him in my life till a few days ago he is very queer you knowvery queer indeed im a lawyer mr harding practising in londonan attorney that is at each separate announcement mr harding bowed and when toogood named his special branch of his profession mr harding bowed lower than before as though desirous of showing that he had great respect for attorneys and of course im anxious if only out of respect for the family that my wifes cousin should pull through this little difficulty if possible  and for the sake of the poor man himself too and for his wife and his childrenand for the sake of the cloth  exactly taking it all together its such a pity you know i think mr harding he can hardly have intended to steal the money  im sure he did not  its very hard to be sure of anybody mr hardingvery hard  i feel quite sure that he did not he has been a most pious hardworking clergyman i cannot bring myself to think that he is guilty what does the latin proverb say no one of a sudden becomes most base  but the temptation mr harding was very strong he was awfully badgered about his debts that butcher in silverbridge was playing the mischief with him  all the butchers in barsetshire could not make an honest man steal money and i think that mr crawley is an honest man youll excuse me for being a little hot about one of my own order  why hes my cousinor rather my wifes but the fact is mr harding we must get hold of the dean as soon as possible and im going to send a gentleman after him  to send a gentleman after him said mr harding almost in dismay  yes i think that will be best  im afraid hell have to go a long way mr toogood  the dean im told is in jerusalem  im afraid he isor on his journey there hes to be there for the easter week and sunday week will be easter sunday but why should the gentleman want to go to jerusalem after the dean  then mr toogood explained as well as he was able that the dean might have something to say on the subject which would serve mr crawleys defence we shouldnt leave any stone unturned said mr toogood as far as i can judge crawley still thinksor half thinksthat he got the cheque from your soninlaw mr harding shook his head sorrowfully im not saying he did you know continued mr toogood i cant see myself how it is possiblebut still we ought not to leave any stone unturned and mrs arabincan you tell me at all where we shall find her  has she anything to do with it mr toogood  i cant quite say that she has but its just possible as i said before mr harding we mustnt leave a stone unturned theyre not expected here till the end of april  about the 25th or 26th i think  and the assizes are the 28th the judges come into the city on that day it will be too late to wait till then we must have our defence ready you know can you say where my friend will find mrs arabin  mr harding began nursing his knee patting it and being very tender to it as he sat meditating with his head on one sidemeditating not so much as to the nature of his answer as to that of the question could it be necessary that any emissary from a lawyers office should be sent after his daughter he did not like the idea of his eleanor being disturbed by questions as to a theft though she had been twice married and had a son who was now nearly a man still she was his eleanor but if it was necessary on mr crawleys behalf of course it must be done her last address was at paris sir but i think she has gone on to florence she has friends there and she purposes to meet the dean at venice on his return then mr harding turned the table and wrote on a card his daughters address  i suppose mrs arabin must have heard of the affair said mr toogood  she had not done so when she last wrote i mentioned it to her the other day before i knew that she had left paris if my letters and her sisters letters have been sent on to her she must know it now  then mr toogood got up to take his leave you will excuse me for troubling you i hope mr harding  oh sir pray do not mention that it is no trouble if one could only be of any service  one can always try to be of service in these affairs so much is to be done by rummaging about as i always call it there have been many theatrical managers you know mr harding who have usually made up their pieces according to the dresses they have happened to have in their wardrobes  have there indeed now i never should have thought of that  and we lawyers have to do the same thing  not with your clothes mr toogood  not exactly with our clothesbut with our information  i do not quite understand you mr toogood  in preparing a defence we have to rummage about and get up what we can if we cant find anything that suits us exactly we are obliged to use what we do find as well as we can i remember when i was a young man an ostler was to be tried for stealing some oats in the borough and he did steal them too and sold them at a ragshop regularly the evidence against him was as plain as a pikestaff all i could find out was that on a certain day a horse had trod on the fellows foot so we put it to the jury whether the man could walk as far as the ragshop with a bag of oats when he was dead lameand we got him off  did you though said mr harding  yes we did  and he was guilty  he had been at it regularly for months  dear dear dear wouldnt it have been better to have had him punished for the faultgently so as to warn him of the consequences of such doings  our business was to get him offand we got him off its my business to get my cousins husband off if i can and we must do it by hook or crook its a very difficult piece of work because he wont let us employ a barrister however i shall have one in the court and say nothing to him about it at all goodby mr harding as you say it would be a thousand pities that a clergyman should be convicted of a theftand one so well connected too  mr harding when he was left alone began to turn the matter over in his mind and to reflect whether the thousand pities of which mr toogood had spoken appertained to the conviction of the criminal or the doing of the crime if he did steal the money i suppose he ought to be punished let him be ever so much a clergyman said mr harding to himself but yethow terrible it would be of clergymen convicted of fraud in london he had often heard but nothing of the kind had ever disgraced the diocese to which he belonged since he had known it he could not teach himself to hope that mr crawley should be acquitted if mr crawley were guiltybut he could teach himself to believe that mr crawley was innocent something of a doubt had crept across his mind as he talked to the lawyer mr toogood though mrs crawley was his cousin seemed to believe that the money had been stolen and mr toogood as a lawyer ought to understand such matters better than an old secluded clergyman in barchester but nevertheless mr toogood might be wrong and mr harding succeeded in satisfying himself at last that he could not be doing harm in thinking that mr toogood was wrong when he had made up his mind on this matter he sat down and wrote the following letter which he addressed to his daughter at the postoffice in florence      deanery march  186     dearest nelly     when i wrote on tuesday i told you about poor mr    crawley that he was the clergyman in barsetshire of    whose misfortune you read an account in galignanis    messengerand i think susan must have written about it    also because everybody here is talking of nothing else    and because of course we know how strong a regard the    dean has for mr crawley but since that something has    occurred which makes me write to you againat once a    gentleman has just been here and has indeed only this    moment left me who tells me that he is an attorney in    london and that he is nearly related to mrs crawley    he seems to be a very goodnatured man and i daresay he    understands his business as a lawyer his name is toogood    and he has come down as he says to get evidence to help    the poor gentleman on his trial i cannot understand how    this should be necessary because it seems to me that the    evidence should all be wanted on the other side i cannot    for a moment suppose that a clergyman and a gentleman such    as mr crawley should have stolen money and if he is    innocent i cannot understand why all this trouble should    be necessary to prevent a jury finding him guilty     mr toogood came here because he wanted to see the    deanand you also he did not explain as far as i    can remember why he wanted to see you but he said it    would be necessary and that he was going to send off a    messenger to find you first and the dean afterwards it    has something to do with the money which was given to    mr crawley last year and which if i remember right    was your present but of course mr toogood could not    have known anything about that however i gave him the    addressposte restante florenceand i daresay that    somebody will make you out before long if you are still    stopping at florence i did not like letting him go    without telling you about it as i thought that a lawyers    coming to you would startle you     the bairns are quite well as i told you in my other    letter and miss jones says that little elly is as good    as gold they are with me every morning and evening and    behave like darling angels as they are posy is my own    little jewel always you may be quite sure i do nothing to    spoil them     god bless you dearest nelly    your most affectionate father     septimus harding   after this he wrote another letter to his other daughter mrs grantly telling her also of mr toogoods visit and then he spent the remainder of the day thinking over the gravity of the occurrence how terrible would it be if a beneficed clergyman in the diocese should really be found guilty of theft by a jury from the city and then he had always heard so high a character of this man from his soninlaw noit was impossible to believe that mr crawley had in truth stolen a cheque for twenty pounds  mr toogood could get no other information in barchester and went on to silverbridge early in the afternoon he was half disposed to go by hogglestock and look up his cousin whom he had never seen and his cousins husband upon whose business he was now intent but on reflection he feared that he might do more harm than good he had quite appreciated the fact that mr crawley was not like other men the mans not above halfsaved he had said to his wifemeaning thereby to insinuate that the poor clergyman was not in full possession of his wits and to tell the truth of mr toogood he was a little afraid of his relative there was a something in mr crawleys manner in spite of his declared poverty and in spite also of his extreme humility which seemed to announce that he expected to be obeyed when he spoke on any point with authority mr toogood had not forgotten the tone in which mr crawley had said to him sir this thing you cannot do and he thought that upon the whole he had better not go to hogglestock on this occasion  when at silverbridge he began at once to rummage about his chief rummaging was to be done at mr walkers table but before dinner he had time to call upon the magistrates clerk and ask a few questions as to the proceedings at the sitting from which mr crawley was committed he found a very taciturn old man who was nearly as difficult to deal with in any rummaging process as a porcupine but nevertheless at last he reached a state of conversation which was not absolutely hostile mr toogood pleaded that he was the poor mans cousinpleaded that as the family lawyer he was naturally the poor mans protector at such a time as the presentpleaded also that as the poor man was so very poor no one else could come forward on his behalfand in this way somewhat softened the hard sharpness of the old porcupines quills but after all this there was very little to be learned from the old porcupine there was not a magistrate on the bench he said who had any doubt that the evidence was sufficient to justify them in sending the case to the assizes they had all regrettedthe porcupine said in his softest momentthat the gentleman had come there without a legal adviser ah thats been the mischief of it all said mr toogood dashing his hand against the porcupines mahogany table but the facts were so strong mr toogood nobody there to soften em down you know said mr toogood shaking his head very little more than this was learned from the porcupine and then mr toogood went away and prepared for mr walkers dinner  mr walker had invited dr tempest and miss anne prettyman and major grantly to meet mr toogood and had explained in a manner intended to be half earnest and half jocose that though mr toogood was an attorney like himself and was at this moment engaged in a noble way on behalf of his cousins husband without any idea of receiving back even the money which he would be out of pocket still he wasnt quitenot quite you knownot quite so much of a gentleman as i ammr walker would have said had he spoken out freely that which he insinuated but he contented himself with the emphasis he put upon the not quite which expressed his meaning fully and mr walker was correct in his opinion of mr toogood as regards the two attorneys i will not venture to say that either of them was not a perfect gentleman a perfect gentleman is a thing which i cannot define but undoubtedly mr walker was a bigger man in his way than was mr toogood in his and did habitually consort in the county of barsetshire with men of higher standing than those with whom mr toogood associated in london  it seemed to be understood that mr crawley was to be the general subject of conversation and no one attempted to talk about anything else indeed at this time very little else was talked about in that part of the countynot only because of the interest naturally attaching to the question of the suspected guilt of a parish clergyman but because much had become lately known of mr crawleys character and because it was known also that an internecine feud had arisen between him and the bishop it had undoubtedly become the general opinion that mr crawley had picked up and used a cheque which was not his ownthat he had in fact stolen it but there was in spite of that belief a general wish that he might be acquitted and left in his living and when the tidings of mr crawleys victory over the bishop at the palace had become bruited about popular sympathy went with the victor the theft was as it were condoned and people made excuses which were not always rational but which were founded on the instincts of true humanity and now the tidings of another stage in the battle as fought against mr crawley by the bishop had gone forth through the county and men had heard that the rural dean was to be instructed to make inquiries which should be preliminary to proceedings against mr crawley in an ecclesiastical court dr tempest who was now about to meet mr toogood at mr walkers was the rural dean to whom mr crawley would have to submit himself in any such inquiry but dr tempest had not as yet received from the bishop any official order on the subject  we are so delighted to think that you have taken up your cousins case said mrs walker to mr toogood almost in a whisper  he is not just my cousin himself said mr toogood but of course its all the same thing and as to taking up his case you see my dear madam he wont let me take it up  i thought you had i thought you were down here about it  only on the sly mrs walker he has such queer ideas that he will not allow a lawyer to be properly employed and you cant conceive how hard that makes it do you know him mrs walker  we know his daughter grace and then mrs walker whispered something further which we may presume to have been an intimation that the gentleman oppositemajor grantlywas supposed by some people to be very fond of miss grace crawley  quite a child isnt she said toogood whose own daughter now about to be married was three or four years older than grace  shes beyond being a child i think of course she is young  but i suppose this affair will knock all that on the head said the lawyer  i do not know how that may be but they do say he is very much attached to her the major is a man of family and of course it would be very disagreeable if mr crawley were found guilty  very disagreeable indeed but upon my word mrs walker i dont know what to say about it  you think it will go against him mr toogood mr toogood shook his head and on seeing this mrs walker sighed deeply  i can only say that i have heard nothing from the bishop as yet said dr tempest after the ladies had left the room of course if he thinks well to order it the inquiry must be made  but how long would it take asked mr walker  three months i should thinkor perhaps more of course crawley would do all that he could to delay us and i am not at all sure that we should be in any very great hurry ourselves  who are the we doctor said mr walker  i cannot make such an inquiry by myself you know i suppose the bishop would ask me to select two or four other clergymen to act with me thats the usual way of doing it but you may be quite sure of this walker the assizes will be over and the jury have found their verdict long before we have settled our preliminaries  and what will be the good of your going on after that  only this goodif the unfortunate man be convicted  which he wont said mr toogood who thought it expedient to put on a bolder front in talking of the matter to the rural dean than he had assumed in his whispered conversation with mrs walker  i hope not with all my heart said the doctor but perhaps for the sake of the argument the supposition may be allowed to pass  certainly sir said mr toogood for the sake of the argument it may pass  if he be convicted then i suppose there will be an end of the question he would be sentenced for not less i should say than twelve months and after that  and would be as good a parson of hogglestock when he came out of prison as when he went in said mr walker the conviction and judgment in a civil court would not touch his temporality  certainly not said mr toogood  of course not said the doctor we all know that and in the event of mr crawley coming back to his parish it would be open to the bishop to raise the question as to his fitness for the duties  why shouldnt he be as fit as any one else said mr toogood  simply because he would have been found to be a thief said the doctor you must excuse me mr toogood but its only for the sake of the argument  i dont see what that has to do with it said mr toogood he would have undergone his penalty  it is preferable that a man who preaches from a pulpit should not have undergone such a penalty said the doctor but in practice under such circumstanceswhich we none of us anticipate mr toogoodthe living should no doubt be vacated mr crawley would probably hardly wish to come back the jury will do their work before we can do ourswill do it on a much better base than any we can have and when they have done it the thing ought to be finished if the jury acquit him the bishop cannot proceed any further if he be found guilty i think that the resignation of the living must follow  it is all spite then on the bishops part said the major  not at all said the doctor the poor man is weak that is all he is driven to persecute because he cannot escape persecution himself but it may really be a question whether his present proceeding is not right if i were bishop i should wait till the trial was over that is all  from this and from much more that was said during the evening on the same subject mr toogood gradually learned the position which mr crawley and the question of mr crawleys guilt really held in the county and he returned to town resolved to go on with the case  ill have a barrister down express and ill defend him in his own teeth he said to his wife therell be a scene in court i daresay and the man will call upon his own counsel to hold his tongue and shut up his brief and as far as i can see counsel in such a case would have no alternative but there would come an explanationhow crawley was too honourable to employ a man whom he could not pay and there would be a romance and it would all go down with the jury one wants sympathy in such a case as thatnot evidence  and how much will it cost tom said maria dolefully  only a trifle we wont think of that yet theres john eames is going all the way to jerusalem out of his pocket  but johnny hasnt got twelve children tom  one doesnt have a cousin in trouble every day said toogood and then you see theres something very pretty in the case its quite a pleasure getting it up     chapter xliii  mr crosbie goes into the city   ive known the city now for more than ten years mr crosbie and i never knew money to be so tight as it is at this moment the best commercial bills going cant be done under nine and any other kind of paper cant so much as get itself looked at thus spoke mr musselboro he was seated in dobbs broughtons armchair in dobbs broughtons room in hook court on the hind legs of which he was balancing himself comfortably and he was communicating his experience in city matters to our old friend adolphus crosbieof whom we may surmise that he would not have been there at that moment in hook court if things had been going well with him it was now past eleven oclock and he should have been at his office at the west end his position in his office was no doubt high enough to place him beyond the reach of any special inquiry as to such absences but it is generally felt that when the crosbies of the west end have calls into the city about noon things in the world are not going well with them the man who goes into the city to look for money is generally one who does not know where to get money when he wants it mr musselboro on this occasion kept his hat on his head and there was something in the way in which he balanced his chair which was in itself an offence to mr crosbies personal dignity it was hardly as yet two months since mr dobbs broughton had assured him in that very room that there need not be the slightest anxiety about his bill of course it could be renewedthe commission being duly paid as mr dobbs broughton explained on that occasion that was his business there was nothing he liked so much as renewing bills for such customers as mr crosbie and he was very candid at that meeting explaining how he did this branch of his business raising money on his own credit at four or five per cent and lending it on his own judgment at eight or nine mr crosbie did not feel himself then called upon to exclaim that what he was called upon to pay was about twelve perfectly understanding the comfort and grace of euphony but he had turned it over in his mind considering whether twelve per cent was not more than he ought to be mulcted for the accommodation he wanted now at the moment he would have been glad to get it from mr musselboro without further words for twenty  things had much changed with adolphus crosbie when he was driven to make morning visits to such a one as mr musselboro with the view of having a bill renewed for two hundred and fifty pounds in his early life he had always had the merit of being a careful man as to money in some other respects he had gone astray very foolishlyas has been partly explained in our earlier chapters but up to the date of his marriage with lady alexandrina de courcy he had never had dealings in hook court or in any such locality money troubles had then come upon him lady alexandrina being the daughter of a countess had high ideas and when very shortly after his marriage he had submitted to a separation from his noble wife he had found himself and his income to be tied up inextricably in the hands of one mr mortimer gazebee a lawyer who had married one of his wifes sisters it was not that mr gazebee was dishonest nor did crosbie suspect him of dishonesty but the lawyer was so wedded to the interest of the noble family with which he was connected that he worked for them all as an inferior spider might be supposed to work which from the infirmity of its nature was compelled by its instincts to be catching flies always for superior spiders mr mortimer gazebee had in this way entangled mr crosbie in his web on behalf of those noble spiders the de courcys and our poor friend in his endeavour to fight his way through the web had fallen into the hands of the hook court firm of mrs van siever dobbs broughton and musselboro  mr broughton told me when i was last here said crosbie that there would be no difficulty about it  and it was renewed then wasnt it  of course it wasfor two months but he was speaking of a continuation of renewal  im afraid we cant do it mr crosbie im afraid we cant indeed money is so awful tight  of course i must pay what you choose to charge me  it isnt that mr crosbie the bill is out for collection and must be collected in times like these we must draw ourselves in a little you know two hundred and fifty pounds isnt a great deal of money you will say but every little helps you know and besides of course we go upon a system business is business and must not be made pleasure of i should have had a great deal of pleasure in doing this for you but it cant be done in the way of business  when will broughton be here  he may be in at any timei cant say when i suppose hes down at the court now  what court  capel court  i suppose i can see him there said crosbie  if you catch him you can see him of course but what good will that do you mr crosbie i tell you that we cant do it for you if broughton was here this moment it couldnt make the slightest difference  now mr crosbie had an idea that mr musselboro though he sat in dobbs broughtons seat and kept on his hat and balanced his chair on two legs was in truth nothing more than a clerk he did not quite understand the manner in which the affairs of the establishment were worked though he had been informed that mrs van siever was one of the partners that dobbs broughton was the managing man who really did the business he was convinced and he did not therefore like to be answered peremptorily by such a one as musselboro i should wish to see mr broughton he said  you can call againor you can go down to the court if you like it but you may take this as an answer from me that the bill cant be renewed by us at this moment the door of the room was opened and dobbs broughton himself came into it his face was not at all pleasant and any one might have seen with half an eye that the moneymarket was a great deal tighter than he liked it to be here is mr crosbie hereabout that bill said musselboro  mr crosbie must take up his bill thats all said dobbs broughton  but it doesnt suit me to take it up said crosbie  then you must take it up without suiting you said dobbs broughton  it might have been seen i said with half an eye that mr broughton did not like the state of the moneymarket and it might also be seen with the other half that he had been endeavouring to mitigate the bitterness of his dislike by alcoholic aid musselboro at once perceived that his patron and partner was half drunk and crosbie was aware that he had been drinking but nevertheless it was necessary that something more should be said the bill would be due tomorrowwas payable at crosbies bankers and as mr crosbie too well knew there were no funds there for the purpose and there were other purposes very needful for which mr crosbies funds were at the present moment unfortunately by no means sufficient he stood for a few moments thinking what he would dowhether he would leave the drunken man and his office and let the bill take its chance or whether he would make one more effort for an arrangement he did not for a moment believe that broughton himself was subject to any pecuniary difficulty broughton lived in a big house as rich men live and had a name for commercial success it never occurred to crosbie that it was a matter of great moment to dobbs broughton himself that the bill should be taken up crosbie still thought that musselboro was his special enemy and that broughton had joined musselboro in his hostility simply because he was too drunk to know better you might at any rate answer me civilly mr broughton he said  i know nothing about civility with things as they are at present said broughton civil by  theres nothing so civil as paying money when you owe it musselboro reach me down the decanter and some glasses perhaps mr crosbie will wet his whistle  he dont want any winenor you either said musselboro  whats up now said broughton staggering across the room towards a cupboard in which it was his custom to keep a provision of that comfort which he needed at the present moment i suppose i may stand a glass of wine to a fellow in my own room if i like it  i will take no wine thank you said crosbie  then you can do the other thing when i ask a gentleman to take a glass of wine there is no compulsion but about the bill there is compulsion do you understand that you may drink or let it alone but pay you must why mussy what dye thinktheres carter ricketts and carterim blessed if carter just now didnt beg for two months as though two months would be all the world to him and that for a trumpery five hundred pounds i never saw money like it is now never to this appeal musselboro made no reply not caring perhaps at the present moment to sustain his partner he still balanced himself in his chair and still kept his hat on his head even mr crosbie began to perceive that mr musselboros genius was in the ascendant in hook court  i can hardly believe said crosbie that things can be so bad that i cannot have a bill for two hundred and fifty pounds renewed when i am willing to pay for the accommodation i have not done much in the way of bills but i never had one dishonoured yet  dont let this be the first said dobbs broughton  not if i can prevent it said crosbie but to tell you the truth mr broughton my bill will be dishonoured unless i can have it renewed if it does not suit you to do it i suppose you can recommend me to some one who can make it convenient  why dont you go to your bankers said musselboro  i never did ask my bankers for anything of the kind  then you should try what your credit with them is worth said broughton it isnt worth much here as you can perceive ha ha ha  crosbie when he heard this became very angry and musselboro perceiving this got out of his chair so that he might be in readiness to prevent any violence if violence were attempted it really is no good your staying here he said you see that broughton has been drinking theres no knowing what he may say or do  you be blowed said broughton who had taken the armchair as soon as musselboro had left it  but you may believe me in the way of business continued musselboro when i tell you that it really does not suit us to renew the bill were pressed ourselves and we must press others  and who will do it for me said crosbie almost in despair  there are burton and bangles there the winemerchants down in the yard perhaps they may accommodate you its all in their line but im told they charge uncommon dear  i dont know messrs burton and bangles said crosbie  that neednt stand in your way you tell them where you come from and theyll make inquiry if they think its about right theyll give you the money and if they dont they wont  mr crosbie then left the office without exchanging another word with dobbs broughton and went down into hook court as he descended the stairs he turned over in his mind the propriety of going to messrs burton and bangles with the view of relieving himself from his present difficulty he knew that it was ruinous dealings even with such men as dobbs broughton and musselboro whom he presumed to be milder in their greed than burton and bangles were all of them steps on the road to ruin but what was he to do if his bill were dishonoured the fact would certainly become known at his office and he might even ultimately be arrested in the doorway at the bottom of the stairs he stood for some moments looking over at burton and bangles and he did not at all like the aspect of the establishment inside the office he could see a man standing with a cigar in his mouth very resplendent with a new hatwith a hat remarkable for the bold upward curve of its rim and this man was copiously decorated with a chain and seals hanging about widely over his waistcoat he was leaning with his back against the counter and was talking to some one on the other side of it there was something in the mans look and manner that was utterly repulsive to crosbie he was more vulgar to the eye even than musselboro and his voice which crosbie could hear as he stood in the other doorway was almost as detestable as that of dobbs broughton in his drunkenness crosbie did not doubt that this was either burton or bangles and that the man standing inside was either bangles or burton he could not bring himself to accost these men and tell them of his necessities and propose to them that they should relieve him in spite of what musselboro had just said to him he could not believe it possible that he should succeed were he to do so without some introduction so he left hook court and went out into the lane hearing as he went the loud voice of the man with the turnedup hat and the chain  but what was he to do at the outset of his pecuniary troubles when he first found it necessary to litigate some question with the de courcy people and withstand the web which mortimer gazebee wove so assiduously his own attorney had introduced him to dobbs broughton and the assistance which he had needed had come to him at any rate without trouble he did not especially like mr broughton and when mr broughton first invited him to come and eat a little bit of dinner he had told himself with painful remorse that in his early days he had been accustomed to eat his little bits of dinner with people of a different kind but there had been nothing really painful in this since his marriage with a daughter of the de courcysby which marriage he had intended to climb to the highest pinnacle of social eating and drinkinghe had gradually found himself to be falling in the scale of such matters and could bring himself to dine with a dobbs broughton without any violent pain but now he had fallen so low that dobbs broughton had insulted him and he was in such distress that he did not know where to turn for ten pounds mr gazebee had beaten him at litigation and his own lawyer had advised him that it would be foolish to try the matter further in his marriage with the noble daughter of the de courcys he had allowed the framers of the de courcy settlement to tie him up in such a way that now even when chance had done so much for him in freeing him from his wife he was still bound to the de courcy faction money had been paid awayon his behalf as alleged by mr gazebeelike running water money for furniture money for the lease of a house money when he had been separated from his wife money while she was living abroad it had seemed to him that he had been made to pay for the entire support of the female moiety of the de courcy family which had settled itself at badenbaden from the day and in some respects from before the day on which his wife had joined that moiety he had done all in his power to struggle against these payments but every such struggle had only cost him more money mr gazebee had written to him the civilest notes but every note seemed to cost him moneyevery word of each note seemed to find its way into some bill his wife had died and her body had been brought back with all the pomp befitting the body of an earls daughter that it might be laid with the old de courcy dustat his expense the embalming of her dear remains had cost a wondrous sum and was a terrible blow upon him all these items were showered upon him by mr gazebee with the most courteously worded demands for settlement as soon as convenient and then when he applied that lady alexandrinas small fortune should be made over to himaccording to a certain agreement under which he had made over all his possessions to his wife should she have survived himmr gazebee expressed a mild opinion that he was wrong in his law and blandly recommended an amicable lawsuit the amicable lawsuit was carried on his own lawyer seemed to throw him over mr gazebee was successful in everything no money came to him money was demanded from him on old scores and on new scoresand all that he received to console him for what he had lost was a mourning ring with his wifes hairfor which with sundry other mourning rings he had to payand an introduction to mr dobbs broughton to mr dobbs broughton he owed five hundred pounds and as regarded a bill for the onehalf of that sum which was due tomorrow mr dobbs broughton had refused to grant him renewal for a single month  i know no more uncomfortable walking than that which falls to the lot of men who go into the city to look for money and who find none of all the lost steps trodden by men surely the steps lost after that fashion are the most melancholy it is not only that they are so vain but that they are accompanied by so killing a sense of shame to wait about in dingy rooms which look on to bare walls and are approached through some hook court or to keep appointments at a low coffeehouse to which trystings the moneylender will not trouble himself to come unless it pleases him to be civil almost suppliant to a cunning knave whom the borrower loathes to be refused thrice and then cheated with his eyes open on the fourth attempt to submit himself to vulgarity of the foulest kind and to have to seem to like it to be badgered reviled and at last accused of want of honesty by the most fraudulent of mankind and at the same time to be clearly conscious of the ruin that is comingthis is the fate of him who goes into the city to find money not knowing where it is to be found  crosbie went along the lane into lombard street and then he stood still for a moment to think though he knew a good deal of affairs in general he did not quite know what would happen to him if his bill should be dishonoured that somebody would bring it to him noted and require him instantly to put his hand into his pocket and bring out the amount of the bill plus the amount of certain expenses he thought that he did know and he knew that were he in trade he would become a bankrupt and he was well aware that such an occurrence would prove him to be insolvent but he did not know what his creditors would immediately have the power of doing that the fact of the bill having been dishonoured would reach the board under which he servedand therefore also the fact that he had had recourse to such bill transactionsthis alone was enough to fill him with dismay in early life he had carried his head so high he had been so much more than a mere government clerk that the idea of the coming disgrace almost killed him would it not be well that he should put an end to himself and thus escape what was there in the world now for which it was worth his while to live lily whom he had once gained and by that gain had placed himself high in all hopes of happiness and richeswhom he had then thrown away from him and who had again seemed to be almost within his reachlily had so refused him that he knew not how to approach her with a further prayer and had she not refused him how could he have told her of his load of debt as he stood at the corner where the lane runs into lombard street he came for a while to think almost more of lily than of his rejected bill then as he thought of both his misfortunes together he asked himself whether a pistol would not conveniently put an end to them together  at that moment a loud harsh voice greeted his ear hallo crosbie what brings you so far east one does not often see you in the city it was the voice of sir raffle buffle which in former days had been very odious to crosbies earsfor sir raffle buffle had once been the presiding genius of the office to which crosbie still belonged  no indeed not very often said crosbie smiling who can tell who has not felt it the pain that goes to the forcing of such smiles but sir raffle was not an acutely observant person and did not see that anything was wrong  i suppose youre doing a little business said sir raffle if a man has kept a trifle of money by him this certainly is the time for turning it you have always been wide awake about such things  no indeed said crosbie if he could only make up his mind that he would shoot himself would it not be a pleasant thing to inflict some condign punishment on this odious man before he left the world but crosbie knew that he was not going to shoot himself and he knew also that he had no power of inflicting condign punishment on sir raffle buffle he could only hate the man and curse him inwardly  ah ha said sir raffle you wouldnt be here unless you knew where a good thing is to be picked up but i must be off im on the rocky mountain canal company directory im not above taking my two guineas a day goodby my boy remember me to old optimist and so sir raffle passed on leaving crosbie still standing at the corner of the lane  what was he to do this interruption had at least seemed to drive lily from his mind and to send his ideas back to the consideration of his pecuniary difficulties he thought of his own bank a westend establishment at which he was personally known to many of the clerks and where he had been heretofore treated with great consideration but of late his balances had been very low and more than once he had been reminded that he had overdrawn his account he knew well that the distinguished firm of bounce bounce and bounce would not cash a bill for him or lend him money without security he did not even dare to ask them to do so  on a sudden he jumped into a cab and was driven back to his office a thought had come upon him he would throw himself upon the kindness of a friend there hitherto he had contrived to hold his head so high above the clerks below him so high before the commissioners who were above him that none there suspected him to be a man in difficulty it not seldom happens that a mans character stands too high for his interestso high that it cannot be maintained and so high that any fall will be dangerous and so it was with crosbie and his character at the general committee office the man to whom he was now thinking of applying as his friend was a certain mr butterwell who had been his predecessor in the secretarys chair and who now filled the less onerous but more dignified position of a commissioner mr crosbie had somewhat despised mr butterwell and had of late years not been averse to showing that he did so he had snubbed mr butterwell and mr butterwell driven to his wits ends had tried a fall or two with him in all these struggles crosbie had had the best of it and butterwell had gone to the wall nevertheless for the sake of official decency and from certain wise remembrances of the sources of official comfort and official discomfort mr butterwell had always maintained a show of outward friendship with the secretary they smiled and were gracious called each other butterwell and crosbie and abstained from all catanddog absurdities nevertheless it was the frequently expressed opinion of every clerk in the office that mr butterwell hated mr crosbie like poison this was the man to whom crosbie suddenly made up his mind that he would have recourse  as he was driven back to his office he resolved that he would make a plunge at once at the difficulty he knew that butterwell was fairly rich and he knew also that he was goodnaturedwith that sort of sleepy goodnature which is not active for philanthropic purposes but which dislikes to incur the pain of refusing and then mr butterwell was nervous and if the thing was managed well he might be cheated out of an assent before time had been given him in which to pluck up courage for refusing but crosbie doubted his own courage alsofearing that if he gave himself time for hesitation he would hesitate and that hesitating he would feel the terrible disgrace of the thing and not do it so without going to his own desk or ridding himself of his hat he went at once to butterwells room when he opened the door he found mr butterwell alone reading the times butterwell said he beginning to speak before he had even closed the door i have come to you in great distress i wonder whether you can help me i want you to lend me five hundred pounds it must be for not less than three months  mr butterwell dropped the paper from his hands and stared at the secretary over his spectacles     chapter xliv  i suppose i must let you have it   illustration  crosbie had been preparing the exact words with which he assailed mr butterwell for the last quarter of an hour before they were uttered there is always a difficulty in the choice not only of the words with which money should be borrowed but of the fashion after which they should be spoken there is the slow deliberate manner in using which the borrower attempts to carry the wishedfor lender along with him by force of argument and to prove that the desire to borrow shows no imprudence on his own part and that a tendency to lend will show none on the part of the intended lender it may be said that this mode fails oftener than any other there is the piteous mannerthe plea for commiseration my dear fellow unless you will see me through now upon my word i shall be very badly off and this manner may be divided again into two there is the plea piteous with a lie and the plea piteous with a truth you shall have it again in two months as sure as the sun rises that is generally the plea piteous with a lie or it may be as follows it is only fair to say that i dont quite know when i can pay it back this is the plea piteous with a truth and upon the whole i think that this is generally the most successful mode of borrowing and there is the assured demandwhich betokens a close intimacy old fellow can you let me have thirty pounds no just put your name then on the back of this and ill get it done in the city the worst of that manner is that the bill so often does not get itself done in the city then there is the sudden attackthat being the manner to which crosbie had recourse in the present instance that there are other modes of borrowing by means of which youth becomes indebted to age and love to respect and ignorance to experience is a matter of course it will be understood that i am here speaking only of borrowing and lending between the butterwells and crosbies of the world i have come to you in great distress said crosbie i wonder whether you can help me i want you to lend me five hundred pounds mr butterwell when he heard the words dropped the paper which he was reading from his hand and stared at crosbie over his spectacles  five hundred pounds he said dear me crosbie thats a large sum of money  yes it isa very large sum half that is what i want at once but i shall want the other half in a month  i thought that you were always so much above the world in money matters gracious menothing that i have heard for a long time has astonished me more i dont know why but i always thought that you had your things so very snug  crosbie was aware that he had made one very great step towards success the idea had been presented to mr butterwells mind and had not been instantly rejected as a scandalously iniquitous idea as an idea to which no reception could be given for a moment crosbie had not been treated as was the needy knifegrinder and had ground to stand upon while he urged his request i have been so pressed since my marriage he said that it has been impossible for me to keep things straight  but lady alexandrina  yes of course i know i do not like to trouble you with my private affairsthere is nothing i think so bad as washing ones dirty linen in publicbut the truth is that i am only now free from the rapacity of the de courcys you would hardly believe me if i told you what ive had to pay what do you think of two hundred and fortyfive pounds for bringing her body over here and burying it at de courcy  id have left it where it was  and so would i you dont suppose i ordered it to be done poor dear thing if it could do her any good god knows i would not begrudge it we had a bad time of it when we were together but i would have spared nothing for her alive or dead that was reasonable but to make me pay for bringing the body over here when i never had a shilling with her by george it was too bad and that oaf john de courcyi had to pay his travelling bill too  he didnt come to be burieddid he  its too disgusting to talk of butterwell it is indeed and when i asked for her money that was settled upon meit was only two thousand poundsthey made me go to law and it seems there was no two thousand pounds to settle if i like i can have another lawsuit with the sisters when the mother is dead oh butterwell i have made such a fool of myself i have come to such shipwreck oh butterwell if you could but know it all  are you free from the de courcys now  i owe gazebee the man who married the other woman over a thousand pounds but i pay that off at two hundred a year and he has a policy on my life  what do you owe that for  dont ask me not that i mind telling youfurniture and the lease of a house and his bill for the marriage settlementd him  god bless me they seem to have been very hard upon you  a man doesnt marry an earls daughter for nothing butterwell and then to think what i lost it cant be helped now you know as a man makes his bed he must lie on it i am sometimes so mad with myself when i think over it allthat i should like to blow my brains out  you must not talk in that way crosbie i hate to hear a man talk like that  i dont mean that i shall im too much of a coward i fancy a man who desires to soften another mans heart should always abuse himself in softening a womans heart he should abuse her but life has been so bitter with me for the last three years i havent had an hour of comfortnot an hour i dont know why i should trouble you with all this butterwell ohabout the money yes thats just how i stand i owed gazebee something over a thousand pounds which is arranged as i have told you then there were debts due by my wifeat least some of them were i supposeand that horrid ghastly funeraland debts i dont doubt due by the cursed old countess at any rate to get myself clear i raised something over four hundred pounds and now i owe five which must be paid part tomorrow and the remainder this day month  and youve no security  not a rag not a shred not a line not an acre theres my salary and after paying gazebee what comes due to him i can manage to let you have the money within twelve monthsthat is if you can lend it me i can just do that and live and if you will assist me with the money i will do so thats what ive brought myself to by my own folly  five hundred pounds is such a large sum of money  indeed it is  and without any security  i know butterwell that ive no right to ask for it i feel that of course i should pay you what interest you please  moneys about seven now said butterwell  ive not the slightest objection to seven per cent said crosbie  but thats on security said butterwell  you can name your own terms said crosbie  mr butterwell got out of his chair and walked about the room with his hands in his pockets he was thinking at that moment what mrs butterwell would say to him will an answer do tomorrow morning he said i would much rather have it today said crosbie then mr butterwell took another turn about the room i suppose i must let you have it he said  butterwell said crosbie im eternally obliged to you its hardly too much to say that youve saved me from ruin  of course i was joking about interest said butterwell five per cent is the proper thing youd better let me have a little acknowledgment ill give you the first half tomorrow  they were genuine tears which filled crosbies eyes as he seized hold of the seniors hands butterwell he said what am i to say to you  nothing at allnothing at all  your kindness makes me feel that i ought not to have come to you  oh nonsense bytheby would you mind telling thompson to bring those papers to me which i gave him yesterday i promised optimist i would read them before three and its past two now so saying he sat himself down at his table and crosbie felt that he was bound to leave the room  mr butterwell when he was left alone did not read the papers which thompson brought him but sat instead thinking of his five hundred pounds just put them down he said to thompson so the papers were put down and there they lay all that day and all the next then thompson took them away again and it is to be hoped that somebody read them five hundred pounds it was a large sum of money and crosbie was a man for whom mr butterwell in truth felt no very strong affection of course he must have it now he said to himself but where should i be if anything happened to him and then he remembered that mrs butterwell especially disliked mr crosbiedisliked him because she knew that he snubbed her husband but its hard to refuse when one man has known another for more than ten years then he comforted himself somewhat with the reflection that crosbie would no doubt make himself more pleasant for the future than he had done lately and with a second reflection that crosbies life was a good lifeand with a third as to his own great goodness in assisting a brother officer nevertheless as he sat looking out of the omnibuswindow on his journey home to putney he was not altogether comfortable in his mind mrs butterwell was a very prudent woman  but crosbie was very comfortable in his mind on that afternoon he had hardly dared to hope for success but he had been successful he had not even thought of butterwell as a possible fountain of supply till his mind had been brought back to the affairs of his office by the voice of sir raffle buffle at the corner of the street the idea that his bill would be dishonoured and that tidings of his insolvency would be conveyed to the commissioners at his board had been dreadful to him the way in which he had been treated by musselboro and dobbs broughton had made him hate city men and what he supposed to be city ways now there had come to him a relief which suddenly made everything feel light he could almost think of mr mortimer gazebee without disgust perhaps after all there might be some happiness yet in store for him might it not be possible that lily would yet accept him in spite of the chilling letterthe freezing letter which he had received from lilys mother of one thing he was quite certain if ever he had an opportunity of pleading his own cause with her he certainly would tell her everything respecting his own money difficulties  in that last resolve i think we may say that he was right if lily would ever listen to him again at all she certainly would not be deterred from marrying him by his own story of his debts     chapter xlv  lily dale goes to london   one morning towards the end of march the squire rapped at the window of the drawingroom of the small house in which mrs dale and her daughter were sitting he had a letter in his hand and both lily and her mother knew that he had come down to speak about the contents of the letter it was always a sign of goodhumour on the squires part this rapping at the window when it became necessary to him in his gloomy moods to see his sisterinlaw he would write a note to her and she would go across to him at the great house at other times if as lily would say he was just then neither sweet nor bitter he would go round to the front door and knock and be admitted after the manner of ordinary people but when he was minded to make himself thoroughly pleasant he would come and rap at the drawingroom window as he was doing now  ill let you in uncle wait a moment said lily as she unbolted the window which opened out upon the lawn its dreadfully cold so come in as fast as you can  its not cold at all said the squire its more like spring than any morning weve had yet ive been sitting without a fire  you wont catch us without one for the next two months will he mamma you have got a letter uncle is it for us to see  wellyes ive brought it down to show you mary what do you think is going to happen  a terrible idea occurred to mrs dale at that moment but she was much too wise to give it expression could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married i am very bad at guessing said mrs dale you had better tell us  bernard is going to be married said lily  how did you know said the squire  i didnt know i only guessed  then youve guessed right said the squire a little annoyed at having his news thus taken out of his mouth  i am so glad said mrs dale and i know from your manner that you like the match  wellyes i dont know the young lady but i think that upon the whole i do like it its quite time you know that he got married  hes not thirty yet said mrs dale  he will be in a month or two  and who is it uncle  wellas youre so good at guessing i suppose you can guess that  its not that miss partridge he used to talk about  no its not miss partridgeim glad to say i dont believe that the partridges have a shilling among them  then i suppose its an heiress said mrs dale  no not an heiress but she will have some money of her own and she has connexions in barsetshire which makes it pleasant  connexions in barsetshire who can it be said lily  her name is emily dunstable said the squire and she is the niece of that miss dunstable who married dr thorne and who lives at chaldicotes  she was the woman who had millions upon millions said lily all got by selling ointment  never mind how it was got said the squire angrily miss dunstable married most respectably and has always made a most excellent use of her money  and will bernards wife have all her fortune asked lily  she will have twenty thousand pounds the day she marries and i suppose that will be all  and quite enough too said mrs dale  it seems that old dr dunstable as he was called who as lily says sold the ointment quarrelled with his son or with his sons widow and left nothing either to her or her child the mother is dead and the aunt dr thornes wife has always provided for the child thats how it is and bernard is going to marry her they are to be married at chaldicotes in may  i am delighted to hear it said mrs dale  ive known dr thorne for the last forty years and the squire now spoke in a low melancholy tone ive written to him to say that the young people shall have the old place up there to themselves if they like it  what and turn you out said mrs dale  that would not matter said the squire  youd have to come and live with us said lily taking him by the hand  it doesnt matter much now where i live said the squire  bernard will never consent to that said mrs dale  i wonder whether shell ask me to be a bridesmaid said lily they say that chaldicotes is such a pretty place and i should see all the barsetshire people that ive been hearing about from grace poor grace i know that the grantlys and the thornes are very intimate fancy bernard having twenty thousand pounds from the making of ointment  what does it matter to you where it comes from said the squire half in anger  not in the least only it sounds so odd i do hope shes a nice girl  then the squire produced a photograph of emily dunstable which his nephew had sent to him and they all pronounced her to be very pretty to be very much like a lady and to be very goodhumoured the squire was evidently pleased with the match and therefore the ladies were pleased also bernard dale was the heir to the estate and his marriage was of course a matter of moment and as on such properties as that of allington money is always wanted the squire may be forgiven for the great importance which he attached to the young ladys fortune bernard could hardly have married prudently without any money he saidunless he had chosen to wait till i am gone  illustration they pronounced her to be very much like a lady  and then he would have been too old to marry at all said lily  but the squires budget of news had not yet been emptied he told them soon afterwards that he himself had been summoned up to london bernard had written to him begging him to come and see the young lady and the family lawyer had written also saying that his presence in town would be very desirable it is very troublesome of course but i shall go said the squire it will do you all the good in the world said mrs dale and of course you ought to know her personally before the marriage and then the squire made a clean breast of it and declared his full purpose i was thinking that perhaps lily would not object to go up to london with me  oh uncle christopher i should so like it said lily  if your mamma does not object  mamma never objects to anything i should like to see her objecting to that and lily shook her head at her mother  bernard says that miss dunstable particularly wants to see you  does she indeed and i particularly want to see miss dunstable how nice mamma i dont think ive ever been in london since i wore short frocks do you remember taking us to the pantomime only think how many years ago that is im quite sure its time that bernard should get married uncle i hope youre prepared to take me to the play  we must see about that  and the opera and madame tussaud and the horticultural gardens and the new conjuror who makes a woman lie upon nothing the idea of my going to london and then i suppose i shall be one of the bridesmaids i declare a new vista of life is opening out to me mamma you mustnt be dull while im away it wont be very long i suppose uncle  about a month probably said the squire  oh mamma what will you do  never mind me lily  you must get bell and the children to come but i cannot imagine living away from home a month i was never away from home a month in my life  and lily did go up to town with her uncle two days only having been allowed to her for her preparations there was very much for her to think of in such a journey it was not only that she would see emily dunstable who was to be her cousins wife and that she would go to the play and visit the new conjurors entertainment but that she would be in the same city both with adolphus crosbie and with john eames not having personal experience of the wideness of london and of the wilderness which it isof the distance which is set there between persons who are not purposely brought togetherit seemed to her fancy as though for this month of her absence from home she would be brought into close contiguity with both her lovers she had hitherto felt herself to be at any rate safe in her fortress at allington when crosbie had written to her mother making a renewed offer which had been rejected lily had felt that she certainly need not see him unless it pleased her to do so he could hardly force himself upon her at allington and as to john eames though he would of course be welcome at allington as often as he pleased to show himself still there was a security in the place she was so much at home there that she could always be mistress of the occasion she knew that she could talk to him at allington as though from ground higher than that on which he stood himself but she felt that this would hardly be the case if she should chance to meet him in london crosbie probably would not come in her way crosbie she thoughtand she blushed for the man she loved as the idea came across her mindwould be afraid of meeting her uncle but john eames would certainly find her and she was led by the experience of latter days to imagine that john would never cross her path without renewing his attempts  but she said no word of all this even to her mother she was contented to confine her outspoken expectations to emily dunstable and the play and the conjuror the chances are ten to one against my liking her mamma she said  i dont see that my dear  i feel to be too old to think that i shall ever like any more new people three years ago i should have been quite sure that i should love a new cousin it would have been like having a new dress but ive come to think that an old dress is the most comfortable and an old cousin certainly the best  the squire had had taken for them a gloomy lodging in sackville street lodgings in london are always gloomy gloomy colours wear better than bright ones for curtains and carpets and the keepers of lodgings in london seem to think that a certain dinginess of appearance is respectable i never saw a london lodging in which any attempt at cheerfulness had been made and i do not think that any such attempt if made would pay the lodgingseeker would be frightened and dismayed and would unconsciously be led to fancy that something was wrong ideas of burglars and improper persons would present themselves this is so certainly the case that i doubt whether any wellconditioned lodginghouse matron could be induced to show rooms that were prettily draped or pleasantly coloured the big drawingroom and two large bedrooms which the squire took were all that was proper and were as brown and as gloomy and as illsuited for the comforts of ordinary life as though they had been prepared for two prisoners but lily was not so ignorant as to expect cheerful lodgings in london and was satisfied and what are we to do now said lily as soon as they found themselves settled it was still march and whatever may have been the nature of the weather at allington it was very cold in london they reached sackville street about five in the evening and an hour was taken up in unpacking their trunks and making themselves as comfortable as their circumstances allowed and now what are we to do said lily  i told them to have dinner for us at halfpast six  and what after that wont bernard come to us tonight i expected him to be standing on the doorsteps waiting for us with his bride in his hand  i dont suppose bernard will be here tonight said the squire he did not say that he would and as for miss dunstable i promised to take you to her aunts house tomorrow  but i wanted to see her tonight wellof course bridesmaids must wait upon brides and ladies with twenty thousand pounds cant be expected to run about like common people as for bernardbut bernard never was in a hurry then they dined and when the squire had very nearly fallen asleep over a bottle of port wine which had been sent in for him from some neighbouring publichouse lily began to feel that it was very dull and she looked round the room and she thought that it was very ugly and she calculated that thirty evenings so spent would seem to be very long and she reflected that the hours were probably going much more quickly with emily dunstable who no doubt at this moment had bernard dale by her side and then she told herself that the hours were not tedious with her at home while sitting with her mother with all her daily occupations within her reach but in so telling herself she took herself to task inquiring of herself whether such an assurance was altogether true were not the hours sometimes tedious even at home and in this way her mind wandered off to thoughts upon life in general and she repeated to herself over and over again the two words which she had told john eames that she would write in her journal the reader will remember those two wordsold maid and she had written them in her book making each letter a capital and round them she had drawn a scroll ornamented after her own fashion and she had added the date in quaintly formed figuresfor in such matters lily had some little skill and a dash of fun to direct it and she had inscribed below it an italian mottowho goes softly goes safely and above her work of art she had put a headingas arranged by fate for l d now she thought of all this and reflected whether emily dunstable was in truth very happy presently the tears came into her eyes and she got up and went to the window as though she were afraid that her uncle might wake and see them and as she looked out on the blank street she muttered a word or twodear mother dearest mother then the door was opened and her cousin bernard announced himself she had not heard his knock at the door as she had been thinking of the two words in her book  what bernardah yes of course said the squire rubbing his eyes as he strove to wake himself i wasnt sure you would come but im delighted to see you i wish you joy with all my heartwith all my heart  of course i should come said bernard dear lily this is so good of you emily is so delighted then lily spoke her congratulations warmly and there was no trace of a tear in her eyes and she was thoroughly happy as she sat by her cousins side and listened to his raptures about emily dunstable and you will be so fond of her aunt he said  but is she not awfully rich said lily  frightfully rich said bernard but really you would hardly find it out if nobody told you of course she lives in a big house and has a heap of servants but she cant help that  i hate a heap of servants said lily  then there came another knock at the door and who should enter the room but john eames lily for a moment was taken aback but it was only for a moment she had been thinking so much of him that his presence disturbed her for an instant he probably will not know that i am here she had said to herself but she had not yet been three hours in london and he was already with her at first he hardly spoke to her addressing himself to the squire lady julia told me you were to be here and as i start for the continent early tomorrow morning i thought you would let me come and see you before i went  im always glad to see you john said the squirevery glad and so youre going abroad are you  then johnny congratulated his old acquaintance bernard dale as to his coming marriage and explained to them how lady julia in one of her letters had told him all about it and had even given him the number in sackville street i suppose she learned it from you lily said the squire yes uncle she did and then there came questions as to johns projected journey to the continent and he explained that he was going on lawbusiness on behalf of mr crawley to catch the dean and mrs arabin if it might be possible you see sir mr toogood who is mr crawleys cousin and also his lawyer is my cousin too and thats why im going and still there had been hardly a word spoken between him and lily  but youre not a lawyer john are you said the squire  no im not a lawyer myself  nor a lawyers clerk  certainly not a lawyers clerk said johnny laughing  then why should you go asked bernard dale  then johnny had to explain and in doing so he became very eloquent as to the hardships of mr crawleys case you see sir nobody can possibly believe that such a man as that stole twenty pounds  i do not for one said lily  god forbid that i should say he did said the squire  im quite sure he didnt said johnny warming to his subject it couldnt be that such a man as that should become a thief all at once its not human nature sir is it  it is very hard to know what is human nature said the squire  its the general opinion down in barsetshire that he did steal it said bernard dr thorne was one of the magistrates who committed him and i know he thinks so  i dont blame the magistrates in the least said johnny  thats kind of you said the squire  of course youll laugh at me sir but youll see that we shall come out right theres some mystery in it of which we havent got at the bottom as yet and if there is anybody that can help us its the dean  if the dean knows anything why has he not written and told what he knows said the squire  thats what i cant say the dean has not had an opportunity of writing since he heardeven if he has yet heardthat mr crawley is to be tried and then he and mrs arabin are not together its a long story and i will not trouble you with it all but at any rate im going off tomorrow lily can i do anything for you in florence  in florence said lily and are you really going to florence how i envy you  and who pays your expenses said the squire  wellas to my expenses they are to be paid by a person who wont raise any unpleasant questions about the amount  i dont know what you mean said the squire  he means himself said lily  is he going to do it out of his own pocket  he is said lily looking at her lover  im going to have a trip for my own fun said johnny and i shall pick up evidence on the road as im goingthats all  then lily began to take an active part in the conversation and a great deal was said about mr crawley and about grace and lily declared that she would be very anxious to hear any news which john eames might be able to send you know john how fond we are of your cousin grace at allington are we not uncle  yes indeed said the squire i thought her a very nice girl  if you should be able to learn anything that may be of use john how happy you will be  yes i shall said johnny  and i think it so good of you to go john but it is just like you you were always generous soon after that he got up and went it was very clear to him that he would have no moment in which to say a word alone to lily and if he could find such a moment what good would such a word do him it was as yet but a few weeks since she had positively refused him and he too remembered very well those two words which she had told him that she would write in her book as he had been coming to the house he had told himself that his coming would becould be of no use and yet he was disappointed with the result of his visit although she had spoken to him so sweetly  i suppose youll be gone when i come back he said  we shall be here a month said the squire  i shall be back long before that i hope said johnny goodby sir goodby dale goodby lily and he put out his hand to her  goodby john and then she added almost in a whisper i think you are very very right to go how could he fail after that to hope as he walked home that she might still relent and she also thought much of him but her thoughts of him made her cling more firmly than ever to the two words she could not bring herself to marry him but at least she would not break his heart by becoming the wife of any one else soon after this bernard dale went also i am not sure that he had been well pleased at seeing john eames become suddenly the hero of the hour when a young man is going to perform so important an act as that of marriage he is apt to think that he ought to be the hero of the hour himselfat any rate among his own family  early on the next morning lily was taken by her uncle to call upon mrs thorne and to see emily dunstable bernard was to meet them there but it had been arranged that they should reach the house first there is nothing so absurd as these introductions bernard had said you go and look at her and when youve had time to look at her then ill come so the squire and lily went off to look at emily dunstable  you dont mean to say that she lives in that house said lily when the cab was stopped before an enormous mansion in one of the most fashionable of the london squares  i believe she does said the squire  i never shall be able to speak to anybody living in such a house as that said lily a duke couldnt have anything grander  mrs thorne is richer than half the dukes said the squire then the door was opened by a porter and lily found herself within the hall everything was very great and very magnificent and as she thought very uncomfortable presently she heard a loud jovial voice on the stairs mr dale im delighted to see you and this is your niece lily come up my dear there is a young woman upstairs dying to embrace you never mind the umbrella put it down anywhere i want to have a look at you because bernard swears that youre so pretty this was mrs thorne once miss dunstable the richest woman in england and the aunt of bernards bride the reader may perhaps remember the advice which she once gave to major grantly and her enthusiasm on that occasion there she is mr dale what do you think of her said mrs thorne as she opened the door of a small sittingroom wedged in between two large saloons in which emily dunstable was sitting  aunt martha how can you be so ridiculous said the young lady  i suppose it is ridiculous to ask the question to which one really wants to have an answer said mrs thorne but mr dale has in truth come to inspect you and to form an opinion and in honest truth i shall be very anxious to know what he thinksthough of course he wont tell me  the old man took the girl in his arms and kissed her on both cheeks i have no doubt youll find out what i think he said though i should never tell you  i generally do find out what people think she said and so youre lily dale  yes im lily dale  i have so often heard of you particularly of late for you must know that a certain major grantly is a friend of mine we must take care that that affair comes off all right must we not  i hope it will then lily turned to emily dunstable and taking her hand went up and sat beside her while mrs thorne and the squire talked of the coming marriage how long have you been engaged said lily  really engaged about three weeks i think it is not more than three weeks ago  how very discreet bernard has been he never told us a word about it while it was going on  men never do tell i suppose said emily dunstable  of course you love him very dearly said lily not knowing what else to say  of course i do  so do we you know hes almost a brother to us that is to me and my sister we never had a brother of our own and so the morning was passed till lily was told by her uncle to come away and was told also by mrs thorne that she was to dine with them in the square on that day you must not be surprised that my husband is not here she said he is a very odd sort of man and he never comes to london if he can help it     chapter xlvi  the bayswater romance   eames had by no means done his work for that evening when he left mr dale and lily at their lodgings he had other business on hand to which he had promised to give attention and another person to see who would welcome his coming quite as warmly though by no means as pleasantly as lily dale it was then just nine oclock and as he had told miss demolinesmadalina we may as well call her nowthat he would be in porchester terrace by nine at the latest it was incumbent on him to make haste he got into a cab and bid the cabman drive hard and lighting a cigar began to inquire of himself whether it was well for him to hurry away from the presence of lily dale to that of madalina demolines he felt that he was halfashamed of what he was doing though he declared to himself over and over again that he never had said a word and never intended to say a word to madalina which all the world might not hear yet he knew that he was doing amiss he was doing amiss and half repented it and yet he was half proud of it he was most anxious to be able to give himself credit for his constancy to lily dale to be able to feel that he was steadfast in his passion and yet he liked the idea of amusing himself with his bayswater romance as he would call it and was not without something of conceit as he thought of the progress he had made in it love is one thing and amusement is another he said to himself as he puffed the cigarsmoke out of his mouth and in his heart he was proud of his own capacity for enjoyment he thought it a fine thing although at the same moment he knew it to be an evil thingthis hurrying away from the young lady whom he really loved to another as to whom he thought it very likely that he should be called upon to pretend to love her and he sang a little song as he went if she be not fair for me what care i how fair she be that was intended to apply to lily and was used as an excuse for his fickleness in going to miss demolines and he was perhaps too a little conceited as to his mission to the continent lily had told him that she was very glad that he was going that she thought him very right to go the words had been pleasant to his ears and lily had never looked prettier in his eyes than when she had spoken them johnny therefore was rather proud of himself as he sat in the cab smoking his cigar he had moreover beaten his old enemy sir raffle buffle in another contest and he felt that the world was smiling on himthat the world was smiling on him in spite of his cruel fate in the matter of his real lovesuit  there was a mystery about the bayswater romance which was not without its allurement and a portion of the mystery was connected with madalinas mother lady demolines was very rarely seen and john eames could not quite understand what was the manner of life of that unfortunate lady her daughter usually spoke of her with affectionate regret as being unable to appear on that particular occasion on account of some passing malady she was suffering from a nervous headache or was afflicted with bronchitis or had been touched with rheumatism so that she was seldom on the scene when johnny was passing his time at porchester terrace and yet he heard of her dining out and going to plays and operas and when he did chance to see her he found that she was a sprightly old woman enough i will not venture to say that he much regretted the absence of lady demolines or that he was keenly alive to the impropriety of being left alone with the gentle madalina but the customary absence of the elder lady was an incident in the romance which did not fail to strike him  madalina was alone when he was shown up into the drawingroom on the evening of which we are speaking  mr eames she said will you kindly look at that watch which is lying on the table she looked full at him with her great eyes wide open and the tone of her voice was intended to show him that she was aggrieved  yes i see it said john looking down on miss demolines little gold geneva watch with which he had already made sufficient acquaintance to know that it was worth nothing shall i give it you  no mr eames let it remain there that it may remind me if it does not remind you by how long a time you have broken your word  upon my word i couldnt help itupon my honour i couldnt  upon your honour mr eames  i was obliged to go and see a friend who has just come to town from my part of the country  that is the friend i suppose of whom i have heard from maria it is to be feared that conway dalrymple had not been so guarded as he should have been in some of his conversations with mrs dobbs broughton and that a word or two had escaped from him as to the love of john eames for lily dale  i dont know what you may have heard said johnny but i was obliged to see these people before i left town there is going to be a marriage and all that sort of thing  who is going to be married  one captain dale is going to be married to one miss dunstable  oh and as to one miss lily daleis she to be married to anybody  not that i have heard of said johnny  she is not going to become the wife of one mr john eames  he did not wish to talk to miss demolines about lily dale he did not choose to disown the imputation or to acknowledge its truth  silence gives consent she said if it be so i congratulate you i have no doubt she is a most charming young woman it is about seven years i believe since that little affair with mr crosbie and therefore that i suppose may be considered as forgotten  it is only three years said johnny angrily besides i dont know what that has to do with it  you need not be ashamed said madalina i have heard how well you behaved on that occasion you were quite the preux chevalier and if any gentleman ever deserved well of a lady you deserved well of her i wonder how mr crosbie felt when he met you the other day at marias i had not heard anything about it then or i should have been much more interested in watching your meeting  i really cant say how he felt  i daresay not but i saw him shake hands with you and so lily dale has come to town  yesmiss dale is here with her uncle  and you are going away tomorrow  yesand i am going away tomorrow  after that there was a pause in the conversation eames was sick of it and was very anxious to change the conversation miss demolines was sitting in the shadow away from the light with her face half hidden by her hands at last she jumped up and came round and stood opposite to him i charge you to tell me truly john eames she said whether miss lilian dale is engaged to you as your future wife he looked up into her face but made no immediate answer then she repeated her demand i ask you whether you are engaged to marry miss lilian dale and i expect a reply  what makes you ask me such a question as that  what makes me ask you do you deny my right to feel so much interest in you as to desire to know whether you are about to be married of course you can decline to tell me if you choose  and if i were to decline  i should know then that it was true and i should think that you were a coward  i dont see any cowardice in the matter one does not talk about that kind of thing to everybody  upon my word mr eames you are complimentaryindeed you are to everybody i am everybodyam i that is your idea offriendship you may be sure that after that i shall ask no further questions  i didnt mean it in the way youve taken it madalina  in what way did you mean it sir everybody mr eames you must excuse me if i say that i am not well enough this evening to bear the company ofeverybody i think you had better leave me i think that you had better go  are you angry with me  yes i amvery angry because i have condescended to feel an interest in your welfare and have asked you a question which i thought that our intimacy justified you tell me that that is a kind of thing that you will not talk about toeverybody i beg you to understand that i will not be your everybody mr eames there is the door  things had now become very serious hitherto johnny had been seated comfortably in the corner of a sofa and had not found himself bound to move though miss demolines was standing before him but now it was absolutely necessary that he should do something he must either go or else he must make entreaty to be allowed to remain would it not be expedient that he should take the lady at her word and escape she was still pointing to the door and the way was open to him if he were to walk out now of course he would never return and there would be the end of the bayswater romance if he remained it might be that the romance would become troublesome he got up from his seat and had almost resolved that he would go had she not somewhat relaxed the majesty of her anger as he rose had the fire of her eye not been somewhat quenched and the lines of her mouth softened i think that he would have gone the romance would have been over and he would have felt that it had come to an inglorious end but it would have been well for him that he should have gone though the fire was somewhat quenched and the lines were somewhat softened she was still pointing to the door do you mean it he said  i do mean itcertainly  and this is to be the end of everything  i do not know what you mean by everything it is a very little everything to you i should say i do not quite understand your everything and your everybody  i will go if you wish me to go of course  i do wish it  but before i go you must permit me to excuse myself i did not intend to offend you i merely meant  you merely meant give me an honest answer to a downright question are you engaged to miss lilian dale  noi am not  upon your honour  do you think that i would tell you a falsehood about it what i meant was that it is a kind of thing one doesnt like talking about merely because stories are bandied about people are so fond of saying that this man is engaged to that woman and of making up tales and it seems to be so foolish to contradict such things  but you know that you used to be very fond of her  he had taken up his hat when he had risen from the sofa and was still standing with it ready in his hand he was even now halfminded to escape and the name of lily dale in miss demolines mouth was so distasteful to him that he would have done sohe would have gone in sheer disgust had she not stood in his way so that he could not escape without moving her or going round behind the sofa she did not stir to make way for him and it may be that she understood that he was her prisoner in spite of her late command to him to go it may be also that she understood his vexation and the cause of it and that she saw the expediency of leaving lily dale alone for the present at any rate she pressed him no more upon the matter are we to be friends again she said  i hope so replied johnny  there is my hand then so johnny took her hand and pressed it and held it a little whilejust long enough to seem to give a meaning to the action you will get to understand me some day she said and will learn that i do not like to be reckoned among the everybodies by those for whom i reallyreallyreally have a regard when i am angry i am angry  you were very angry just now when you showed me the way to the door  and i meant it toofor the minute only thinksupposing you had gone we should never have seen each other againnever never what a change one word may make  one word often does make a change  does it not just a little yes or no a no is said when a yes is meant and then there comes no second chance and what a change that may be from bright hopes to desolation or worse again a yes is said when a no should be saidwhen the speaker knows that it should be no what a difference that no makes when one thinks of it one wonders that a woman should ever say anything but no  they never did say anything else to me said johnny  i dont believe it i daresay the truth is you never asked anybody  did anybody ever ask you  what would you give to know but i will tell you franklyyes and onceonce i thought that my answer would not have been a no  but you changed your mind  when the moment came i could not bring myself to say the word that should rob me of my liberty for ever i had said no to him often enough beforepoor fellow and on this occasion he told me that he asked for the last time i shall not give myself another chance he said for i shall be on board ship within a week i merely bade him goodby it was the only answer i gave him he understood me and since that day his foot has never pressed his native soil  and was it all because you are so fond of your liberty said johnny  perhapsi did notlove him said miss demolines thoughtfully she was now again seated in her chair and john eames had gone back to his corner of the sofa if i had really loved him i suppose it would have been otherwise he was a gallant fellow and had two thousand a year of his own in india stock and other securities  dear me and he has not married yet  he wrote me word to say that he would never marry till i was marriedbut that on the day that he should hear of my wedding he would go to the first single woman near him and propose it was a droll thing to say was it not  the single woman ought to feel herself flattered  he would find plenty to accept him besides being so well off he was a very handsome fellow and is connected with people of title he had everything to recommend him  and yet you refused him so often  yes you think i was foolishdo you not  i dont think you were at all foolish if you didnt care for him  it was my destiny i suppose i daresay i was wrong other girls marry without violent love and do very well afterwards look at maria clutterbuck  the name of maria clutterbuck had become odious to john eames as long as miss demolines would continue to talk about herself he could listen with some amount of gratification conversation on that subject was the natural progress of the bayswater romance and if madalina would only call her friend by her present name he had no strong objection to an occasional mention of the lady but the combined names of maria clutterbuck had come to be absolutely distasteful to him he did not believe in the maria clutterbuck friendshipeither in its past or present existence as described by madalina indeed he did not put strong faith in anything that madalina said to him in the handsome gentleman with two thousand a year he did not believe at all but the handsome gentleman had only been mentioned once in the course of his acquaintance with miss demolines whereas maria clutterbuck had come up so often upon my word i must wish you goodby he said it is going on for eleven oclock and i have to start tomorrow at seven  what difference does that make  a fellow wants to get a little sleep you know  go thengo and get your sleep what a sleepyheaded generation it is johnny longed to ask her whether the last generation was less sleepyheaded and whether the gentleman with two thousand a year had sat up talking all night before he pressed his foot for the last time on his native soil but he did not dare as he said to himself afterwards it would not do to bring the bayswater romance too suddenly to its termination but before you go she continued i must say the word to you about that picture did you speak to mr dalrymple  i did not i have been so busy with different things that i have not seen him  and now you are going  wellto tell the truth i think i shall see him tonight in spite of my being so sleepyheaded i wrote him a line that i would look in and smoke a cigar with him if he chanced to be at home  and that is why you want to go a gentleman cannot live without his cigar now  it is especially at your bidding that i am going to see him  go thenand make your friend understand that if he continues this picture of his he will bring himself to great trouble and will probably ruin the woman for whom he professes i presume to feel something like friendship you may tell him that mrs van siever has already heard of it  who told her demanded johnny  never mind you need not look at me like that it was not i do you suppose that secrets can be kept when so many people know them every servant in marias house knows all about it  as for that i dont suppose mrs broughton makes any great secret of it  do you think she has told mr broughton i am sure she has not i may say i know she has not maria clutterbuck is infatuated there is no other excuse to be made for her  goodby said johnny hurriedly  and you really are going  wellyes i suppose so  go then i have nothing more to say to you  i shall come and call directly i return said johnny  you may do as you please about that sir  do you mean that you wont be glad to see me again  i am not going to flatter you mr eames mamma will be well by that time i hope and i do not mind telling you that you are a favourite with her johnny thought that this was particularly kind as he had seen so very little of the old lady if you choose to call upon her said madalina of course she will be glad to see you  but i was speaking of yourself you know and johnny permitted himself for a moment to look tenderly at her  then from myself pray understand that i will say nothing to flatter your selflove  i thought you would be kinder just when i was going away  i think i have been quite kind enough as you observed yourself just now it is nearly eleven oclock and i must ask you to go away bon voyage and a happy return to you  and you will be glad to see me when i am back tell me that you will be glad to see me  i will tell you nothing of the kind mr eames if you do i will be very angry with you and then he went  on his way back to his own lodgings he did call on conway dalrymple and in spite of his need for early rising sat smoking with the artist for an hour if you dont take care young man said his friend you will find yourself in a scrape with your madalina  what sort of a scrape  as you walk away from porchester terrace some fine day you will have to congratulate yourself on having made a successful overture towards matrimony  you dont think i am such a fool as that comes to  other men as wise as you have done the same sort of thing miss demolines is very clever and i daresay you find it amusing  it isnt so much that shes clever and i can hardly say that it is amusing one gets awfully tired of it you know but a fellow must have something to do and that is as good as anything else  i suppose you have not heard that one young man levanted last year to save himself from a breach of promise case  i wonder whether he had any money in indian securities  what makes you ask that  nothing particular  whatever little he had he chose to save and i think i heard that he went to canada his name was shorter and they say that on the eve of his going madalina sent him word that she had no objection to the colonies and that under the pressing emergency of his expatriation she was willing to become mrs shorter with more expedition than usually attends fashionable weddings shorter however escaped and has never been seen back again  eames declared that he did not believe a word of it nevertheless as he walked home he came to the conclusion that mr shorter must have been the handsome gentleman with indian securities to whom no had been said once too often  while sitting with conway dalrymple he had forgotten to say a word about jael and sisera     chapter xlvii  dr tempest at the palace   illustration  intimation had been sent from the palace to dr tempest of silverbridge of the bishops intention that a commission should be held by him as rural dean with other neighbouring clergymen as assessors with him that inquiry might be made on the part of the church into the question of mr crawleys guilt it must be understood that by this time the opinion had become very general that mr crawley had been guiltythat he had found the cheque in his house and that he had after holding it for many months succumbed to temptation and applied it to his own purposes but various excuses were made for him by those who so believed in the first place it was felt by all who really knew anything of the mans character that the very fact of his committing such a crime proved him to be hardly responsible for his actions he must have known had not all judgment in such matters been taken from him that the cheque would certainly be traced back to his hands no attempt had been made in the disposing of it to dispose of it in such a way that the trace should be obliterated he had simply given it to a neighbour with a direction to have it cashed and had written his own name on the back of it and therefore though there could be no doubt as to the theft in the mind of those who supposed that he had found the cheque in his own house yet the guilt of the theft seemed to be almost annihilated by the folly of the thief and then his poverty and his struggles and the sufferings of his wife were remembered and stories were told from mouth to mouth of his industry in his profession of his great zeal among those brickmakers of hoggle end of acts of charity done by him which startled the people of the district into admirationhow he had worked with his own hands for the sick poor to whom he could not give relief in money turning a womans mangle for a couple of hours and carrying a boys load along the lanes dr tempest and others declared that he had derogated from the dignity of his position as an english parish clergyman by such acts but nevertheless the stories of these deeds acted strongly on the minds of both men and women creating an admiration for mr crawley which was much stronger than the condemnation of his guilt  even mrs walker and her daughter and the miss prettymans had so far given way that they had ceased to asseverate their belief in mr crawleys innocence they contented themselves now with simply expressing a hope that he would be acquitted by a jury and that when he should be so acquitted the thing might be allowed to rest if he had sinned no doubt he had repented and then there were serious debates whether he might not have stolen the money without much sin being mad or halfmadtouched with madness when he took it and whether he might not in spite of such temporary touch of madness be well fitted for his parish duties sorrow had afflicted him grievously but that sorrow though it had incapacitated him for the management of his own affairs had not rendered him unfit for the ministrations of his parish such were the arguments now used in his favour by the women around him and the men were not keen to contradict them the wish that he should be acquitted and allowed to remain in his parsonage was very general  when therefore it became known that the bishop had decided to put on foot another investigation with the view of bringing mr crawleys conduct under ecclesiastical condemnation almost everybody accused the bishop of persecution the world of the diocese declared that mrs proudie was at work and that the bishop himself was no better than a puppet it was in vain that certain clearheaded men among the clergy of whom dr tempest himself was one pointed out that the bishop after all might perhaps be rightthat if mr crawley were guilty and if he should be found to have been so by a jury it might be absolutely necessary that an ecclesiastical court should take some cognizance of the crime beyond that taken by the civil law the jury said dr tempest discussing the case with mr robarts and other clerical neighboursthe jury may probably find him guilty and recommend him to mercy the judge will have heard his character and will have been made acquainted with his manner of life and will deal as lightly with the case as the law will allow him for aught i know he may be imprisoned for a month i wish it might be for no more than a dayor an hour but when he comes out from his months imprisonmenthow then surely it should be a case for ecclesiastical inquiry whether a clergyman who has committed a theft should be allowed to go into his pulpit directly he comes out of prison but the answer to this was that mr crawley always had been a good clergyman was a good clergyman at this moment and would be a good clergyman when he did come out of prison  but dr tempest though he had argued in this way was by no means eager for the commencement of the commission over which he was to be called upon to preside in spite of such arguments as the above which came from the mans head when his head was brought to bear upon the matter there was a thorough desire within his heart to oppose the bishop he had no strong sympathy with mr crawley as had others he would have had mr crawley silenced without regret presuming mr crawley to have been guilty but he had a much stronger feeling with regard to the bishop had there been any question of silencing the bishopcould it have been possible to take any steps in that directionhe would have been very active it may therefore be understood that in spite of his defence of the bishops present proceedings as to the commission he was anxious that the bishop should fail and anxious to put impediments in the bishops way should it appear to him that he could do so with justice dr tempest was well known among his parishioners to be hard and unsympathetic some said unfeeling also and cruel but it was admitted by those who disliked him the most that he was both practical and just and that he cared for the welfare of many though he was rarely touched by the misery of one such was the man who was rector of silverbridge and rural dean in the district and who was now called upon by the bishop to assist him in making further inquiry as to this wretched cheque for twenty pounds  once at this period archdeacon grantly and dr tempest met each other and discussed the question of mr crawleys guilt both these men were inimical to the present bishop of the diocese and both had perhaps respected the old bishop beyond all other men but they were different in this that the archdeacon hated dr proudie as a partisanwhereas dr tempest opposed the bishop on certain principles which he endeavoured to make clear at any rate to himself wrong said the archdeacon speaking of the bishops intention of issuing a commissionof course he is wrong how could anything right come from him or from her i should be sorry to have to do his bidding  i think you are a little hard upon bishop proudie said dr tempest  one cannot be hard upon him said the archdeacon he is so scandalously weak and she is so radically vicious that they cannot but be wrong together the very fact that such a man should be a bishop among us is to me terribly strong evidence of evil days coming  you are more impulsive than i am said dr tempest in this case i am sorry for the poor man who is i am sure honest in the main but i believe that in such a case your father would have done just what the present bishop is doingthat he could have done nothing else and as i think that dr proudie is right i shall do all that i can to assist him in the commission  the bishops secretary had written to dr tempest telling him of the bishops purpose and now in one of the last days of march the bishop himself wrote to dr tempest asking him to come over to the palace the letter was worded most courteously and expressed very feelingly the great regret which the writer felt at being obliged to take these proceedings against a clergyman in his diocese bishop proudie knew how to write such a letter by the writing of such letters and by the making of speeches in the same strain he had become bishop of barchester now in this letter he begged dr tempest to come over to him saying how delighted mrs proudie would be to see him at the palace then he went on to explain the great difficulty which he felt and great sorrow also in dealing with this matter of mr crawley he looked therefore confidently for dr tempests assistance thinking to do the best for mr crawley and anxious to enable mr crawley to remain in quiet retirement till the trial should be over he had sent a clergyman over to hogglestock who would have relieved mr crawley from the burden of the churchservicesbut mr crawley would have none of this relief mr crawley had been obstinate and overbearing and had persisted in claiming his right to his own pulpit therefore was the bishop obliged to interfere legally and therefore was he under the necessity of asking dr tempest to assist him would dr tempest come over on the monday and stay till the wednesday  the letter was a very good letter and dr tempest was obliged to do as he was asked he so far modified the bishops proposition that he reduced the sojourn at the palace by one night he wrote to say that he would have the pleasure of dining with the bishop and mrs proudie on the monday but would return home on the tuesday as soon as the business in hand would permit him i shall get on very well with him he said to his wife before he started but i am afraid of the woman if she interferes there will be a row then my dear said his wife there will be a row for i am told that she always interferes on reaching the palace about halfanhour before dinnertime dr tempest found that other guests were expected and on descending to the great yellow drawingroom which was used only on state occasions he encountered mrs proudie and two of her daughters arrayed in a full panoply of female armour she received him with her sweetest smiles and if there had been any former enmity between silverbridge and the palace it was now all forgotten she regretted greatly that mrs tempest had not accompanied the doctorfor mrs tempest also had been invited but mrs tempest was not quite as well as she might have been the doctor had said and very rarely slept away from home and then the bishop came in and greeted his guest with his pleasantest goodhumour it was quite a sorrow to him that silverbridge was so distant and that he saw so little of dr tempest but he hoped that that might be somewhat mended now and that leisure might be found for social delightsto all which dr tempest said but little bowing to the bishop at each separate expression of his lordships kindness  there were guests there that evening who did not often sit at the bishops table the archdeacon and mrs grantly had been summoned from plumstead and had obeyed the summons great as was the enmity between the bishop and the archdeacon it had never quite taken the form of open palpable hostility each therefore asked the other to dinner perhaps once every year and each went to the other perhaps once in two years and dr thorne from chaldicotes was there but without his wife who in these days was up in london mrs proudie always expressed a warm friendship for mrs thorne and on this occasion loudly regretted her absence you must tell her dr thorne how exceedingly much we miss her dr thorne who was accustomed to hear his wife speak of her dear friend mrs proudie with almost unmeasured ridicule promised that he would do so we are so sorry the luftons couldnt come to us said mrs proudienot alluding to the dowager of whom it was well known that no earthly inducement would have sufficed to make her put her foot within mrs proudies roombut one of the children is ill and she could not leave him but the greshams were there from boxall hill and the thornes from ullathorne and with the exception of a single chaplain who pretended to carve dr tempest and the archdeacon were the only clerical guests at the table from all which dr tempest knew that the bishop was anxious to treat him with special consideration on the present occasion  the dinner was rather long and ponderous and occasionally almost dull the archdeacon talked a good deal but a bystander with an acute ear might have understood from the tone of his voice that he was not talking as he would have talked among friends mrs proudie felt this and understood it and was angry she could never find herself in the presence of the archdeacon without becoming angry her accurate ear would always appreciate the defiance of episcopal authority as now existing in barchester which was concealed or only half concealed by all the archdeacons words but the bishop was not so keen nor so easily roused to wrath and though the presence of his enemy did to a certain degree cow him he strove to fight against the feeling with renewed goodhumour  you have improved so upon the old days said the archdeacon speaking of some small matter with reference to the cathedral that one hardly knows the old place  i hope we have not fallen off said the bishop with a smile  we have improved dr grantly said mrs proudie with great emphasis on her words what you say is true we have improved  not a doubt about that said the archdeacon then mrs grantly interposed strove to change the subject and threw oil upon the waters  talking of improvements said mrs grantly what an excellent row of houses they have built at the bottom of high street i wonder who is to live in them  i remember when that was the very worst part of the town said dr thorne  and now theyre asking seventy pounds apiece for houses which did not cost above six hundred each to build said mr thorne of ullathorne with that seeming dislike of modern success which is evinced by most of the elders of the world  and who is to live in them asked mrs grantly  two of them have been already taken by clergymen said the bishop in a tone of triumph  yes said the archdeacon and the houses in the close which used to be the residences of the prebendaries have been leased out to tallowchandlers and retired brewers that comes of the working of the ecclesiastical commission  and why not demanded mrs proudie  why not indeed if you like to have tallowchandlers next door to you said the archdeacon in the old days we would sooner have had our brethren near to us  there is nothing dr grantly so objectionable in a cathedral town as a lot of idle clergymen said mrs proudie  it is beginning to be a question to me said the archdeacon whether there is any use in clergymen at all for the present generation  dr grantly those cannot be your real sentiments said mrs proudie then mrs grantly working hard in her vocation as a peacemaker changed the conversation again and began to talk of the american war but even that was made matter of discord on church mattersthe archdeacon professing an opinion that the southerners were christian gentlemen and the northerners infidel snobs whereas mrs proudie had an idea that the gospel was preached with genuine zeal in the northern states and at each such outbreak the poor bishop would laugh uneasily and say a word or two to which no one paid much attention and so the dinner went on not always in the most pleasant manner for those who preferred continued social goodhumour to the occasional excitement of a halfsuppressed battle  not a word was said about mr crawley when mrs proudie and the ladies had left the diningroom the bishop strove to get up a little lay conversation he spoke to mr thorne about his game and to dr thorne about his timber and even to mr gresham about his hounds it is not so very many years mr gresham said he since the bishop of barchester was expected to keep hounds himself and the bishop laughed at his own joke  your lordship shall have them back at the palace next season said young frank gresham if you will promise to do the county justice  ha ha ha laughed the bishop what do you say mr tozer mr tozer was the chaplain on duty  i have not the least objection in the world my lord said mr tozer to act as second whip  im afraid youll find them an expensive adjunct to the episcopate said the archdeacon and then the joke was over for there had been a rumour now for some years prevalent in barchester that bishop proudie was not liberal in his expenditure as mr thorne said afterwards to his cousin the doctor the archdeacon might have spared that sneer the archdeacon will never spare the man who sits in his fathers seat said the doctor the pity of it is that men who are so thoroughly different in all their sympathies should ever be brought into contact dear dear said the archdeacon as he stood afterwards on the rug before the drawingroom fire how many rubbers of whist i have seen played in this room i sincerely hope that you will never see another played here said mrs proudie im quite sure that i shall not said the archdeacon for this last sally his wife scolded him bitterly on their way home you know very well she said that the times are changed and that if you were bishop of barchester yourself you would not have whist played in the palace i only know said he that when we had the whist we had some true religion along with it and some good sense and good feeling also you cannot be right to sneer at others for doing what you would do yourself said his wife then the archdeacon threw himself sulkily into the corner of his carriage and nothing more was said between him and his wife about the bishops dinnerparty  not a word was spoken that night at the palace about mr crawley and when that obnoxious guest from plumstead was gone mrs proudie resumed her goodhumour towards dr tempest so intent was she on conciliating him that she refrained even from abusing the archdeacon whom she knew to have been intimate for very many years with the rector of silverbridge in her accustomed moods she would have broken forth in loud anger caring nothing for old friendships but at present she was thoughtful of the morrow and desirous that dr tempest should if possible meet her in a friendly humour when the great discussion as to hogglestock should be opened between them but dr tempest understood her bearing and as he pulled on his nightcap made certain resolutions of his own as to the morrows proceedings i dont suppose she will dare to interfere he had said to his wife but if she does i shall certainly tell the bishop that i cannot speak on the subject in her presence  at breakfast on the following morning there was no one present but the bishop mrs proudie and dr tempest very little was said at the meal mr crawleys name was not mentioned but there seemed to be a general feeling among them that there was a task hanging over them which prevented any general conversation the eggs were eaten and the coffee was drunk but the eggs and the coffee disappeared almost in silence when these ceremonies had been altogether completed and it was clearly necessary that something further should be done the bishop spoke dr tempest he said perhaps you will join me in my study at eleven we can then say a few words to each other about the unfortunate matter on which i shall have to trouble you dr tempest said he would be punctual to his appointment and then the bishop withdrew muttering something as to the necessity of looking at his letters dr tempest took a newspaper in his hand which had been brought in by a servant but mrs proudie did not allow him to read it dr tempest she said this is a matter of most vital importance i am quite sure that you feel that it is so  what matter madam said the doctor  this terrible affair of mr crawleys if something be not done the whole diocese will be disgraced then she waited for an answer but receiving none she was obliged to continue of the poor mans guilt there can i fear be no doubt then there was another pause but still the doctor made no answer and if he be guilty said mrs proudie resolving that she would ask a question that must bring forth some reply can any experienced clergyman think that he can be fit to preach from the pulpit of a parish church i am sure that you must agree with me dr tempest consider the souls of the people  mrs proudie said he i think that we had better not discuss the matter  not discuss it  i think that we had better not do so if i understand the bishop aright he wishes that i should take some step in the matter  of course he does  and therefore i must decline to make it a matter of common conversation  common conversation dr tempest i should be the last person in the world to make it a matter of common conversation i regard this as by no means a common conversation god forbid that it should be a common conversation i am speaking now very seriously with reference to the interests of the church which i think will be endangered by having among her active servants a man who has been guilty of so base a crime as theft think of it dr tempest theft stealing money appropriating to his own use a cheque for twenty pounds which did not belong to him and then telling such terrible falsehoods about it can anything be worse anything more scandalous anything more dangerous indeed dr tempest i do not regard this as any common conversation the whole of this speech was not made at once fluently or without a break from stop to stop mrs proudie paused waiting for her companions words but as he would not speak she was obliged to continue i am sure that you cannot but agree with me dr tempest she said  i am quite sure that i shall not discuss it with you said the doctor very brusquely  and why not are you not here to discuss it  not with you mrs proudie you must excuse me for saying so but i am not here to discuss any such matter with you were i to do so i should be guilty of a very great impropriety  all these things are in common between me and the bishop said mrs proudie with an air that was intended to be dignified but which nevertheless displayed her rising anger  as to that i know nothing but they cannot be in common between you and me it grieves me much that i should have to speak to you in such a strain but my duty allows me no alternative i think if you will permit me i will take a turn round the garden before i keep my appointment with his lordship and so saying he escaped from the lady without hearing her further remonstrance  it still wanted nearly an hour to the time named by the bishop and dr tempest used it in preparing for his withdrawal from the palace as soon as his interview with the bishop should be over after what had passed he thought that he would be justified in taking his departure without bidding adieu formally to mrs proudie he would say a word or two explaining his haste to the bishop and then if he could get out of the house at once it might be that he would never see mrs proudie again he was rather proud of his success in their late battle but he felt that having been so completely victorious it would be foolish in him to risk his laurels in the chance of another encounter he would say not a word of what had happened to the bishop and he thought it probable that neither would mrs proudie speak of itat any rate till after he was gone generals who are beaten out of the field are not quick to talk of their own repulses he indeed had not beaten mrs proudie out of the field he had in fact himself run away but he had left his foe silenced and with such a foe and in such a contest that was everything he put up his portmanteau therefore and prepared for his final retreat then he rang his bell and desired the servant to show him to the bishops study the servant did so and when he entered the room the first thing he saw was mrs proudie sitting in an armchair near the window the bishop was also in the room sitting with his arms upon the writingtable and his head upon his hands it was very evident that mrs proudie did not consider herself to have been beaten and that she was prepared to fight another battle will you sit down dr tempest she said motioning him with her hand to a chair opposite to that occupied by the bishop dr tempest sat down he felt that at the moment he had nothing else to do and that he must restrain any remonstrance that he might make till mr crawleys name should be mentioned he was almost lost in admiration of the woman he had left her as he thought utterly vanquished and prostrated by his determined but uncourteous usage of her and here she was present again upon the field of battle as though she had never been even wounded he could see that there had been words between her and the bishop and that she had carried a point on which the bishop had been very anxious to have his own way he could perceive at once that the bishop had begged her to absent herself and was greatly chagrined that he should not have prevailed with her there she wasand as dr tempest was resolved that he would neither give advice nor receive instructions respecting mr crawley in her presence he could only draw upon his courage and his strategy for the coming warfare for a few moments no one said a word the bishop felt that if dr tempest would only begin the work on hand might be got through even in his wifes presence mrs proudie was aware that her husband should begin if he would do so and if dr tempest would listen and then reply she might gradually make her way into the conversation and if her words were once accepted then she could say all that she desired to say then she could play her part and become somebody in the episcopal work when once she should have been allowed liberty of speech the enemy would be powerless to stop her but all this dr tempest understood quite as well as she understood it and had they waited till night he would not have been the first to mention mr crawleys name  the bishop sighed aloud the sigh might be taken as expressing grief over the sin of the erring brother whose conduct they were then to discuss and was not amiss but when the sigh with its attendant murmurs had passed away it was necessary that some initiative step should be taken dr tempest said the bishop what are we to do about this poor stiffnecked gentleman still dr tempest did not speak there is no clergyman in the diocese continued the bishop in whose prudence and wisdom i have more confidence than in yours and i know too that you are by no means disposed to severity where severe measures are not necessary what ought we to do if he has been guilty he should not surely return to his pulpit after the expiration of such punishment as the law of his country may award to him  dr tempest looked at mrs proudie thinking that she might perhaps say a word now but mrs proudie knew her part better and was silent angry as she was she contrived to hold her peace let the debate once begin and she would be able to creep into it and then to lead itand so she would hold her own but she had met a foe as wary as herself my lord said the doctor it will perhaps be well that you should communicate your wishes to me in writing if it be possible for me to comply with them i will do so  yesexactly no doubtbut i thought that perhaps we might better understand each other if we had a few words of quiet conversation upon the subject i believe you know the steps that i have  but here the bishop was interrupted dr tempest rose from his chair and advancing to the table put both his hands upon it my lord he said i feel myself compelled to say that which i would very much rather leave unsaid were it possible i feel the difficulty and i may say delicacy of my position but i should be untrue to my conscience and to my feeling of what is right in such matters if i were to take any part in a discussion on this matter in the presence ofa lady  dr tempest what is your objection said mrs proudie rising from her chair and coming also to the table so that from thence she might confront her opponent and as she stood opposite to dr tempest she also put both her hands upon the table  my dear perhaps you will leave us for a few moments said the bishop poor bishop poor weak bishop as the words came from his mouth he knew that they would be spoken in vain and that if so it would have been better for him to have left them unspoken  why should i be dismissed from your room without a reason said mrs proudie cannot dr tempest understand that a wife may share her husbands counselsas she must share his troubles if he cannot i pity him very much as to his own household  dr tempest said the bishop mrs proudie takes the greatest possible interest in everything concerning the diocese  i am sure my lord said the doctor that you will see how unseemly it would be that i should interfere in any way between you and mrs proudie i certainly will not do so i can only say again that if you will communicate to me your wishes in writing i will attend to themif it be possible  you mean to be stubborn said mrs proudie whose prudence was beginning to give way under the great provocation to which her temper was being subjected  yes madam if it is to be called stubbornness i must be stubborn my lord mrs proudie spoke to me on this subject in the breakfastroom after you had left it and i then ventured to explain to her that in accordance with such light as i have on the matter i could not discuss it in her presence i greatly grieve that i failed to make myself understood by heras otherwise this unpleasantness might have been spared  i understood you very well dr tempest and i think you to be a most unreasonable man indeed i might use a much harsher word  you may use any word you please mrs proudie said the doctor  my dear i really think you had better leave us for a few minutes said the bishop  no my lordno said mrs proudie turning round upon her husband not so it would be most unbecoming that i should be turned out of a room in this palace by an uncourteous word from a parish clergyman it would be unseemly if dr tempest forgets his duty i will not forget mine there are other clergymen in the diocese besides dr tempest who can undertake the very easy task of this commission as for his having been appointed rural dean i dont know how many years ago it is a matter of no consequence whatever in such a preliminary inquiry any three clergymen will suffice it need not be done by the rural dean at all  my dear  i will not be turned out of this room by dr tempestand that is enough  my lord said the doctor you had better write to me as i proposed to you just now  his lordship will not write his lordship will do nothing of the kind said mrs proudie  my dear said the bishop driven in his perplexity beyond all carefulness of reticence my dear i do wish you wouldnti do indeed if you would only go away  i will not go away my lord said mrs proudie  but i will said dr tempest feeling true compassion for the unfortunate man whom he saw writhing in agony before him it will manifestly be for the best that i should retire my lord i wish you good morning mrs proudie good morning and so he left the room  a most stubborn and a most ungentlemanlike man said mrs proudie as soon as the door was closed behind the retreating rural dean i do not think that in the whole course of my life i ever met with any one so insubordinate and so illmannered he is worse than the archdeacon as she uttered these words she paced about the room the bishop said nothing and when she herself had been silent for a few minutes she turned upon him bishop she said i hope that you agree with me i expect that you will agree with me in a matter that is of so much moment to my comfort and i may say to my position generally in the diocese bishop why do you not speak  you have behaved in such a way that i do not know that i shall ever speak again said the bishop  what is this that you say  i say that i do not know how i shall ever speak again you have disgraced me  disgraced you i disgrace you it is you that disgrace yourself by saying such words  very well let it be so perhaps you will go away now and leave me to myself i have got a bad headache and i cant talk any more oh dear oh dear what will he think of it  and you mean to tell me that i have been wrong  yes you have been wrongvery wrong why didnt you go away when i asked you you are always being wrong i wish i had never come to barchester in any other position i should not have felt it so much as it is i do not know how i can ever show my face again  not have felt what so much mr proudie said the wife going back in the excitement of her anger to the nomenclature of old days and this is to be my return for all my care in your behalf allow me to tell you sir that in any position in which you may be placed i know what is due to you and that your dignity will never lose anything in my hands i wish that you were as well able to take care of it yourself then she stalked out of the room and left the poor man alone  bishop proudie sat alone in his study throughout the whole day once or twice in the course of the morning his chaplain came to him on some matter of business and was answered with a smilethe peculiar softness of which the chaplain did not fail to attribute to the right cause for it was soon known throughout the household that there had been a quarrel could he quite have made up his mind to do socould he have resolved that it would be altogether better to quarrel with his wifethe bishop would have appealed to the chaplain and have asked at any rate for sympathy but even yet he could not bring himself to confess his misery and to own himself to another to be the wretch that he was then during the long hours of the day he sat thinking of it all how happy could he be if it were only possible for him to go away and become even a curate in a parish without his wife would there ever come to him a time of freedom would she ever die he was older than she and of course he would die first would it not be a fine thing if he could die at once and thus escape from his misery  what could he do even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle he could not lock her up he could not even very well lock her out of his room she was his wife and must have the run of his house he could not altogether debar her from the society of the diocesan clergymen he had on this very morning taken strong measures with her more than once or twice he had desired her to leave the room what was there to be done with a woman who would not obey her husbandwho would not even leave him to the performance of his own work what a blessed thing it would be if a bishop could go away from his home to his work every day like a clerk in a public officeas a stonemason does but there was no such escape for him he could not go away and how was he to meet her again on this very day  and then for hours he thought of dr tempest and mr crawley considering what he had better do to repair the shipwreck of the morning at last he resolved that he would write to the doctor and before he had again seen his wife he did write his letter and he sent it off in this letter he made no direct allusion to the occurrence of the morning but wrote as though there had not been any fixed intention of a personal discussion between them i think it will be better that there should be a commission he said and i would suggest that you should have four other clergymen with you perhaps you will select two yourself out of your rural deanery and if you do not object i will name as the other two mr thumble and mr quiverful who are both resident in the city as he wrote these two names he felt ashamed of himself knowing that he had chosen the two men as being special friends of his wife and feeling that he should have been brave enough to throw aside all considerations of his wifes favourespecially at this moment in which he was putting on his armour to do battle against her it is not probable he continued to say in his letter that you will be able to make your report until after the trial of this unfortunate gentleman shall have taken place and a verdict shall have been given should he be acquitted that i imagine should end the matter there can be no reason why we should attempt to go beyond the verdict of a jury but should he be found guilty i think we ought to be ready with such steps as it will be becoming for us to take at the expiration of any sentence which may be pronounced it will be at any rate expedient that in such case the matter should be brought before an ecclesiastical court he knew well as he wrote this that he was proposing something much milder than the course intended by his wife when she had instigated him to take proceedings in the matter but he did not much regard that now though he had been weak enough to name certain clergymen as assessors with the rural dean because he thought that by doing so he would to a certain degree conciliate his wifethough he had been so far a coward yet he was resolved that he would not sacrifice to her his own judgment and his own conscience in his manner of proceeding he kept no copy of his letter so that he might be unable to show her his very words when she should ask to see them of course he would tell her what he had done but in telling her he would keep to himself what he had said as to the result of an acquittal in a civil court she need not yet be told that he had promised to take such a verdict as sufficing also for an ecclesiastical acquittal in this spirit his letter was written and sent off before he again saw his wife  he did not meet her till they came together in the drawingroom before dinner in explaining the whole truth as to circumstances as they existed at the palace at that moment it must be acknowledged that mrs proudie herself great as was her courage and wide as were the resources which she possessed within herself was somewhat appalled by the position of affairs i fear that it may now be too late for me to excite much sympathy in the mind of any reader on behalf of mrs proudie i shall never be able to make her virtues popular but she had virtues and their existence now made her unhappy she did regard the dignity of her husband and she felt at the present moment that she had almost compromised it she did also regard the welfare of the clergymen around her thinking of course in a general way that certain of them who agreed with her were the clergymen whose welfare should be studied and that certain of them who disagreed with her were the clergymen whose welfare should be postponed but now an idea made its way into her bosom that she was not perhaps doing the best for the welfare of the diocese generally what if it should come to pass that all the clergymen of the diocese should refuse to open their mouths in her presence on ecclesiastical subjects as dr tempest had done this special day was not one on which she was well contented with herself though by no means on that account was her anger mitigated against the offending rural dean  during dinner she struggled to say a word or two to her husband as though there had been no quarrel between them with him the matter had gone so deep that he could not answer her in the same spirit there were sundry members of the family presentdaughters and a soninlaw and a daughters friend who was staying with them but even in the hope of appearing to be serene before them he could not struggle through his deep despondence he was very silent and to his wifes words he answered hardly anything he was courteous and gentle with them all but he spoke as little as was possible and during the evening he sat alone with his head leaning on his handnot pretending even to read he was aware that it was too late to make even an attempt to conceal his misery and his disgrace from his own family  his wife came to him that night in his dressingroom in a spirit of feminine softness that was very unusual with her my dear said she let us forget what occurred this morning if there has been any anger we are bound as christians to forget it she stood over him as she spoke and put her hand upon his shoulder almost caressingly  when a mans heart is broken he cannot forget it was his reply she still stood by him and still kept her hand upon him but she could think of no other words of comfort to say i will go to bed he said it is the best place for me then she left him and he went to bed     chapter xlviii  the softness of sir raffle buffle   we have seen that john eames was prepared to start on his journey in search of the arabins and have seen him after he had taken farewell of his office and of his master there previous to his departure but that matter of his departure had not been arranged altogether with comfort as far as his official interests were concerned he had been perhaps a little abrupt in his mode of informing sir raffle buffle that there was a pressing cause for his official absence and sir raffle had replied to him that no private pressure could be allowed to interfere with his public duties i must go sir raffle at any rate johnny had said it is a matter affecting my family and must not be neglected if you intend to go without leave said sir raffle i presume you will first put your resignation into the hands of mr kissing now mr kissing was the secretary to the board this had been serious undoubtedly john eames was not specially anxious to keep his present position as private secretary to sir raffle but he certainly had no desire to give up his profession altogether he said nothing more to the great man on that occasion but before he left the office he wrote a private note to the chairman expressing the extreme importance of his business and begging that he might have leave of absence on the next morning he received it back with a very few words written across it it cant be done were the very few words which sir raffle buffle had written across the note from his private secretary here was a difficulty which johnny had not anticipated and which seemed to be insuperable sir raffle would not have answered him in that strain if he had not been very much in earnest  i should send him a medical certificate said cradell his friend of old  nonsense said eames  i dont see that its nonsense at all they cant get over a medical certificate from a respectable man and everybody has got something the matter with him of some kind  i should go and let him do his worst said fisher who was another clerk it wouldnt be more than putting you down a place or two as to losing your present berth you dont mind that and they would never think of dismissing you  but i do mind being put down a place or two said johnny who could not forget that were he so put down his friend fisher would gain the step which he would lose  i should give him a barrel of oysters and talk to him about the chancellor of the exchequer said fitzhoward who had been private secretary to sir raffle before eames and might therefore be supposed to know the man  that might have done very well if i had not asked him and been refused first said john eames ill tell you what ill do ill write a long letter on a sheet of foolscap paper with a regular margin so that it must come before the board and perhaps that will frighten him  when he mentioned his difficulty on that evening to mr toogood the lawyer begged him to give up the journey it will only be sending a clerk and it wont cost so very much after all said toogood but johnnys pride could not allow him to give way im not going to be done about it said he im not going to resign but i will go even though they may dismiss me i dont think it will come to that but if it does it must his uncle begged of him not to think of such an alternative but this discussion took place after dinner and away from the office and eames would not submit to bow his neck to authority if it comes to that said he a fellow might as well be a slave at once and what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent you may be sure of one thing i shall go and that on the day fixed  on the next morning john eames was very silent when he went into sir raffles room at the office there was now only this day and another before that fixed for his departure and it was of course very necessary that matters should be arranged but he said nothing to sir raffle during the morning the great man himself was condescending and endeavoured to be kind he knew that his stern refusal had greatly irritated his private secretary and was anxious to show that though in the cause of public duty he was obliged to be stern he was quite willing to forget his sternness when the necessity for it had passed away on this morning therefore he was very cheery but to all his cheery goodhumour john eames would make no response late in the afternoon when most of the men had left the office johnny appeared before the chairman for the last time that day with a very long face he was dressed in black and had changed his ordinary morning coat for a frock which gave him an appearance altogether unlike that which was customary to him and he spoke almost in a whisper very slowly and when sir raffle jokedand sir raffle often would jokehe not only did not laugh but he absolutely sighed is there anything the matter with you eames asked sir raffle  i am in great trouble said john eames  and what is your trouble  it is essential for the honour of one of my family that i should be at florence by this day week i cannot make up my mind what i ought to do i do not wish to lose my position in the public service to which as you know i am warmly attached but i cannot submit to see the honour of my family sacrificed  eames said sir raffle that must be nonsensethat must be nonsense there can be no reason why you should always expect to have your own way in everything  of course if i go without leave i shall be dismissed  of course you will it is out of the question that a young man should take the bit between his teeth in that way  as for taking the bit between his teeth sir raffle i do not think that any man was ever more obedient perhaps i should say more submissive than i have been but there must be a limit to everything  what do you mean by that mr eames said sir raffle turning in anger upon his private secretary but johnny disregarded his anger johnny indeed had made up his mind that sir raffle should be very angry what do you mean mr eames by saying that there must be a limit i know nothing about limits one would suppose that you intended to make an accusation against me  so i do i think sir raffle that you are treating me with great cruelty i have explained to you that family circumstances  you have explained nothing mr eames  yes i have sir raffle i have explained to you that matters relating to my family which materially affect the honour of a certain one of its members demand that i should go at once to florence you tell me that if i go i shall be dismissed  of course you must not go without leave i never heard of such a thing in all my life and sir raffle lifted up his hands towards heaven almost in dismay  so i have drawn up a short statement of the circumstances which i hope may be read at the board when the question of my dismissal comes before it  you mean to go then  yes sir raffle i must go the honour of a certain branch of my family demands that i should do so as i have for some time been so especially under you i thought it would be proper to show you what i have said before i send my letter in and therefore i have brought it with me here it is and johnny handed to sir raffle an official document of large dimensions  sir raffle began to be uncomfortable he had acquired a character for tyranny in the public service of which he was aware though he thought that he knew well that he had never deserved it some official bigwigperhaps that chancellor of the exchequer of whom he was so fondhad on one occasion hinted to him that a little softness of usage would be compatible with the prejudices of the age softness was impossible to sir raffle but his temper was sufficiently under his control to enable him to encounter the rebuke and to pull himself up from time to time when he found himself tempted to speak loud and to take things with a high hand he knew that a clerk should not be dismissed for leaving his office who could show that his absence had been caused by some matter really affecting the interest of his family and that were he to drive eames to go on this occasion without leave eames would be simply called in to state what was this matter of moment which had taken him away probably he had stated that matter of moment in this very document which sir raffle was holding in his hand but sir raffle was not willing to be conquered by the document if it was necessary that he should give way he would much prefer to give wayout of his own goodnature let us saywithout looking at the document at all i must under the circumstances decline to read this said he unless it should come before me officially and he handed back the paper  i thought it best to let you see it if you pleased said john eames then he turned round as though he were going to leave the room but suddenly he turned back again i dont like to leave you sir raffle without saying goodby i do not suppose we shall meet again of course you must do your duty and i do not wish you to think that i have any personal illwill against you so saying he put out his hand to sir raffle as though to take a final farewell sir raffle looked at him in amazement he was dressed as has been said in black and did not look like the john eames of every day to whom sir raffle was accustomed  i dont understand this at all said sir raffle  i was afraid that it was only too plain said john eames  and you must go  oh yesthats certain i have pledged myself to go  of course i dont know anything of this matter that is so important to your family  no you do not said johnny  cant you explain it to me then so that i may have some reasonif there is any reason  then john told the story of mr crawleya considerable portion of the story and in his telling of it i think it probable that he put more weight upon the necessity of his mission to italy than it could have fairly been made to bear in the course of the narration sir raffle did once contrive to suggest that a lawyer by going to florence might do the business at any rate as well as john eames but johnny denied this no sir raffle it is impossible quite impossible he said if you saw the lawyer who is acting in the matter mr toogood who is also my uncle he would tell you the same sir raffle had already heard something of the story of mr crawley and was now willing to accept the sad tragedy of that case as an excuse for his private secretarys somewhat insubordinate conduct under the circumstances eames i suppose you must go but i think you should have told me all about it before  i did not like to trouble you sir raffle with private business  it is always best to tell the whole of a story said sir raffle johnny being quite content with the upshot of the negotiations accepted this gentle rebuke in silence and withdrew on the next day he appeared again at the office in his ordinary costume and an idea crossed sir raffles brain that he had been partly done by the affectation of a costume ill be even with him some day yet said sir raffle to himself  ive got my leave boys said eames when he went out into the room in which his three friends sat  no said cradell  but i have said johnny  you dont mean that old huffle scuffle has given it out of his own head said fisher  indeed he has said johnny and bade god bless me into the bargain  and you didnt give him the oysters said fitzhoward not a shell said johnny  im blessed if you dont beat cockfighting said cradell lost in admiration at his friends adroitness  we know how john passed his evening after that he went first to see lily dale at her uncles lodgings in sackville street from thence he was taken to the presence of the charming madalina in porchester terrace and then wound up the night with his friend conway dalrymple when he got to his bed he felt himself to have been triumphant but in spite of his triumph he was ashamed of himself why had he left lily to go to madalina as he thought of this he quoted to himself against himself hamlets oftenquoted appeal to the two portraits how could he not despise himself in that he could find any pleasure with madalina having a lily dale to fill his thoughts but she is not fair for me he said to himselfthinking thus to comfort himself but he did not comfort himself  on the next morning early his uncle mr toogood met him at the dover railway station upon my word johnny youre a clever fellow said he i never thought that youd make it all right with sir raffle  as right as a trivet uncle there are some people if you can only get to learn the length of their feet you can always fit them with shoes afterwards  illustration as right as a trivet uncle  youll go on direct to florence johnny  yes i think so from what we have heard mrs arabin must be either there or at venice and i dont suppose i could learn from any one at paris at which town she is staying at this moment  her address is florenceposte restante florence you will be sure to find out at any of the hotels where she is staying or where she has been staying  but when i have found her i dont suppose she can tell me anything said johnny  who can tell she may or she may not my belief is that the money was her present altogether and not his it seems that they dont mix their moneys he has always had some scruple about it because of her son by a former marriage and they always have different accounts at their bankers i found that out when i was at barchester  but crawley was his friend  yes crawley was his friend but i dont know that fiftypound notes have always been so very plentiful with him deans incomes aint what they were you know  i dont know anything about that said johnny  well they are not and he has nothing of his own as far as i can learn it would be just the thing for her to doto give the money to his friend at any rate she will tell you whether it was so or not  and then i will go on to jerusalem after him  should you find it necessary he will probably be on his way back and she will know where you can hit him on the road you must make him understand that it is essential that he should be here some little time before the trial you can understand johnnyand as he spoke mr toogood lowered his voice to a whisper though they were walking together on the platform of the railway station and could not possibly have been overheard by any one you can understand that it may be necessary to prove that he is not exactly compos mentis and if so it will be essential that he should have some influential friend near him otherwise that bishop will trample him into dust if mr toogood could have seen the bishop at this time and have read the troubles of the poor mans heart he would hardly have spoken of him as being so terrible a tyrant  i understand all that said johnny  so that in fact i shall expect to see you both together said toogood  i hope the dean is a good fellow  they tell me he is a very good fellow  i never did see much of bishops or deans as yet said johnny and i should feel rather awestruck travelling with one  i should fancy that a dean is very much like anybody else  but the mans hat would cow me  i daresay youll find him walking about jerusalem with a wideawake on and a big stick in his hand probably smoking a cigar deans contrive to get out of their armour sometimes as the knights of old used to do bishops i fancy find it more difficult wellgoodby old fellow im very much obliged to you for goingi am indeed i dont doubt but what we shall pull through somehow  then mr toogood went home to breakfast and from his own house he proceeded to his office when he had been there an hour or two there came to him a messenger from the incometax office with an official note addressed to himself by sir raffle bufflea note which looked to be very official sir raffle buffle presented his compliments to mr toogood and could mr toogood favour sir r b with the present address of mr john eames old fox said mr toogoodbut then such a stupid old fox as if it was likely that i should have peached on johnny if anything was wrong so mr toogood sent his compliments to sir raffle buffle and begged to inform sir r b that mr john eames was away on very particular family business which would take him in the first instance to florencebut that from florence he would probably have to go on to jerusalem without the loss of an hour stupid old fool said mr toogood as he sent off his reply by the messenger     chapter xlix  near the close   illustration  i wonder whether any one will read these pages who has never known anything of the bitterness of a family quarrel if so i shall have a reader very fortunate or else very coldblooded it would be wrong to say that love produces quarrels but love does produce those intimate relations of which quarrelling is too often one of the consequencesone of the consequences which frequently seem to be so natural and sometimes seem to be unavoidable one brother rebukes the otherand what brothers ever lived together between whom there was no such rebukingthen some warm word is misunderstood and hotter words follow and there is a quarrel the husband tyrannizes knowing that it is his duty to direct and the wife disobeys or only partially obeys thinking that a little independence will become herand so there is a quarrel the father anxious only for his sons good looks into that sons future with other eyes than those of his son himselfand so there is a quarrel they come very easily these quarrels but the quittance from them is sometimes terribly difficult much of thought is necessary before the angry man can remember that he too in part may have been wrong and any attempt at such thinking is almost beyond the power of him who is carefully nursing his wrath lest it cool but the nursing of such quarrelling kills all happiness the very man who is nursing his wrath lest it coolhis wrath against one whom he loves perhaps the best of all whom it has been given him to loveis himself wretched as long as it lasts his anger poisons every pleasure of his life he is sullen at his meals and cannot understand his book as he turns its pages his work let it be what it may is ill done he is full of his quarrelnursing it he is telling himself how much he has loved that wicked one how many have been his sacrifices for that wicked one and that now that wicked one is repaying him simply with wickedness and yet the wicked one is at that very moment dearer to him than ever if that wicked one could only be forgiven how sweet would the world be again and yet he nurses his wrath  so it was in these days with archdeacon grantly he was very angry with his son it is hardly too much to say that in every moment of his life whether waking or sleeping he was thinking of the injury that his son was doing him he had almost come to forget the fact that his anger had first been roused by the feeling that his son was about to do himself an injuryto cut his own throat various other considerations had now added themselves to that and filled not only his mind but his daily conversation with his wife how terrible would be the disgrace to lord hartletop how incurable the injury to griselda the marchioness should the brotherinlaw of the one and the brother of the other marry the daughter of a convicted thief of himself he would say nothing so he declared constantly though of himself he did say a great deal of himself he would say nothing though of course such a marriage would ruin him in the county my dear said his wife that is nonsense that really is nonsense i feel sure there is not a single person in the county who would think of the marriage in such a light then the archdeacon would have quarrelled with his wife too had she not been too wise to admit such a quarrel mrs grantly was very wise and knew that it took two persons to make a quarrel he told her over and over again that she was in league with her sonthat she was encouraging her son to marry grace crawley i believe that in your heart you wish it he once said to her no my dear i do not wish it i do not think it a becoming marriage but if he does marry her i should wish to receive his wife in my house and certainly should not quarrel with him i will never receive her the archdeacon had replied and as for him i can only say that in such case i will make no provision for his family  it will be remembered that the archdeacon had on a former occasion instructed his wife to write to their son and tell him of his fathers determination mrs grantly had so manoeuvred that a little time had been gained and that those instructions had not been insisted upon in all their bitterness since that time major grantly had renewed his assurance that he would marry grace crawley if grace crawley would accept himwriting on this occasion direct to his fatherand had asked his father whether in such case he was to look forward to be disinherited it is essential that i should know the major had said because in such case i must take immediate measures for leaving this place his father had sent him back his letter writing a few words at the bottom of it if you do as you propose above you must expect nothing from me the words were written in large round handwriting very hurriedly and the son when he received them perfectly understood the mood of his fathers mind when he wrote them  then there came tidings addressed on this occasion to mrs grantly that cosby lodge was to be given up ladyday had come and the notice necessarily to be given at that period was so given i know this will grieve you major grantly had said but my father has driven me to it this in itself was a cause of great sorrow both to the archdeacon and to mrs grantly as there were circumstances connected with cosby lodge which made them think that it was a very desirable residence for their son i shall sell everything about the place and go abroad at once he said in a subsequent letter my present idea is that i shall settle myself at pau as my income will suffice for me to live there and education for edith will be cheap at any rate i will not continue in england i could never be happy here in circumstances so altered of course i should not have left my profession unless i had understood from my father that the income arising from it would not be necessary to me i do not however mean to complain but simply tell you that i shall go there were many letters between the mother and son in those days i shall stay till after the trial he said if she will then go with me well and good but whether she will or not i shall not remain here all this seemed to mrs grantly to be peculiarly unfortunate for had he not resolved to go things might even yet have righted themselves from what she could now understand of the character of miss crawley whom she did not know personally she thought it probable that grace in the event of her father being found guilty by the jury would absolutely and persistently refuse the offer made to her she would be too good as mrs grantly put it to herself to bring misery and disgrace into another family but should mr crawley be acquitted and should the marriage then take place the archdeacon himself might probably be got to forgive it in either case there would be no necessity for breaking up the house at cosby lodge but her dear son henry her best beloved was obstinate and stiffnecked and would take no advice he is even worse than his father she said in her shortlived anger to her own father to whom alone at this time she could unburden her griefs seeking consolation and encouragement  it was her habit to go over to the deanery at any rate twice a week at this time and on the occasion of one of the visits so made she expressed very strongly her distress at the family quarrel which had come among them the old man took his grandsons part through and through i do not at all see why he should not marry the young lady if he likes her as for money there ought to be enough without his having to look for a wife with a fortune  it is not a question of money papa  and as to rank continued mr harding henry will not at any rate be going lower than his father did when he married younot so low indeed for at that time i was only a minor canon and mr crawley is in possession of a benefice  papa all that is nonsense it is indeed  very likely my dear  it is not because mr crawley is only perpetual curate of hogglestock that the archdeacon objects to the marriage it has nothing to do with that at all at the present moment he is in disgrace  under a cloud my dear let us pray that it may be only a passing cloud  all the world thinks that he was guilty and then he is such a manso singular so unlike anybody else you know papa that i dont think very much of money merely as money  i hope not my dear money is worth thinking of but it is not worth very much thought  but it does give advantages and the absence of such advantages must be very much felt in the education of a girl you would hardly wish henry to marry a young woman who from want of money had not been brought up among ladies it is not miss crawleys fault but such has been her lot we cannot ignore these deficiencies papa  certainly not my dear  you would not for instance wish that henry should marry a kitchenmaid  but is miss crawley a kitchenmaid susan  i dont quite say that  i am told that she has been educated infinitely better than most of the young ladies in the neighbourhood said mr harding  i believe that her father has taught her greek and i suppose she has learned something of french at that school at silverbridge  then the kitchenmaid theory is sufficiently disposed of said mr harding with mild triumph  you know what i mean papa but the fact is that it is impossible to deal with men they will never be reasonable a marriage such as this would be injurious to henry but it will not be ruinous and as to disinheriting him for it that would be downright wicked  i think so said mr harding  but the archdeacon will look at it as though it would destroy henry and edith altogether while you speak of it as though it were the best thing in the world  if the young people love each other i think it would be the best thing in the world said mr harding  but papa you cannot but think that his fathers wish should go for something said mrs grantly who desirous as she was on the one side to support her son could not bear that her husband should on the other side be declared to be altogether in the wrong  i do not know my dear said mr harding but i do think that if the two young people are fond of each other and if there is anything for them to live upon it cannot be right to keep them apart you know my dear she is the daughter of a gentleman mrs grantly upon this left her father almost brusquely without speaking another word on the subject for though she was opposed to the vehement anger of her husband she could not endure the proposition now made by her father  mr harding was at this time living all alone in the deanery for some few years the deanery had been his home and as his youngest daughter was the deans wife there could be no more comfortable restingplace for the evening of his life during the last month or two the days had gone tediously with him for he had had the large house all to himself and he was a man who did not love solitude it is hard to conceive that the old whose thoughts have been all thought out should ever love to live alone solitude is surely for the young who have time before them for the execution of schemes and who can therefore take delight in thinking in these days the poor old man would wander about the rooms shambling from one chamber to another and would feel ashamed when the servants met him ever on the move he would make little apologies for his uneasiness which they would accept graciously understanding after a fashion why it was that he was uneasy he aint got nothing to do said the housemaid to the cook and as for reading they say that some of the young ones can read all day sometimes and all night too but bless you when youre nigh eighty reading dont go for much the housemaid was right as to mr hardings reading he was not one who had read so much in his earlier days as to enable him to make reading go far with him now that he was near eighty so he wandered about the room and sat here for a few minutes and there for a few minutes and though he did not sleep much he made the hours of the night as many as was possible every morning he shambled across from the deanery to the cathedral and attended the morning service sitting in the stall which he had occupied for fifty years the distance was very short not exceeding indeed a hundred yards from a sidedoor in the deanery to another sidedoor into the cathedral but short as it was there had come to be a question whether he should be allowed to go alone it had been feared that he might fall on his passage and hurt himself for there was a step here and a step there and the light was not very good in the purlieus of the old cathedral a word or two had been said once and the offer of an arm to help him had been made but he had rejected the proffered assistancesoftly indeed but still firmlyand every day he tottered off by himself hardly lifting his feet as he went and aiding himself on his journey by a hand upon the wall when he thought that nobody was looking at him but many did see him and they who knew himladies generally of the citywould offer him a hand nobody was milder in his dislikings than mr harding but there were ladies in barchester upon whose arm he would always decline to lean bowing courteously as he did so and saying a word or two of constrained civility there were others whom he would allow to accompany him home to the door of the deanery with whom he delighted to linger and chat if the morning was warm and to whom he would tell little stories of his own doings in the cathedral services in the old days when bishop grantly had ruled in the diocese never a word did he say against bishop proudie or against bishop proudies wife but the many words which he did say in praise of bishop grantlywho by his showing was surely one of the best of churchmen who ever walked through this vale of sorrowwere as eloquent in dispraise of the existing prelate as could have been any more clearlypointed phrases this daily visit to the cathedral where he would say his prayers as he had said them for so many years and listen to the organ of which he knew all the power and every blemish as though he himself had made the stops and fixed the pipes was the chief occupation of his life it was a pity that it could not have been made to cover a larger portion of the day  it was sometimes sad enough to watch him as he sat alone he would have a book near him and for a while would keep it in his hands it would generally be some volume of good old standard theology with which he had been or supposed himself to have been conversant from his youth but the book would soon be laid aside and gradually he would move himself away from it and he would stand about in the room looking now out of a window from which he would fancy that he could not be seen or gazing up at some print which he had known for years and then he would sit down for a while in one chair and for a while in another while his mind was wandering back into old days thinking of old troubles and remembering his old joys and he had a habit when he was sure that he was not watched of creeping up to a great black wooden case which always stood in one corner of the sittingroom which he occupied in the deanery mr harding when he was younger had been a performer on the violoncello and in this case there was still the instrument from which he had been wont to extract the sounds which he had so dearly loved now in these latter days he never made any attempt to play soon after he had come to the deanery there had fallen upon him an illness and after that he had never again asked for his bow they who were around himhis daughter chiefly and her husbandhad given the matter much thought arguing with themselves whether or no it would be better to invite him to resume the task he had so loved for of all the works of his life this playing on the violoncello had been the sweetest to him but even before that illness his hand had greatly failed him and the dean and mrs arabin had agreed that it would be better to let the matter pass without a word he had never asked to be allowed to play he had expressed no regrets when he himself would propose that his daughter should give them a little musicand he would make such a proposition on every evening that was suitablehe would never say a word of those former performances at which he himself had taken a part but it had become known to mrs arabin through the servants that he had once dragged the instrument forth from its case when he had thought the house to be nearly deserted and a wail of sounds had been heard very low very shortlived recurring now and again at fitful intervals he had at those times attempted to play as though with a muffled bowso that none should know of his vanity and folly then there had been further consultations at the deanery and it had been again agreed that it would be best to say nothing to him of his music  in these latter days of which i am now speaking he would never draw the instrument out of its case indeed he was aware that it was too heavy for him to handle without assistance but he would open the prison door and gaze upon the thing that he loved and he would pass his fingers among the broad strings and ever and anon he would produce from one of them a low melancholy almost unearthly sound and then he would pause never daring to produce two such notes in successionone close upon the other and these last sad moans of the old fiddle were now known through the household they were the ghosts of the melody of days long past he imagined that his visits to the box were unsuspectedthat none knew of the folly of his old fingers which could not keep themselves from touching the wires but the voice of the violoncello had been recognized by the servants and by his daughter and when that low wail was heard through the houselike the last dying note of a dirgethey would all know that mr harding was visiting his ancient friend  when the dean and mrs arabin had first talked of going abroad for a long visit it had been understood that mr harding should pass the period of their absence with his other daughter at plumstead but when the time came he begged of mrs arabin to be allowed to remain in his old rooms of course i shall go backwards and forwards he had said there is nothing i like so much as a change now and then the result had been that he had gone once to plumstead during the deans absence when he had thus remonstrated begging to be allowed to remain in barchester mrs arabin had declared her intention of giving up her tour in telling her father of this she had not said that her altered purpose had arisen from her disinclination to leave him alonebut he had perceived that it was so and had then consented to be taken over to plumstead there was nothing he said which he would like so much as going over to plumstead for four or five months it had ended in his having his own way altogether the arabins had gone upon their tour and he was left in possession of the deanery i should not like to die out of barchester he said to himself in excuse to himself for his disinclination to sojourn long under the archdeacons roof but in truth the archdeacon who loved him well and who after a fashion had always been good to himwho had always spoken of the connexion which had bound the two families together as the great blessing of his lifewas too rough in his greetings for the old man mr harding had ever mixed something of fear with his warm affection for his elder soninlaw and now in these closing hours of his life he could not avoid a certain amount of shrinking from that loud voicea certain inaptitude to be quite at ease in that commanding presence the dean his second soninlaw had been a modern friend in comparison with the archdeacon but the dean was more gentle with him and then the deans wife had ever been the dearest to him of human beings it may be a doubt whether one of the deans children was not now almost more dear and whether in these days he did not have more free communication with that little girl than with any other human being her name was susan but he had always called her posy having himself invented for her that soubriquet when it had been proposed to him to pass the winter and spring at plumstead the suggestion had been made alluring by a promise that posy also should be taken to mrs grantlys house but he as we have seen had remained at the deanery and posy had remained with him  posy was now five years old and could talk well and had her own ideas of things posys eyeshers and no others besides her ownwere allowed to see the inhabitant of the big black case and now that the deanery was so nearly deserted posys fingers had touched the strings and had produced an infantine moan grandpa let me do it again twang it was not however in truth a twang but a sound as of a prolonged dull almost deadly hummmmm on this occasion the moan was not entirely infantineposys fingers having been something too strongand the case was closed and locked and grandpapa shook his head  but mrs baxter wont be angry said posy mrs baxter was the housekeeper in the deanery and had mr harding under her especial charge  no my darling mrs baxter will not be angry but we mustnt disturb the house  no said posy with much of important awe in her tone we mustnt disturb the house must we grandpapa and so she gave in her adhesion to the closing of the case but posy could play catscradle and as catscradle did not disturb the house at all there was a good deal of catscradle played in these days posys fingers were so soft and pretty so small and deft that the dear old man delighted in taking the strings from them and in having them taken from his own by those tender little digits  illustration posy and her grandpapa  on the afternoon after the conversation respecting grace crawley which is recorded in the early part of this chapter a messenger from barchester went over to plumstead and a part of his mission consisted of a note from mrs baxter to mrs grantly beginning honoured madam and informing mrs grantly among other things that her respected papa as mrs baxter called him was not quite so well as usual not that mrs baxter thought there was much the matter mr harding had been to the cathedral service as was usual with him but had come home leaning on a ladys arm who had thought it well to stay with him at the door till it had been opened for him after that miss posy had found him asleep and had been unableor if not unable unwilling to wake him miss posy had come down to mrs baxter somewhat in a fright and hence this letter had been written mrs baxter thought that there was nothing to fright mrs grantly and she wasnt sure that she should have written at all only that dick was bound to go over to plumstead with the wool but as dick was going mrs baxter thought it proper to send her duty and to say that to her humble way of thinking perhaps it might be best that mr harding shouldnt go alone to the cathedral every morning if the dear reverend gentleman was to get a tumble maam said the letter it would be awkward then mrs grantly remembered that she had left her father almost without a greeting on the previous day and she resolved that she would go over very early on the following morningso early that she would be at the deanery before her father should have gone to the cathedral  he ought to have come over here and not stayed there by himself said the archdeacon when his wife told him of her intention  it is too late to think of that now my dear and one can understand i think that he should not like leaving the cathedral as long as he can attend it the truth is he does not like being out of barchester  he would be much better here said the archdeacon of course you can have the carriage and go over we can breakfast at eight and if you can bring him back with you do i should tell him that he ought to come mrs grantly made no answer to this knowing very well that she could not bring herself to go beyond the gentlest persuasion with her father and on the next morning she was at the deanery by ten oclock halfpast ten was the hour at which the service began mrs baxter contrived to meet her before she saw her father and begged her not to let it be known that any special tidings of mr hardings failing strength had been sent from the deanery to plumstead and how is my father asked mrs grantly well then maam said baxter in one sense hes finely he took a morsel of early lamb to his dinner yesterday and relished it ever so wellonly he gave miss posy the best part of it and then he sat with miss posy quite happy for an hour or so and then he slept in his chair and you know maam we never wakes him and after that old skulpit toddled up from the hospitalthis was hirams hospital of which establishment in the city of barchester mr harding had once been the warden and kind master as has been told in former chronicles of the cityand your papa has said maam you know that he is always to see any of the old men when they come up and skulpit is sly and no better than he should be and got money from your father maam i know and then he had just a drop of tea and after that i took him his glass of port wine with my own hands and it touched me maam so it did when he said oh mrs baxter how good you are you know well what it is i like and then he went to bed i listened hardnot from idle curosity maam as you who know me will believe but just because its becoming to know what hes about as there might be an accident you know maam you are very good mrs baxter very good thank ye maam for saying so and so i listened hard but he didnt go to his music poor gentleman and i think he had a quiet night he doesnt sleep much at nights poor gentleman but hes very quiet leastwise he was last night this was the bulletin which mrs baxter gave to mrs grantly on that morning before mrs grantly saw her father  she found him preparing himself for his visit to the cathedral some year or twobut no morebefore the date of which we are speaking he had still taken some small part in the service and while he had done so he had of course worn his surplice living so close to the cathedralso close that he could almost walk out of the house into the transepthe had kept his surplice in his own room and had gone down in his vestment it had been a bitter day to him when he had first found himself constrained to abandon the white garment which he loved he had encountered some failure in the performance of the slight clerical task allotted to him and the dean had tenderly advised him to desist he did not utter one word of remonstrance it will perhaps be better the dean had said yesit will be better mr harding had replied few have had accorded to them the high privilege of serving their master in his house for so many yearsthough few more humbly or with lower gifts but on the following morning and for nearly a week afterwards he had been unable to face the minor canon and the vergers and the old women who knew him so well in his ordinary black garments at last he went down with the dean and occupied a stall close to the deans seatfar away from that in which he had sat for so many yearsand in this seat he had said his prayers ever since that day and now his surplices were washed and ironed and folded and put away but there were moments in which he would stealthily visit them as he also stealthily visited his friend in the black wooden case this was very melancholy and the sadness of it was felt by all those who lived with him but he never alluded himself to any of those bereavements which age brought upon him whatever might be his regrets he kept them ever within his own breast  posy was with him when mrs grantly went up into his room holding for him his hat and stick while he was engaged in brushing a suspicion of dust from his black gaiters grandpapa here is aunt susan said posy the old man looked up with somethingwith some slightest sign of that habitual fear which was always aroused within his bosom by visitations from plumstead had mrs arabin thoroughly understood the difference in her fathers feeling toward herself and toward her sister i think she would hardly have gone forth upon any tour while he remained with her in the deanery it is very hard sometimes to know how intensely we are loved and of what value our presence is to those who love us mrs grantly saw the lookdid not analyse it did not quite understand itbut felt as she had so often felt before that it was not altogether laden with welcome but all this had nothing to do with the duty on which she had come nor did it in the slightest degree militate against her own affection papa she said kissing him you are surprised to see me so early  well my dear yesbut very glad all the same i hope everybody is well at plumstead  everybody thank you papa  that is well posy and i are getting ready for church are we not posy  grandpapa is getting ready mrs baxter wont let me go  no my dear nonot yet posy when posy is a great girl she can go to cathedral every day only then perhaps posy wont want to go  i thought that perhaps papa you would sit with me a little while this morning instead of going to morning prayers  certainly my dearcertainly only i do not like not goingfor who can say how often i may be able to go again there is so little left susanso very little left  after that she had not the heart to ask him to stay and therefore she went with him as they passed down the stairs and out of the doors she was astonished to find how weak were his footstepshow powerless he was against the slightest misadventure on this very day he would have tripped at the upward step at the cathedral door had she not been with him oh papa she said indeed indeed you should not come here alone then he apologized for his little stumble with many words and much shame assuring her that anybody might trip on an occasion it was purely an accident and though it was a comfort to him to have had her arm he was sure that he should have recovered himself even had he been alone he always he said kept quite close to the wall so that there might be no mistakeno possibility of an accident all this he said volubly but with confused words in the covered stone passage leading into the transept and as he thus spoke mrs grantly made up her mind that her father should never again go to the cathedral alone he never did go again to the cathedralalone  when they returned to the deanery mr harding was fluttered weary and unwell when his daughter left him for a few minutes he told mrs baxter in confidence the story of his accident and his great grief that his daughter should have seen it laws amercy sir it was a blessing she was with you said mrs baxter it was indeed mr harding then mr harding had been angry and spoke almost crossly to mrs baxter but before she left the room he found an opportunity of begging her pardonnot in a set speech to that effect but by a little word of gentle kindness which she had understood perfectly papa said mrs grantly to him as soon as she had succeeded in getting both posy and mrs baxter out of the roomagainst the doing of which mr harding had manoeuvred with all his little impotent skillpapa you must promise me that you will not go to the cathedral again alone till eleanor comes home when he heard the sentence he looked at her with blank misery in his eyes he made no attempt at remonstrance he begged for no respite the word had gone forth and he knew that it must be obeyed though he would have hidden the signs of his weakness had he been able he would not condescend to plead that he was strong if you think it wrong my dear i will not go alone he said papa i do indeed i do dear papa i would not hurt you by saying it if i did not know that i am right he was sitting with his hand upon the table and as she spoke to him she put her hand upon his caressing it my dear he said you are always right  she then left him again for awhile having some business out in the city and he was alone in his room for an hour what was there left to him now in the world old as he was and in some things almost childish nevertheless he thought of this keenly and some halfrealized remembrance of the lean and slippered pantaloon flitted across his mind causing him a pang what was there left to him now in the world posy and catscradle then in the midst of his regrets as he sat with his back bent in his old easychair with one arm over the shoulder of the chair and the other hanging loose by his side on a sudden there came across his face a smile as sweet as ever brightened the face of man or woman he had been able to tell himself that he had no ground for complaintgreat ground rather for rejoicing and gratitude had not the world and all in it been good to him had he not children who loved him who had done him honour who had been to him always a crown of glory never a mark for reproach had not his lines fallen to him in very pleasant places was it not his happy fate to go and leave it all amidst the good words and kind loving cares of devoted friends whose latter days had ever been more blessed than his and for the future it was as he thought of this that that smile came across his faceas though it were already the face of an angel and then he muttered to himself a word or two lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace  when mrs grantly returned she found him in jocund spirits and yet she perceived that he was so weak that when he left his chair he could barely get across the room without assistance mrs baxter indeed had not sent to her too soon and it was well that the prohibition had come in time to prevent some terrible accident papa she said i think you had better go with me to plumstead the carriage is here and i can take you home so comfortably but he would not allow himself to be taken on this occasion to plumstead he smiled and thanked her and put his hand into hers and repeated his promise that he would not leave the house on any occasion without assistance and declared himself specially thankful to her for coming to him on that special morningbut he would not be taken to plumstead when the summer comes he said then if you will have me for a few days  he meant no deceit and yet he had told himself within the last hour that he should never see another summer he could not tell even his daughter that after such a life as this after more than fifty years spent in the ministrations of his darling cathedral it specially behoved him to dieas he had livedat barchester he could not say this to his eldest daughter but had his eleanor been at home he could have said it to her he thought he might yet live to see his eleanor once again if this could be given to him he would ask for nothing more  on the afternoon of the next day mrs baxter wrote another letter in which she told mrs grantly that her father had declared at his usual hour of rising that morning that as he was not going to the cathedral he would he thought lie in bed a little longer and then he had lain in bed the whole day and perhaps honoured madam looking at all things its best as he should said mrs baxter     chapter l  lady luftons proposition   it was now known throughout barchester that a commission was to be held by the bishops orders at which inquiry would be madethat is ecclesiastical inquiryas to the guilt imputed to mr crawley in the matter of mr soamess cheque sundry rumours had gone abroad as to quarrels which had taken place on the subject among certain clergymen high in office but these were simply rumours and nothing was in truth known there was no more discreet clergyman in all the diocese than dr tempest and not a word had escaped from him as to the stormy nature of that meeting in the bishops palace at which he had attended with the bishopand at which mrs proudie had attended also when it is said that the fact of this coming commission was known to all barsetshire allusion is of course made to that portion of the inhabitants of barsetshire to which clerical matters were dearand as such matters were specially dear to the inhabitants of the parish of framley the commission was discussed very eagerly in that parish and was specially discussed by the dowager lady lufton  and there was a double interest attached to the commission in the parish of framley by the fact that mr robarts the vicar had been invited by dr tempest to be one of the clergymen who were to assist in making the inquiry i also propose to ask mr oriel of greshamsbury to join us said dr tempest the bishop wishes to appoint the other two and has already named mr thumble and mr quiverful who are both residents in the city perhaps his lordship may be right in thinking it better that the matter should not be left altogether in the hands of clergymen who hold livings in the diocese you are no doubt aware that neither mr thumble nor mr quiverful do hold any benefice mr robarts feltas everybody else did feel who knew anything of the matterthat bishop proudie was singularly ignorant in his knowledge of men and that he showed his ignorance on this special occasion if he intended to name two such men he should at any rate have named three said dr thorne mr thumble and mr quiverful will simply be outvoted on the first day and after that will give in their adhesion to the majority mr thumble indeed lady lufton had said with much scorn in her voice to her thinking it was absurd in the highest degree that such men as dr tempest and her mr robarts should be asked to meet mr thumble and mr quiverful on a matter of ecclesiastical business outvoted of course they would be outvoted of course they would be so paralyzed by fear at finding themselves in the presence of real gentlemen that they would hardly be able to vote at all old lady lufton did not in fact utter words so harsh as these but thoughts as harsh passed through her mind the reader therefore will understand that much interest was felt on the subject at framley court where lady lufton lived with her son and her daughterinlaw  they tell me said lady lufton that both the archdeacon and dr tempest think it right that a commission should be held if so i have no doubt that it is right  mark says that the bishop could hardly do anything else rejoined mrs robarts  i daresay not my dear i suppose the bishop has somebody near him to tell him what he may do and what he may not do it would be terrible to think of if it were not so but yet when i hear that he has named such men as mr thumble and mr quiverful i cannot but feel that the whole diocese is disgraced  oh lady lufton that is such a strong word said mrs robarts  it may be strong but it is not the less true said lady lufton  and from talking on the subject of the crawleys lady lufton soon advanced first to a desire for some action and then to acting i think my dear i will go over and see mrs crawley said lady lufton the elder to lady lufton the younger lady lufton the younger had nothing to urge against this but she did not offer to accompany the elder lady i attempted to explain in the early part of this story that there still existed a certain understanding between mrs crawley and lord luftons wife and that kindnesses occasionally passed from framley court to hogglestock parsonage but on this occasion young lady luftonthe lucy robarts who had once passed certain days of her life with the crawleys at hogglestockdid not choose to accompany her motherinlaw and therefore mrs robarts was invited to do so i think it may comfort her to know that she has our sympathy the elder woman said to the younger as they made their journey together  when the carriage stopped before the little wicketgate from whence a path led through a ragged garden from the road to mr crawleys house lady lufton hardly knew how to proceed the servant came to the door of the carriage and asked for her orders hmm ha yes i think ill send in my cardand say that i hope mrs crawley will be able to see me wont that be best eh fanny fanny otherwise mrs robarts said that she thought that would be best and the card and message were carried in  it was happily the case that mr crawley was not at home mr crawley was away at hoggle end reading to the brickmakers or turning the mangles of their wives or teaching them theology or politics or history after his fashion in these days he spent perhaps the happiest hours of his life down at hoggle end i say that his absence was a happy chance because had he been at home he would certainly have said something or done something to offend lady lufton he would either have refused to see her or when seeing her he would have bade her hold her peace and not interfere with matters which did not concern her ormore probable stillhe would have sat still and sullen and have spoken not at all but he was away and mrs crawley sent out word by the servant that she would be most proud to see her ladyship if her ladyship would be pleased to alight her ladyship did alight and walked into the parsonage followed by mrs robarts  grace was with her mother indeed jane had been there also when the message was brought in but she fled into back regions overcome by shame as to her frock grace i think would have fled too had she not been bound in honour to support her mother lady lufton as she entered was very gracious struggling with all the power of her womanhood so to carry herself that there should be no outwardly visible sign of her rank or her wealthbut not altogether succeeding mrs robarts on her first entrance said only a word or two of greeting to mrs crawley and kissed grace whom she had known intimately in early years lady lufton said mrs crawley i am afraid this is a very poor place for you to come to but you have known that of old and therefore i need hardly apologize  sometimes i like poor places best said lady lufton then there was a pause after which lady lufton addressed herself to grace seeking some subject for immediate conversation you have been down at allington my dear have you not grace in a whisper said that she had staying with the dales i believe i know the dales well by name and i have always heard that they are charming people  i like them very much said grace and then there was another pause  i hope your husband is pretty well mrs crawley said lady lufton  he is pretty wellnot quite strong i daresay you know lady lufton that he has things to vex him mrs crawley felt that it was the need of the moment that the only possible subject of conversation in that house should be introduced and therefore she brought it in at once not loving the subject but being strongly conscious of the necessity lady lufton meant to be goodnatured and therefore mrs crawley would do all in her power to make lady luftons mission easy to her  indeed yes said her ladyship we do know that  we feel so much for you and mr crawley said mrs robarts and are so sure that your sufferings are unmerited this was not discreet on the part of mrs robarts as she was the wife of one of the clergymen who had been selected to form the commission of inquiry and so lady lufton told her on their way home  you are very kind said mrs crawley we must only bear it with such fortitude as god will give us we are told that he tempers the wind to the shorn lamb  and so he does my dear said the old lady very solemnly so he does surely you have felt that it is so  i struggle not to complain said mrs crawley  i know that you struggle bravely i hear of you and i admire you for it and i love you it was still the old lady who was speaking and now she had at last been roused out of her difficulty as to words and had risen from her chair and was standing before mrs crawley it is because you do not complain because you are so great and so good because your character is so high and your spirit so firm that i could not resist the temptation of coming to you mrs crawley if you will let me be your friend i shall be proud of your friendship  your ladyship is too good said mrs crawley  do not talk to me after that fashion said lady lufton if you do i shall be disappointed and feel myself thrown back you know what i mean she paused for an answer but mrs crawley had no answer to make she simply shook her head not knowing why she did so but we may know we can understand that she had felt that the friendship offered to her by lady lufton was an impossibility she had decided within her own breast that it was so though she did not know that she had come to such decision i wish you to take me at my word mrs crawley continued lady lufton what can we do for you we know that you are distressed  yeswe are distressed  and we know how cruel circumstances have been to you will you not forgive me for being plain  i have nothing to forgive said mrs crawley  lady lufton means said mrs robarts that in asking you to talk openly to her of your affairs she wishes you to remember that i think you know what we mean said mrs robarts knowing very well herself what she did mean but not knowing at all how to express herself  lady lufton is very kind said mrs crawley and so are you mrs robarts i know how good you both are and for how much it behoves me to be grateful these words were very cold and the voice in which they were spoken was very cold they made lady lufton feel that it was beyond her power to proceed with the work of her mission in its intended spirit it is ever so much easier to proffer kindness graciously than to receive it with grace lady lufton had intended to say let us be women togetherwomen bound by humanity and not separated by rank and let us open our hearts freely let us see how we may be of comfort to each other and could she have succeeded in this she would have spread out her little plans of succour with so loving a hand that she would have conquered the woman before her but the suffering spirit cannot descend from its dignity of reticence it has a nobility of its own made sacred by many tears by the flowing of streams of blood from unseen wounds which cannot descend from its daïs to receive pity and kindness a consciousness of undeserved woe produces a grandeur of its own with which the highsouled sufferer will not easily part baskets full of eggs pounds of eleemosynary butter quarters of given pork even secondhand clothing from the wardrobe of some richer sistereven money unsophisticated money she could accept she had learned to know that it was a portion of her allotted misery to take such thingsfor the sake of her children and her husbandand to be thankful for them she did take them and was thankful and in the taking she submitted herself to the rod of cruel circumstances but she could not even yet bring herself to accept spoken pity from a stranger and to kiss the speaker  can we not do something to help you said mrs robarts she would not have spoken but that she perceived that lady lufton had completed her appeal and that mrs crawley did not seem prepared to answer it  you have done much to help us said mrs crawley the things you have sent to us have been very serviceable  but we mean something more than that said lady lufton  i do not know what there is more said mrs crawley a bit to eat and something to wearthat seems to be all that we have to care for now  but we were afraid that this coming trial must cause you so much anxiety  of course it causes anxietybut what can we do it must be so it cannot be put off or avoided we have made up our minds to it now and almost wish that it would come quicker if it were once over i think that he would be better whatever the result might be  then there was another lull in the conversation and lady lufton began to be afraid that her visit would be a failure she thought that perhaps she might get on better if grace were not in the room and she turned over in her mind various schemes for sending her away and perhaps her task would be easier if mrs robarts also could be banished for a time fanny my dear she said at last boldly i know you have a little plan to arrange with miss crawley perhaps you will be more likely to be successful if you can take a turn with her alone there was not much subtlety in her ladyships scheme but it answered the proposed purpose and the two elder ladies were soon left face to face so that lady lufton had a fair pretext for making another attempt dear mrs crawley she said i do so long to say a word to you but i fear that i may be thought to interfere  oh no lady lufton i have no feeling of that kind  i have asked your daughter and mrs robarts to go out because i can speak more easily to you alone i wish i could teach you to trust me  i do trust you  as a friend i meanas a real friend if it should be the case mrs crawley that a jury should give a verdict against your husbandwhat will you do then perhaps i ought not to suppose that it is possible  of course we know that is possible said mrs crawley her voice was stern and there was in it a tone almost of offence as she spoke she did not look at her visitor but sat with her face averted and her arms akimbo on the table  yesit is possible said lady lufton i suppose there is not one in the county who does not truly wish that it may not be so but it is right to be prepared for all alternatives in such case have you thought what you will do  i do not know what they would do to him said she  i suppose that for some time he would be  put in prison said mrs crawley speaking very quickly bringing out the words with a sharp eagerness that was quite unusual to her they will send him to gaol is it not so lady lufton  i suppose it would be so not for long i should hope but i presume that such would be the sentence for some short period  and i might not go with him  no that would be impossible  and the house and the living would they let him have them again when he came out  ah that i cannot say that will depend much probably on what these clergymen will report i hope he will not put himself in opposition to them  i do not know i cannot say it is probable that he may do so it is not easy for a man so injured as he has been and one at the same time so great in intelligence to submit himself gently to such inquiries when ill is being done to himself or others he is very prone to oppose it  but these gentlemen do not wish to do him ill mrs crawley  i cannot say i do not know when i think of it i see that there is nothing but ruin on every side what is the use of talking of it do not be angry lady lufton if i say that it is of no use  but i desire to be of useof real use if it should be the case mrs crawley that your husband should bedetained at barchester  you mean imprisoned lady lufton  yes i mean imprisoned if it should be so then do you bring yourself and your childrenall of themover to framley and i will find a home for you while he is lost to you  oh lady lufton i could not do that  yes you can you have not heard me yet it would not be a comfort to you in such a home as that to sit at table with people who are partly strangers to you but there is a cottage nearly adjoining to the house which you shall have all to yourself the bailiff lived in it once and others have lived in it who belong to the place but it is empty now and it shall be made comfortable the tears were now running down mrs crawleys face so that she could not answer a word of course it is my sons property and not mine but he has commissioned me to say that it is most heartily at your service he begs that in such case you will occupy it and i beg the same and your old friend lucy has desired me also to ask you in her name  lady lufton i could not do that said mrs crawley through her tears  you must think better of it my dear i do not scruple to advise you because i am older than you and have experience of the world this i think taken in the ordinary sense of the words was a boast on the part of lady lufton for which but little true pretence existed lady luftons experience of the world at large was not perhaps extensive nevertheless she knew what one woman might offer to another and what one woman might receive from another you would be better over with me my dear than you could be elsewhere you will not misunderstand me if i say that under such circumstances it would do your husband good that you and your children should be under our protection during his period of temporary seclusion we stand well in the county perhaps i ought not to say so but i do not know how otherwise to explain myself and when it is known by the bishop and others that you have come to us during that sad time it will be understood that we think well of mr crawley in spite of anything that a jury may say of him do you see that my dear and we do think well of him i have known of your husband for many years though i have not personally had the pleasure of much acquaintance with him he was over at framley once at my request and i had great occasion then to respect him i do respect him and i shall feel grateful to him if he will allow you to put yourself and your children under my wing as being an old woman should this misfortune fall upon him we hope that it will not fall upon him but it is always well to be provided for the worst  in this way lady lufton at last made her speech and opened out the proposal with which she had come laden to hogglestock while she was speaking mrs crawleys shoulder was still turned to her but the speaker could see that the quick tears were pouring themselves down the cheeks of the woman whom she addressed there was a downright honesty of thoroughgoing wellwishing charity about the proposition which overcame mrs crawley altogether she did not feel for a moment that it would be possible for her to go to framley in such circumstances as those which had been suggested as she thought of it all at the present moment it seemed to her that her only appropriate home during the terrible period which was coming upon her would be under the walls of the prison in which her husband would be incarcerated but she fully appreciated the kindness which had suggested a measure which if carried into execution would make the outside world feel that her husband was respected in the county despite the degradation to which he was subjected she felt all this but her heart was too full to speak  say that it shall be so my dear continued lady lufton just give me one nod of assent and the cottage shall be ready for you should it so chance that you should require it  but mrs crawley did not give the nod of assent with her face still averted while the tears were still running down her cheeks she muttered but a word or two i could not do that lady lufton i could not do that  you know at any rate what my wishes are and as you become calmer you will think of it there is quite time enough and i am speaking of an alternative which may never happen my dear friend mrs robarts who is now with your daughter wishes miss crawley to go over to framley parsonage while this inquiry among the clergymen is going on they all say it is the most ridiculous thing in all the worldthis inquiry but the bishop you know is so silly we all think that if miss crawley would go for a week or so to framley parsonage that it will show how happy we all are to receive her it should be while mr robarts is employed in his part of the work what do you say mrs crawley we at framley are all clearly of opinion that it will be best that it should be known that the people in the county uphold your husband miss crawley would be back you know before the trial comes on i hope you will let her come mrs crawley  but even to this proposition mrs crawley could give no assent though she expressed no direct dissent as regarded her own feelings she would much have preferred to have been left to live through her misery alone but she could not but appreciate the kindness which endeavoured to throw over her and hers in their trouble the ægis of firstrate county respectability she was saved from the necessity of giving a direct answer to this suggestion by the return of mrs robarts and grace herself the door was opened slowly and they crept into the room as though they were aware that their presence would be hardly welcomed  is the carriage there fanny said lady lufton it is almost time for us to think of returning home  mrs robarts said that the carriage was standing within twenty yards of the door  then i think we will make a start said lady lufton have you succeeded in persuading miss crawley to come over to framley in april  mrs robarts made no answer to this but looked at grace and grace looked down upon the ground  i have spoken to mrs crawley said lady lufton and they will think of it then the two ladies took their leave and walked out to their carriage  what does she say about your plan mrs robarts asked  she is too brokenhearted to say anything lady lufton answered should it happen that he is convicted we must come over and take her she will have no power then to resist us in anything     chapter li  mrs dobbs broughton piles her fagots   illustration  the picture still progressed up in mrs dobbs broughtons room and the secret was still kept or supposed to be kept miss van siever was at any rate certain that her mother had heard nothing of it and mrs broughton reported from day to day that her husband had not as yet interfered nevertheless there was in these days a great gloom upon the dobbs broughton household so much so that conway dalrymple had more than once suggested to mrs broughton that the work should be discontinued but the mistress of the house would not consent to this in answer to these offers she was wont to declare in somewhat mysterious language that any misery coming upon herself was matter of moment to nobodyhardly even to herself as she was quite prepared to encounter moral and social death without delay if not an absolute physical demise as to which latter alternative she seemed to think that even that might not be so far distant as some people chose to believe what was the cause of the gloom over the house neither conway dalrymple nor miss van siever understood and to speak the truth mrs broughton did not quite understand the cause herself she knew well enough no doubt that her husband came home always sullen and sometimes tipsy and that things were not going well in the city she had never understood much about the city being satisfied with an assurance that had come to her in early days from her friends that there was a mine of wealth in hook court from whence would always come for her use house and furniture a carriage and horses dresses and jewels which latter if not quite real should be manufactured of the best sham substitute known soon after her brilliant marriage with mr dobbs broughton she had discovered that the carriage and horses and the sham jewels did not lift her so completely into a terrestrial paradise as she had taught herself to expect that they would do her brilliant drawingroom with dobbs broughton for a companion was not an elysium but though she had found out early in her married life that something was still wanting to her she had by no means confessed to herself that the carriage and horses and sham jewels were bad and it can hardly be said that she had repented she had endeavoured to patch up matters with a little romance and then had fallen upon conway dalrymplemeaning no harm indeed love with her as it never could have meant much good was not likely to mean much harm that somebody should pretend to love her to which pretence she might reply by a pretence of friendshipthis was the little excitement which she craved and by which she had once flattered herself that something of an elysium might yet be created for her mr dobbs broughton had unreasonably expressed a dislike to this innocent amusementvery unreasonably knowing as he ought to have known that he himself did so very little towards providing the necessary elysium by any qualities of his own for a few weeks this interference from her husband had enhanced the amusement giving an additional excitement to the game she felt herself to be a woman misunderstood and illused and to some women there is nothing so charming as a little mild illusage which does not interfere with their creature comforts with their clothes or their carriage or their sham jewels but suffices to afford them the indulgence of a grievance of late however mr dobbs broughton had become a little too rough in his language and things had gone uncomfortably she suspected that conway dalrymple was not the only cause of all this she had an idea that mr musselboro and mrs van siever had it in their power to make themselves unpleasant and that they were exercising this power of his business in the city her husband never spoke to her nor she to him her own fortune had been very small some couple of thousand pounds or so and she conceived that she had no pretext on which she could unasked interrogate him about his money she had no knowledge that marriage of itself had given her the right to such interference and had such knowledge been hers she would have had no desire to interfere she hoped that the carriage and sham jewels would be continued to her but she did not know how to frame any question on the subject touching the other difficultythe conway dalrymple difficultyshe had her ideas the tenderness of her friendship had been trodden upon and outraged by the rough foot of an overbearing husband and she was illused she would obey it was becoming to her as a wife that she should submit she would give up conway dalrymple and would induce himin spite of his violent attachment to herselfto take a wife she herself would choose a wife for him she herself would with suicidal hands destroy the romance of her own life since an overbearing brutal husband demanded that it should be destroyed she would sacrifice her own feelings and do all in her power to bring conway dalrymple and clara van siever together if after that some poet did not immortalize her friendship in byronic verse she certainly would not get her due perhaps conway dalrymple would himself become a poet in order that this might be done properly for it must be understood that though she expected conway dalrymple to marry she expected also that he should be byronically wretched after his marriage on account of his love for herself  but there was certainly something wrong over and beyond the dalrymple difficulty the servants were not as civil as they used to be and her husband when she suggested to him a little dinnerparty snubbed her most unmercifully the giving of dinnerparties had been his glory and she had made the suggestion simply with the view of pleasing him if the world were going round the wrong way a woman would still want a party he had said sneering at her it was of you i was thinking dobbs she replied not of myself i care little for such gatherings after that she retired to her own room with a romantic tear in each eye and told herself that had chance thrown conway dalrymple into her way before she had seen dobbs broughton she would have been the happiest woman in the world she sat for a while looking into vacancy and thinking that it would be very nice to break her heart how should she set about it should she take to her bed and grow thin she would begin by eating no dinner for ever so many days together at lunch her husband was never present and therefore the broken heart could be displayed at dinner without much positive suffering in the meantime she would implore conway dalrymple to get himself married with as little delay as possible and she would lay upon him her positive order to restrain himself from any word of affection addressed to herself she at any rate would be pure highminded and selfsacrificingalthough romantic and poetic also as was her nature  the picture was progressing and so also as it had come about was the loveaffair between the artist and his model conway dalrymple had begun to think that he might after all do worse than make clara van siever his wife clara van siever was handsome and undoubtedly clever and clara van sievers mother was certainly rich and in addition to this the young lady herself began to like the man into whose society she was thrown the affair seemed to flourish and mrs dobbs broughton should have been delighted she told clara with a very serious air that she was delighted bidding clara at the same time to be very cautious as men were so fickle and as conway though the best fellow in the world was not perhaps altogether free from that common vice of men indeed it might have been surmised from a word or two which mrs broughton allowed to escape that she considered poor conway to be more than ordinarily afflicted in that way miss van siever at first only pouted and said that there was nothing in it there is something in it my dear certainly said mrs dobbs broughton and there can be no earthly reason why there should not be a great deal in it there is nothing in it said miss van siever impetuously and if you will continue to speak of mr dalrymple in that way i must give up the picture as for that said mrs broughton i conceive that we are both of us bound to the young man now seeing that he has given so much time to the work i am not bound to him at all said miss van siever  mrs broughton also told conway dalrymple that she was delightedoh so much delighted he had obtained permission to come in one morning before the time of sitting so that he might work at his canvas independently of his model as was his custom he made his own way upstairs and commenced his work alonehaving been expressly told by mrs broughton that she would not come to him till she brought clara with her but she did go up to the room in which the artist was painting without waiting for miss van siever indeed she was at this time so anxious as to the future welfare of her two young friends that she could not restrain herself from speaking either to the one or to the other whenever any opportunity for such speech came round to have left conway dalrymple at work upstairs without going to him was impossible to her so she went and then took the opportunity of expressing to her friend her ideas as to his past and future conduct  yes it is very good very good indeed she said standing before the easel and looking at the halfcompleted work i do not know that you ever did anything better  i never can tell myself till a picture is finished whether it is going to be good or not said dalrymple thinking really of his picture and of nothing else  i am sure this will be good she said and i suppose it is because you have thrown so much heart into it it is not mere industry that will produce good work nor yet skill nor even genius more than this is required the heart of the artist must be thrust with all its gushing tides into the performance by this time he knew all the tones of her voice and their various meanings and immediately became aware that at the present moment she was intent upon something beyond the picture she was preparing for a little scene and was going to give him some advice he understood it all but as he was really desirous of working at his canvas and was rather averse to having a scene at that moment he made a little attempt to disconcert her it is the heart that gives success she said while he was considering how he might best put an extinguisher upon her romance for the occasion  not at all mrs broughton success depends on elbowgrease  on what conway  on elbowgreasehard work that isand i must work hard now if i mean to take advantage of todays sitting the truth is i dont give enough hours of work to it and he leaned upon his stick and daubed away briskly at the background and then stood for a moment looking at his canvas with his head a little on one side as though he could not withdraw his attention for a moment from the thing he was doing  you mean to say conway that you would rather that i should not speak to you  oh no mrs broughton i did not mean that at all  i wont interrupt you at your work what i have to say is perhaps of no great moment indeed words between you and me never can have much importance now can they conway  i dont see that at all said he still working away with his brush  do you not i do they should never amount to morethey can never amount to more than the common ordinary courtesies of life what i call the greetings and goodbyings of conversation she said this in a low melancholy tone of voice not intending to be in any degree jocose how seldom is it that conversation between ordinary friends goes beyond that  dont you think it does said conway stepping back and taking another look at his picture i find myself talking to all manner of people about all manner of things  you are different from me i cannot talk to all manner of people  politics you know and art and a little scandal and the wars with a dozen other things make talking easy enough i think i grant you this that it is very often a great bore hardly a day passes that i dont wish to cut out somebodys tongue  do you wish to cut out my tongue conway  he began to perceive that she was determined to talk about herself and that there was no remedy he dreaded it not because he did not like the woman but from a conviction that she was going to make some comparison between herself and clara van siever in his ordinary humour he liked a little pretence at romance and was rather good at that sort of lovemaking which in truth means anything but love but just now he was really thinking of matrimony and had on this very morning acknowledged to himself that he had become sufficiently attached to clara van siever to justify him in asking her to be his wife in his present mood he was not anxious for one of those tilts with blunted swords and halfsevered lances in the lists of cupid of which mrs dobbs broughton was so fond nevertheless if she insisted that he should now descend into the arena and go through the paraphernalia of a mock tournament he must obey her it is the hardship of men that when called upon by women for romance they are bound to be romantic whether the opportunity serves them or does not a man must produce romance or at least submit to it when duly summoned even though he should have a sorethroat or a headache he is a brute if he decline such an encounterand feels that should he so decline persistently he will ever after be treated as a brute there are many potiphars wives who never dream of any mischief and josephs who are very anxious to escape though they are asked to return only whisper for whisper mrs dobbs broughton had asked him whether he wished that her tongue should be cut out and he had of course replied that her words had always been a joy to himnever a trouble it occurred to him as he made his little speech that it would only have served her right if he had answered her quite in another strain but she was a woman and was young and pretty and was entitled to flattery they have always been a joy to me he said repeating his last words as he strove to continue his work  a deadly joy she replied not quite knowing what she herself meant a deadly joy conway i wish with all my heart that we had never known each other  i do not i will never wish away the happiness of my life even should it be followed by misery  you are a man and if trouble comes upon you you can bear it on your own shoulders a woman suffers more just because anothers shoulders may have to bear the burden  when she has got a husband you mean  yeswhen she has a husband  its the same with a man when he has a wife hitherto the conversation had had so much of milkandwater in its composition that dalrymple found himself able to keep it up and go on with his background at the same time if she could only be kept in the same dim cloud of sentiment if the hot rays of the sun of romance could be kept from breaking through the mist till miss van siever should come it might still be well he had known her to wander about within the clouds for an hour together without being able to find her way into the light its all the same with a man when he has got a wife he said of course one has to suffer for two when one so to say is two  and what happens when one has to suffer for three she asked  you mean when a woman has children  i mean nothing of the kind conway and you must know that i do not unless your feelings are indeed blunted but worldly success has i suppose blunted them  i rather fancy not he said i think they are pretty nearly as sharp as ever  i know mine are oh how i wish i could rid myself of them but it cannot be done age will not blunt themi am sure of that said mrs broughton i wish it would  he had determined not to talk about herself if the subject could be in any way avoided but now he felt that he was driven up into a cornernow he was forced to speak to her of her own personality you have no experience yet as to that how can you say what age will do  age does not go by years said mrs dobbs broughton we all know that his hair was grey but not with years look here conway and she moved back her tresses from off her temples to show him that there were gray hairs behind he did not see them and had they been very visible she might not perhaps have been so ready to exhibit them no one can say that length of years has blanched them i have no secrets from you about my age one should not be grey before one has reached thirty  i did not see a changed hair  twas the fault of your eyes then for there are plenty of them and what is it has made them grey  they say that hot rooms will do it  hot rooms no conway it does not come from heated atmosphere it comes from a cold heart a chilled heart a frozen heart a heart that is all ice she was getting out of the cloud into the heat now and he could only hope that miss van siever would come soon the world is beginning with you conway and yet you are as old as i am it is ending with me and yet i am as young as you are but i do not know why i talk of all this it is simply follyutter folly i had not meant to speak of myself but i did wish to say a few words to you of your own future i suppose i may still speak to you as a friend  i hope you will always do that  nayi will make no such promise that i will always have a friends feeling for you a friends interest in your welfare a friends triumph in your successthat i will promise but friendly words conway are sometimes misunderstood  never by me said he  no not by youcertainly not by you i did not mean that i did not expect that you should misinterpret them then she laughed hystericallya little low gurgling hysterical laugh and after that she wiped her eyes and then she smiled and then she put her hand very gently upon his shoulder thank god conway we are quite safe thereare we not  he had made a blunder and it was necessary that he should correct it his watch was lying in the trough of his easel and he looked at it and wondered why miss van siever was not there he had tripped and he must make a little struggle and recover his step as i said before it shall never be misunderstood by me i have never been vain enough to suppose for a moment that there was any other feelingnot for a moment you women can be so careful while we men are always off our guard a man loves because he cannot help it but a woman has been careful and answers himwith friendship perhaps i am wrong to say that i never thought of winning anything more but i never think of winning more now why the mischief didnt miss van siever come in another five minutes despite himself he would be on his knees making a mock declaration and she would be pouring forth the vial of her mock wrath or giving him mock counsel as to the restraint of his passion he had gone through it all before and was tired of it but for his life he did not know how to help himself  conway said she gravely how dare you address me in such language  of course it is very wrong i know that  im not speaking of myself now i have learned to think so little of myself as even to be indifferent to the feeling of the injury you are doing me my life is a blank and i almost think that nothing can hurt me further i have not heart left enough to break no not enough to be broken it is not of myself that i am thinking when i ask you how you dare to address me in such language do you not know that it is an injury to another  to what other asked conway dalrymple whose mind was becoming rather confused and who was not quite sure whether the other one was mr dobbs broughton or somebody else  to that poor girl who is coming here now who is devoted to you and to whom i do not doubt you have uttered words which ought to have made it impossible for you to speak to me as you spoke not a moment since  things were becoming very grave and difficult they would have been very grave indeed had not some god saved him by sending miss van siever to his rescue at this moment he was beginning to think what he would say in answer to the accusation now made when his eager ear caught the sound of her step upon the stairs and before the pause in the conversation which the circumstances admitted had given place to the necessity for further speech miss van siever had knocked at the door and had entered the room he was rejoiced and i think that mrs broughton did not regret the interference it is always well that these little dangerous scenes should be brought to sudden ends the last details of such romances if drawn out to their natural conclusions are apt to be uncomfortable if not dull she did not want him to go down on his knees knowing that the getting up again is always awkward  clara i began to think you were never coming said mrs broughton with her sweetest smile  i began to think so myself also said clara and i believe this must be the last sitting or at any rate the last but one  is anything the matter at home said mrs broughton clasping her hands together  nothing very much mamma asked me a question or two this morning and i said i was coming here had she asked me why i should have told her  but what did she ask what did she say  she does not always make herself very intelligible she complains without telling you what she complains of but she muttered something about artists which was not complimentary and i suppose therefore that she has a suspicion she stayed ever so late this morning and we left the house together she will ask some direct question tonight or before long and then there will be an end of it  let us make the best of our time then said dalrymple and the sitting was arranged miss van siever went down on her knees with her hammer in her hand and the work began mrs broughton had twisted a turban round claras head as she always did on these occasions and assisted to arrange the drapery she used to tell herself as she did so that she was like isaac piling the fagots for her own sacrifice only isaac had piled them in ignorance and she piled them conscious of the sacrificial flames and isaac had been saved whereas it was impossible that the catching of any ram in any thicket could save her but nevertheless she arranged the drapery with all her skill piling the fagots ever so high for her own pyre in the meantime conway dalrymple painted away thinking more of his picture than he did of one woman or of the other  illustration mrs dobbs broughton piles her fagots  after a while when mrs broughton had piled the fagots as high as she could pile them she got up from her seat and prepared to leave the room much of the piling consisted of course in her own absence during a portion of these sittings conway she said as she went if this is to be the last sitting or the last but one you should make the most of it then she threw upon him a very peculiar glance over the head of the kneeling jael and withdrew jael who in those moments would be thinking more of the fatigue of her position than of anything else did not at all take home to herself the peculiar meaning of her friends words conway dalrymple understood them thoroughly and thought that he might as well take the advice given to him he had made up his mind to propose to miss van siever and why should he not do so now he went on with his brush for a couple of minutes without saying a word working as well as he could work and then resolved that he would at once begin the other task miss van siever he said im afraid you are tired  not more than usually tired it is fatiguing to be slaying sisera by the hour together i do get to hate this block the block was the dummy by which the form of sisera was supposed to be typified  another sitting will about finish it said he so that you need not positively distress yourself now will you rest yourself for a minute or two he had already perceived that the attitude in which clara was posed before him was not one in which an offer of marriage could be received and replied to with advantage  thank you i am not tired yet said clara not changing the fixed glance of national wrath with which she regarded her wooden sisera as she held her hammer on high  but i am there we will rest for a moment dalrymple was aware that mrs dobbs broughton though she was very assiduous in piling her fagots never piled them for long together if he did not make haste she would be back upon them before he could get his word spoken when he put down his brush and got up from his chair and stretched out his arm as a man does when he ceases for a moment from his work clara of course got up also and seated herself she was used to her turban and her drapery and therefore thought not of it at all and he also was used to it seeing her in it two or three times a week but now that he intended to accomplish a special purpose the turban and the drapery seemed to be in the way i do so hope you will like the picture he said as he was thinking of this  i dont think i shall but you will understand that it is natural that a girl should not like herself in such a portraiture as that  i dont know why i can understand that you specially should not like the picture but i think that most women in london in your place would at any rate say that they did  are you angry with me  what for telling the truth no indeed he was standing opposite to his easel looking at the canvas shifting his head about so as to change the lights and observing critically this blemish and that and yet he was all the while thinking how he had best carry out his purpose it will have been a prosperous picture to me he said at last if it leads to the success of which i am ambitious  i am told that all you do is successful nowmerely because you do it that is the worst of success  what is the worst of success  that when won by merit it leads to further success for the gaining of which no merit is necessary  i hope it may be so in my case if it is not i shall have a very poor chance clara i think you must know that i am not talking about my pictures  i thought you were  indeed i am not as for success in my profession far as i am from thinking i merit it i feel tolerably certain that i shall obtain it  you have obtained it  i am in the way to do so perhaps one out of ten struggling artists is successful and for him the profession is very charming it is certainly a sad feeling that there is so much of chance in the distribution of the prizes it is a lottery but one cannot complain of that when one has drawn the prize dalrymple was not a man without selfpossession nor was he readily abashed but he found it easier to talk of his possession than to make his offer the turban was his difficulty he had told himself over and over again within the last five minutes that he would have long since said what he had to say had it not been for the turban he had been painting all his life from living modelsfrom women dressed up in this or that costume to suit the necessities of his picturebut he had never made love to any of them they had been simply models to him and now he found that there was a difficulty of that prize he said i have made myself tolerably sure but as to the other prize i do not know i wonder whether i am to have that of course miss van siever understood well what was the prize of which he was speaking and as she was a young woman with a will and purpose of her own no doubt she was already prepared with an answer but it was necessary that the question should be put to her in properly distinct terms conway dalrymple certainly had not put his question in properly distinct terms at present she did not choose to make any answer to his last words and therefore simply suggested that as time was pressing he had better go on with his work i am quite ready now said she  stop half a moment how much more you are thinking of the picture than i am i do not care twopence for the picture i will slit the canvas from top to bottom without a groanwithout a single inner groanif you will let me  for heavens sake do nothing of the kind why should you  just to show you that it is not for the sake of the picture that i come here clara then the door was opened and isaac appeared very weary having been piling fagots with assiduity till human nature could pile no more conway dalrymple who had made his way almost up to claras seat turned round sharply towards his easel in anger at having been disturbed he should have been more grateful for all that his isaac had done for him and have recognized the fact that the fault had been with himself mrs broughton had been twelve minutes out of the room she had counted them to be fifteenhaving no doubt made a mistake as to threeand had told herself that with such a one as conway dalrymple with so much of the work ready done to his hand for him fifteen minutes should have been amply sufficient when we reflect what her own thoughts must have been during the intervalwhat it is to have to pile up such fagots as those how she was as it were giving away a fresh morsel of her own heart during each minute that she allowed clara and conway dalrymple to remain together it cannot surprise us that her eyes should have become dizzy and that she should not have counted the minutes with accurate correctness dalrymple turned to his picture angrily but miss van siever kept her seat and did not show the slightest emotion  my friends said mrs broughton this will not do this is not working this is not sitting  mr dalrymple has been explaining to me the precarious nature of an artists profession said clara  it is not precarious with him said mrs dobbs broughton sententiously  not in a general way perhaps but to prove the truth of his words he was going to treat jael worse than jael treats sisera  i was going to slit the picture from the top to the bottom  and why said mrs broughton putting up her hands to heaven in tragic horror  just to show miss van siever how little i care about it  and how little you care about her too said mrs broughton  she might take that as she liked after this there was another genuine sitting and the real work went on as though there had been no episode jael fixed her face and held her hammer as though her mind and heart were solely bent on seeming to be slaying sisera dalrymple turned his eyes from the canvas to the model and from the model to the canvas working with his hand all the while as though that last pathetic clara had never been uttered and mrs dobbs broughton reclined on a sofa looking at them and thinking of her own singularly romantic position till her mind was filled with a poetic frenzy in one moment she resolved that she would hate clara as woman was never hated by woman and then there were daggers and poisoncups and strangling cords in her eye in the next she was as firmly determined that she would love mrs conway dalrymple as woman never was loved by woman and then she saw herself kneeling by a cradle and tenderly nursing a baby of which conway was to be the father and clara the mother and so she went to sleep  for some time dalrymple did not observe this but at last there was a little soundeven the illnature of miss demolines could hardly have called it a snoreand he became aware that for practical purposes he and miss van siever were again alone together clara he said in a whisper mrs broughton instantly aroused herself from her slumbers and rubbed her eyes dear dear dear she said i declare its past one im afraid i must turn you both out one more sitting i suppose will finish it conway  yes one more said he it was always understood that he and clara should not leave the house together and therefore he remained painting when she left the room and now conway said mrs broughton i suppose that all is over  i dont know what you mean by all being over  noof course not you look at it in another light no doubt everything is beginning for you but you must pardon me for my heart is distracteddistracteddistracted then she sat down upon the floor and burst into tears what was he to do he thought that the woman should either give him up altogether or not give him up all this fuss about it was irrational he would not have made love to clara van siever in her room if she had not told him to do so  maria he said in a very grave voice any sacrifice that is required on my part on your behalf i am ready to make  no sir the sacrifices shall all be made by me it is the part of a woman to be ever sacrificial poor mrs dobbs broughton you shall give up nothing the world is at your feet and you shall have everythingyouth beauty wealth station lovelove and friendship also if you will accept it from one so poor so broken so secluded as i shall be at each of the last words there had been a desperate sob and as she was still crouching in the middle of the room looking up into dalrymples face while he stood over her the scene was one which had much in it that transcended the doings of everyday life much that would be ever memorable and much i have no doubt that was thoroughly enjoyed by the principal actor as for conway dalrymple he was so secondrate a personage in the whole thing that it mattered little whether he enjoyed it or not i dont think he did enjoy it and now conway she said i will give you some advice and when in afterdays you shall remember this interview and reflect how that advice was given youwith what solemnityhere she clasped both her hands togetheri think that you will follow it clara van siever will now become your wife  i do not know that at all said dalrymple  clara van siever will now become your wife repeated mrs broughton in a louder voice impatient of opposition love her cleave to her make her flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone but rule her yes rule her let her be your second self but not your first self rule her love her cleave to her do not leave her alone to feed on her own thoughts as i have doneas i have been forced to do now go no conway not a word i will not hear a word you must go or i must then she rose quickly from her lowly attitude and prepared herself for a dart at the door it was better by far that he should go and so he went  an american when he has spent a pleasant day will tell you that he has had a good time i think that mrs dobbs broughton if she had ever spoken the truth of that days employment would have acknowledged that she had had a good time i think that she enjoyed her mornings work but as for conway dalrymple i doubt whether he did enjoy his mornings work a man may have too much of this sort of thing and then he becomes very sick of his cake such was the nature of his thoughts as he returned to his own abode     chapter lii  why dont you have an it for yourself   of course it came to pass that lily dale and emily dunstable were soon very intimate and that they saw each other every day indeed before long they would have been living together in the same house had it not been that the squire had felt reluctant to abandon the independence of his own lodgings when mrs thorne had pressed her invitation for the second and then for the third time asking them both to come to her large house he had begged his niece to go and leave him alone you need not regard me he had said speaking not with the whining voice of complaint but with that thin tinge of melancholy which was usual to him i am so much alone down at allington that you need not mind leaving me but lily would not go on those terms and therefore they still lived together in the lodgings nevertheless lily was every day at mrs thornes house and thus a great intimacy grew up between the girls emily dunstable had neither brother nor sister and lilys nearest male relative in her own degree was now miss dunstables betrothed husband it was natural therefore that they should at any rate try to like each other it afterwards came to pass that lily did go to mrs thornes house and she stayed there for awhile but when that occurred the squire had gone back to allington  among other generous kindnesses mrs thorne insisted that bernard should hire a horse for his cousin lily emily dunstable rode daily and of course captain dale rode with herand now lily joined the party almost before she knew what was being done she found herself provided with hat and habit and horse and whip it was a way with mrs thorne that they who came within the influence of her immediate sphere should be made to feel that the comforts and luxuries arising from her wealth belonged to a common stock and were the joint property of them all things were not offered and taken and talked about but they made their appearance and were used as a matter of course if you go to stay at a gentlemans house you understand that as a matter of course you will be provided with meat and drink some hosts furnish you also with cigars a small number give you stabling and forage for your horse and a very select few mount you on hunting days and send you out with a groom and a second horse mrs thorne went beyond all others in this openhanded hospitality she had enormous wealth at her command and had but few of those allabsorbing drains upon wealth which in this country make so many rich men poor she had no family propertyno place to keep up in which she did not live she had no retainers to be maintained because they were retainers she had neither sons nor daughters consequently she was able to be lavish in her generosity and as her heart was very lavish she would have given her friends gold to eat had gold been good for eating indeed there was no measure in her givingunless when the idea came upon her that the recipient of her favours was trading on them then she could hold her hand very stoutly  lily dale had not liked the idea of being fitted out thus expensively a box at the opera was all very well as it was not procured especially for her and tickets for other theatres did not seem to come unnaturally for a night or two but her spirit had militated against the hat and the habit and the horse the whip was a little present from emily dunstable and that of course was accepted with a good grace then there came the horseas though from the heavens there seemed to be ten horses twenty horses if anybody needed them all these things seemed to flow naturally into mrs thornes establishment like air through the windows it was very pleasant but lily hesitated when she was told that a habit was to be given to her my dear old aunt insists said emily dunstable nobody ever thinks of refusing anything from her if you only knew what some people will take and some people will even ask who have nothing to do with her at all but i have nothing to do with herin that way i mean said lily oh yes you have said emily you and bernard are as good as brother and sister and bernard and i are as good as man and wife and my aunt and i are as good as mother and daughter so you see in a sort of a way you are a child of the house so lily accepted the habit but made a stand at the hat and paid for that out of her own pocket when the squire had seen lily on horseback he asked her questions about it it was a hired horse i suppose he said i think it came direct from heaven said lily what do you mean lily said the squire angrily i mean that when people are so rich and goodnatured as mrs thorne it is no good inquiring where things come from all that i know is that the horses come out of potts liverystable they talk of potts as if he were a goodnatured man who provides horses for the world without troubling anybody then the squire spoke to bernard about it saying that he should insist on defraying his nieces expenses but bernard swore that he could give his uncle no assistance i would not speak to her about such a thing for all the world said bernard then i shall said the squire  in those days lily thought much of johnny eamesgave to him perhaps more of that thought which leads to love than she had ever given him before she still heard the crawley question discussed every day mrs thorne as we all know was at this time a barsetshire personage and was of course interested in barsetshire subjects and she was specially anxious in the matter having strong hopes with reference to the marriage of major grantly and grace and strong hopes also that graces father might escape the fangs of justice the crawley case was constantly in lilys ears and as constantly she heard high praise awarded to johnny for his kindness in going after the arabins he must be a fine young fellow said mrs thorne and well have him down at chaldicotes some day old lord de guest found him out and made a friend of him and old lord de guest was no fool lily was not altogether free from a suspicion that mrs thorne knew the story of johnnys love and was trying to serve johnnyas other people had tried to do very ineffectually when this suspicion came upon her she would shut her heart against her lovers praises and swear that she would stand by those two letters which she had written in her book at home but the suspicion would not be always there and there did come upon her a conviction that her lover was more esteemed among men and women than she had been accustomed to believe her cousin bernard dale who certainly was regarded in the world as somebody spoke of him as his equal whereas in former days bernard had always regarded johnny eames as standing low in the worlds regard then lily when alone would remember a certain comparison which she once made between adolphus crosbie and john eames when neither of the men had as yet pleaded his cause to her and which had been very much in favour of the former she had then declared that johnny was a mere clerk she had a higher opinion of him nowa much higher opinion even though he could never be more to her than a friend  in these days lilys new ally emily dunstable seemed to lily to be so happy there was in emily a complete realization of that idea of antenuptial blessedness of which lily had often thought so much whatever emily did she did for bernard and to give captain dale his due he received all the sweets which were showered upon him with becoming signs of gratitude i suppose it is always the case at such times that the girl has the best of it and on this occasion emily dunstable certainly made the most of her happiness i do envy you lily said one day the acknowledgment seemed to have been extorted from her involuntarily she did not laugh as she spoke or follow up what she had said with other words intended to take away the joke of what she had utteredhad it been a joke but she sat silent looking at the girl who was rearranging flowers which bernard had brought to her  i cant give him up to you you know said emily  i dont envy you him but it said lily  then go and get an it for yourself why dont you have an it for yourself you can have an it tomorrow if you likeor two or three if all that i hear is true  no i cant said lily things have gone wrong with me dont ask me anything more about it pray dont i shant speak of it if you do  of course i will not if you tell me i must not  i do tell you so i have been a fool to say anything about it however i have got over my envy now and am ready to go out with your aunt here she is  things have gone wrong with me she repeated the same words to herself over and over again with all the efforts which she had made she could not quite reconcile herself to the two letters which she had written in the book this coming up to london and riding in the park and going to the theatres seemed to unsettle her at home she had schooled herself down into quiescence and made herself think that she believed that she was satisfied with the prospects of her life but now she was all astray again doubting about herself hankering after something over and beyond that which seemed to be allotted to herbut nevertheless assuring herself that she never would accept of anything else  i must not if i can help it let the reader suppose that she was softening her heart to john eames because john eames was spoken well of in the world but with all of us in the opinion which we form of those around us we take unconsciously the opinion of others a woman is handsome because the world says so music is charming to us because it charms others we drink our wines with other mens palates and look at our pictures with other mens eyes when lily heard john eames praised by all around her it could not be but that she should praise him toonot out loud as others did but in the silence of her heart and then his constancy to her had been so perfect if that other one had never come if it could be that she might begin again and that she might be spared that episode in her life which had brought him and her together  when is mr eames going to be back mrs thorne said at dinner one day on this occasion the squire was dining at mrs thornes house and there were three or four others thereamong them a mr harold smith who was in parliament and his wife and john eamess especial friend sir raffle buffle the question was addressed to the squire but the squire was slow to answer and it was taken up by sir raffle buffle  hell be back on the 15th said the knight unless he means to play truant i hope he wont do that as his absence has been a terrible inconvenience to me then sir raffle explained that john eames was his private secretary and that johnnys journey to the continent had been made with and could not have been made without his sanction when i came to hear the story of course i told him that he must go eames i said take the advice of a man who knows the world circumstanced as you are you are bound to go and he went  upon my word that was very goodnatured of you said mrs thorne  i never keep a fellow to his desk who has really got important business elsewhere said sir raffle the country i say can afford to do as much as that for her servants but then i like to know that the business is business one doesnt choose to be humbugged  i daresay you are humbugged as you call it very often said harold smith  perhaps so perhaps i am perhaps that is the opinion which they have of me at the treasury but you were hardly long enough there smith to have learned much about it i should say  i dont suppose i should have known much about it as you call it if i had stayed till doomsday  i daresay not i daresay not men who begin as late as you did never know what official life really means now ive been at it all my life and i think i do understand it  its not a profession i should like unless where its joined with politics said harold smith  but then its apt to be so short said sir raffle buffle now it had happened once in the life of mr harold smith that he had been in a ministry but unfortunately that ministry had gone out almost within a week of the time of mr smiths adhesion sir raffle and mr smith had known each other for many years and were accustomed to make civil little speeches to each other in society  id sooner be a horse in a mill than have to go to an office every day said mrs smith coming to her husbands assistance you sir raffle have kept yourself fresh and pleasant through it all but who besides you ever did  i hope i am fresh said sir raffle and as for pleasantness i will leave that for you to determine  there can be but one opinion said mrs thorne  the conversation had strayed away from john eames and lily was disappointed it was a pleasure to her when people talked of him in her hearing and as a question or two had been asked about him making him the hero of the moment it seemed to her that he was being robbed of his due when the little amenities between mr and mrs harold smith and sir raffle banished his name from the circle nothing more however was said of him at dinner and i fear that he would have been altogether forgotten throughout the evening had not lily herself referrednot to him which she could not possibly have been induced to dobut to the subject of his journey i wonder whether poor mr crawley will be found guilty she said to sir raffle up in the drawingroom  i am afraid he will i am afraid he will said sir raffle and i fear my dear miss dale that i must go further than that i fear i must express an opinion that he is guilty  nothing will ever make me think so said lily  ladies are always tenderhearted said sir raffle and especially young ladiesand especially pretty young ladies i do not wonder that such should be your opinion but you see miss dale a man of business has to look at these things in a business light what i want to know is where did he get the cheque he is bound to be explicit in answering that before anybody can acquit him  that is just what mr eames has gone abroad to learn  it is very well for eames to go abroadthough upon my word i dont know whether i should not have given him different advice if i had known how much i was to be tormented by his absence the thing couldnt have happened at a more unfortunate timethe ministry going out and everything but as i was saying it is all very well for him to do what he can he is related to them and is bound to save the honour of his relations if it be possible i like him for going i always liked him as i said to my friend de guest that young man will make his way and i rather fancy that the chance word which i spoke then to my valued old friend was not thrown away in eamess favour but my dear miss dale where did mr crawley get that cheque thats what i want to know if you can tell me that then i can tell you whether or no he will be acquitted  lily did not feel a strong prepossession in favour of sir raffle in spite of his praise of john eames the harsh voice of the man annoyed her and his egotism offended her when much later in the evening his character came on for discussion between herself and mrs thorne and emily dunstable she had not a word to say in his favour but still she had been pleased to meet him because he was the man with whom johnnys life was most specially concerned i think that a portion of her dislike to him arose from the fact that in continuing the conversation he did not revert to his private secretary but preferred to regale her with stories of his own doings in wonderful cases which had partaken of interest similar to that which now attached itself to mr crawleys case he had known a man who had stolen a hundred pounds and had never been found out and another man who had been arrested for stealing twoandsixpence which was found afterwards sticking to a bit of butter at the bottom of a plate mrs thorne had heard all this and had answered him dear me sir raffle she had said what a great many thieves you have had among your acquaintance this had rather disconcerted him and then there had been no more talking about mr crawley  it had been arranged on this morning that mr dale should return to allington and leave lily with mrs thorne some special need of his presence at home real or assumed had arisen and he had declared that he must shorten his stay in london by about half the intended period the need would not have been so pressing probably had he not felt that lily would be more comfortable with mrs thorne than in his lodgings in sackville street lily had at first declared that she would return with him but everybody had protested against this emily dunstable had protested against it very stoutly mrs dale herself had protested against it by letter and mrs thornes protest had been quite imperious in its nature indeed my dear youll do nothing of the kind im sure your mother wouldnt wish it i look upon it as quite essential that you and emily should learn to know each other but we do know each other dont we emily said lily not quite well yet said emily then lily had laughed and so the matter was settled and now on this present occasion mr dale was at mrs thornes house for the last time his conscience had been perplexed about lilys horse and if anything was to be said it must be said now the subject was very disagreeable to him and he was angry with bernard because bernard had declined to manage it for him after his own fashion but he had told himself so often that anything was better than a pecuniary obligation that he was determined to speak his mind to mrs thorne and to beg her to allow him to have his way so he waited till the harold smiths were gone and sir raffle buffle and then when lily was apart with emilyfor bernard dale had left themhe found himself at last alone with mrs thorne  i cant be too much obliged to you he said for your kindness to my girl  oh laws thats nothing said mrs thorne we look on her as one of us now  im sure she is gratefulvery grateful and so am i she and bernard have been brought up so much together that it is very desirable that she should be not unknown to bernards wife  exactlythats just what i mean bloods thicker than water isnt it emilys child if she has one will be lilys cousin  her firstcousin once removed said the squire who was accurate in these matters then he drew himself up in his seat and compressed his lips together and prepared himself for his task it was very disagreeable nothing he thought could be more disagreeable i have a little thing to speak about he said at last which i hope will not offend you  about lily  yes about lily  im not very easily offended and i dont know how i could possibly be offended about her  im an oldfashioned man mrs thorne and dont know much about the ways of the world i have always been down in the country and maybe i have prejudices you wont refuse to humour one of them i hope  youre beginning to frighten me mr dale what is it  about lilys horse  lilys horse what about her horse i hope hes not vicious  she is riding every day with your niece said the squire thinking it best to stick to his own point  it will do her all the good in the world said mrs thorne  very likely i dont doubt it i do not in the least disapprove her riding but  but what mr dale  i should be so much obliged if i might be allowed to pay the liverystable keepers bill  oh laws a mercy  i daresay it may sound odd but as i have a fancy about it im sure youll gratify me  of course i will ill remember it ill make it all right with bernard bernard and i have no end of accountsor shall have before longand well make an item of it then you can arrange with bernard afterwards  mr dale as he got up to go away felt that he was beaten but he did not know how to carry the battle any further on that occasion he could not take out his purse and put down the cost of the horse on the table i will then speak to my nephew about it he said very gravely as he went away and he did speak to his nephew about it and even wrote to him more than once but it was all to no purpose mr potts could not be induced to give a separate bill andso said bernardswore at last that he would furnish no account to anybody for horses that went to mrs thornes door except to mrs thorne herself  that night lily took leave of her uncle and remained at mrs thornes house as things were now arranged she would no doubt be in london when john eames returned if he should find her in townand she told herself that if she was in town he certainly would find herhe would doubtless repeat to her the offer he had so often made before she never ventured to tell herself that she doubted as to the answer to be made to him the two letters were written in the book and must remain there but she felt that she would have had more courage for persistency down at allington than she would be able to summon to her assistance up in london she knew she would be weak should she be found by him alone in mrs thornes drawingroom it would be better for her to make some excuse and go home she was resolved that she would not become his wife she could not extricate herself from the dominion of a feeling which she believed to be love for another man she had given a solemn promise both to her mother and to john eames that she would not marry that other man but in doing so she had made a solemn promise to herself that she would not marry john eames she had sworn it and would keep her oath and yet she regretted it in writing home to her mother the next day she told mrs dale that all the world was speaking well of john eamesthat john had won for himself a reputation of his own and was known far and wide to be a noble fellow she could not keep herself from praising john eames though she knew that such praise might and would be used against her at some future time though i cannot love him i will give him his due she said to herself  i wish you would make up your mind to have an it for yourself emily dunstable said to her again that night a nice it so that i could make a friend perhaps a brother of him  i shall never have an it if i live to be a hundred said lily dale     chapter liii  rotten row   illustration  lily had heard nothing as to the difficulty about her horse and could therefore enjoy her exercise without the drawback of feeling that her uncle was subjected to an annoyance she was in the habit of going out every day with bernard and emily dunstable and their party was generally joined by others who would meet them at mrs thornes house for mrs thorne was a very hospitable woman and there were many who liked well enough to go to her house late in the afternoon there would be a great congregation of horses before the doorsometimes as many as a dozen and then the cavalcade would go off into the park and there it would become scattered as neither bernard nor miss dunstable were unconscionable lovers lily in these scatterings did not often find herself neglected or lost her cousin would generally remain with her and as in those days she had no it of her own she was well pleased that he should do so  but it so happened that on a certain afternoon she found herself riding in rotten row alone with a certain stout gentleman whom she constantly met at mrs thornes house his name was onesiphorus dunn and he was usually called siph by his intimate friends it had seemed to lily that everybody was an intimate friend of mr dunns and she was in daily fear lest she should make a mistake and call him siph herself had she done so it would not have mattered in the least mr dunn had he observed it at all would neither have been flattered nor angry a great many young ladies about london did call him siph and to him it was quite natural that they should do so he was an irishman living on the best of everything in the world with apparently no fortune of his own and certainly never earning anything everybody liked him and it was admitted on all sides that there was no safer friend in the world either for young ladies or young men than mr onesiphorus dunn he did not borrow money and he did not encroach he did like being asked out to dinner and he did think that they to whom he gave the light of his countenance in town owed him the return of a weeks run in the country he neither shot nor hunted nor fished nor read and yet he was never in the way in any house he did play billiards and whist and croquetvery badly he was a good judge of wine and would occasionally condescend to look after the bottling of it on behalf of some very intimate friend he was a great friend of mrs thornes with whom he always spent ten days in the autumn at chaldicotes  bernard and emily were not insatiable lovers but nevertheless mrs thorne had thought it proper to provide a fourth in the ridingparties and had put mr dunn upon this duty dont bother yourself about it siph she had said only if those lovers should go off philandering out of sight our little country lassie might find herself to be nowhere in the park siph had promised to make himself useful and had done so there had generally been so large a number in their party that the work imposed on mr dunn had been very light lily had never found out that he had been especially consigned to her as her own cavalier but had seen quite enough of him to be aware that he was a pleasant companion to her thinking as she ever was thinking about johnny eames siph was much more agreeable than might have been a younger man who would have endeavoured to make her think about himself  thus when she found herself riding alone in rotten row with siph dunn she was neither disconcerted nor displeased he had been talking to her about lord de guest whom he had knownfor siph knew everybodyand lily had begun to wonder whether he knew john eames she would have liked to hear the opinion of such a man about john eames she was making up her mind that she would say something about the crawley matternot intending of course to mention john eamess namewhen suddenly her tongue was paralyzed and she could not speak at that moment they were standing near a corner where a turning path made an angle in the iron rails mr dunn having proposed that they should wait there for a few minutes before they returned home as it was probable that bernard and miss dunstable might come up they had been there for some five or ten minutes and lily had asked her first question about the crawleysinquiring of mr dunn whether he had heard of a terrible accusation which had been made against a clergyman in barsetshirewhen on a sudden her tongue was paralyzed as they were standing lilys horse was turned towards the diverging path whereas mr dunn was looking the other way towards achilles and apsley house mr dunn was nearer to the railings but though they were thus looking different ways they were so placed that each could see the face of the other then on a sudden coming slowly towards her along the diverging path and leaning on the arm of another man she sawadolphus crosbie  she had never seen him since a day on which she had parted from him with many kisseswith warm pressing eager kissesof which she had been nowhat ashamed he had then been to her almost as her husband she had trusted him entirely and had thrown herself into his arms with a full reliance there is often much of reticence on the part of a woman towards a man to whom she is engaged something also of shamefacedness occasionally there exists a shadow of doubt at least of that hesitation which shows that in spite of vows the woman knows that a change may come and that provision for such possible steps backward should always be within her reach but lily had cast all such caution to the winds she had given herself to the man entirely and had determined that she would sink or swim stand or fall live or die by him and by his truth he had been as false as hell she had been in his arms clinging to him kissing him swearing that her only pleasure in the world was to be with himwith him her treasure her promised husband and within a month a week he had been false to her there had come upon her crushing tidings and she had for days wondered at herself that they had not killed her but she had lived and had forgiven him she had still loved him and had received new offers from him which had been answered as the reader knows but she had never seen him since the day on which she had parted from him at allington without a doubt as to his faith now he was before her walking on the footpath almost within reach of her whip  he did not recognize her but as he passed on he did recognize mr onesiphorus dunn and stopped to speak to him or it might have been that crosbies friend fowler pratt stopped with this special objectfor siph dunn was an intimate friend of fowler pratts crosbie and siph were also acquainted but in those days crosbie did not care much for stopping his friends in the park or elsewhere he had become moody and discontented and was generally seen going about the world alone on this special occasion he was having a little special conversation about money with his very old friend fowler pratt  what siph is this you youre always on horseback now said fowler pratt  well yes i have gone in a good deal for cavalry work this last month ive been lucky enough to have a young lady to ride with me this he said in a whisper which the distance of lily justified how dye do crosbie one doesnt often see you on horseback or on foot either  ive something to do besides going to look or to be looked at said crosbie then he raised his eyes and saw lilys sideface and recognized her had he seen her before he had been stopped on his way i think he would have passed on endeavouring to escape observation but as it was his feet had been arrested before he knew of her close vicinity and now it would seem that he was afraid of her and was flying from her were he at once to walk off leaving his friend behind him and he knew that she had seen him and had recognized him and was now suffering from his presence he could not but perceive that it was so from the fixedness of her face and from the constrained manner in which she gazed before her his friend fowler pratt had never seen miss dale though he knew very much of her history siph dunn knew nothing of the history of crosbie and his love and was unaware that he and lily had ever seen each other there was thus no help near her to extricate her from her difficulty  when a man has any work to do in the world said siph he always boasts of it to his acquaintance and curses his luck to himself i have nothing to do and can go about to see and to be seenand i must own that i like it  especially the being seeneh siph said fowler pratt i also have nothing on earth to do and i come here every day because it is as easy to do that as to go anywhere else  crosbie was still looking at lily he could not help himself he could not take his eyes from off her he could see that she was as pretty as ever that she was but very little altered she was in truth somewhat stouter than in the old days but of that he took no special notice should he speak to her should he try to catch her eye and then raise his hat should he go up to her horses head boldly and ask her to let bygones be bygones he had an idea that of all courses which he could pursue that was the one which she would approve the bestwhich would be most efficacious for him if with her anything from him might have any efficacy but he could not do it he did not know what words he might best use would it become him humbly to sue to her for pardon or should he strive to express his unaltered love by some tone of his voice or should he simply ask her after her health he made one step towards her and he saw that the face became more rigid and more fixed than before and then he desisted he told himself that he was simply hateful to her he thought that he could perceive that there was no tenderness mixed with her unabated anger  at this moment bernard dale and emily came close upon him and bernard saw him at once it was through bernard that lily and crosbie had come to know each other he and bernard dale had been fast friends in old times and had of course been bitter enemies since the day of crosbies treachery they had never spoken since though they had often seen each other and dale was not at all disposed to speak to him now the moment that he recognized crosbie he looked across to his cousin for an instant an idea had flashed across him that he was there by her permissionwith her assent but it required no second glance to show him that this was not the case dunn he said i think we will ride on and he put his horse into a trot siph whose ear was very accurate and who knew at once that something was wrong trotted on with him and lily of course was not left behind is there anything the matter said emily to her lover  nothing specially the matter he replied but you were standing in company with the greatest blackguard that ever lived and i thought we had better change our ground  bernard said lily flashing on him with all the fire which her eyes could command then she remembered that she could not reprimand him for the offence of such abuse in such a company so she reined in her horse and fell aweeping  siph dunn with his wicked cleverness knew the whole story at once remembering that he had once heard something of crosbie having behaved very ill to some one before he married lady alexandrina de courcy he stopped his horse also falling a little behind lily so that he might not be supposed to have seen her tears and began to hum a tune emily also though not wickedly clever understood something of it if bernard says anything to make you angry i will scold him she said then the two girls rode on together in front while bernard fell back with siph dunn  pratt said crosbie putting his hand on his friends shoulder as soon as the party had ridden out of hearing do you see that girl there in the dark blue habit  what the one nearest to the path  yes the one nearest to the path that is lily dale  lily dale said fowler pratt  yes that is lily dale  did you speak to her pratt asked  no she gave me no chance she was there but a moment but it was herself it seems so odd to me that i should have been thus so near her again if there was any man to whom crosbie could have spoken freely about lily dale it was this man fowler pratt pratt was the oldest friend he had in the world and it had happened that when he first woke to the misery that he had prepared for himself in throwing over lily and betrothing himself to his late wife pratt had been the first person to whom he had communicated his sorrow not that he had ever been really open in his communications it is not given to such men as crosbie to speak openly of themselves to their friends nor indeed was fowler pratt one who was fond of listening to such tales he had no such tales to tell of himself and he thought that men and women should go through the world quietly not subjecting themselves or their acquaintances to anxieties and emotions from peculiar conduct but he was conscientious and courageous also as well as prudent and he had dared to tell crosbie that he was behaving very badly he had spoken his mind plainly and had then given all the assistance in his power  he paused a moment before he replied weighing like a prudent man the force of the words he was about to utter it is much better as it is he said it is much better that you should be as strangers for the future  i do not see that at all said crosbie they were both leaning on the rails and so they remained for the next twenty minutes i do not see that at all  i feel sure of it what could come of any renewed intercourseeven if she would allow it  i might make her my wife  and do you think that you would be happy with her or she with you after what has passed  i do think so  i do not it might be possible that she should bring herself to marry you women delight to forgive injuries they like the excitement of generosity but she could never forget that you had had a former wife or the circumstances under which you were married and as for yourself you would regret it after the first month how could you ever speak to her of your love without speaking also of your shame if a man does marry he should at least be able to hold up his head before his wife  this was very severe but crosbie showed no anger i think i should do so he saidafter a while  and then about money of course you would have to tell her everything  everythingof course  it is like enough that she might not regard thatexcept that she would feel that if you could not afford to marry her when you were unembarrassed you can hardly afford to do so when you are over head and ears in debt  she has money now  after all that has come and gone you would hardly seek lily dale because you want to marry a fortune  you are too hard on me pratt you know that my only reason for seeking her is that i love her  i do not mean to be hard but i have a very strong opinion that the quarrels of lovers when they are of so very serious a nature are a bad basis for the renewal of love come let us go and dress for dinner i am going to dine with mrs thorne the millionaire who married a country doctor and who used to be called miss dunstable  i never dine out anywhere now said crosbie and then they walked out of the park together neither of them of course knew that lily dale was staying at the house at which fowler pratt was going to dine  lily as she rode home did not speak a word she would have given worlds to be able to talk but she could not even make a beginning she heard bernard and siph dunn chatting behind her and hoped that they would continue to do so till she was safe within the house they all used her well for no one tried to draw her into conversation once emily said to her shall we trot a little lily and then they had moved on quickly and the misery was soon over as soon as she was upstairs in the house she got emily by herself and explained all the mystery in a word or two i fear i have made a fool of myself that was the man to whom i was once engaged what mr crosbie said emily who had heard the whole story from bernard yes mr crosbie pray do not say a word of it to anybodynot even to your aunt i am better now but i was such a fool no dear i wont go into the drawingroom ill go upstairs and come down ready for dinner  when she was alone she sat down in her habit and declared to herself that she certainly would never become the wife of mr crosbie i do not know why she should make such a declaration she had promised her mother and john eames that she would not do so and that promise would certainly have bound her without any further resolutions on her own part but to tell the truth the vision of the man had disenchanted her when last she had seen him he had been as it were a god to her and though since that day his conduct to her had been as ungodlike as it well might be still the memory of the outward signs of his divinity had remained with her it is difficult to explain how it had come to pass that the glimpse which she had had of him should have altered so much within her mindwhy she should so suddenly have come to regard him in an altered light it was not simply that he looked to be older and because his face was careworn it was not only that he had lost that look of an apollo which lily had once in her mirth attributed to him i think it was chiefly that she herself was older and could no longer see a god in such a man she had never regarded john eames as being gifted with divinity and had therefore always been making comparisons to his discredit any such comparison now would tend quite the other way nevertheless she would adhere to the two letters in her book since she had seen mr crosbie she was altogether out of love with the prospect of matrimony  she was in the room when mr pratt was announced and she at once recognized him as the man who had been with crosbie and when some minutes afterwards siph dunn came into the room she could see that in their greeting allusion was made to the scene in the park but still it was probable that this man would not recognize her and if he did so what would it matter there were twenty people to sit down to dinner and the chances were that she would not be called upon to exchange a word with mr pratt she had now recovered herself and could speak freely to her friend siph and when siph came and stood near her she thanked him graciously for his escort in the park if it wasnt for you mr dunn i really think i should not get any riding at all bernard and miss dunstable have only one thing to think about and certainly i am not that one thing she thought it probable that if she could keep siph close to her mrs thorne who always managed those things herself might apportion her out to be led to dinner by her goodnatured friend but the fates were averse the time had now come and lily was waiting her turn mr fowler pratt let me introduce you to miss lily dale said mrs thorne lily could perceive that mr pratt was startled the sign he gave was the least possible sign in the world but still it sufficed for lily to perceive it she put her hand upon his arm and walked down with him to the diningroom without giving him the slightest cause to suppose that she knew who he was  i think i saw you in the park riding he said  yes i was there we go nearly every day  i never ride i was walking  it seems to me that the people dont go there to walk but to stand still said lily i cannot understand how so many people can bear to loiter about in that wayleaning on the rails and doing nothing  it is about as good as the riding and costs less money that is all that can be said for it do you live chiefly in town  o dear no i live altogether in the country im only up here because a cousin is going to be married  captain dale you meanto miss dunstable said fowler pratt  when they have been joined together in holy matrimony i shall go down to the country and never i suppose come up to london again  you do not like london  not as a residence i think said lily but of course ones likings and dislikings on such a matter depend on circumstances i live with my mother and all my relatives live near us of course i like the country best because they are there  young ladies so often have a different way of looking at this subject i shouldnt wonder if miss dunstables views about it were altogether of another sort young ladies generally expect to be taken away from their fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts  but you see i expect to be left with mine said lily after that she turned as much away from mr fowler pratt as she could having taken an aversion to him what business had he to talk to her about being taken away from her uncles and aunts she had seen him with mr crosbie and it might be possible that they were intimate friends it might be that mr pratt was asking questions in mr crosbies interest let that be as it might she would answer no more questions from him further than ordinary good breeding should require of her  she is a nice girl certainly said fowler pratt to himself as he walked home and i have no doubt would make a good ordinary everyday wife but she is not such a paragon that a man should condescend to grovel in the dirt for her  that night lily told emily dunstable the whole of mr crosbies history as far as she knew it and also explained her new aversion to mr fowler pratt they are very great friends said emily bernard has told me so and you may be sure that mr pratt knew the whole history before he came here i am so sorry that my aunt asked him  it does not signify in the least said lily even if i were to meet mr crosbie i dont think i should make such a fool of myself again as it is i can only hope he did not see it  i am sure he did not  then there was a pause during which lily sat with her face resting on both her hands it is wonderful how much he is altered she said at last  think how much he has suffered  i suppose i am altered as much only i do not see it in myself  i dont know what you were but i dont think you can have changed much you no doubt have suffered too but not as he has done  oh as for that i have done very well i think ill go to bed now the riding makes me so sleepy     chapter liv  the clerical commission   it was at last arranged that the five clergymen selected should meet at dr tempests house in silverbridge to make inquiry and report to the bishop whether the circumstances connected with the cheque for twenty pounds were of such a nature as to make it incumbent on him to institute proceedings against mr crawley in the court of arches dr tempest had acted upon the letter which he had received from the bishop exactly as though there had been no meeting at the palace no quarrel to the death between him and mrs proudie he was a prudent man gifted with the great power of holding his tongue and had not spoken a word even to his wife of what had occurred after such a victory our old friend the archdeacon would have blown his own trumpet loudly among his friends plumstead would have heard of it instantly and the pæan would have been sung out in the neighbouring parishes of eiderdown stogpingum and st ewolds the highstreet of barchester would have known of it and the very bedesmen in hirams hospital would have told among themselves the terrible discomfiture of the bishop and his lady but dr tempest spoke no word of it to anybody he wrote letters to the two clergymen named by the bishop and himself selected two others out of his own rural deanery and suggested to them all a day at which a preliminary meeting should be held at his own house the two who were invited by him were mr oriel the rector of greshamsbury and mr robarts the vicar of framley they all assented to the proposition and on the day named assembled themselves at silverbridge  it was now april and the judges were to come into barchester before the end of the month what then could be the use of this ecclesiastical inquiry exactly at the same time men and women declared that it was a double prosecution and that a double prosecution for the same offence was a course of action opposed to the feelings and traditions of the country miss anne prettyman went so far as to say that it was unconstitutional and mary walker declared that no human being except mrs proudie would ever have been guilty of such cruelty dont tell me about the bishop john she said the bishop is a cypher you may be sure dr tempest would not have a hand in it if it were not right said john walker my dear mr john said miss anne prettyman dr tempest is as hard as a bar of iron and always was but i am surprised that mr robarts should take a part in it  in the meantime at the palace mrs proudie had been reduced to learn what was going on from mr thumble the bishop had never spoken a word to her respecting mr crawley since that terrible day on which dr tempest had witnessed his imbecilityhaving absolutely declined to answer when his wife had mentioned the subject you wont speak to me about it my dear she had said to him when he had thus declined remonstrating more in sorrow than in anger no i wont the bishop had replied there has been a great deal too much talking about it it has broken my heart already i know these were very bad days in the palace mrs proudie affected to be satisfied with what was being done she talked to mr thumble about mr crawley and the cheque as though everything were arranged quite to her satisfactionas though everything indeed had been arranged by herself but everybody about the house could see that the manner of the woman was altogether altered she was milder than usual with the servants and was almost too gentle in her usage of her husband it seemed as though something had happened to frighten her and break her spirit and it was whispered about through the palace that she was afraid that the bishop was dying as for him he hardly left his own sittingroom in these days except when he joined the family at breakfast and at dinner and in his study he did little or nothing he would smile when his chaplain went to him and give some trifling verbal directions but for days he scarcely ever took a pen in his hands and though he took up many books he read hardly a page how often he told his wife in those days that he was brokenhearted no one but his wife ever knew  what has happened that you should speak like that she said to him once what has broken your heart  you he replied you you have done it  oh tom she said going back into the memory of very far distant days in her nomenclature how can you speak to me so cruelly as that that it should come to that between you and me after all  why did you not go away and leave me that day when i told you  did you ever know a woman who liked to be turned out of a room in her own house said mrs proudie when mrs proudie had condescended so far as this it must be admitted that in those days there was great trouble in the palace  mr thumble on the day before he went to silverbridge asked for an audience with the bishop in order that he might receive instructions he had been strictly desired to do this by mrs proudie and had not dared to disobey her injunctionsthinking however himself that his doing so was inexpedient i have got nothing to say to you about it not a word said the bishop crossly i thought that perhaps you might like to see me before i started pleaded mr thumble very humbly i dont want to see you at all said the bishop you are going there to exercise your own judgmentif you have got any and you ought not to come to me after that mr thumble began to think that mrs proudie was right and that the bishop was near his dissolution  mr thumble and mr quiverful went over to silverbridge together in a gig hired from the dragon of wantlyas to the cost of which there arose among them a not unnatural apprehension which amounted at last almost to dismay i dont mind it so much for once said mr quiverful but if many such meetings are necessary i for one cant afford it and i wont do it a man with my family cant allow himself to be money out of pocket in that way it is hard said mr thumble she ought to pay it herself out of her own pocket said mr quiverful he had had concerns with the palace when mrs proudie was in the full swing of her dominion and had not as yet begun to suspect that there might possibly be a change  mr oriel and mr robarts were already sitting with dr tempest when the other two clergymen were shown into the room when the first greetings were over luncheon was announced and while they were eating not a word was said about mr crawley the ladies of the family were not present and the five clergymen sat round the table alone it would have been difficult to have got together five gentlemen less likely to act with one mind and one spiritand perhaps it was all the better for mr crawley that it should be so dr tempest himself was a man peculiarly capable of exercising the functions of a judge in such a matter had he sat alone as a judge but he was one who would be almost sure to differ from others who sat as equal assessors with him mr oriel was a gentleman at all points but he was very shy very reticent and altogether uninstructed in the ordinary daily intercourse of man with man any one knowing him might have predicted of him that he would be sure on such an occasion as this to be found floundering in a sea of doubts mr quiverful was the father of a large family whose whole life had been devoted to fighting a cruel world on behalf of his wife and children that fight he had fought bravely but it had left him no energy for any other business mr thumble was a poor creatureso poor a creature that in spite of a small restless ambition to be doing something he was almost cowed by the hard lines of dr tempests brow the rev mark robarts was a man of the world and a clever fellow and did not stand in awe of anybodyunless it might be in a very moderate degree of his patrons the luftons whom he was bound to respect but his cleverness was not the cleverness needed by a judge he was essentially a partisan and would be sure to vote against the bishop in such a matter as this now before him there was a palace faction in the diocese and an antipalace faction mr thumble and mr quiverful belonged to one and mr oriel and mr robarts to the other mr thumble was too weak to stick to his faction against the strength of such a man as dr tempest mr quiverful would be too indifferent to do sounless his interest were concerned mr oriel would be too conscientious to regard his own side on such an occasion as this but mark robarts would be sure to support his friends and oppose his enemies let the case be what it might now gentlemen if you please we will go into the other room said dr tempest they went into the other room and there they found five chairs arranged for them round the table not a word had as yet been said about mr crawley and no one of the four strangers knew whether mr crawley was to appear before them on that day or not  gentlemen said dr tempest seating himself at once in an armchair placed at the middle of the table i think it will be well to explain to you at first what as i regard the matter is the extent of the work which we are called upon to perform it is of its nature very disagreeable it cannot but be so let it be ever so limited here is a brother clergyman and a gentleman living among us and doing his duty as we are told in a most exemplary manner and suddenly we hear that he is accused of a theft the matter is brought before the magistrates of whom i myself was one and he was committed for trial there is therefore primâ facie evidence of his guilt but i do not think that we need go into the question of his guilt at all when he said this the other four all looked up at him in astonishment i thought that we had been summoned here for that purpose said mr robarts not at all as i take it said the doctor were we to commence any such inquiry the jury would have given their verdict before we could come to any conclusion and it would be impossible for us to oppose that verdict whether it declares this unfortunate gentleman to be innocent or to be guilty if the jury shall say that he is innocent there is an end of the matter altogether he would go back to his parish amidst the sympathy and congratulations of his friends that is what we should all wish  of course it is said mr robarts they all declared that was their desire as a matter of course and mr thumble said it louder than any one else  but if he be found guilty then will come that difficulty to the bishop in which we are bound to give him any assistance within our power  of course we are said mr thumble who having heard his own voice once and having liked the sound thought that he might creep into a little importance by using it on any occasion that opened itself for him  if you will allow me sir i will venture to state my views as shortly as i can said dr tempest that may perhaps be the most expeditious course for us all in the end  oh certainly said mr thumble i didnt mean to interrupt  in the case of his being found guilty continued the doctor there will arise the question whether the punishment awarded to him by the judge should suffice for ecclesiastical purposes suppose for instance that he should be imprisoned for two months should he be allowed to return to his living at the expiration of that term  i think he ought said mr robartsconsidering all things  i dont see why he shouldnt said mr quiverful  mr oriel sat listening patiently and mr thumble looked up to the doctor expecting to hear some opinion expressed by him with which he might coincide  there certainly are reasons why he should not said dr tempest though i by no means say that those reasons are conclusive in the present case in the first place a man who has stolen money can hardly be a fitting person to teach others not to steal  you must look to the circumstances said robarts  yes that is true but just bear with me a moment it cannot at any rate be thought that a clergyman should come out of prison and go to his living without any notice from his bishop simply because he has already been punished under the common law if this were so a clergyman might be fined ten days running for being drunk in the streetfive shillings each timeand at the end of that time might set his bishop at defiance when a clergyman has shown himself to be utterly unfit for clerical duties he must not be held to be protected from ecclesiastical censure or from deprivation by the action of the common law  but mr crawley has not shown himself to be unfit said robarts  that is begging the question robarts said the doctor  just so said mr thumble then mr robarts gave a look at mr thumble and mr thumble retired into his shoes  that is the question as to which we are called upon to advise the bishop continued dr tempest and i must say that i think the bishop is right if he were to allow the matter to pass by without noticethat is to say in the event of mr crawley being pronounced to be guilty by a juryhe would i think neglect his duty now i have been informed that the bishop has recommended mr crawley to desist from his duties till the trial be over and that mr crawley has declined to take the bishops advice  that is true said mr thumble he altogether disregarded the bishop  i cannot say that i think he was wrong said dr tempest  i think he was quite right said mr robarts  a bishop in almost all cases is entitled to the obedience of his clergy said mr oriel  i must say that i agree with you sir said mr thumble  the income is not large and i suppose that it would have gone with the duties said mr quiverful it is very hard for a man with a family to live when his income has been stopped  be that as it may continued the doctor the bishop feels that it may be his duty to oppose the return of mr crawley to his pulpit and that he can oppose it in no other way than by proceeding against mr crawley under the clerical offences act i propose therefore that we should invite mr crawley to attend here  mr crawley is not coming here today then said mr robarts  i thought it useless to ask for his attendance until we had settled on our course of action said dr tempest if we are all agreed i will beg him to come here on this day week when we will meet again and we will then ask him whether he will submit himself to the bishops decision in the event of the jury finding him guilty if he should decline to do so we can only then form our opinion as to what will be the bishops duty by reference to the facts as they are elicited at the trial if mr crawley should choose to make to us any statement as to his own case of course we shall be willing to receive it that is my idea of what had better be done and now if any gentleman has any other proposition to make of course we shall be pleased to hear him dr tempest as he said this looked round upon his companions as though his pleasure under the circumstances suggested by himself would be very doubtful  i dont suppose we can do anything better said mr robarts i think it a pity however that any steps should have been taken by the bishop before the trial  the bishop has been placed in a very delicate position said mr thumble pleading for his patron  i dont know the meaning of the word delicate said robarts i think his duty was very clear to avoid interference whilst the matter is so to say before the judge  nobody has anything else to propose said dr tempest then i will write to mr crawley and you gentlemen will perhaps do me the honour of meeting me here at one oclock on this day week then the meeting was over and the four clergymen having shaken hands with dr tempest in the hall all promised that they would return on that day week so far dr tempest had carried his point exactly as he might have done had the four gentlemen been represented by the chairs on which they had sat  i shant come again all the same unless i know where im to get my expenses said mr quiverful as he got into the gig  i shall come said mr thumble because i think it a duty of course it is a hardship mr thumble liked the idea of being joined with such men as dr tempest and mr oriel and mr robarts and would any day have paid the expense of a gig from barchester to silverbridge out of his own pocket for the sake of sitting with such benchfellows on any clerical inquiry  ones first duty is to ones own wife and family said mr quiverful  well yes in a way of course that is quite true mr quiverful and when we know how very inadequate are the incomes of the working clergy we cannot but feel ourselves to be if i may so say put upon when we have to defray the expenses incidental to special duties out of our own pockets i think you knowi dont mind saying this to youthat the palace should have provided us with a chaise and pair this was ungrateful on the part of mr thumble who had been permitted to ride miles upon miles to various outlying clerical duties upon the bishops wornout cob you see continued mr thumble you and i go specially to represent the palace and the palace ought to remember that i think there ought to have been a chaise and pair i do indeed  i dont care much what the conveyance is said mr quiverful but i certainly shall pay nothing more out of my own pocketcertainly i shall not  the result will be that the palace will be thrown over if they dont take care said mr thumble tempest however seems to be pretty steady tempest i think is steady you see he is getting tired of parish work and would like to go into the close thats what he is looking out for did you ever see such a fellow as that robartsjust look at himquite indecent wasnt he he thinks he can have his own way in everything just because his sister married a lord i do hate to see all that meanness  mark robarts and caleb oriel left silverbridge in another gig by the same road and soon passed their brethren as mr robarts was in the habit of driving a large quickstepping horse the last remarks were being made as the dust from the vicar of framleys wheels saluted the faces of the two slower clergymen mr oriel had promised to dine and sleep at framley and therefore returned in mr robarts gig  quite unnecessary all this fuss dont you think so said mr robarts  i am not quite sure said mr oriel i can understand that the bishop may have found a difficulty  the bishop indeed the bishop doesnt care two straws about it its mrs proudie she has put her finger on the poor mans neck because he has not put his neck beneath her feet and now she thinks she can crush himas she would crush you or me if it were in her power thats about the long and the short of the bishops solicitude  you are very hard on him said mr oriel  i know himand am not at all hard on him she is hard upon him if you like tempest is fair he is very fair and as long as no one meddles with him he wont do amiss i cant hold my tongue always but i often know that it is better that i should  dr tempest said not a word to any one on the subject not even in his own defence and yet he was sorely tempted on the very day of the meeting he dined at mr walkers in silverbridge and there submitted to be talked at by all the ladies and most of the gentlemen present without saying a word in his own defence and yet a word or two would have been so easy and so conclusive  oh dr tempest said mary walker i am so sorry that you have joined the bishop  are you my dear said he it is generally thought well that a parish clergyman should agree with his bishop  but you know dr tempest that you dont agree with your bishop generally  then it is the more fortunate that i shall be able to agree with him on this occasion  major grantly was present at the dinner and ventured to ask the doctor in the course of the evening what he thought would be done i should not venture to ask such a question dr tempest he said unless i had the strongest possible reason to justify my anxiety  i dont know that i can tell you anything major grantly said the doctor we did not even see mr crawley today but the real truth is that he must stand or fall as the jury shall find him guilty or not guilty it would be the same in any profession could a captain in the army hold up his head in his regiment after he had been tried and found guilty of stealing twenty pounds  i dont think he could said the major  neither can a clergyman said the doctor the bishop can neither make him nor mar him it is the jury that must do it     chapter lv  framley parsonage   at this time grace crawley was at framley parsonage old lady luftons strategy had been quite intelligible but some people said that in point of etiquette and judgment and moral conduct it was indefensible her vicar mr robarts had been selected to be one of the clergymen who was to sit in ecclesiastical judgment upon mr crawley and while he was so sitting mr crawleys daughter was staying in mr robarts house as a visitor with his wife it might be that there was no harm in this lady lufton when the apparent impropriety was pointed out to her by no less a person than archdeacon grantly ridiculed the idea my dear archdeacon lady lufton had said we all know the bishop to be such a fool and the bishops wife to be such a knave that we cannot allow ourselves to be governed in this matter by ordinary rules do you not think that it is expedient to show how utterly we disregard his judgment and her malice the archdeacon had hesitated much before he spoke to lady lufton whether he should address himself to her or to mr robartsor indeed to mrs robarts but he had become aware that the proposition as to the visit had originated with lady lufton and he had therefore decided on speaking to her he had not condescended to say a word as to his son nor would he so condescend nor could he go from lady lufton to mr robarts having once failed with her ladyship indeed in giving him his due we must acknowledge that his disapprobation of lady luftons strategy arose rather from his true conviction as to its impropriety than from any fear lest this attention paid to miss crawley should tend to bring about her marriage with his son by this time he hated the very name of crawley he hated it the more because in hating it he had to put himself for the time on the same side with mrs proudie but for all that he would not condescend to any unworthy mode of fighting he thought it wrong that the young lady should be invited to framley parsonage at this moment and he said so to the person who had as he thought in truth given the invitation but he would not allow his own personal motives to induce him to carry on the argument with lady lufton the bishop is a fool he said and the bishops wife is a knave nevertheless i would not have had the young lady over to framley at this moment if however you think it right and robarts thinks it right there is an end of it  upon my word we do said lady lufton  i am induced to think that mr robarts was not quite confident of the expediency of what he was doing by the way in which he mentioned to mr oriel the fact of miss crawleys presence at the parsonage as he drove that gentleman home in his gig they had been talking about mr crawley when he suddenly turned himself round so that he could look at his companion and said miss crawley is staying with us at the parsonage at the present moment  what mr crawleys daughter said mr oriel showing plainly by his voice that the tidings had much surprised him  yes mr crawleys daughter  oh indeed i did not know that you were on those terms with the family  we have known them for the last seven or eight years said mark and though i should be giving you a false notion if i were to say that i myself have known them intimatelyfor crawley is a man whom it is quite impossible to know intimatelyyet the womankind at framley have known them my sister stayed with them over at hogglestock for some time  what lady lufton  yes my sister lucy it was just before her marriage there was a lot of trouble and the crawleys were all ill and she went to nurse them and then the old lady took them up and altogether there came to be a sort of feeling that they were to be regarded as friends they are always in trouble and now in this special trouble the women between them have thought it best to have the girl over at framley of course i had a kind of feeling about this commission but as i knew that it would make no difference with me i did not think it necessary to put my veto upon the visit mr oriel said nothing further but mark robarts was aware that mr oriel did not quite approve of the visit  that morning old lady lufton herself had come across to the parsonage with the express view of bidding all the parsonage party to come across to the hall to dine you can tell mr oriel fanny with lucys compliments how delighted she will be to see him old lady lufton always spoke of her daughterinlaw as the mistress of the house if you think he is particular you know we will send a note across mrs robarts said that she supposed mr oriel would not be particular but looking at grace made some faint excuse you must come my dear said lady lufton lucy wishes it particularly mrs robarts did not know how to say that she would not come and so the matter stoodwhen mrs robarts was called upon to leave the room for a moment and lady lufton and grace were left alone  dear lady lufton said grace getting up suddenly from her chair will you do me a favoura great favour she spoke with an energy which quite surprised the old lady and caused her almost to start from her seat  i dont like making promises said lady lufton but anything i can do with propriety i will  you can do this pray let me stay here today you dont understand how i feel about going out while papa is in this way i know how kind and how good you all are and when dear mrs robarts asked me here and mamma said that i had better come i could not refuse but indeed indeed i had rather not go out to a dinnerparty  it is not a party my dear girl said lady lufton with the kindest voice which she knew how to assume and you must remember that my daughterinlaw regards you as so very old a friend you remember of course when she was staying over at hogglestock  indeed i do i remember it well  and therefore you should not regard it as going out there will be nobody there but ourselves and the people from this house  but it will be going out lady lufton and i do hope you will let me stay here you cannot think how i feel it of course i cannot go without something like dressing andandand in poor papas state i feel that i ought not to do anything that looks like gaiety i ought never to forget itnot for a moment  there was a tear in lady luftons eye as she saidmy dear you shant come you and fanny shall stop and dine here by yourselves the gentlemen shall come  do let mrs robarts go please said grace  i wont do anything of the kind said lady lufton then when mrs robarts returned to the room her ladyship explained it all in two words whilst you have been away my dear grace has begged off and therefore we have decided that mr oriel and mr robarts shall come without you  i am so sorry mrs robarts said grace  pooh pooh said lady lufton fanny and i have known each other quite long enough not to stand on any complimentshavent we my dear i must get home now as all the morning has gone by fanny my dear i want to speak to you then she expressed her opinion of grace crawley as she walked across the parsonage garden with mrs robarts she is a very nice girl and a very good girl i am sure and she shows excellent feeling whatever happens we must take care of her and fanny have you observed how handsome she is  we think her very pretty  she is more than pretty when she has a little fire in her eyes she is downright handsomeor will be when she fills out a little i tell you what my dear shell make havoc with somebody yet you see if she doesnt byby tell the two gentlemen to be up by seven punctually and then lady lufton went home  grace so contrived that mr oriel came and went without seeing her there was a separate nursery breakfast at the parsonage and by special permission grace was allowed to have her tea and breadandbutter on the next morning with the children i thought you told me miss crawley was here said mr oriel as the two clergymen stood waiting for the gig that was to take the visitor away to barchester  so she is said robarts but she likes to hide herself because of her fathers trouble you cant blame her  no indeed said mr oriel  poor girl if you knew her you would not only pity her but like her  is shewhat you call  you mean is she a lady  of course she is by birth and all that said mr oriel apologizing for his inquiry  i dont think there is another girl in the county so well educated said mr robarts  indeed i had no idea of that  and we think her a great beauty as for manners i never saw a girl with a prettier way of her own  dear me said mr oriel i wish she had come down to breakfast  it will have been perceived that old lady lufton had heard nothing of major grantlys offence that she had no knowledge that grace had already made havoc as she had called ithad in truth made very sad havoc at plumstead she did not therefore think much about it when her son told her upon her return home from the parsonage on that afternoon that major grantly had come over from cosby lodge and that he was going to dine and sleep at framley court some slight idea of thankfulness came across her mind that she had not betrayed grace crawley into a meeting with a stranger i asked him to come some day before we went up to town said his lordship and i am glad he has come today as two clergymen to ones self are at any rate one too many so major grantly dined and slept at the court  but mrs robarts was in a great flurry when she was told of this by her husband on his return from the dinner mrs crawley had found an opportunity of telling the story of major grantlys love to mrs robarts before she had sent her daughter to framley knowing that the families were intimate and thinking it right that there should be some precaution  i wonder whether he will come up here mrs robarts had said  probably not said the vicar he said he was going home early  i hope he will not comefor graces sake said mrs robarts she hesitated whether she should tell her husband she always did tell him everything but on this occasion she thought she had no right to do so and she kept the secret dont do anything to bring him up dear  you neednt be afraid he wont come said the vicar on the following morning as soon as mr oriel was gone mr robarts went outabout his parish he would probably have called it but in half an hour he might have been seen strolling about the court stableyard with lord lufton where is grantly asked the vicar i dont know where he is said his lordship he has sloped off somewhere the major had sloped off to the parsonage well knowing in what nest his dove was lying hid and he and the vicar had passed each other the major had gone out at the front gate and the vicar had gone in at the stable entrance  the two clergymen had hardly taken their departure when major grantly knocked at the parsonage door he had come so early that mrs robarts had taken no precautionseven had there been any precautions which she would have thought it right to take grace was in the act of coming down the stairs not having heard the knock at the door and thus she found her lover in the hall he had asked of course for mrs robarts and thus they two entered the drawingroom together they had not had time to speak when the servant opened the drawingroom door to announce the visitor there had been no word spoken between mrs robarts and grace about major grantly but the mother had told the daughter of what she had said to mrs robarts  grace said the major i am so glad to find you then he turned to mrs robarts with his open hand you wont take it uncivil of me if i say that my visit is not entirely to yourself i think i may take upon myself to say that i and miss crawley are old friends may i not  grace could not answer a word mrs crawley told me that you had known her at silverbridge said mrs robarts driven to say something but feeling that she was blundering  i came over to framley yesterday because i heard that she was here am i wrong to come up here to see her  i think she must answer that for herself major grantly  am i wrong grace grace thought that he was the finest gentleman and the noblest lover that had ever shown his devotion to a woman and was stirred by a mighty resolve that if it ever should be in her power to reward him after any fashion she would pour out the reward with a very full hand indeed but what was she to say on the present moment am i wrong grace he said repeating his question with so much emphasis that she was positively driven to answer it  i do not think you are wrong at all how can i say you are wrong when you are so good if i could be your servant i would serve you but i can be nothing to you because of papas disgrace dear mrs robarts i cannot stay you must answer him for me and having thus made her speech she escaped from the room  illustration because of papas disgrace  it may suffice to say further now that the major did not see grace again during that visit at framley     chapter lvi  the archdeacon goes to framley   illustration  by some of those unseen telegraphic wires which carry news about the country and make no charge for the conveyance archdeacon grantly heard that his son the major was at framley now in that itself there would have been nothing singular there had been for years much intimacy between the lufton family and the grantly familyso much that an alliance between the two houses had once been planned the elders having considered it expedient that the young lord should marry that griselda who had since mounted higher in the world even than the elders had then projected for her there had come no such alliance but the intimacy had not ceased and there was nothing in itself surprising in the fact that major grantly should be staying at framley court but the archdeacon when he heard the news bethought him at once of grace crawley could it be possible that his old friend lady luftonlady lufton whom he had known and trusted all his life whom he had ever regarded as a pillar of the church in barsetshireshould now be untrue to him in a matter so closely affecting his interests men when they are worried by fears and teased by adverse circumstances become suspicious of those on whom suspicion should never rest it was hardly possible the archdeacon thought that lady lufton should treat him so unworthilybut the circumstances were strong against his friend lady lufton had induced miss crawley to go to framley much against his advice at a time when such a visit seemed to him to be very improper and it now appeared that his son was to be there at the same timea fact of which lady lufton had made no mention to him whatever why had not lady lufton told him that henry grantly was coming to framley court the reader whose interest in the matter will be less keen than was the archdeacons will know very well why lady lufton had said nothing about the majors visit the reader will remember that lady lufton when she saw the archdeacon was as ignorant as to the intended visit as was the archdeacon himself but the archdeacon was uneasy troubled and suspiciousand he suspected his old friend unworthily  he spoke to his wife about it within a very few hours of the arrival of the tidings by those invisible wires he had already told her that miss crawley was to go to framley parsonage and that he thought that mrs robarts was wrong to receive her at such a time it is only intended for goodnature mrs grantly had said it is misplaced goodnature at the present moment the archdeacon had replied mrs grantly had not thought it worth her while to undertake at the moment any strong defence of the framley people she knew well how odious was the name of crawley in her husbands ears and she felt that the less that was said at present about the crawleys the better for the peace of the rectory at plumstead she had therefore allowed the expression of his disapproval to pass unchallenged but now he came upon her with a more bitter grievance and she was obliged to argue the matter with him  what do you think said he henry is at framley  he can hardly be staying there said mrs grantly because i know that he is so very busy at home the business at home of which the majors mother was speaking was his projected moving from cosby lodge a subject which was also very odious to the archdeacon he did not wish his son to move from cosby lodge he could not endure the idea that his son should be known throughout the county to be giving up a residence because he could not afford to keep it the archdeacon could have afforded to keep up two cosby lodges for his son and would have been well pleased to do so if only his son would not misbehave against him so shamefully he could not bear that his son should be punished openly before the eyes of all barsetshire indeed he did not wish that his son should be punished at all he simply desired that his son should recognize his fathers power to inflict punishment it would be henbane to archdeacon grantly to have a poor sona son living at pauamong frenchmenbecause he could not afford to live in england why had the archdeacon been careful of his money adding house to house and field to field he himself was contentedso he told himselfto die as he had lived in a country parsonage working with the collar round his neck up to the day of his death if god would allow him so to do he was ambitious of no grandeur for himself so he would tell himselfbeing partly oblivious of certain episodes in his own life all his wealth had been got together for his children he desired that his sons should be fitting brothers for their august sister and now the son who was nearest to him whom he was bent upon making a squire in his own county wanted to marry the daughter of a man who had stolen twenty pounds and when objection was made to so discreditable a connexion replied by packing up all his things and saying that he would go and liveat pau the archdeacon therefore did not like to hear of his son being very busy at home  i dont know whether hes busy or not said the archdeacon but i tell you he is staying at framley  from whom have you heard it  what matter does that make if it is so i heard it from flurry  flurry may have been mistaken said mrs grantly  it is not at all likely those people always know about such things he heard it from the framley keeper i dont doubt but its true and i think that its a great shame  a great shame that henry should be at framley he has been there two or three times every year since he has lived in the county  it is a great shame that he should be had over there just at the time when that girl is there also it is impossible to believe that such a thing is an accident  but archdeacon you do not mean to say that you think that lady lufton has arranged it  i dont know who has arranged it somebody has arranged it if it is robarts that is almost worse one could forgive a woman in such a matter better than one could a man  psha mrs grantlys temper was never bitter but at this moment it was not sweetened by her husbands very uncivil reference to her sex the whole idea is nonsense and you should get it out of your head  am i to get it out of my head that henry wants to make this girl his wife and that the two are at this moment at framley together in this the archdeacon was wrong as to his facts major grantly had left framley on the previous day having stayed there only one night it is coming to that that one can trust no oneno oneliterally no one mrs grantly perfectly understood that the archdeacon in the agony of the moment intended to exclude even herself from his confidence by that no one but to this she was indifferent understanding accurately when his words should be accepted as expressing his thoughts and when they should be supposed to express only his anger  the probability is that no one at lufton knew anything about henrys partiality for miss crawley said mrs grantly  i tell you i think they are both at framley together  and i tell you that if they are which i doubt they are there simply by an accident besides what does it matter if they choose to marry each other you and i cannot prevent them they dont want any assistance from lady lufton or anybody else they have simply got to make up their own minds and then no one can hinder them  and therefore you would like to see them brought together  i say nothing about that archdeacon but i do say that we must take these things as they come what can we do henry may go and stay with lady lufton if he pleases you and i cannot prevent him  after this the archdeacon walked away and would not argue the matter any further with his wife at that moment he knew very well that he could not get the better of her and was apt at such moments to think that she took an unfair advantage of him by keeping her temper but he could not get out of his head the idea that perhaps on this very day things were being arranged between his son and grace crawley at framley and he resolved that he himself would go over and see what might be done he would at any rate tell all his trouble to lady lufton and beg his old friend to assist him he could not think that such a one as he had always known lady lufton to be would approve of a marriage between henry grantly and grace crawley at any rate he would learn the truth he had once been told that grace crawley had herself refused to marry his son feeling that she would do wrong to inflict so great an injury upon any gentleman he had not believed in so great a virtue he could not believe in it nownow when he heard that miss crawley and his son were staying together in the same parish somebody must be doing him an injury it could hardly be chance but his presence at framley might even yet have a good effect and he would at least learn the truth so he had himself driven to barchester and from barchester he took posthorses to framley  as he came near to the village he grew to be somewhat ashamed of himself or at least nervous as to the mode in which he would proceed the driver turning round to him had suggested that he supposed he was to drive to my ladys this injustice to lord lufton to whom the house belonged and with whom his mother lived as a guest was very common in the county for old lady lufton had lived at framley court through her sons long minority and had kept the house there till his marriage and even since his marriage she had been recognized as its presiding genius it certainly was not the fault of old lady lufton as she always spoke of everything as belonging either to her son or to her daughterinlaw the archdeacon had been in doubt whether he would go to the court or to the parsonage could he have done exactly as he wished he would have left the chaise and walked to the parsonage so as to reach it without the noise and fuss incidental to a postilions arrival but that was impossible he could not drop into framley as though he had come from the clouds and therefore he told the man to do as he had suggested to my ladys said the postilion the archdeacon assented and the man with loud cracks of his whip and with a spasmodic gallop along the short avenue took the archdeacon up to the door of lord luftons house he asked for lord lufton first putting on his pleasantest smile so that the servant should not suspect the purpose of which he was somewhat ashamed was lord lufton at home lord lufton was not at home lord lufton had gone up to london that morning intending to return the day after tomorrow but both my ladies were at home so the archdeacon was shown into the room where both my ladies were sittingand with them he found mrs robarts any one who had become acquainted with the habits of the framley ladies would have known that this might very probably be the case the archdeacon himself was as well aware as any one of the modes of life at framley the lords wife was the parsons sister and the parsons wife had from her infancy been the petted friend of the old lady of course they all lived very much together of course mrs robarts was as much at home in the drawingroom of framley court as she was in her own drawingroom at the parsonage nevertheless the archdeacon thought himself to be hardly used when he found that mrs robarts was at the house  my dear archdeacon who ever expected to see you said old lady lufton then the two younger women greeted him and they all smiled on him pleasantly and seemed overjoyed to see him he was in truth a great favourite at framley and each of the three was glad to welcome him they believed in the archdeacon at framley and felt for him that sort of love which ladies in the country do feel for their elderly male friends there was not one of the three who would not have taken much trouble to get anything for the archdeacon which they had thought the archdeacon would like even old lady lufton remembered what was his favourite soup and always took care that he should have it when he dined at the court young lady lufton would bring his tea to him as he sat in his chair he was petted in the house was allowed to poke the fire if he pleased and called the servants by their names as though he were at home he was compelled therefore to smile and to seem pleased and it was not till after he had eaten his lunch and had declared that he must return home to dinner that the dowager gave him an opportunity of having the private conversation which he desired  can i have a few minutes talk with you he said to her whispering into her ear as they left the drawingroom together so she led the way into her own sittingroom telling him as she asked him to be seated that she had supposed that something special must have brought him over to framley i should have asked you to come up here even if you had not spoken she said  then perhaps you know what has brought me over said the archdeacon  not in the least said lady lufton i have not an idea but i did not flatter myself that you would come so far on a morning call merely to see us three ladies i hope you did not want to see ludovic because he will not be back till tomorrow  i wanted to see you lady lufton  that is lucky as here i am you may be pretty sure to find me here any day in the year  after this there was a little pause the archdeacon hardly knew how to begin his story in the first place he was in doubt whether lady lufton had ever heard of the preposterous match which his son had proposed to himself to make in his anger at plumstead he had felt sure that she knew all about it and that she was assisting his son but this belief had dwindled as his anger had dwindled and as the chaise had entered the parish of framley he had told himself that it was quite impossible that she should know anything about it her manner had certainly been altogether in her favour since he had been in her house there had been nothing of the consciousness of guilt in her demeanour but nevertheless there was the coincidence how had it come to pass that grace crawley and his son should be at framley together it might indeed be just possible that flurry might have been wrong and that his son had not been there at all  i suppose miss crawley is at the parsonage he said at last  oh yes she is still there and will remain there i should think for the next ten days  oh i did not know said the archdeacon very coldly  it seemed to lady lufton who was as innocent as an unborn babe in the matter of the projected marriage that her old friend the archdeacon was in a mind to persecute the crawleys he had on a former occasion taken upon himself to advise that grace crawley should not be entertained at framley and now it seemed that he had come all the way from plumstead to say something further in the same strain lady lufton if he had anything further to say of that kind would listen to him as a matter of course she would listen to him and reply to him without temper but she did not approve of it she told herself silently that she could not approve of persecution or of interference she therefore drew herself up and pursed her mouth and put on something of that look of severity which she could assume very visibly if it so pleased her  yes she is still there and i think that her visit will do her a great deal of good said lady lufton  when we talk of doing good to people said the archdeacon we often make terrible mistakes it so often happens that we dont know when we are doing good and when we are doing harm  that is true of course dr grantly and must be so necessarily as our wisdom here below is so very limited but i should thinkas far as i can see that isthat the kindness which my friend mrs robarts is showing to this young lady must be beneficial you know archdeacon i explained to you before that i could not quite agree with you in what you said as to leaving these people alone till after the trial i thought that help was necessary to them at once  the archdeacon sighed deeply he ought to have been somewhat renovated in spirit by the tone in which lady lufton spoke to him as it conveyed to him almost an absolute conviction that his first suspicion was incorrect but any comfort which might have come to him from this source was marred by the feeling that he must announce his own disgrace at any rate he must do so unless he were contented to go back to plumstead without having learned anything by his journey he changed the tone of his voice however and asked a questionas it might be altogether on a different subject i heard yesterday he said that henry was over here  he was here yesterday he came the evening before and dined and slept here and went home yesterday morning  was miss crawley with you that evening  miss crawley no she would not come she thinks it best not to go out while her father is in his present unfortunate position and she is right  she is quite right in that said the archdeacon and then he paused again he thought that it would be best for him to make a clean breast of it and to trust to lady luftons sympathy did henry go up to the parsonage he asked  but still lady lufton did not suspect the truth i think he did she replied with an air of surprise i think i heard that he went up there to call on mrs robarts after breakfast  no lady lufton he did not go up there to call on mrs robarts he went up there because he is making a fool of himself about that miss crawley that is the truth now you understand it all i hope that mrs robarts does not know it i do hope for her own sake that mrs robarts does not know it  the archdeacon certainly had no longer any doubt as to lady luftons innocence when he looked at her face as she heard these tidings she had predicted that grace crawley would make havoc and could not therefore be altogether surprised at the idea that some gentleman should have fallen in love with her but she had never supposed that the havoc might be made so early in her days or on so great a quarry you dont mean to tell me that henry grantly is in love with grace crawley she replied  i mean to say that he says he is  dear dear dear im sure archdeacon that you will believe me when i say that i knew nothing about it  i am quite sure of that said the archdeacon dolefully  or i certainly should not have been glad to see him here but the house you know is not mine dr grantly i could have done nothing if i had known it but only to think well to be sure she has not lost time at any rate  now this was not at all the light in which the archdeacon wished that the matter should be regarded he had been desirous that lady lufton should be horrorstricken by the tidings but it seemed to him that she regarded the iniquity almost as a good joke what did it matter how young or how old the girl might be she came of poor peopleof people who had no friendsof disgraced people and lady lufton ought to feel that such a marriage would be a terrible misfortune and a terrible crime i need hardly tell you lady lufton said the archdeacon that i shall set my face against it as far as it is in my power to do so  if they both be resolved i suppose you can hardly prevent it  of course i cannot prevent it of course i cannot prevent it if he will break my heart and his mothersand his sistersof course i cannot prevent it if he will ruin himself he must have his own way  ruin himself dr grantly  they will have enough to live uponsomewhere in spain or france the scorn expressed in the archdeacons voice as he spoke of pau as being somewhere in spain or france should have been heard to be understood no doubt they will have enough to live upon  do you mean to say that it will make a difference as to your own property dr grantly  certainly it will lady lufton i told henry when i first heard of the thingbefore he had definitely made any offer to the girlthat i should withdraw from him altogether the allowance that i now make him if he married her and i told him also that if he persisted in his folly i should think it my duty to alter my will  i am sorry for that dr grantly  sorry and am not i sorry sorrow is no sufficient word i am brokenhearted lady lufton it is killing me it is indeed i love him i love himi love him as you have loved your son but what is the use what can he be to me when he shall have married the daughter of such a man as that  lady lufton sat for a while silent thinking of a certain episode in her own life there had been a time when her son was desirous of making a marriage which she had thought would break her heart she had for a time moved heaven and earthas far as she knew how to move themto prevent the marriage but at last she had yieldednot from lack of power for the circumstances had been such that at the moment of yielding she had still the power in her hand of staying the marriagebut she had yielded because she had perceived that her son was in earnest she had yielded and had kissed the dust but from the moment in which her lips had so touched the ground she had taken great joy in the new daughter whom her son had brought into the house since that she had learned to think that young people might perhaps be right and that old people might perhaps be wrong this trouble of her friend the archdeacons was very like her own old trouble and he is engaged to her now she said when those thoughts had passed through her mind  yesthat is no i am not sure i do not know how to make myself sure  i am sure major grantly will tell you all the truth as it exists  yes hell tell me the truthas far as he knows it i do not see that there is much anxiety to spare me in the matter he is desirous rather of making me understand that i have no power of saving him from his own folly of course i have no power of saving him  but is he engaged to her  he says that she has refused him but of course that means nothing  again the archdeacons position was very like lady luftons position as it had existed before her sons marriage in that case also the young lady who was now lady luftons own daughter and dearest friend had refused the lover who proposed to her although the marriage was so much to her advantageloving him too the while with her whole heart as it was natural to suppose that grace crawley might so love her lover the more she thought of the similarity of the stories the stronger were her sympathies on the side of poor grace nevertheless she would comfort her old friend if she knew how and of course she could not but admit to herself that the match was one which must be a cause of real sorrow to him i dont know why her refusal should mean nothing said lady lufton  of course a girl refuses at firsta girl i mean in such circumstances as hers she cant but feel that more is offered to her than she ought to take and that she is bound to go through the ceremony of declining but my anger is not with her lady lufton  i do not see how it can be  no it is not with her if she becomes his wife i trust that i may never see her  oh dr grantly  i do i do how can it be otherwise with me but i shall have no quarrel with her with him i must quarrel  i do not see why said lady lufton  you do not does he not set me at defiance  at his age surely a son has a right to marry as he pleases  if he took her out of the streets then it would be the same said the archdeacon with bitter anger  nofor such a one would herself be bad  or if she were the daughter of a huxter out of the city  no againfor in that case her want of education would probably unfit her for your society  her fathers disgrace then should be a matter of indifference to me lady lufton  i did not say so in the first place her father is not disgracednot as yet and we do not know whether he may ever be disgraced you will hardly be disposed to say that persecution from the palace disgraces a clergyman in barsetshire  all the same i believe that the man was guilty said the archdeacon  wait and see my friend before you condemn him altogether but be that as it may i acknowledge that the marriage is one which must naturally be distasteful to you  oh lady lufton if you only knew if you only knew  i do know and i feel for you but i think that your son has a right to expect that you should not show the same repugnance to such a marriage as this as you would have had a right to show had he suggested to himself such a wife as those at which you just now hinted of course you can advise him and make him understand your feelings but i cannot think you will be justified in quarrelling with him or in changing your views towards him as regards money seeing that miss crawley is an educated lady who has done nothing to forfeit your respect a heavy cloud came upon the archdeacons brow as he heard these words but he did not make any immediate answer of course my friend continued lady lufton i should not have ventured to say so much to you had you not come to me as it were for my opinion  i came here because i thought henry was here said the archdeacon  if i have said too much i beg your pardon  no you have not said too much it is not that you and i are such old friends that either may say almost anything to the other  yesjust so and therefore i have ventured to speak my mind said lady lufton  of courseand i am obliged to you but lady lufton you do not understand yet how this hits me everything in life that i have done i have done for my children i am wealthy but i have not used my wealth for myself because i have desired that they should be able to hold their heads high in the world all my ambition has been for them and all the pleasure which i have anticipated for myself in my old age is that which i have hoped to receive from their credit as for henry he might have had anything he wanted from me in the way of money he expressed a wish a few months since to go into parliament and i promised to help him as far as ever i could go i have kept up the game altogether for him he the younger son of a working parish parson has had everything that could be given to the eldest son of a country gentlemanmore than is given to the eldest son of many a peer i have hoped that he would marry again but i have never cared that he should marry for money i have been willing to do anything for him myself but lady lufton a father does feel that he should have some return for all this no one can imagine that henry ever supposed that a bride from that wretched place at hogglestock could be welcomed among us he knew that he would break our hearts and he did not care for it that is what i feel of course he has the power to do as he likesand of course i have the power to do as i like also with what is my own  lady lufton was a very good woman devoted to her duties affectionate and just to those about her truly religious and charitable from her nature but i doubt whether the thorough worldliness of the archdeacons appeal struck her as it will strike the reader people are so much more worldly in practice than they are in theory so much keener after their own gratification in detail than they are in the abstract that the narrative of many an adventure would shock us though the same adventure would not shock us in the action one girl tells another how she has changed her mind in love and the friend sympathizes with the friend and perhaps applauds had the story been told in print the friend who had listened with equanimity would have read of such vacillation with indignation she who vacillated herself would have hated her own performance when brought before her judgment as a matter in which she had no personal interest very fine things are written every day about honesty and truth and men read them with a sort of external conviction that a man if he be anything of a man at all is of course honest and true but when the internal convictions are brought out between two or three who are personally interested togetherbetween two or three who feel that their little gathering is so to say tiledthose internal convictions differ very much from the external convictions this man in his confidences asserts broadly that he does not mean to be thrown over and that man has a project for throwing over somebody else and the intention of each is that scruples are not to stand in the way of his success the ruat coelum fiat justitia was said no doubt from an outside balcony to a crowd and the speaker knew that he was talking buncombe the rem si possis recte si non quocunque modo was whispered into the ear in a club smokingroom and the whisperer intended that his words should prevail  lady lufton had often heard her friend the archdeacon preach and she knew well the high tone which he could take as to the necessity of trusting to our hopes for the future for all our true happiness and yet she sympathized with him when he told her that he was brokenhearted because his son would take a step which might possibly interfere with his worldly prosperity had the archdeacon been preaching about matrimony he would have recommended young men in taking wives to themselves especially to look for young women who feared the lord but in talking about his own sons wife no word as to her eligibility or noneligibility in this respect escaped his lips had he talked on the subject till nightfall no such word would have been spoken had any friend of his own man or woman in discussing such a matter with him and asking his advice upon it alluded to the fear of the lord the allusion would have been distasteful to him and would have smacked to his palate of hypocrisy lady lufton who understood as well as any woman what it was to be tiled with a friend took all this in good part the archdeacon had spoken out of his heart what was in his heart one of his children had married a marquis another might probably become a bishopperhaps an archbishop the third might be a county squirehigh among county squires but he could only so become by walking warilyand now he was bent on marrying the penniless daughter of an impoverished halfmad country curate who was about to be tried for stealing twenty pounds lady lufton in spite of all her arguments could not refuse her sympathy to her old friend  after all from what you say i suppose they are not engaged  i do not know said the archdeacon i cannot tell  and what do you wish me to do  ohnothing i came over as i said before because i thought he was here i think it right before he has absolutely committed himself to take every means in my power to make him understand that i shall withdraw from him all pecuniary assistancenow and for the future  my friend that threat seems to me to be so terrible  it is the only power i have left to me  but you who are so affectionate by nature would never adhere to it  i will try i will do my best to be firm i will at once put everything beyond my control after my death the archdeacon as he uttered these terrible wordswords which were awful to lady luftons earsresolved that he would endeavour to nurse his own wrath but at the same time almost hated himself for his own pusillanimity because he feared that his wrath would die away before he should have availed himself of its heat  i would do nothing rash of that kind said lady lufton your object is to prevent the marriagenot to punish him for it when once he has made it  he is not to have his own way in everything lady lufton  but you should first try to prevent it  what can i do to prevent it  lady lufton paused for a couple of minutes before she replied she had a scheme in her head but it seemed to her to savour of cruelty and yet at present it was her chief duty to assist her old friend if any assistance could be given there could hardly be a doubt that such a marriage as this of which they were speaking was in itself an evil in her case the case of her son there had been no question of a trial of money stolen of aught that was in truth disgraceful i think if i were you dr grantly she said that i would see the young lady while i was here  see her myself said the archdeacon the idea of seeing grace crawley himself had up to this moment never entered his head  i think i would do so  i think i will said the archdeacon after a pause then he got up from his chair if i am to do it i had better do it at once  be gentle with her my friend the archdeacon paused again he certainly had entertained the idea of encountering miss crawley with severity rather than gentleness lady lufton rose from her seat and coming up to him took one of his hands between her own two be gentle to her she said you have owned that she has done nothing wrong the archdeacon bowed his head in token of assent and left the room  poor grace crawley     chapter lvii  a double pledge   the archdeacon as he walked across from the court to the parsonage was very thoughtful and his steps were very slow this idea of seeing miss crawley herself had been suggested to him suddenly and he had to determine how he would bear himself towards her and what he would say to her lady lufton had beseeched him to be gentle with her was the mission one in which gentleness would be possible must it not be his object to make this young lady understand that she could not be right in desiring to come into his family and share in all his good things when she had got no good things of her ownnothing but evil things to bring with her and how could this be properly explained to the young lady in gentle terms must he not be round with her and give her to understand in plain wordsthe plainest which he could usethat she would not get his good things though she would most certainly impose the burden of all her evil things on the man whom she was proposing to herself as a husband he remembered very well as he went that he had been told that miss crawley had herself refused the offer feeling herself to be unfit for the honour tendered to her but he suspected the sincerity of such a refusal calculating in his own mind the unreasonably great advantages which would be conferred on such a young lady as miss crawley by a marriage with his son he declared to himself that any girl must be very wicked indeed who should expect or even accept so much more than was her duebut nevertheless he could not bring himself to believe that any girl when so tempted would in sincerity decline to commit this great wickedness if he was to do any good by seeing miss crawley must it not consist in a proper explanation to her of the selfishness abomination and altogether damnable blackness of such wickedness as this on the part of a young woman in her circumstances heaven and earth he must say here are you without a penny in your pocket with hardly decent raiment on your back with a thief for your father and you think that you are to come and share in all the wealth that the grantlys have amassed that you are to have a husband with broad acres a big house and game preserves and become one of a family whose name has never been touched by a single accusationno not by a suspicion noinjustice such as that shall never be done betwixt you and me you may wring my heart and you may ruin my son but the broad acres and the big house and the game preserves and the rest of it shall never be your reward for doing so how was all that to be told effectively to a young woman in gentle words and then how was a man in the archdeacons position to be desirous of gentle wordsgentle words which would not be efficientwhen he knew well in his heart of hearts that he had nothing but his threats on which to depend he had no more power of disinheriting his own son for such an offence as that contemplated than he had of blowing out his own brains and he knew that it was so he was a man incapable of such persistency of wrath against one whom he loved he was neither cruel enough nor strong enough to do such a thing he could only threaten to do it and make what best use he might of threats whilst threats might be of avail in spite of all that he had said to his wife to lady lufton and to himself he knew very well that if his son did sin in this way he the father would forgive the sin of the son  in going across from the front gate of the court to the parsonage there was a place where three roads met and on this spot there stood a fingerpost round this fingerpost there was now pasted a placard which at once arrested the archdeacons eyecosby lodgesale of furnituregrowing crops to be sold on the grounds three hunters a brown gelding warranted for saddle or harnessthe archdeacon himself had given the brown gelding to his son as a great treasurethree alderney cows two cowcalves a low phaeton a gig two ricks of hay in this fashion were proclaimed in odious details all those comfortable additions to a gentlemans house in the country with which the archdeacon was so well acquainted only last november he had recommended his son to buy a certain newinvented clodcrusher and the clodcrusher had of course been bought the bright blue paint upon it had not as yet given way to the stains of the ordinary farmyard muck and mireand here was the clodcrusher advertised for sale the archdeacon did not want his son to leave cosby lodge he knew well enough that his son need not leave cosby lodge why had the foolish fellow been in such a hurry with his hideous illconditioned advertisements gentle how was he in such circumstances to be gentle he raised his umbrella and poked angrily at the disgusting notice the iron ferule caught the paper at a chink in the post and tore it from the top to the bottom but what was the use a horrid ugly bill lying torn in such a spot would attract only more attention than one fixed to a post he could not condescend however to give to it further attention but passed on up to the parsonage gentle indeed  nevertheless archdeacon grantly was a gentleman and never yet had dealt more harshly with any woman than we have sometimes seen him do with his wifewhen he would say to her an angry word or two with a good deal of marital authority his wife who knew well what his angry words were worth never even suggested to herself that she had cause for complaint on that head had she known that the archdeacon was about to undertake such a mission as this which he had now in hand she would not have warned him to be gentle she indeed would have strongly advised him not to undertake the mission cautioning him that the young lady would probably get the better of him  grace my dear said mrs robarts coming up into the nursery in which miss crawley was sitting with the children come out here a moment will you then grace left the children and went out into the passage my dear there is a gentleman in the drawingroom who asks to see you  a gentleman mrs robarts what gentleman but grace though she asked the question conceived that the gentleman must be henry grantly her mind did not suggest to her the possibility of any other gentleman coming to see her  you must not be surprised or allow yourself to be frightened  oh mrs robarts who is it  it is major grantlys father  the archdeacon  yes dear archdeacon grantly he is in the drawingroom  must i see him mrs robarts  well gracei think you must i hardly know how you can refuse he is an intimate friend of everybody here at framley  what will he say to me  nay that i cannot tell i suppose you know  he has come no doubt to bid me have nothing to say to his son he need not have troubled himself but he may say what he likes i am not a coward and i will go to him  stop a moment grace come into my room for an instant the children have pulled your hair about but grace though she followed mrs robarts into the bedroom would have nothing done to her hair she was too proud for thatand we may say also too little confident in any good which such resources might effect on her behalf never mind about that she said what am i to say to him mrs robarts paused before she replied feeling that the matter was one which required some deliberation tell me what i must say to him said grace repeating her question  i hardly know what your own feelings are my dear  yes you do you do know if i had all the world to give i would give it all to major grantly  tell him that then  no i will not tell him that never mind about my frock mrs robarts i do not care for that i will tell him that i love his son and his granddaughter too well to injure them i will tell him nothing else i might as well go now mrs robarts as she looked at grace was astonished at the serenity of her face and yet when her hand was on the drawingroom door grace hesitated looked back and trembled mrs robarts blew a kiss to her from the stairs and then the door was opened and the girl found herself in the presence of the archdeacon he was standing on the rug with his back to the fire and his heavy ecclesiastical hat was placed on the middle of the round table the hat caught graces eye at the moment of her entrance and she felt that all the thunders of the church were contained within it and then the archdeacon himself was so big and so clerical and so imposing her fathers aspect was severe but the severity of her fathers face was essentially different from that expressed by the archdeacon whatever impression came from her father came from the man himself there was no outward adornment there there was so to say no wig about mr crawley now the archdeacon was not exactly adorned but he was so thoroughly imbued with high clerical belongings and sacerdotal fitnesses as to appear always as a walking sitting or standing impersonation of parsondom to poor grace as she entered the room he appeared to be an impersonation of parsondom in its severest aspect  miss crawley i believe said he  yes sir said she curtseying ever so slightly as she stood before him at some considerable distance  his first idea was that his son must be indeed a fool if he was going to give up cosby lodge and all barsetshire and retire to pau for so slight and unattractive a creature as he now saw before him but this idea stayed with him only for a moment as he continued to gaze at her during the interview he came to perceive that there was very much more than he had perceived at the first glance and that his son after all had had eyes to see though perhaps not a heart to understand  will you not take a chair he said then grace sat down still at a distance from the archdeacon and he kept his place upon the rug he felt that there would be a difficulty in making her feel the full force of his eloquence all across the room and yet he did not know how to bring himself nearer to her she became suddenly very important in his eyes and he was to some extent afraid of her she was so slight so meek so young and yet there was about her something so beautifully feminineand withal so like a ladythat he felt instinctively that he could not attack her with harsh words had her lips been full and her colour high and had her eyes rolled had she put forth against him any of that ordinary artillery with which youthful feminine batteries are charged he would have been ready to rush to the combat but this girl about whom his son had gone mad sat there as passively as though she were conscious of the possession of no artillery there was not a single gun fired from beneath her eyelids he knew not why but he respected his son now more than he had respected him for the last two monthsmore perhaps than he had ever respected him before he was as eager as ever against the marriagebut in thinking of his son in what he said and did after these few first moments of the interview he ceased to think of him with contempt the creature before him was a woman who grew in his opinion till he began to feel that she was in truth fit to be the wife of his sonif only she were not a pauper and the daughter of a mad curate and alas too probably of a thief though his feeling towards the girl was changed his duty to himself his family and his son was the same as ever and therefore he began his task  perhaps you had not expected to see me he said  no indeed sir  nor had i intended when i came over here to call on my old friend lady lufton to come up to this house but as i knew that you were here miss crawley i thought that upon the whole it would be better that i should see you then he paused as though he expected that grace would say something but grace had nothing to say of course you must understand miss crawley that i should not venture to speak to you on this subject unless i myself were very closely interested in it he had not yet said what was the subject and it was not probable that grace should give him any assistance by affecting to understand this without direct explanation from him she sat quite motionless and did not even aid him by showing by her altered colour that she understood his purpose my son has told me said he that he has professed an attachment for you miss crawley  then there was another pause and grace felt that she was compelled to say something major grantly has been very good to me she said and then she hated herself for having uttered words which were so tame and unwomanly in their spirit of course her lovers father would despise her for having so spoken after all it did not much signify if he would only despise her and go away it would perhaps be for the best  i do not know about being good said the archdeacon i think he is good i think he means to be good  i am sure he is good said grace warmly  you know he has a daughter miss crawley  oh yes i know edith well  of course his first duty is to her is it not and he owes much to his family do you not feel that  of course i feel it sir the poor girl had always heard dr grantly spoken of as the archdeacon but she did not in the least know what she ought to call him  now miss crawley pray listen to me i will speak to you very openly i must speak to you openly because it is my duty on my sons behalfbut i will endeavour to speak to you kindly also of yourself i have heard nothing but what is favourable and there is no reason as yet why i should not respect and esteem you grace told herself that she would do nothing which ought to forfeit his respect and esteem but that she did not care two straws whether his respect and esteem were bestowed on her or not she was striving after something very different from that if my son were to marry you he would greatly injure himself and would very greatly injure his child again he paused he had told her to listen and she was resolved that she would listenunless he should say something which might make a word from her necessary at the moment i do not know whether there does at present exist any engagement between you  there is no engagement sir  i am glad of thatvery glad of it i do not know whether you are aware that my son is dependent upon me for the greater part of his income it is so and as i am so circumstanced with my son of course i feel the closest possible concern in his future prospects the archdeacon did not know how to explain clearly why the fact of his making a son an annual allowance should give him a warmer interest in his sons affairs than he might have had had the major been altogether independent of him but he trusted that grace would understand this by her own natural lights now miss crawley of course i cannot wish to say a word that shall hurt your feelings but there are reasons  i know said she interrupting him papa is accused of stealing money he did not steal it but people think he did and then we are so very poor  you do understand me thenand i feel grateful i do indeed  i dont think our being poor ought to signify a bit said grace papa is a gentleman and a clergyman and mamma is a lady  but my dear  i know i ought not to be your sons wife as long as people think that papa stole the money if he had stolen it i ought never to be major grantlys wifeor anybodys wife i know that very well and as for edithi would sooner die than do anything that would be bad to her  the archdeacon had now left the rug and advanced till he was almost close to the chair on which grace was sitting my dear he said what you say does you very much honourvery much honour indeed now that he was close to her he could look into her eyes and he could see the exact form of her features and could understandcould not help understandingthe character of her countenance it was a noble face having in it nothing that was poor nothing that was mean nothing that was shapeless it was a face that promised infinite beauty with a promise that was on the very verge of fulfilment there was a play about her mouth as she spoke and a curl in her nostril as the eager words came from her which almost made the selfish father give way why had they not told him that she was such a one as this why had not henry himself spoken of the speciality of her beauty no man in england knew better than the archdeacon the difference between beauty of one kind and beauty of another kind in a womans facethe one beauty which comes from health and youth and animal spirits and which belongs to the millers daughter and the other beauty which shows itself in fine lines and a noble spiritthe beauty which comes from breeding what you say does you very much honour indeed said the archdeacon  i should not mind at all about being poor said grace  no no no said the archdeacon  poor as we areand no clergyman i think ever was so poori should have done as your son asked me at once if it had been only thatbecause i love him  if you love him you will not wish to injure him  i will not injure him sir there is my promise and now as she spoke she rose from her chair and standing close to the archdeacon laid her hand very lightly on the sleeve of his coat there is my promise as long as people say that papa stole the money i will never marry your son there  the archdeacon was still looking down at her and feeling the slight touch of her fingers raised his arm a little as though to welcome the pressure he looked into her eyes which were turned eagerly towards his and when doing so was quite sure that the promise would be kept it would have been sacrilegehe felt that it would have been sacrilegeto doubt such a promise he almost relented his soft heart which was never very well under his own control gave way so far that he was nearly moved to tell her that on his sons behalf he acquitted her of the promise what could any mans son do better than have such a woman for his wife it would have been of no avail had he made her such offer the pledge she had given had not been wrung from her by his influence nor could his influence have availed aught with her towards the alteration of her purpose it was not the archdeacon who had taught her that it would not be her duty to take disgrace into the house of the man she loved as he looked down upon her face two tears formed themselves in his eyes and gradually trickled down his old nose my dear he said if this cloud passes away from you you shall come to us and be my daughter and thus he also pledged himself there was a dash of generosity about the man in spite of his selfishness which always made him desirous of giving largely to those who gave largely to him he would fain that his gifts should be the bigger if it were possible he longed at this moment to tell her that the dirty cheque should go for nothing he would have done it i think but that it was impossible for him so to speak in her presence of that which moved her so greatly  he had contrived that her hand should fall from his arm into his grasp and now for a moment he held it you are a good girl he saida dear dear good girl when this cloud has passed away you shall come to us and be our daughter  but it will never pass away said grace  illustration but it will never pass away said grace  let us hope that it may let us hope that it may then he stooped over her and kissed her and leaving the room got out into the hall and thence into the garden and so away without saying a word of adieu to mrs robarts  as he walked across to the court whither he was obliged to go because of his chaise he was lost in surprise at what had occurred he had gone to the parsonage hating the girl and despising his son now as he retraced his steps his feelings were altogether changed he admired the girland as for his son even his anger was for the moment altogether gone he would write to his son at once and implore him to stop the sale he would tell his son all that had occurred or rather would make mrs grantly do so in respect to his son he was quite safe he thought at that moment that he was safe there would be no use in hurling further threats at him if crawley were found guilty of stealing the money there was the girls promise if he were acquitted there was his own pledge he remembered perfectly well that the girl had said more than thisthat she had not confined her assurance to the verdict of a jury that she had protested that she would not accept major grantlys hand as long as people thought that her father had stolen the cheque but the archdeacon felt that it would be ignoble to hold her closely to her words the event according to his ideas of the compact was to depend upon the verdict of the jury if the jury should find mr crawley not guilty all objection on his part to the marriage was to be withdrawn and he would keep his word in such case it should be withdrawn  when he came to the rags of the auctioneers bill which he had before torn down with his umbrella he stopped a moment to consider how he would act at once in the first place he would tell his son that his threats were withdrawn and would ask him to remain at cosby lodge he would write the letter as he passed through barchester on his way home so that his son might receive it on the following morning and he would refer the major to his mother for a full explanation of the circumstances those odious bills must be removed from every barndoor and wall in the county at the present moment his anger against his son was chiefly directed against his illjudged haste in having put up those illomened posters then he paused to consider what must be his wish as to the verdict of the jury he had pledged himself to abide by the verdict and he could not but have a wish on the subject could he desire in his heart that mr crawley should be found guilty he stood still for a moment thinking of this and then he walked on shaking his head if it might be possible he would have no wish on the subject whatsoever  well said lady lufton stopping him in the passagehave you seen her  yes i have seen her  well  she is a good girla very good girl i am in a great hurry and hardly know how to tell you more now  you say that she is a good girl  i say that she is a very good girl an angel could not have behaved better i will tell you all some day lady lufton but i can hardly tell you now  when the archdeacon was gone old lady lufton confided to young lady lufton her very strong opinion that many months would not be gone by before grace crawley would be the mistress of cosby lodge it will be great promotion said the old lady with a little toss of her head  when grace was interrogated afterwards by mrs robarts as to what had passed between her and the archdeacon she had very little to say as to the interview no he did not scold me she replied to an inquiry from her friend but he spoke about your engagement said mrs robarts there is no engagement said grace but i suppose you acknowledged my dear that a future engagement is quite possible i told him mrs robarts grace answered after hesitating for a moment that i would never marry his son as long as papa was suspected by any one in the world of being a thief and i will keep my word but she said nothing to mrs robarts of the pledge which the archdeacon had made to her     chapter lviii  the crossgrainedness of men   illustration  by the time that the archdeacon reached plumstead his enthusiasm in favour of grace crawley had somewhat cooled itself and the language which from time to time he prepared for conveying his impressions to his wife became less fervid as he approached his home there was his pledge and by that he would abideand so much he would make both his wife and his son understand but any idea which he might have entertained for a moment of extending the promise he had given and relaxing that given to him was gone before he saw his own chimneys indeed i fear he had by that time begun to feel that the only salvation now open to him must come from the jurys verdict if the jury should declare mr crawley to be guilty then he would not say even to himself that in such case all would be right but he did feel that much as he might regret the fate of the poor crawleys and of the girl whom in his warmth he had declared to be almost an angel nevertheless to him personally such a verdict would bring consolatory comfort  i have seen miss crawley he said to his wife as soon as he had closed the door of his study before he had been two minutes out of the chaise he had determined that he would dash at the subject at once and he thus carried his resolution into effect  you have seen grace crawley  yes i went up to the parsonage and called upon her lady lufton advised me to do so  and henry  oh henry has gone he was only there one night i suppose he saw her but i am not sure  would not miss crawley tell you  i forgot to ask her mrs grantly at hearing this expressed her surprise by opening wide her eyes he had gone all the way over to framley on purpose to look after his son and learn what were his doings and when there he had forgotten to ask the person who could have given him better information than any one else but it does not signify continued the archdeacon she said enough to me to make that of no importance  and what did she say  she said that she would never consent to marry henry as long as there was any suspicion abroad as to her fathers guilt  and you believe her promise  certainly i do i do not doubt it in the least i put implicit confidence in her and i have promised her that if her father is acquittedi will withdraw my opposition  no  but i have and you would have done the same had you been there  i doubt that my dear i am not so impulsive as you are  you could not have helped yourself you would have felt yourself obliged to be equally generous with her she came up to me and she put her hand upon me psha said mrs grantly but she did my dear and then she said i promise you that i will not become your sons wife while people think that papa stole this money what else could i do  and is she pretty  very pretty very beautiful  and like a lady  quite like a lady there is no mistake about that  and she behaved well  admirably said the archdeacon who was in a measure compelled to justify the generosity into which he had been betrayed by his feelings  then she is a paragon said mrs grantly  i dont know what you may call a paragon my dear i say that she is a lady and that she is extremely goodlooking and that she behaved very well i cannot say less in her favour i am sure you would not say less yourself if you had been present  she must be a wonderful young woman  i dont know anything about her being wonderful  she must be wonderful when she has succeeded both with the son and with the father  i wish you had been there instead of me said the archdeacon angrily mrs grantly very probably wished so also feeling that in that case a more serene mode of business would have been adopted how keenly susceptible the archdeacon still was to the influences of feminine charms no one knew better than mrs grantly and whenever she became aware that he had been in this way seduced from the wisdom of his cooler judgment she always felt something akin to indignation against the seducer as for her husband she probably told herself at such moments that he was an old goose if you had been there and henry with you you would have made a great deal worse job of it than i have done said the archdeacon  i dont say you have made a bad job of it my dear said mrs grantly but its past eight and you must be terribly in want of your dinner had you not better go up and dress  in the evening the plan of the future campaign was arranged between them the archdeacon would not write to his son at all in passing through barchester he had abandoned his idea of despatching a note from the hotel feeling that such a note as would be required was not easily written in a hurry mrs grantly would now write to her son telling him that circumstances had changed that it would be altogether unnecessary for him to sell his furniture and begging him to come over and see his father without a days delay she wrote her letter that night and read to the archdeacon all that she had writtenwith the exception of the postscriptyou may be quite sure that there will be no unpleasantness with your father that was the postscript which was not communicated to the archdeacon  on the third day after that henry grantly did come over to plumstead his mother in her letter to him had not explained how it had come to pass that the sale of his furniture would be unnecessary his father had given him to understand distinctly that his income would be withdrawn from him unless he would express his intention of giving up miss crawley and it had been admitted among them all that cosby lodge must be abandoned if this were done he certainly would not give up grace crawley sooner than that he would give up every stick in his possession and go and live in new zealand if it were necessary not only had graces conduct to him made him thus firm but the natural bent of his own disposition had tended that way also his father had attempted to dictate to him and sooner than submit to that he would sell the coat off his back had his father confined his opposition to advice and had miss crawley been less firm in her view of her duty the major might have been less firm also but things had so gone that he was determined to be fixed as granite if others would not be moved from their resolves neither would he such being the state of his mind he could not understand why he was thus summoned to plumstead he had already written over to pau about his house and it was well that he should at any rate see his mother before he started he was willing therefore to go to plumstead but he took no steps as to the withdrawal of those auctioneers bills to which the archdeacon so strongly objected when he drove into the rectory yard his father was standing there before him henry he said i am very glad to see you i am very much obliged to you for coming then henry got out of his cart and shook hands with his father and the archdeacon began to talk about the weather your mother has gone into barchester to see your grandfather said the archdeacon if you are not tired we might as well take a walk i want to go up as far as flurrys cottage the major of course declared that he was not at all tired and that he should be delighted of all things to go up and see old flurry and thus they started young grantly had not even been into the house before he left the yard with his father of course he was thinking of the coming sale at cosby lodge and of his future life at pau and of his injured position in the world there would be no longer any occasion for him to be solicitous as to the plumstead foxes of course these things were in his mind but he could not begin to speak of them till his father did so im afraid your grandfather is not very strong said the archdeacon shaking his head i fear he wont be with us very long  is it so bad as that sir  well you know he is an old man henry and he was always somewhat old for his age he will be eighty if he lives two years longer i think but hell never reach eightynever you must go and see him before you go back home you must indeed the major of course promised that he would see his grandfather and the archdeacon told his son how nearly the old man had fallen in the passage between the cathedral and the deanery in this way they had nearly made their way up to the gamekeepers cottage without a word of reference to any subject that touched upon the matter of which each of them was of course thinking whether the major intended to remain at home or to live at pau the subject of mr hardings health was a natural topic for conversation between him and his father but when his father stopped suddenly and began to tell him how a fox had been trapped on darvells farmand of course it was a plumstead foxthere can be no doubt that flurry is right about thatwhen the archdeacon spoke of this iniquity with much warmth and told his son how he had at once written off to mr thorne of ullathorne and how mr thorne had declared that he didnt believe a word of it and how flurry had produced the pad of the fox with the marks of the trap on the skinthen the son began to feel that the ground was becoming very warm and that he could not go on much longer without rushing into details about grace crawley ive no more doubt that it was one of our foxes than that i stand here said the archdeacon  it doesnt matter where the fox was bred it shouldnt have been trapped said the major  of course not said the archdeacon indignantly i wonder whether he would have been so keen had a romanist priest come into his parish and turned one of his protestants into a papist  then flurry came up and produced the identical pad out of his pocket i dont suppose it was intended said the major looking at the interesting relic with scrutinizing eyes i suppose it was caught in a rabbittrapeh flurry  i dont see what right a man has with traps at all when gentlemen is particular about their foxes said flurry of course theyd call it rabbits  i never liked that man on darvells farm said the archdeacon  nor i either said flurry no farmer ought to be on that land who dont have a horse of his own and if i war squire thorne i wouldnt have no farmer there who didnt keep no horse when a farmer has a horse of his own and follies the hounds there aint no rabbittrapsnever how does that come about mr henry rabbits i know very well what rabbits is  mr henry shook his head and turned away and the archdeacon followed him there was an hypocrisy about this pretended care for the foxes which displeased the major he could not of course tell his father that the foxes were no longer anything to him but yet he must make it understood that such was his conviction his mother had written to him saying that the sale of furniture need not take place it might be all very well for his mother to say that or for his father but after what had taken place he could consent to remain in england on no other understanding than that his income should be made permanent to him such permanence must not be any longer dependent on his fathers caprice in these days he had come to be somewhat in love with poverty and pau and had been feeding on the luxury of his grievance there is perhaps nothing so pleasant as the preparation for selfsacrifice to give up cosby lodge and the foxes to marry a penniless wife and go and live at pau on six or seven hundred a year seemed just now to major grantly to be a fine thing and he did not intend to abandon this fine thing without receiving a very clear reason for doing so i cant quite understand thorne said the archdeacon he used to be so particular about the foxes and i dont suppose that a country gentleman will change his ideas because he has given up hunting himself  mr thorne never thought much of flurry said henry grantly with his mind intent upon pau and his grievance  he might take my word at any rate said the archdeacon  it was a known fact that the archdeacons solicitude about the plumstead covers was wholly on behalf of his son the major the major himself knew this thoroughly and felt that his fathers present special anxiety was intended as a corroboration of the tidings conveyed in his mothers letter every word so uttered was meant to have reference to his sons future residence in the country father he said turning round shortly and standing before the archdeacon in the pathway i think you are quite right about the covers i feel sure that every gentleman who preserves a fox does good to the country i am sorry that i shall not have a closer interest in the matter myself  why shouldnt you have a closer interest in it said the archdeacon  because i shall be living abroad  you got your mothers letter  yes i got my mothers letter  did she not tell you that you can stay where you are  yes she said so but to tell you the truth sir i do not like the risk of living beyond my assured income but if i justify it  i do not wish to complain sir but you have made me understand that you can and that in certain circumstances you will at a moment withdraw what you give me since this was said to me i have felt myself to be unsafe in such a house as cosby lodge  the archdeacon did not know how to explain he had intended that the real explanation should be given by mrs grantly and had been anxious to return to his old relations with his son without any exact terms on his own part but his son was as he thought awkward and would drive him to some speech that was unnecessary you need not be unsafe there at all he said half angrily  i must be unsafe if i am not sure of my income  your income is not in any danger but you had better speak to your mother about it for myself i think i may say that i have never yet behaved to any of you with harshness a son should at any rate not be offended because a father thinks that he is entitled to some consideration for what he does  there are some points on which a son cannot give way even to his father sir  you had better speak to your mother henry she will explain to you what has taken place look at that plantation you dont remember it but every tree there was planted since you were born i bought that farm from old mr thorne when he was purchasing st ewolds downs and it was the first bit of land i ever had of my own  that is not in plumstead i think  no this is plumstead where we stand but thats in eiderdown the parishes run in and out here i never bought any other land as cheap as i bought that  and did old thorne make a good purchase at st ewolds  yes i fancy he did it gave him the whole of the parish which was a great thing it is astonishing how land has risen in value since that and yet rents are not so very much higher they who buy land now cant have above twoandahalf for their money  i wonder people are so fond of land said the major  it is a comfortable feeling to know that you stand on your own ground land is about the only thing that cant fly away and then you see land gives so much more than the rent it gives position and influence and political power to say nothing about the game well go back now i daresay your mother will be at home by this time  the archdeacon was striving to teach a great lesson to his son when he thus spoke of the pleasure which a man feels when he stands upon his own ground he was bidding his son to understand how great was the position of an heir to a landed property and how small the position of a man depending on what dr grantly himself would have called a scratch incomean income made up of a few odds and ends a share or two in this company and a share or two in that a slight venture in foreign stocks a small mortgage and such like convenient but uninfluential driblets a man no doubt may live at pau on driblets may pay his way and drink his bottle of cheap wine and enjoy life after a fashion while reading galignani and looking at the mountains butas it seemed to the archdeaconwhen there was a choice between this kind of thing and foxcovers at plumstead and a seat among the magistrates of barsetshire and an establishment full of horses beeves swine carriages and hayricks a man brought up as his son had been brought up ought not to be very long in choosing it never entered into the archdeacons mind that he was tempting his son but henry grantly felt that he was having the good things of the world shown to him and that he was being told that they should be hisfor a consideration  the major in his present mood looked at the matter from his own point of view and determined that the consideration was too high he was pledged not to give up grace crawley and he would not yield on that point though he might be tempted by all the foxcovers in barsetshire at this moment he did not know how far his father was prepared to yield or how far it was expected that he should yield himself he was told that he had to speak to his mother he would speak to his mother but in the meantime he could not bring himself to make a comfortable answer to his fathers eloquent praise of landed property he could not allow himself to be enthusiastic on the matter till he knew what was expected of him if he chose to submit to be made a british squire at present galignani and the mountains had their charms for him there was therefore but little conversation between the father and the son as they walked back to the rectory  late that night the major heard the whole story from his mother gradually and as though unintentionally mrs grantly told him all she knew of the archdeacons visit to framley mrs grantly was quite as anxious as was her husband to keep her son at home and therefore she omitted in her story those little sneers against grace which she herself had been tempted to make by the archdeacons fervour in the girls favour the major said as little as was possible while he was being told of his fathers adventure and expressed neither anger nor satisfaction till he had been made thoroughly to understand that grace had pledged herself not to marry him as long as any suspicion should rest upon her fathers name  your father is quite satisfied with her said mrs grantly he thinks that she is behaving very well  my father had no right to exact such a pledge  but she made it of her own accord she was the first to speak about mr crawleys supposed guilt your father never mentioned it  he must have led to it and i think he had no right to do so he had no right to go to her at all  now dont be foolish henry  i dont see that i am foolish  yes you are a man is foolish if he wont take what he wants without asking exactly how he is to come by it that your father should be anxious is the most natural thing in the world you know how high he has always held his own head and how much he thinks about the characters and position of clergymen it is not surprising that he should dislike the idea of such a marriage  grace crawley would disgrace no family said the lover  thats all very well for you to say and ill take your word that it is sothat is as far as the young lady goes herself and theres your father almost as much in love with her as you are i dont know what you would have  i would be left alone  but what harm has been done you from what you yourself have told me i know that miss crawley has said the same thing to you that she has said to your father you cant but admire her for the feeling  i admire her for everything  very well we dont say anything against that  and i dont mean to give her up  very well again let us hope that mr crawley will be acquitted and then all will be right your father never goes back from his promise he is always better than his word youll find that if mr crawley is acquitted or if he escapes in any way your father will only be happy of an excuse to make much of the young lady you should not be hard on him henry dont you see that it is his one great desire to keep you near to him the sight of those odious bills nearly broke his heart  then why did he threaten me  henry you are obstinate  i am not obstinate mother  yes you are you remember nothing and you forget nothing you expect everything to be made smooth for you and will do nothing towards making things smooth for anybody else you ought to promise to give up the sale if the worst came to the worst your father would not let you suffer in pocket for yielding to him in so much  if the worst comes to the worst i wish to take nothing from my father  you wont put off the sale then  the son paused a moment before he answered his mother thinking over all the circumstances of his position i cannot do so as long as i am subject to my fathers threat he said at last what took place between my father and miss crawley can go for nothing with me he has told me that his allowance to me is to be withdrawn let him tell me that he has reconsidered the matter  but he has not withdrawn it the last quarter was paid to your account only the other day he does not mean to withdraw it  let him tell me so let him tell me that my power of living at cosby lodge does not depend on my marriagethat my income will be continued to me whether i marry or no and ill arrange matters with the auctioneer tomorrow you cant suppose that i should prefer to live in france  henry you are too hard on your father  i think mother he has been too hard upon me  it is you that are to blame now i tell you plainly that that is my opinion if evil comes of it it will be your own fault  if evil come of it i must bear it  a son ought to give up something to his fatherespecially to a father so indulgent as yours  but it was of no use and mrs grantly when she went to her bed could only lament in her own mind over what in discussing the matter afterwards with her sister she called the crossgrainedness of men they are as like each other as two peas she said and though each of them wished to be generous neither of them would condescend to be just early on the following morning there was no doubt much said on the subject between the archdeacon and his wife before they met their son at breakfast but neither at breakfast nor afterwards was there a word said between the father and son that had the slightest reference to the subject in dispute between them the archdeacon made no more speeches in favour of land nor did he revert to the foxes he was very civil to his sontoo civil by half as mrs grantly continued to say to herself and then the major drove himself away in his cart going through barchester so that he might see his grandfather when he wished his father goodby the archdeacon shook hands with him and said something about the chance of rain had he not better take the big umbrella the major thanked him courteously and said that he did not think it would rain then he was gone upon his own head be it said the archdeacon when his sons step was heard in the passage leading to the backyard then mrs grantly got up quietly and followed her son she found him settling himself in his dogcart while the servant who was to accompany him was still at the horses head she went up close to him and standing by the wheel of the gig whispered a word or two into his ear if you love me henry you will postpone the sale do it for my sake there came across his face a look of great pain but he answered her not a word  the archdeacon was walking about the room striking one hand open with the other closed clearly in a tumult of anger when his wife returned to him i have done all that i can he saidall that i can more indeed than was becoming for me upon his own head be it upon his own head be it  what is it that you fear she asked  i fear nothing but if he chooses to sell his things at cosby lodge he must abide the consequences they shall not be replaced with my money  what will it matter if he does sell them  matter do you think there is a single person in the county who will not know that his doing so is a sign that he has quarrelled with me  but he has not quarrelled with you  i can tell you then that in that case i shall have quarrelled with him i have not been a hard father but there are some things which a man cannot bear of course you will take his part  i am taking no part i only want to see peace between you  peaceyes peace indeed i am to yield in everything i am to be nobody look hereas sure as ever an auctioneers hammer is raised at cosby lodge i will alter the settlement of the property every acre shall belong to charles there is my word for it the poor woman had nothing more to saynothing more to say at that moment she thought that at the present conjuncture her husband was less in the wrong than her son but she could not tell him so lest she should strengthen him in his wrath  henry grantly found his grandfather in bed with posy seated on the bed beside him my father told me that you were not quite well and i thought that i would look in said the major  thank you my dearit is very good of you there is not much the matter with me but i am not quite so strong as i was once and the old man smiled as he held his grandsons hand  and how is cousin posy said the major  posy is quite wellisnt she my darling said the old man  grandpa doesnt go to the cathedral now said posy so i come in to talk to him dont i grandpa  and to play catscradleonly we have not had any catscradle this morninghave we posy  mrs baxter told me not to play this morning because its cold for grandpa to sit up in bed said posy  when the major had been there about twenty minutes he was preparing to take his leavebut mr harding bidding posy to go out of the room told his grandson that he had a word to say to him i dont like to interfere henry he said but i am afraid that things are not quite smooth at plumstead  there is nothing wrong between me and my mother said the major  god forbid that there should be but my dear boy dont let there be anything wrong between you and your father he is a good man and the time will come when you will be proud of his memory  i am proud of him now  then be gentle with himand submit yourself i am an old man nowvery fast going away from all those i love here but i am happy in leaving my children because they have ever been gentle to me and kind if i am permitted to remember them whither i am going my thoughts of them will all be pleasant should it not be much to them that they have made my deathbed happy  the major could not but tell himself that mr harding had been a man easy to please easy to satisfy and in that respect very different from his father but of course he said nothing of this i will do my best he replied  do my boy honour thy fatherthat thy days may be long in the land  illustration honour thy fatherthat thy days may be long in the land  it seemed to the major as he drove away from barchester that everybody was against him and yet he was sure that he himself was right he could not give up grace crawley and unless he were to do so he could not live at cosby lodge     chapter lix  a lady presents her compliments to miss l d   one morning while lily dale was staying with mrs thorne in london there was brought up to her room as she was dressing for dinner a letter which the postman had just left for her the address was written with a feminine hand and lily was at once aware that she did not know the writing the angles were very acute and the lines were very straight and the vowels looked to be cruel and false with their sharp points and their open eyes lily at once knew that it was the performance of a woman who had been taught to write at school and not at home and she became prejudiced against the writer before she opened the letter when she had opened the letter and read it her feelings towards the writer were not of a kindly nature it was as follows  a lady presents her compliments to miss l d and earnestly implores miss l d to give her an answer to the following question is miss l d engaged to marry mr j e the lady in question pledges herself not to interfere with miss l d in any way should the answer be in the affirmative the lady earnestly requests that a reply to this question may be sent to m d postoffice 455 edgware road in order that l d may not doubt that m d has an interest in j e m d encloses the last note she received from him before he started for the continent then there was a scrap which lily well knew to be in the handwriting of john eames and the scrap was as followsdearest mpunctually at 830 ever and always your unalterable j e lily as she read this did not comprehend that johns note to m d had been in itself a joke  lily dale had heard of anonymous letters before but had never received one or even seen one now that she had one in her hand it seemed to her that there could be nothing more abominable than the writing of such a letter she let it drop from her as though the receiving and opening and reading it had been a stain to her as it lay on the ground at her feet she trod upon it of what sort could a woman be who would write such a letter as that answer it of course she would not answer it it never occurred to her for a moment that it could become her to answer it had she been at home or with her mother she would have called her mother to her and mrs dale would have taken it from the ground and have read it and then destroyed it as it was she must pick it up herself she did so and declared to herself that there should be an end to it it might be right that somebody should see it and therefore she would show it to emily dunstable after that it should be destroyed  of course the letter could have no effect upon her so she told herself but it did have a very strong effect and probably the exact effect which the writer had intended that it should have j e was of course john eames there was no doubt about that what a fool the writer must have been to talk of l d in the letter when the outside cover was plainly addressed to miss lilian dale but there are some people for whom the pretended mystery of initial letters has a charm and who love the darkness of anonymous letters as lily thought of this she stamped on the letter again who was the m d to whom she was required to send an answerwith whom john eames corresponded in the most affectionate terms she had resolved that she would not even ask herself a question about m d and yet she could not divert her mind from the inquiry it was at any rate a fact that there must be some woman designated by the letterssome woman who had at any rate chosen to call herself m d and john eames had called her m there must at any rate be such a woman this female be she who she might had thought it worth her while to make this inquiry about john eames and had manifestly learned something of lilys own history and the woman had pledged herself not to interfere with john eames if l d would only condescend to say that she was engaged to him as lily thought of the proposition she trod upon the letter for the third time then she picked it up and having no place of custody under lock and key ready to her hand she put it in her pocket  at night before she went to bed she showed the letter to emily dunstable is it not surprising that any woman could bring herself to write such a letter said lily  but miss dunstable hardly saw it in the same light if anybody were to write me such a letter about bernard said she i should show it to him as a good joke  that would be very different you and bernard of course understand each other  and so will you and mr eamessome day i hope  never more than we do now dear the thing that annoys me is that such a woman as that should have even heard my name at all  as long as people have got ears and tongues people will hear other peoples names  lily paused a moment and then spoke again asking another question i suppose this woman does know him she must know him because he has written to her  she knows something about him no doubt and has some reason for wishing that you should quarrel with him if i were you i should take care not to gratify her as for mr eamess note it is a joke  it is nothing to me said lily  i suppose continued emily that most gentlemen become acquainted with some people that they would not wish all their friends to know that they knew they go about so much more than we do and meet people of all sorts  no gentleman should become intimately acquainted with a woman who could write such a letter as that said lily and as she spoke she remembered a certain episode to john eamess early life which had reached her from a source which she had not doubted and which had given her pain and offended her she had believed that john eames had in that case behaved cruelly to a young woman and had thought that her offence had come simply from that feeling but of course it is nothing to me she said mr eames can choose his friends as he likes i only wish that my name might not be mentioned to them  it is not from him that she has heard it  perhaps not as i said before of course it does not signify only there is something very disagreeable in the whole thing the idea is so hateful of course this woman means me to understand that she considers herself to have a claim upon mr eames and that i stand in her way  and why should you not stand in her way  i will stand in nobodys way mr eames has a right to give his hand to any one that he pleases i at any rate can have no cause of offence against him the only thing is that i do wish that my name could be left alone lily when she was in her own room again did destroy the letter but before she did so she read it again and it became so indelibly impressed on her memory that she could not forget even the words of it the lady who wrote had pledged herself under certain conditions not to interfere with miss l d interfere with me lily said to herself nobody can interfere with me nobody has power to do so as she turned it over in her mind her heart became hard against john eames no woman would have troubled herself to write such a letter without some cause for the writing that the writer was vulgar false and unfeminine lily thought that she could perceive from the letter itself but no doubt the woman knew john eames had some interest in the question of his marriage and was entitled to some answer to her questiononly was not entitled to such answer from lily dale  for some weeks past now up to the hour at which this anonymous letter had reached her hands lilys heart had been growing soft and still softer towards john eames and now again it had become hardened i think that the appearance of adolphus crosbie in the park that momentary vision of the real man by which the divinity of the imaginary apollo had been dashed to the ground had done a service to the cause of the other lover of the lover who had never been a god but who of late years had at any rate grown into the full dimensions of a man unfortunately for the latter he had commenced his lovemaking when he was but little more than a boy lily as she had thought of the two together in the days of her solitude after she had been deserted by crosbie had ever pictured to herself the lover whom she had preferred as having something godlike in his favour as being far the superior in wit in manner in acquirement and in personal advantage there had been good nature and true hearty love on the side of the other man but circumstances had seemed to show that his goodnature was equal to all and that he was able to share even his hearty love among two or three a man of such a character known by a girl from his boyhood as john eames had been known by lily dale was likely to find more favour as a friend than as a lover so it had been between john eames and lily while the untrue memory of what crosbie was or ever had been was present to her she could hardly bring herself to accept in her mind the idea of a lover who was less noble in his manhood than the false picture which that untrue memory was ever painting for her then had come before her eyes the actual man and though he had been seen but for a moment the false image had been broken into shivers lily had discovered that she had been deceived and that her forgiveness had been asked not by a god but by an ordinary human being as regarded the ungodlike man himself this could make no difference having thought upon the matter deeply she had resolved that she would not marry mr crosbie and had pledged herself to that effect to friends who never could have brought themselves to feel affection for him even had she married him but the shattering of the false image might have done john eames a good turn lily knew that she had at any rate full permission from all her friends to throw in her lot with hisif she could persuade herself to do so mother uncle sister brotherinlaw cousinand now this new cousins bride that was to betogether with lady julia and a whole crowd of allington and guestwick friends were in favour of such a marriage there had been nothing against it but the fact that the other man had been dearer to her and that other fact that poor johnny lacked somethingsomething of earnestness something of manliness something of that phoebus divinity with which crosbie had contrived to invest his own image but as i have said above john had gradually grown if not into divinity at least into manliness and the shattering of the false image had done him yeomans service now had come this accursed letter and lily despite herself despite her better judgment could not sweep it away from her mind and make the letter as nothing to her m d had promised not to interfere with her there was no room for such interference no possibility that such interference should take place she hoped earnestlyso she told herselfthat her old friend john eames might have nothing to do with a woman so impudent and vulgar as must be this m d but except as regarded old friendship m d and john eames apart or together could be as nothing to her therefore i say that the letter had had the effect which the writer of it had desired  all london was new to lily dale and mrs thorne was very anxious to show her everything that could be seen she was to return to allington before the flowers of may would have come and the crowd and the glare and the fashion and the art of the academys great exhibition must therefore remain unknown to her but she was taken to see many pictures and among others she was taken to see the pictures belonging to a certain nobleman who with that munificence which is so amply enjoyed and so little recognized in england keeps open house for the world to see the treasures which the wealth of his family has collected the necessary order was procured and on a certain brilliant april afternoon mrs thorne and her party found themselves in this noblemans drawingroom lily was with her of course and emily dunstable was there and bernard dale and mrs thornes dear friend mrs harold smith and mrs thornes constant and useful attendant siph dunn they had nearly completed their delightful but wearying task of gazing at pictures and mrs harold smith had declared that she would not look at another painting till the exhibition was open three of the ladies were seated in the drawingroom and siph dunn was standing before them lecturing about art as though he had been brought up on the ancient masters emily and bernard were lingering behind and the others were simply delaying their departure till the truant lovers should have caught them at this moment two gentlemen entered the room from the gallery and the two gentlemen were fowler pratt and adolphus crosbie  all the party except mrs thorne knew crosbie personally and all of them except mrs harold smith knew something of the story of what had occurred between crosbie and lily siph dunn had learned it all since the meeting in the park having nearly learned it all from what he had seen there with his eyes but mrs thorne who knew lilys story did not know crosbies appearance but there was his friend fowler pratt who as will be remembered had dined with her but the other day and she with that outspoken and somewhat loud impulse which was natural to her addressed him at once across the room calling him by name had she not done so the two men might probably have escaped through the room in which case they would have met bernard dale and emily dunstable in the doorway fowler pratt would have endeavoured so to escape and to carry crosbie with him as he was quite alive to the expedience of saving lily from such a meeting but as things turned out escape from mrs thorne was impossible  theres fowler pratt she had said when they first entered quite loud enough for fowler pratt to hear her mr pratt come here how dye do you dined with me last tuesday and youve never been to call  i never recognize that obligation till after the middle of may said mr pratt shaking hands with mrs thorne and mrs smith and bowing to miss dale  i dont see the justice of that at all said mrs thorne it seems to me that a good dinner is as much entitled to a morsel of pasteboard in april as at any other time you wont have another till you have calledunless youre specially wanted  crosbie would have gone on but that in his attempt to do so he passed close by the chair on which mrs harold smith was sitting and that he was accosted by her mr crosbie she said i havent seen you for an age has it come to pass that you have buried yourself entirely he did not know how to extricate himself so as to move on at once he paused and hesitated and then stopped and made an attempt to talk to mrs smith as though he were at his ease the attempt was anything but successful but having once stopped he did not know how to put himself in motion again so that he might escape at this moment bernard dale and emily dunstable came up and joined the group but neither of them had discovered who crosbie was till they were close upon him  lily was seated between mrs thorne and mrs smith and siph dunn had been standing immediately opposite to them fowler pratt who had been drawn into the circle against his will was now standing close to dunn almost between him and lilyand crosbie was standing within two yards of lily on the other side of dunn emily and bernard had gone behind pratt and crosbie to mrs thornes side before they had recognized the two menand in this way lily was completely surrounded mrs thorne who in spite of her eager impetuous ways was as thoughtful of others as any woman could be as soon as she heard crosbies name understood it all and knew that it would be well that she should withdraw lily from her plight crosbie in his attempt to talk to mrs smith had smiled and simperedand had then felt that to smile and simper before lily dale with a pretended indifference to her presence was false on his part and would seem to be mean he would have avoided lily for both their sakes had it been possible but it was no longer possible and he could not keep his eyes from her face hardly knowing what he did he bowed to her lifted his hat and uttered some word of greeting  lily from the moment that she had perceived his presence had looked straight before her with something almost of fierceness in her eyes both pratt and siph dunn had observed her narrowly it had seemed as though crosbie had been altogether outside the ken of her eyes or the notice of her ears and yet she had seen every motion of his body and had heard every word which had fallen from his lips now when he saluted her she turned her face full upon him and bowed to him then she rose from her seat and made her way between siph dunn and pratt out of the circle the blood had mounted to her face and suffused it all and her whole manner was such that it could escape the observation of none who stood there even mrs harold smith had seen it and had read the story as soon as she was on her feet bernard had dropped emilys hand and offered his arm to his cousin lily he had said out loud you had better let me take you away it is a misfortune that you have been subjected to the insult of such a greeting bernard and crosbie had been early friends and bernard had been the unfortunate means of bringing crosbie and lily together up to this day bernard had never had his revenge for the illtreatment which his cousin had received some morsel of that revenge came to him now lily almost hated her cousin for what he said but she took his arm and walked with him from the room it must be acknowledged in excuse for bernard dale and as an apology for the apparent indiscretion of his words that all the circumstances of the meeting had become apparent to every one there the misfortune of the encounter had become too plain to admit of its being hidden under any of the ordinary veils of society crosbies salutation had been made before the eyes of them all and in the midst of absolute silence and lily had risen with so queenlike a demeanour and had moved with so stately a step that it was impossible that any one concerned should pretend to ignore the facts of the scene that had occurred crosbie was still standing close to mrs harold smith mrs thorne had risen from her seat and the words which bernard dale had uttered were still sounding in the ears of them all shall i see after the carriage said siph dunn do said mrs thorne or stay a moment the carriage will of course be there and we will go together goodmorning mr pratt i expect that at any rate you will send me your card by post then they all passed on and crosbie and fowler pratt were left among the pictures  i think you will agree with me now that you had better give her up said fowler pratt  i will never give her up said crosbie till i shall hear that she has married some one else  you may take my word for it that she will never marry you after what has just now occurred  very likely not but still the attempt even the idea of the attempt will be a comfort to me i shall be endeavouring to do that which i ought to have done  what you have got to think of i should suppose is her comfortnot your own  crosbie stood for a while silent looking at a portrait which was hung just within the doorway of a smaller room into which they had passed as though his attention were entirely riveted by the picture but he was thinking of the picture not at all and did not even know what kind of painting was on the canvas before him  pratt he said at last you are always hard to me  i will say nothing more to you on the subject if you wish me to be silent  i do wish you to be silent about that  that shall be enough said pratt  you do not quite understand me you do not know how thoroughly i have repented of the evil that i have done or how far i would go to make retribution if retribution were possible  fowler pratt having been told to hold his tongue as regarded that subject made no reply to this and began to talk about the pictures  lily leaning on her cousins arm was out in the courtyard in front of the house before mrs thorne or siph dunn it was but for a minute but still there was a minute in which bernard felt that he ought to say a word to her  i hope you are not angry with me lily for having spoken  i wish of course that you had not spoken but i am not angry i have no right to be angry i made the misfortune for myself do not say anything more about it dear bernardthat is all  they had walked to the picturegallery but by agreement two carriages had come to take them awaymrs thornes and mrs harold smiths mrs thorne easily managed to send emily dunstable and bernard away with her friend and to tell siph dunn that he must manage for himself in this way it was contrived that no one but mrs thorne should be with lily dale  my dear said mrs thorne it seemed to me that you were a little put out and so i thought it best to send them all away  it was very kind  he ought to have passed on and not to have stood an instant when he saw you said mrs thorne with indignation there are moments when it is a mans duty simply to vanish to melt into the air or to sink into the groundin which he is bound to overcome the difficulties of such sudden selfremoval or must ever after be accounted poor and mean  i did not want him to vanishif only he had not spoken to me  he should have vanished a man is sometimes bound in honour to do so even when he himself has done nothing wrongwhen the sin has been all with the woman her femininity has still a right to expect that so much shall be done in its behalf but when the sin has been all his own as it was in this caseand such damning sin too  pray do not go on mrs thorne  he ought to go out and hang himself simply for having allowed himself to be seen i thought bernard behaved very well and i shall tell him so  i wish you could manage to forget it all and say no word more about it  i wont trouble you with it my dear i will promise you that but lily i can hardly understand you this man who must have been and must ever be a brute  mrs thorne you promised me this instant that you would not talk of him  after this i will not but you must let me have my way now for one moment i have so often longed to speak to you but have not done so from fear of offending you now the matter has come up by chance and it was impossible that what has occurred should pass by without a word i cannot conceive why the memory of that bad man should be allowed to destroy your whole life  my life is not destroyed my life is anything but destroyed it is a very happy life  but my dear if all that i hear is true there is a most estimable young man whom everybody likes and particularly all your own family and whom you like very much yourself and you will have nothing to say to him though his constancy is like the constancy of an old paladinand all because of this wretch who just now came in your way  mrs thorne it is impossible to explain it all  i do not want you to explain it all of course i would not ask any young woman to marry a man whom she did not love such marriages are abominable to me but i think that a young woman ought to get married if the thing fairly comes in her way and if her friends approve and if she is fond of the man who is fond of her it may be that some memory of what has gone before is allowed to stand in your way and that it should not be so allowed it sometimes happens that a morbid sentiment will destroy a life excuse me then lily if i say too much to you in my hope that you may not suffer after this fashion  i know how kind you are mrs thorne  here we are at home and perhaps you would like to go in i have some calls which i must make then the conversation was ended and lily was alone  as if she had not thought of it all before as if there was anything new in this counsel which mrs thorne had given her she had received the same advice from her mother from her sister from her uncle and from lady julia till she was sick of it how had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private should with her have become the public property of so large a circle any other girl would receive advice on such a subject from her mother alone and there the secret would rest but her secret had been published as it were by the towncrier in the high street everybody knew that she had been jilted by adolphus crosbie and that it was intended that she should be consoled by john eames and people seemed to think that they had a right to rebuke her if she expressed an unwillingness to carry out this intention which the public had so kindly arranged for her  morbid sentiment why should she be accused of morbid sentiment because she was unable to transfer her affections to the man who had been fixed on as her future husband by the large circle of acquaintance who had interested themselves in her affairs there was nothing morbid in either her desires or her regrets so she assured herself with something very like anger at the accusation made against her she had been contented and was contented to live at home as her mother lived asking for no excitement beyond that given by the daily routine of her duties there could be nothing morbid in that she would go back to allington as soon as might be and have done with this london life which only made her wretched this seeing of crosbie had been terrible to her she did not tell herself that his image had been shattered her idea was that all her misery had come from the untowardness of the meeting but there was the fact that she had seen the man and heard his voice and that the seeing him and hearing him had made her miserable she certainly desired that it might never be her lot either to see him or to hear him again  and as for john eamesin those bitter moments of her reflection she almost wished the same in regard to him if he would only cease to be her lover he might be very well but he was not very well to her as long as his pretensions were dinned into her ear by everybody who knew her and then she told herself that john would have had a better chance if he had been content to plead for himself in this i think she was hard upon her lover he had pleaded for himself as well as he knew how and as often as the occasion had been given to him it had hardly been his fault that his case had been taken in hand by other advocates he had given no commission to mrs thorne to plead for him  poor johnny he had stood in much better favour before the lady had presented her compliments to miss l d it was that odious letter and the thoughts which it had forced upon lilys mind which were now most inimical to his interests whether lily loved him or not she did not love him well enough not to be jealous of him had any such letter reached her respecting crosbie in the happy days of her young love she would simply have laughed at it it would have been nothing to her but now she was sore and unhappy and any trifle was powerful enough to irritate her is miss l d engaged to marry mr j e no said lily out loud lily dale is not engaged to marry john eames and never will be so engaged she was almost tempted to sit down and write the required answer to miss m d though the letter had been destroyed she well remembered the number of the postoffice in the edgware road poor john eames  that evening she told emily dunstable that she thought she would like to return to allington before the day that had been appointed for her but why said emily should you be worse than your word  i daresay it will seem silly but the fact is i am homesick im not accustomed to be away from mamma for so long  i hope it is not what occurred today at the picturegallery  i wont deny that it is that in part  that was a strange accident you know that might never occur again  it has occurred twice already emily  i dont call the affair in the park anything anybody may see anybody else in the park of course he was not brought so near you that he could annoy you there you ought certainly to wait till mr eames has come back from italy  then lily declared that she must and would go back to allington on the next monday and she actually did write a letter to her mother that night to say that such was her intention but on the morrow her heart was less sore and the letter was not sent     chapter lx  the end of jael and sisera   illustration  there was to be one more sitting for the picture as the reader will remember and the day for that sitting had arrived conway dalrymple had in the meantime called at mrs van sievers house hoping that he might be able to see clara and make his offer to her there but he had failed in his attempt to reach her he had found it impossible to say all that he had to say in the paintingroom during the very short intervals which mrs broughton left to him a man should be allowed to be alone more than fifteen minutes with a young lady on the occasion in which he offers to her his hand and his heart but hitherto he had never had more than fifteen minutes at his command and then there had been the turban he had also in the meantime called on mrs broughton with the intention of explaining to her that if she really intended to favour his views in respect to miss van siever she ought to give him a little more liberty for expressing himself on this occasion he had seen his friend but had not been able to go as minutely as he had wished into the matter that was so important to himself mrs broughton had found it necessary during this meeting to talk almost exclusively about herself and her own affairs conway she had said directly she saw him i am so glad you have come i think i should have gone mad if i had not seen some one who cares for me this was early in the morning not much after eleven and mrs broughton hearing first his knock at the door and then his voice had met him in the hall and taken him into the diningroom  is anything the matter he asked  oh conway  what is it has anything gone wrong with dobbs  everything has gone wrong with him he is ruined  heaven and earth what do you mean  simply what i say but you must not speak a word of it i do not know it from himself  how do you know it  wait a moment sit down there will youand i will sit by you no conway do not take my hand it is not right thereso yesterday mrs van siever was here i need not tell you all that she said to me even if i could she was very harsh and cruel saying all manner of things about dobbs how can i help it if he drinks i have not encouraged him and as for expensive living i have been as ignorant as a child i have never asked for anything when we were married somebody told me how much we should have to spend it was either two thousand or three thousand or four thousand or something like that you know conway how ignorant i am about moneythat i am like a child is it not true she waited for an answer and dalrymple was obliged to acknowledge that it was true and yet he had known the times in which his dear friend had been very sharp in her memory with reference to a few pounds and now she says that dobbs owes her money which he cannot pay her and that everything must be sold she says that musselboro must have the business and that dobbs must shift for himself elsewhere  do you believe that she has the power to decide that things shall go this way or thatas she pleases  how am i to know she says so and she says it is because he drinks he does drink that at least is true but how can i help it oh conway what am i to do dobbs did not come home at all last night but sent for his thingssaying that he must stay in the city what am i to do if they come and take the house and sell the furniture and turn me out into the street then the poor creature began to cry in earnest and dalrymple had to console her as best he might how i wish i had known you first she said to this dalrymple was able to make no direct answer he was wise enough to know that a direct answer might possibly lead him into terrible trouble he was by no means anxious to find himself protecting mrs dobbs broughton from the ruin which her husband had brought upon her  before he left her she had told him a long story partly of matters of which he had known something before and partly made up of that which she had heard from the old woman it was settled mrs broughton said that mr musselboro was to marry clara van siever but it appeared as far as dalrymple could learn that this was a settlement made simply between mrs van siever and musselboro clara as he thought was not a girl likely to fall into such a settlement without having an opinion of her own musselboro was to have the business and dobbs broughton was to be sold up and then look for employment in the city from her husband the wife had not heard a word on this matter and the above story was simply what had been told to mrs broughton by mrs van siever for myself it seems that there can be but one fate said mrs broughton dalrymple in his tenderest voice asked what that one fate must be never mind said mrs broughton there are some things which one cannot tell even to such a friend as you he was sitting near her and had all but got his arm behind her waist he was however able to be prudent maria he said getting up on his feet if it should really come about that you should want anything you will send to me you will promise me that at any rate she rubbed a tear from her eye and said that she did not know there are moments in which a man must speak plainly said conway dalrymplein which it would be unmanly not to do so however prosaic it may seem i need hardly tell you that my purse shall be yours if you want it but just at that moment she did not want his purse nor must it be supposed that she wanted to run away with him and to leave her husband to fight the battle alone with mrs van siever the truth was that she did not know what she wanted over and beyond an assurance from conway dalrymple that she was the most illused the most interesting and the most beautiful woman ever heard of either in history or romance had he proposed to her to pack up a bundle and go off with him in a cab to the london chatham and dover railway station en route for boulogne i do not for a moment think that she would have packed up her bundle she would have received intense gratification from the offerso much so that she would have been almost consoled for her husbands ruin but she would have scolded her lover and would have explained to him the great iniquity of which he was guilty  it was clear to him that at this present time he could not make any special terms with her as to clara van siever at such a moment as this he could hardly ask her to keep out of the way in order that he might have his opportunity but when he suggested that probably it might be better in the present emergency to give up the idea of any further sitting in her room and proposed to send for his canvas colourbox and easel she told him that as far as she was concerned he was welcome to have that one other sitting for which they had all bargained you had better come tomorrow as we had agreed she said and unless i shall have been turned out into the street by the creditors you may have the room as you did before and you must remember conway that though mrs van says that musselboro is to have clara it doesnt follow that clara should give way when we consider everything we must acknowledge that this was at any rate goodnatured then there was a tender parting with many tears and conway dalrymple escaped from the house  he did not for a moment doubt the truth of the story which mrs broughton had told as far at least as it referred to the ruin of dobbs broughton he had heard something of this before and for some weeks had expected that a crash was coming broughtons rise had been very sudden and dalrymple had never regarded his friend as firmly placed in the commercial world dobbs was one of those men who seem born to surprise the world by a spurt of prosperity and might perhaps have had a second spurt or even a third could he have kept himself from drinking in the morning but dalrymple though he was hardly astonished by the story as it regarded broughton was put out by that part of it which had reference to musselboro he had known that musselboro had been introduced to broughton by mrs van siever but nevertheless he had regarded the man as being no more than broughtons clerk and now he was told that musselboro was to marry clara van siever and have all mrs van sievers money he resolved at last that he would run his risk about the money and take clara either with or without it if she would have him and as for that difficulty in asking her if mrs broughton would give him no opportunity of putting the question behind her back he would put it before her face he had not much leisure for consideration on these points as the next day was the day for the last sitting  on the following morning he found miss van siever already seated in mrs broughtons room when he reached it and at the moment mrs broughton was not there as he took claras hand he could not prevent himself from asking her whether she had heard anything heard what said clara then you have not said he never mind now as mrs broughton is here then mrs broughton had entered the room she seemed to be quite cheerful but dalrymple perfectly understood from a special glance which she gave to him that he was to perceive that her cheerfulness was assumed for claras benefit mrs broughton was showing how great a heroine she could be on behalf of her friends now my dear she said do remember that this is the last day it may be all very well conway and of course you know best but as far as i can see you have not made half as much progress as you ought to have done we shall do excellently well said dalrymple so much the better said mrs broughton and now clara ill place you and so clara was placed on her knees with the turban on her head  dalrymple began his work assiduously knowing that mrs broughton would not leave the room for some minutes it was certain that she would remain for a quarter of an hour and it might be as well that he should really use that time on his picture the peculiar position in which he was placed probably made his work difficult to him there was something perplexing in the necessity which bound him to look upon the young lady before him both as jael and as the future mrs conway dalrymple knowing as he did that she was at present simply clara van siever a double personification was not difficult to him he had encountered it with every model that had sat to him and with every young lady he had attempted to winif he had ever made such an attempt with one before but the triple character joined to the necessity of the double work was distressing to him the hand a little further back if you dont mind he said and the wrist more turned towards me that is just it lean a little more over him therethat will do exactly if mrs broughton did not go very quickly he must begin to address his model on a totally different subject even while she was in the act of slaying sisera  have you made up your mind who is to be sisera asked mrs broughton  i think i shall put in my own face said dalrymple if miss van siever does not object  not in the least said clara speaking without moving her facealmost without moving her lips  that will be excellent said mrs broughton she was still quite cheerful and really laughed as she spoke shall you like the idea clara of striking the nail right through his head  oh yes as well his head as anothers i shall seem to be having my revenge for all the trouble he has given me  there was a slight pause and then dalrymple spoke you have had that already in striking me right through the heart  what a very pretty speech was it not my dear said mrs broughton and then mrs broughton laughed there was something slightly hysterical in her laugh which grated on dalrymples earssomething which seemed to tell him that at the present moment his dear friend was not going to assist him honestly in his effort  only that i should put him out i would get up and make a curtsey said clara no young lady could ever talk of making a curtsey for such a speech if she supposed it to have been made in earnestness and clara no doubt understood that a man might make a hundred such speeches in the presence of a third person without any danger that they would be taken as meaning anything all this dalrymple knew and began to think that he had better put down his palette and brush and do the work which he had before him in the most prosaic language that he could use he could at any rate succeed in making clara acknowledge his intention in this way he waited still for a minute or two and it seemed to him that mrs broughton had no intention of piling her fagots on the present occasion it might be that the remembrance of her husbands ruin prevented her from sacrificing herself in the other direction also  i am not very good at pretty speeches but i am good at telling the truth said dalrymple  ha ha ha laughed mrs broughton still with a touch of hysterical action in her throat upon my word conway you know how to praise yourself  he dispraises himself most unnecessarily in denying the prettiness of his language said clara as she spoke she hardly moved her lips and dalrymple went on painting from the model it was clear that miss van siever understood that the painting and not the pretty speeches was the important business on hand  mrs broughton had now tucked her feet up on the sofa and was gazing at the artist as he stood at his work dalrymple remembering how he had offered her his pursean offer which in the existing crisis of her affairs might mean a great dealfelt that she was illnatured had she intended to do him a good turn she would have gone now but there she lay with her feet tucked up clearly purposing to be present through the whole of that mornings sitting his anger against her added something to his spirit and made him determine that he would carry out his purpose suddenly therefore he prepared himself for action  he was in the habit of working with a turkish cap on his head and with a short apron tied round him there was something picturesque about the cap which might not have been incongruous with lovemaking it is easy to suppose that juan wore a turkish cap when he sat with haidee in lambros island but we may be quite sure that he did not wear an apron now dalrymple had thought of all this and had made up his mind to work today without his apron but when arranging his easel and his brushes he had put it on from force of habit and was now disgusted with himself as he remembered it he put down his brush divested his thumb of his palette then took off his cap and after that untied the apron  conway what are you going to do said mrs broughton  i am going to ask clara van siever to be my wife said dalrymple at that moment the door was opened and mrs van siever entered the room  clara had not risen from her kneeling posture when dalrymple began to put off his trappings she had not seen what he was doing as plainly as mrs broughton had done having her attention naturally drawn towards her sisera and besides this she understood that she was to remain as she was placed till orders to move were given to her dalrymple would occasionally step aside from his easel to look at her in some altered light and on such occasions she would simply hold her hammer somewhat more tightly than before when therefore mrs van siever entered the room clara was still slaying sisera in spite of the artists speech the speech indeed and her mother both seemed to come to her at the same time the old woman stood for a moment holding the open door in her hand you fool she said what are you doing there dressed up in that way like a guy then clara got up from her feet and stood before her mother in jaels dress and jaels turban dalrymple thought that the dress and turban did not become her badly mrs van siever apparently thought otherwise will you have the goodness to tell me miss why you are dressed up after that mad bess of bedlam fashion  the reader will no doubt bear in mind that clara had other words of which to think besides those which were addressed to her by her mother dalrymple had asked her to be his wife in the plainest possible language and she thought that the very plainness of the language became him well the very taking off of his apron almost as he said the words though to himself the action had been so distressing as almost to overcome his purpose had in it something to her of direct simple determination which pleased her when he had spoken of having had a nail driven by her right through his heart she had not been in the least gratified but the taking off of the apron and the putting down of the palette and the downright way in which he had called her clara van sieverattempting to be neither sentimental with clara nor polite with miss van sieverdid please her she had often said to herself that she would never give a plain answer to a man who did not ask her a plain questionto a man who in asking this question did not say plainly to her clara van siever will you become mrs jonesor mrs smith or mrs tomkins as the case might be now conway dalrymple had asked her to become mrs dalrymple very much after this fashion in spite of the apparition of her mother all this had passed through her mind not the less however was she obliged to answer her mother before she could give any reply to the other questioner in the meantime mrs dobbs broughton had untucked her feet  mamma said clara who ever expected to see you here  i daresay nobody did said mrs van siever but here i am nevertheless  madam said mrs dobbs broughton you might at any rate have gone through the ceremony of having yourself announced by the servant  madam said the old woman attempting to mimic the tone of the other i thought that on such a very particular occasion as this i might be allowed to announce myself you tomfool you why dont you take that turban off then clara with slow and graceful motion unwound the turban if dalrymple really meant what he had said and would stick to it she need not mind being called a tomfool by her mother  conway i am afraid that our last sitting is disturbed said mrs broughton with her little laugh  conways last sitting certainly is disturbed said mrs van siever and then she mimicked the laugh and youll all be disturbedi can tell you that what an ass you must be to go on with this kind of thing after what i said to you yesterday do you know that he got beastly drunk in the city last night and that he is drunk now while you are going on with your tomfooleries upon hearing this mrs dobbs broughton fainted into dalrymples arms  hitherto the artist had not said a word and had hardly known what part it would best become him now to play if he intended to marry claraand he certainly did intend to marry her if she would have himit might be as well not to quarrel with mrs van siever at any rate there was nothing in mrs van sievers intrusion disagreeable as it was which need make him take up his sword to do battle with her but now as he held mrs broughton in his arms and as the horrid words which the old woman had spoken rung in his ears he could not refrain himself from uttering reproach you ought not to have told her in this way before other people even if it be true said conway  leave me to be my own judge of what i ought to do if you please sir if she had any feeling at all what i told her yesterday would have kept her from all this but some people have no feeling and will go on being tomfools though the house is on fire as these words were spoken mrs broughton fainted more persistently than everso that dalrymple was convinced that whether she felt or not at any rate she heard he had now dragged her across the room and laid her upon the sofa and clara had come to her assistance i daresay you think me very hard because i speak plainly but there are things much harder than plain speaking how much do you expect to be paid sir for this picture of my girl  i do not expect to be paid for it at all said dalrymple  and who is it to belong to  it belongs to me at present  then sir it mustnt belong to you any longer it wont do for you to have a picture of my girl to hang up in your paintingroom for all your friends to come and make their jokes about nor yet to make a show of it in any of your exhibitions my daughter has been a fool and i cant help it if youll tell me whats the cost ill pay you then ill have the picture home and ill treat it as it deserves  dalrymple thought for a moment about his picture and about mrs van siever what had he better do he wanted to behave well and he felt that the old woman had something of justice on her side madam he said i will not sell this picture but it shall be destroyed if you wish it  i certainly do wish it but i wont trust to you if its not sent to my house at once youll hear from me through my lawyers  then dalrymple deliberately opened his penknife and slit the canvas across through the middle of the picture each way clara as she saw him do it felt that in truth she loved him there mrs van siever he said now you can take the bits home with you in your basket if you wish it at this moment as the rent canvas fell and fluttered upon the stretcher there came a loud voice of lamentation from the sofa a groan of despair and a shriek of wrath very fine indeed said mrs van siever when ladies faint they always ought to have their eyes about them i see that mrs broughton understands that  take her away conwayfor gods sake take her away said mrs broughton  i shall take myself away very shortly said mrs van siever so you neednt trouble mr conway about that not but what i thought the gentlemans name was mr something else  my name is conway dalrymple said the artist  then i suppose you must be her brother or her cousin or something of that sort said mrs van siever  take her away screamed mrs dobbs broughton  wait a moment madam as youve chopped up your handiwork there mr conway dalrymple and as i suppose my daughter has been more to blame than anybody else  she has not been to blame at all said dalrymple  thats my affair and not yours said mrs van siever very sharply but as youve been at all this trouble and have now chopped it up i dont mind paying you for your time and paints only i shall be glad to know how much it will come to  there will be nothing to pay mrs van siever  how long has he been at it clara  mamma indeed you had better not say anything about paying him  i shall say whatever i please miss will ten pounds do it sir  if you choose to buy the picture the price will be seven hundred and fifty said dalrymple with a smile pointing to the fragments  seven hundred and fifty pounds said the old woman  but i strongly advise you not to make the purchase said dalrymple  seven hundred and fifty pounds i certainly shall not give you seven hundred and fifty pounds sir  i certainly think you could invest your money better mrs van siever but if the thing is to be sold at all that is my price ive thought that there was some justice in your demand that it should be destroyedand therefore i have destroyed it  mrs van siever had been standing on the same spot ever since she had entered the room and now she turned round to leave the room  if you have any demand to make i beg that you will send in your account for work done to mr musselboro he is my man of business clara are you ready to come home the cab is waiting at the doorat sixpence the quarter of an hour if you will be pleased to remember  mrs broughton said clara thoughtful of her raiment and remembering that it might not be well that she should return home even in a cab dressed as jael if you will allow me i will go into your room for a minute or two  certainly clara said mrs broughton preparing to accompany her  but before you go mrs broughton said mrs van siever it may be as well that i should tell you that my daughter is going to become the wife of mr musselboro it may simplify matters that you should know this and mrs van siever as she spoke looked hard at conway dalrymple  mamma exclaimed clara  my dear said mrs van siever you had better change your dress and come away with me  not till i have protested against what you have said mamma  you had better leave your protesting alone i can tell you  mrs broughton continued clara i must beg you to understand that mamma has not the slightest right in the world to tell you what she just now said about me nothing on earth would induce me to become the wife of mr broughtons partner  there was something which made clara unwilling even to name the man whom her mother had publicly proposed as her future husband  he isnt mr broughtons partner said mrs van siever mr broughton has not got a partner mr musselboro is the head of the firm and as to your marrying him of course i cant make you  no mamma you cannot  mrs broughton understands that no doubtand so probably does mr dalrymple i only tell them what are my ideas if you choose to marry the sweep at the crossing i cant help it only i dont see what good you would do the sweep when he would have to sweep for himself and you too at any rate i suppose you mean to go home with me now then mrs broughton and clara left the room and mrs van siever was left with conway dalrymple mr dalrymple said mrs van siever do not deceive yourself what i told you just now will certainly come to pass  it seems to me that that must depend on the young lady said dalrymple  ill tell you what certainly will not depend on the young lady said mrs van siever and that is whether the man who marries her will have more with her than the clothes she stands up in you will understand that argument i suppose  im not quite sure that i do said dalrymple  then youd better try to understand it goodmorning sir im sorry youve had to slit your picture then she curtseyed low and walked out on to the landingplace clara she cried im waiting for yousixpence a quarter of an hourremember that in a minute or two clara came out to her and then mrs van siever and miss van siever took their departure  oh conway what am i to do what am i to do said mrs dobbs broughton dalrymple stood perplexed for a few minutes and could not tell her what she was to do she was in such a position that it was very hard to tell her what to do do you believe conway that he is really ruined  what am i to say how am i to know  i see that you believe it said the wretched woman  i cannot but believe that there is something of truth in what this woman says why else should she come here with such a story then there was a pause during which mrs broughton was burying her face on the arm of the sofa ill tell you what ill do continued he ill go into the city and make inquiry it can hardly be but what i shall learn the truth there  then there was another pause at the end of which mrs broughton got up from the sofa  tell me said shewhat do you mean to do about that girl  you heard me ask her to be my wife  i did i did  is it not what you intended  do not ask me my mind is bewildered my brain is on fire oh conway  shall i go into the city as i proposed said dalrymple who felt that he might at any rate improve the position of circumstances by leaving the house  yesyes go into the city go anywhere go but stay oh conway there was a sudden change in her voice as she spoke harkthere he is as sure as life then conway listened and heard a footstep on the stairs as to which he had then but little doubt that it was the footstep of dobbs broughton o heavens he is tipsy exclaimed mrs broughton and what shall we do then dalrymple took her hand and pressed it and left the room so that he might meet the husband on the stairs in the one moment that he had for reflection he thought it was better that there should be no concealment     chapter lxi  its dogged as does it   in accordance with the resolution to which the clerical commission had come on the first day of their sitting dr tempest wrote the following letter to mr crawley      rectory silverbridge april 9 186     dear sir     i have been given to understand that you have been    informed that the bishop of barchester has appointed a    commission of clergymen of the diocese to make inquiry    respecting certain accusations which to the great regret    of us all have been made against you in respect to a    cheque for twenty pounds which was passed by you to a    tradesman in this town the clergymen appointed to form    this commission are mr oriel the rector of greshamsbury    mr robarts the vicar of framley mr quiverful the    warden of hirams hospital at barchester mr thumble a    clergyman established in that city and myself we held    our first meeting on last monday and i now write to you    in compliance with a resolution to which we then came    before taking any other steps we thought it best to ask    you to attend us here on next monday at two oclock and    i beg that you will accept this letter as an invitation to    that effect     we are of course aware that you are about to stand your    trial at the next assizes for the offence in question i    beg you to understand that i do not express any opinion as    to your guilt but i think it right to point out to you    that in the event of a jury finding an adverse verdict    the bishop might be placed in great difficulty unless he    were fortified with the opinion of a commission formed    from your fellow clerical labourers in the diocese should    such adverse verdict unfortunately be given the bishop    would hardly be justified in allowing a clergyman placed    as you then would be placed to return to his cure after    the expiration of such punishment as the judge might    award without a further decision from an ecclesiastical    court this decision he could only obtain by proceeding    against you under the act in reference to clerical    offences which empowers him as bishop of the diocese to    bring you before the court of archesunless you would    think well to submit yourself entirely to his judgment    you will i think understand what i mean the judge at    assizes might find it his duty to imprison a clergyman    for a monthregarding that clergyman simply as he would    regard any other person found guilty by a jury and thus    made subject to his judgmentand might do this for an    offence which the ecclesiastical judge would find himself    obliged to visit with the severer sentence of prolonged    suspension or even with deprivation     we are however clearly of opinion that should the jury    find themselves able to acquit you no further action    whatsoever should be taken in such case we think that the    bishop may regard your innocence to be fully established    and in such case we shall recommend his lordship to look    upon the matter as altogether at an end i can assure you    that in such case i shall so regard it myself     you will perceive that as a consequence of this    resolution to which we have already come we are    not minded to make any inquiries ourselves into the    circumstances of your alleged guilt till the verdict of    the jury shall be given if you are acquitted our course    will be clear but should you be convicted we must in    that case advise the bishop to take the proceedings to    which i have alluded or to abstain from taking them we    wish to ask you whether now that our opinion has been    conveyed to you you will be willing to submit to the    bishops decision in the event of an adverse verdict    being given by the jury and we think that it will be    better for us all that you should meet us here at the hour    i have named on monday next the 15th instant it is not    our intention to make any report to the bishop until the    trial shall be over     i have the honour to be    my dear sir    your very obedient servant     mortimer tempest     the rev josiah crawley    hogglestock   in the same envelope dr tempest sent a short private note in which he said that he should be very happy to see mr crawley at halfpast one on the monday named that luncheon would be ready at that hour and that as mr crawleys attendance was required on public grounds he would take care that a carriage was provided for the day  mr crawley received this letter in his wifes presence and read it in silence mrs crawley saw that he paid close attention to it and was sureshe felt that she was surethat it referred in some way to the terrible subject of the cheque for twenty pounds indeed everything that came into the house almost every word spoken there and every thought that came into the breasts of any of the family had more or less reference to the coming trial how could it be otherwise there was ruin coming on them allruin and complete disgrace coming on father mother and children to have been accused itself was very bad but now it seemed to be the opinion of every one that the verdict must be against the man mrs crawley herself who was perfectly sure of her husbands innocence before god believed that the jury would find him guiltyand believed also that he had become possessed of the money in some manner that would have been dishonest had he not been so different from other people as to be entitled to be considered innocent where another man would have been plainly guilty she was full of the cheque for twenty pounds and of its results when therefore he had read the letter through a second time and even then had spoken no word about it of course she could not refrain from questioning him my love she said what is the letter  it is on business he answered  she was silent for a moment before she spoke again may i not know the business  no said he not at present  is it from the bishop  have i not answered you have i not given you to understand that for a while at least i would prefer to keep the contents of this epistle to myself then he looked at her very sternly and afterwards turned his eyes upon the fireplace and gazed at the fire as though he were striving to read there something of his future fate she did not much regard the severity of his speech that too like the taking of the cheque itself was to be forgiven him because he was different from other men his black mood had come upon him and everything was to be forgiven him now he was as a child when cutting his teeth let the poor wayward sufferer be ever so petulant the mother simply pities and loves him and is never angry i beg your pardon josiah she said but i thought it would comfort you to speak to me about it  it will not comfort me he said nothing comforts me nothing can comfort me jane give me my hat and my stick his daughter brought to him his hat and stick and without another word he went out and left them  as a matter of course he turned his steps towards hoggle end when he desired to be long absent from the house he always went among the brickmakers his wife as she stood at the window and watched the direction in which he went knew that he might be away for hours the only friends out of his own family with whom he ever spoke freely were some of these rough parishioners but he was not thinking of the brickmakers when he started he was simply desirous of again reading dr tempests letter and of considering it in some spot where no eye could see him he walked away with long steps regarding nothingneither the ruts in the dirty lane nor the young primroses which were fast showing themselves on the banks nor the gathering clouds which might have told him of the coming rain he went on for a couple of miles till he had nearly reached the outskirts of the colony of hoggle end and then he sat himself down upon a gate he had not been there a minute before a few slow large drops began to fall but he was altogether too much wrapped up in his thoughts to regard the rain what answer should he make to this letter from the man at silverbridge  the position of his own mind in reference to his own guilt or his own innocence was very singular it was simply the truth that he did not know how the cheque had come to him he did know that he had blundered about it most egregiously especially when he had averred that this cheque for twenty pounds had been identical with a cheque for another sum which had been given to him by mr soames he had blundered since in saying that the dean had given it to him there could be no doubt as to this for the dean had denied that he had done so and he had come to think it very possible that he had indeed picked the cheque up and had afterwards used it having deposited it by some strange accidentnot knowing then what he was doing or what was the nature of the bit of paper in his handwith the notes which he had accepted from the dean with so much reluctance with such an agony of spirit in all these thoughts of his own about his own doings and his own position he almost admitted to himself his own insanity his inability to manage his own affairs with that degree of rational sequence which is taken for granted as belonging to a man when he is made subject to criminal laws as he puzzled his brain in his efforts to create a memory as to the cheque and succeeded in bringing to his mind a recollection that he had once known something about the chequethat the cheque had at one time been the subject of a thought and of a resolutionhe admitted to himself that in accordance with all law and all reason he must be regarded as a thief he had taken and used and spent that which he ought to have known was not his ownwhich he would have known not to be his own but for some terrible incapacity with which god had afflicted him what then must be the result his mind was clear enough about this if the jury could see everything and know everythingas he would wish that they should do and if this bishops commission and the bishop himself and the court of arches with its judge could see and know everything and if so seeing and so knowing they could act with clear honesty and perfect wisdomwhat would they do they would declare of him that he was not a thief only because he was so muddyminded so addlepated as not to know the difference between meum and tuum there could be no other end to it let all the lawyers and all the clergymen in england put their wits to it though he knew himself to be muddyminded and addlepated he could see that and could any one say of such a man that he was fit to be the acting clergyman of a parishto have a freehold possession in a parish as curer of mens souls the bishop was in the right of it let him be ten times as mean a fellow as he was  and yet as he sat there on the gate while the rain came down heavily upon him even when admitting the justice of the bishop and the truth of the verdict which the jury would no doubt give and the propriety of the action which that cold reasonable prosperous man at silverbridge would take he pitied himself with a tenderness of commiseration which knew no bounds as for those belonging to him his wife and children his pity for them was of a different kind he would have suffered any increase of suffering could he by such agony have released them dearly as he loved them he would have severed himself from them had it been possible terrible thoughts as to their fate had come into his mind in the worst moments of his moodinessthoughts which he had had sufficient strength and manliness to put away from him with a strong hand lest they should drive him to crime indeed and these had come from the great pity which he had felt for them but the commiseration which he had felt for himself had been different from this and had mostly visited him at times when that other pity was for the moment in abeyance what though he had taken the cheque and spent the money though it was not his he might be guilty before the law but he was not guilty before god there had never been a thought of theft in his mind or a desire to steal in his heart he knew that well enough no jury could make him guilty of theft before god and what though this mixture of guilt and innocence had come from madnessfrom madness which these courts must recognize if they chose to find him innocent of the crime in spite of his aberrations of intellect if there were any such his ministrations in his parish were good had he not preached fervently and wellpreaching the true gospel had he not been very diligent among his people striving with all his might to lessen the ignorance of the ignorant and to gild with godliness the learning of the instructed had he not been patient enduring instant and in all things amenable to the laws and regulations laid down by the church for his guidance in his duties as a parish clergyman who could point out in what he had been astray or where he had gone amiss but for the work which he had done with so much zeal the church which he served had paid him so miserable a pittance that though life and soul had been kept together the reason or a fragment of the reason had at moments escaped from his keeping in the scramble hence it was that this terrible calamity had fallen upon him who had been tried as he had been tried and had gone through such fire with less loss of intellectual power than he had done he was still a scholar though no brother scholar ever came near him and would make greek iambics as he walked along the lanes his memory was stored with poetry though no book ever came to his hands except those shorn and tattered volumes which lay upon his table old problems in trigonometry were the pleasing relaxations of his mind and complications of figures were a delight to him there was not one of those prosperous clergymen around him and who scorned him whom he could not have instructed in hebrew it was always a gratification to him to remember that his old friend the dean was weak in his hebrew he with these acquirements with these fitnesses had been thrust down to the groundto the very graniteand because in that harsh heartless thrusting his intellect had for moments wavered as to common things cleaving still to all its grander nobler possessions he was now to be rent in pieces and scattered to the winds as being altogether vile worthless and worse than worthless it was thus that he thought of himself pitying himself as he sat upon the gate while the rain fell ruthlessly on his shoulders  he pitied himself with a commiseration that was sickly in spite of its truth it was the fault of the man that he was imbued too strongly with selfconsciousness he could do a great thing or two he could keep up his courage in positions which would wash all courage out of most men he could tell the truth though truth should ruin him he could sacrifice all that he had to duty he could do justice though the heaven should fall but he could not forget to pay a tribute to himself for the greatness of his own actions nor when accepting with an effort of meekness the small payment made by the world to him in return for his great works could he forget the great payments made to others for small work it was not sufficient for him to remember that he knew hebrew but he must remember also that the dean did not  nevertheless as he sat there under the rain he made up his mind with a clearness that certainly had in it nothing of that muddiness of mind of which he had often accused himself indeed the intellect of this man was essentially clear it was simply his memory that would play him trickshis memory as to things which at the moment were not important to him the fact that the dean had given him money was very important and he remembered it well but the amount of the money and its form at a moment in which he had flattered himself that he might have strength to leave it unused had not been important to him now he resolved that he would go to dr tempest and that he would tell dr tempest that there was no occasion for any further inquiry he would submit to the bishop let the bishops decision be what it might things were different since the day on which he had refused mr thumble admission to his pulpit at that time people believed him to be innocent and he so believed of himself now people believed him to be guilty and it could not be right that a man held in such slight esteem should exercise the functions of a parish priest let his own opinion of himself be what it might he would submit himself and go anywhereto the galleys or the workhouse if they wished it as for his wife and children they would he said to himself be better without him than with him the world would never be so hard to a woman or to children as it had been to him  he was sitting saturated with rainsaturated also with thinkingand quite unobservant of anything around him when he was accosted by an old man from hoggle end with whom he was well acquainted thee be wat master crawley said the old man  wet said crawley recalled suddenly back to the realities of life wellyes i am wet thats because its raining  thee be teeming o wat hadnt thee better go whome  and are not you wet also said mr crawley looking at the old man who had been at work in the brickfield and who was soaked with mire and from whom there seemed to come a steam of muddy mist  is it me yer reverence im wat in course the loikes of us is always watthat is barring the insides of us it comes to us natural to have the rheumatics how is one of us to help hisself against having on em but there aint no call for the loikes of you to have the rheumatics  my friend said crawley who was now standing on the roadand as he spoke he put out his arm and took the brickmaker by the hand there is a worse complaint than rheumatismthere is indeed  theres what they calls the collerer said giles hoggett looking up into mr crawleys face that aint a got a hold of yer  ay and worse than the cholera a man is killed all over when he is struck in his prideand yet he lives  maybe thats bad enough too said giles with his hand still held by the other  it is bad enough said mr crawley striking his breast with his left hand it is bad enough  tell ee what master crawleyand yer reverence mustnt think as i means to be preaching there aint nowt a man cant bear if hell only be dogged you go whome master crawley and think o that and maybe itll do ye a good yet its dogged as does it it aint thinking about it then giles hoggett withdrew his hand from the clergymans and walked away towards his home at hoggle end mr crawley also turned homewards and as he made his way through the lanes he repeated to himself giles hoggetts words its dogged as does it its not thinking about it  illustration its dogged as does it  he did not say a word to his wife on that afternoon about dr tempest and she was so much taken up with his outward condition when he returned as almost to have forgotten the letter he allowed himself but barely allowed himself to be made dry and then for the remainder of the day applied himself to learn the lesson which hoggett had endeavoured to teach him but the learning of it was not easy and hardly became more easy when he had worked the problem out in his own mind and discovered that the brickmakers doggedness simply meant selfabnegationthat a man should force himself to endure anything that might be sent upon him not only without outward grumbling but also without grumbling inwardly  early on the next morning he told his wife that he was going into silverbridge it is that letterthe letter which i got yesterday that calls me he said and then he handed her the letter as to which he had refused to speak to her on the preceding day  but this speaks of your going next monday josiah said mrs crawley  i find it to be more suitable that i should go today said he some duty i do owe in this matter both to the bishop and to dr tempest who after a fashion is as regards my present business the bishops representative but i do not perceive that i owe it as a duty to either to obey implicitly their injunctions and i will not submit myself to the crossquestionings of the man thumble as i am purposed at present i shall express my willingness to give up the parish  give up the parish altogether  yes altogether as he spoke he clasped both his hands together and having held them for a moment on high allowed them to fall thus clasped before him i cannot give it up in part i cannot abandon the duties and reserve the honorarium nor would i if i could  i did not mean that josiah but pray think of it before you speak  i have thought of it and i will think of it farewell my dear then he came up to her and kissed her and started on his journey on foot to silverbridge  it was about noon when he reached silverbridge and he was told that doctor tempest was at home the servant asked him for a card i have no card said mr crawley but i will write my name for your behoof if your masters hospitality will allow me paper and pencil the name was written and as crawley waited in the drawingroom he spent his time in hating dr tempest because the door had been opened by a manservant dressed in black had the man been in livery he would have hated dr tempest all the same and he would have hated him a little had the door been opened even by a smart maid  your letter came to hand yesterday morning dr tempest said mr crawley still standing though the doctor had pointed to a chair for him after shaking hands with him and having given yesterday to the consideration of it with what judgment i have been able to exercise i have felt it to be incumbent upon me to wait upon you without further delay as by doing so i may perhaps assist your views and save labour to those gentlemen who are joined with you in this commission of which you have spoken to some of them it may possibly be troublesome that they should be brought together here on next monday  dr tempest had been looking at him during this speech and could see by his shoes and trowsers that he had walked from hogglestock to silverbridge mr crawley will you not sit down said he and then he rang his bell mr crawley sat down not on the chair indicated but on one further removed and at the other side of the table when the servant camethe objectionable butler in black clothes that were so much smarter than mr crawleys ownhis masters orders were communicated without any audible word and the man returned with a decanter and wineglasses  after your walk mr crawley said dr tempest getting up from his seat to pour out the wine  none i thank you  pray let me persuade you i know the length of the miles so well  i will take none if you please sir said mr crawley  now mr crawley said dr tempest do let me speak to you as a friend you have walked eight miles and are going to talk to me on a subject which is of vital importance to yourself i wont discuss it unless youll take a glass of wine and a biscuit  dr tempest  im quite in earnest i wont if you do as i ask you you shall talk to me till dinnertime if you like it there now you may begin  mr crawley did eat the biscuit and did drink the wine and as he did so he acknowledged to himself that dr tempest was right he felt that the wine made him stronger to speak i hardly know why you have preferred today to next monday said dr tempest but if anything can be done by your presence here today your time shall not be thrown away  i have preferred today to monday said crawley partly because i would sooner talk to one man than to five  there is something in that certainly said dr tempest  and as i have made up my mind as to the course of action which it is my duty to take in the matter to which your letter of the 9th of this month refers there can be no reason why i should postpone the declaration of my purpose dr tempest i have determined to resign my preferment at hogglestock and shall write today to the dean of barchester who is the patron acquainting him of my purpose  you mean in the eventin the event  i mean sir to do this without reference to any event that is future the bishop dr tempest when i shall have been proved to be a thief shall have no trouble either in causing my suspension or my deprivation the name and fame of a parish clergyman should be unstained mine have become foul with infamy i will not wait to be deprived by any court by any bishop or by any commission i will bow my head to that public opinion which has reached me and i will deprive myself  he had got up from his chair and was standing as he pronounced the final sentence against himself dr tempest still remained seated in his chair looking at him and for a few moments there was silence you must not do that mr crawley dr tempest said at last  but i shall do it  then the dean must not take your resignation speaking to you frankly i tell you that there is no prevailing opinion as to the verdict which the jury may give  my decision has nothing to do with the jurys verdict my decision  stop a moment mr crawley it is possible that you might say that which should not be said  there is nothing to be saidnothing which i could say which i would not say at the town cross if it were possible as to this money i do not know whether i stole it or whether i did not  that is just what i have thought  it is so  then you did not steal it there can be no doubt about that  thank you dr tempest i thank you heartily for saying so much but sir you are not the jury nor if you were could you whitewash me from the infamy which has been cast on me against the opinion expressed at the beginning of these proceedings by the bishop of the dioceseor rather against that expressed by his wifei did venture to make a stand neither the opinion which came from the palace nor the vehicle by which it was expressed commanded my respect since that others have spoken to whom i feel myself bound to yieldyourself not the least among them dr tempestand to them i shall yield you may tell the bishop of barchester that i shall at once resign the perpetual curacy of hogglestock into the hands of the dean of barchester by whom i was appointed  no mr crawley i shall not do that i cannot control you but thinking you to be wrong i shall not make that communication to the bishop  then i shall do so myself  and your wife mr crawley and your children  at that moment mr crawley called to mind the advice of his friend giles hoggett its dogged as does it he certainly wanted something very strong to sustain him in his difficulty he found that this reference to his wife and children required him to be dogged in a very marked manner i can only trust that the wind may be tempered to them he said they will indeed be shorn lambs  dr tempest got up from his chair and took a couple of turns about the room before he spoke again man he said addressing mr crawley with all his energy if you do this thing you will then at least be very wicked if the jury find a verdict in your favour you are safe and the chances are that the verdict will be in your favour  i care nothing now for the verdict said mr crawley  and you will turn your wife into the poorhouse for an idea  its dogged as does it said mr crawley to himself i have thought of that he said aloud that my wife is dear to me and that my children are dear i will not deny she was softly nurtured dr tempest and came from a house in which want was never known since she has shared my board she has had some experience of that nature that i should have brought her to all this is very terrible to meso terrible that i often wonder how it is that i live but sir you will agree with me that my duty as a clergyman is above everything i do not dare even for their sake to remain in the parish good morning dr tempest dr tempest finding that he could not prevail with him bade him adieu feeling that any service to the crawleys within his power might be best done by intercession with the bishop and with the dean  then mr crawley walked back to hogglestock repeating to himself giles hoggetts words its dogged as does it     chapter lxii  mr crawleys letter to the dean   illustration  mr crawley when he got home after his walk to silverbridge denied that he was at all tired the man at silverbridge whom i went to see administered refreshment to menay he administered it with salutary violence he said affecting even to laugh and i am bound to speak well of him on behalf of mercies over and beyond that exhibited by the persistent tender of some wine that i should find him judicious i had expected what little i have known of him taught me so to think of him but i found with him also a softness of heart for which i had not looked  and you will not give up the living josiah  most certainly i will a duty when it is clear before a man should never be made less so by any tenderness in others he was still thinking of giles hoggett its dogged as does it the poor woman could not answer him she knew well that it was vain to argue with him she could only hope that in the event of his being acquitted at the trial the dean whose friendship she did not doubt might reendow him with the small benefice which was their only source of bread  on the following morning there came by post a short note from dr tempest my dear mr crawley the note ran      i implore you if there be yet time to do nothing rashly    and even although you should have written to the bishop or    to the dean your letters need have no effect if you will    allow me to make them inoperative permit me to say that    i am a man much older than you and one who has mixed much    both with clergymen and with the world at large i tell    you with absolute confidence that it is not your duty in    your present position to give up your living should your    conduct ever be called in question on this matter you will    be at perfect liberty to say that you were guided by my    advice you should take no step till after the trial    then if the verdict be against you you should submit to    the bishops judgment if the verdict be in your favour    the bishops interference will be over     and you must remember that if it is not your duty as a    clergyman to give up your living you can have no right    seeing that you have a wife and family to throw it away    as an indulgence to your pride consult any other friend    you pleasemr robarts or the dean himself i am    quite sure that any friend who knows as many of the    circumstances as i know will advise you to hold the    living at any rate till after the trial you can refer    any such friend to me     believe me to be yours very truly     mortimer tempest   mr crawley walked about again with this letter in his pocket but on this occasion he did not go in the direction of hoggle end from hoggle end he could hardly hope to pick up further lessons of wisdom what could any giles hoggett say to him beyond what he had said to him already if he were to read the doctors letter to hoggett and to succeed in making hoggett understand it all hoggett could only caution him to be dogged but it seemed to him that hoggett and his new friend at silverbridge did not agree in their doctrines and it might be well that he should endeavour to find out which of them had most of justice on his side he was quite sure that hoggett would advise him to adhere to his project of giving up the livingif only hoggett could be made to understand the circumstances  he had written but had not as yet sent away his letter to the dean  his letter to the bishop would be but a note and he had postponed the writing of that till the other should be copied and made complete  he had sat up late into the night composing and altering his letter to his old friend and now that the composition was finished he was loth to throw it away early in this morning before the postman had brought to him dr tempests urgent remonstrance he had shown to his wife the draught of his letter to the dean i cannot say that it is not true she had said  it is certainly true  but i wish dear you would not send it why should you take any step till the trial be over  i shall assuredly send it he had replied if you will peruse it again you will see that the epistle would be futile were it kept till i shall have been proved to be a thief  oh josiah such words kill me  they are not pleasant but it will be well that you should become used to them as for the letter i have taken some trouble to express myself with perspicuity and i trust that i may have succeeded at that time hoggett was altogether in the ascendant but now as he started on his walk his mind was somewhat perturbed by the contrary advice of one who after all might be as wise as hoggett there would be nothing dogged in the conduct recommended to him by dr tempest were he to follow the doctors advice he would be trimming his sails so as to catch any slant of a breeze that might be favourable to him there could be no doggedness in a character that would submit to such trimming  the postman came to hogglestock but once in a day so that he could not despatch his letter till the next morningunless indeed he chose to send it a distance of four miles to the nearest postoffice as there was nothing to justify this there was another night for the copying of his lettershould he at last determine to send it he had declared to dr tempest that he would send it he had sworn to his wife that it should go he had taken much trouble with it he believed in hoggett but nevertheless this incumbency of hogglestock was his all in the world it might be that he could still hold it and have bread at least for his wife to eat dr tempest had told him that he would be probably acquitted dr tempest knew as much of all the circumstances as did he himself and had told him that he was not guilty after all dr tempest knew more about it than hoggett knew  if he resigned the living what would become of himof himof him and of his wife whither would they first go when they turned their back upon the door inside which there had at any rate been shelter for them for many years he calculated everything that he had and found that at the end of april even when he should have received his rentcharge there would not be five pounds in hand among them as for his furniture he still owed enough to make it impossible that he should get anything out of that and these thoughts all had reference to his position if he should be acquitted what would become of his wife if he should be convicted and as for himself whither should he go when he came out of prison  he had completely realized the idea that hoggetts counsel was opposed to that given to him by dr tempest but then it might certainly be the case that hoggett had not known all the facts a man should no doubt be dogged when the evils of life are insuperable but need he be so when the evils can be overcome would not hoggett himself undergo any treatment which he believed to be specific for rheumatism yes hoggett would undergo any treatment that was not in itself opposed to his duty the best treatment for rheumatism might be to stay away from the brickfield on a rainy day but if so there would be no money to keep the pot boiling and hoggett would certainly go to the brickfield rheumatism and all as long as his limbs would carry him there yes he would send his letter it was his duty and he would do it men looked askance at him and pointed at him as a thief he would send the letter in spite of dr tempest let justice be done though the heaven may fall  he had heard of lady luftons offer to his wife the offers of the lady luftons of the world had been sorely distressing to his spirit since it had first come to pass that such offers had reached him in consequence of his poverty but now there was something almost of relief to him in the thought that the lady luftons would after some fashion save his wife and children from starvationwould save his wife from the poorhouse and enable his children to have a start in the world for one of his children a brilliant marriage might be providedif only he himself were out of the way how could he take himself out of the way it had been whispered to him that he might be imprisoned for two monthsor for two years would it not be a grand thing if the judge would condemn him to be imprisoned for life was there ever a man whose existence was so purposeless so useless so deleterious as his own and yet he knew hebrew well whereas the dean knew but very little hebrew he could make greek iambics and doubted whether the bishop knew the difference between an iambus and a trochee he could disport himself with trigonometry feeling confident that dr tempest had forgotten his way over the asses bridge he knew lycidas by heart and as for thumble he felt quite sure that thumble was incompetent of understanding a single allusion in that divine poem nevertheless though all this wealth of acquirement was his it would be better for himself better for those who belonged to him better for the world at large that he should be put an end to a sentence of penal servitude for life without any trial would be of all things the most desirable then there would be ample room for the practice of that virtue which hoggett had taught him  when he returned home the hoggethan doctrine prevailed and he prepared to copy his letter but before he commenced his task he sat down with his youngest daughter and reador made her read to hima passage out of a greek poem in which are described the troubles and agonies of a blind giant no giant would have been more powerfulonly that he was blind and could not see to avenge himself on those who had injured him the same story is always coming up he said stopping the girl in her reading we have it in various versions because it is so true to life     ask for this great deliverer now and find him    eyeless in gaza at the mill with slaves  it is the same story great power reduced to impotence great glory to misery by the hand of fatenecessity as the greeks called her the goddess that will not be shunned at the mill with slaves people when they read it do not appreciate the horror of the picture go on my dear it may be a question whether polyphemus had mind enough to suffer but from the description of his power i should think that he had at the mill with slaves can any picture be more dreadful than that go on my dear of course you remember miltons samson agonistes agonistes indeed his wife was sitting stitching at the other side of the room but she heard his wordsheard and understood them and before jane could again get herself into the swing of the greek verse she was over at her husbands side with her arms round his neck my love she said my love  he turned to her and smiled as he spoke to her these are old thoughts with me polyphemus and belisarius and samson and milton have always been pets of mine the mind of the strong blind creature must be so sensible of the injury that has been done to him the impotency combined with his strength or rather the impotency with the memory of former strength and former aspirations is so essentially tragic  she looked into his eyes as he spoke and there was something of the flash of old days when the world was young to them and when he would tell her of his hopes and repeat to her long passages of poetry and would criticize for her advantage the works of old writers thank god she said that you are not blind it may yet be all right with you  yesit may be he said  and you shall not be at the mill with slaves  or at any rate not eyeless in gaza if the lord is good to me come jane we will go on then he took up the passage himself and read it on with clear sonorous voice every now and then explaining some passage or expressing his own ideas upon it as though he were really happy with his poetry  it was late in the evening before he got out his small stock of best letterpaper and sat down to work at his letter he first addressed himself to the bishop and what he wrote to the bishop was as follows      hogglestock parsonage april llth 186     my lord bishop     i have been in communication with dr tempest of    silverbridge from whom i have learned that your lordship    has been pleased to appoint a commission of inquiryof    which commission he is the chairmanwith reference to    the proceedings which it may be necessary that you should    take as bishop of this diocese after my forthcoming    trial at the approaching barchester assizes my lord i    think it right to inform you partly with a view to the    comfort of the gentlemen named on that commission and    partly with the purport of giving you that information    which i think that a bishop should possess in regard to    the clerical affairs of his own diocese that i have by    this post resigned my preferment at hogglestock into the    hands of the dean of barchester by whom it was given    to me in these circumstances it will i suppose be    unnecessary for you to continue the commission which you    have set in force but as to that your lordship will of    course be the only judge     i have the honour to be my lord bishop    your most obedient and very humble servant     josiah crawley    perpetual curate of hogglestock     the right reverend    the bishop of barchester    c c c    the palace barchester   but the letter which was of real importancewhich was intended to say somethingwas that to the dean and that also shall be given to the reader mr crawley had been for a while in doubt how he should address his old friend in commencing this letter understanding that its tone throughout must in a great degree be made conformable with its first words he would fain in his pride have begun sir the question was between that and my dear arabin it had once between them always been dear frank and dear joe but the occasions for dear frank and dear joe between them had long been past crawley would have been very angry had he now been called joe by the dean and would have bitten his tongue out before he would have called the dean frank his better nature however now prevailed and he began his letter and completed it as follows      my dear arabin     circumstances of which you have probably heard something    compel me to write to you as i fear at some length i am    sorry that the trouble of such a letter should be forced    upon you during your holidays  mr crawley as he wrote this did not forget to remind himself that he never had any holidays     but i think you will admit if you will bear with me to    the end that i have no alternative     i have been accused of stealing a cheque for twenty    pounds which cheque was drawn by my lord lufton on his    london bankers and was lost out of his pocket by mr    soames his lordships agent and was so lost as mr    soames statesnot with an absolute assertionduring a    visit which he made to my parsonage here at hogglestock    of the fact that i paid the cheque to a tradesman in    silverbridge there is no doubt when questioned about it    i first gave an answer which was so manifestly incorrect    that it has seemed odd to me that i should not have had    credit for a mistake from those who must have seen that    detection was so evident the blunder was undoubtedly    stupid and it now bears heavy on me i then as i have    learned made another errorof which i am aware that you    have been informed i said that the cheque had come to me    from you and in saying so i thought that it had formed    a portion of that alms which your openhanded benevolence    bestowed upon me when i attended on you not long before    your departure in your library i have striven to    remember the facts it may benay it probably is the    casethat such struggles to catch some accurate glimpse    of bygone things do not trouble you your mind is no    doubt clearer and stronger than mine having been kept    to its proper tune by greater and fitter work with me    memory is all but gone and the power of thinking is on    the wane i struggled to remember and i thought that    the cheque had been in the envelope which you handed to    meand i said so i have since learned from tidings    received as i am told direct from yourself that i was    as wrong in the second statement as i had been in the    first the double blunder has of course been very heavy    on me     i was taken before the magistrates at silverbridge and    was by them committed to stand my trial at the assizes to    be holden in barchester on the 28th of this month without    doubt the magistrates had no alternative but to commit    me and i am indebted to them that they have allowed me my    present liberty upon bail that my sufferings in all this    should have been grievous you will understand but on    that head i should not touch were it not that i am bound    to explain to you that my troubles in reference to this    parish of hogglestock to which i was appointed by you    have not been the slightest of those sufferings i felt at    first believing then that the world around me would think    it unlikely that such a one as i had wilfully stolen a sum    of money that it was my duty to maintain myself in my    church i did so maintain myself against an attack made    upon me by the bishop who sent over to hogglestock one    mr thumble a gentleman doubtless in holy orders though    i know nothing and can learn nothing of the place of his    cure to dispossess me of my pulpit and to remove me from    my ministrations among my people to mr thumble i turned    a deaf ear and would not let him so much as open his    mouth inside the porch of my church up to this time i    myself have read the services and have preached to the    people and have continued as best i could my visits to    the poor and my labours in the school though i knowno    one knows as wellhow unfitted i am for such work by the    grief which has fallen upon me     then the bishop sent for me and i thought it becoming on    my part to go to him i presented myself to his lordship    at his palace and was minded to be much governed in my    conduct by what he might say to me remembering that i am    bound to respect the office even though i may not approve    the man and i humbled myself before his lordship waiting    patiently for any directions which he in his discretion    might think it proper to bestow on me but there arose up    between us that very pestilent woman his wifeto his    dismay seemingly as much as to mineand she would    let there be place for no speech but her own if there    be aught clear to me in ecclesiastical matters it is    thisthat no authority can be delegated to a female the    special laws of this and of some other countries do allow    that women shall sit upon the temporal thrones of the    earth but on the lowest step of the throne of the church    no woman has been allowed to sit as bearing authority    the romantic tale of the woman pope notwithstanding    thereupon i left the palace in wrath feeling myself    aggrieved that a woman should have attempted to dictate    to me and finding it hopeless to get a clear instruction    from his lordshipthe woman taking up the word whenever    i put a question to my lord the bishop nothing    therefore came of that interview but fruitless labour to    myself and anger of which i have since been ashamed     since that time i have continued in my parishworking    not without zeal though in truth almost without    hopeand learning even from day to day that the opinions    of men around me have declared me to be guilty of the    crime imputed to me and now the bishop has issued a    commission as preparatory to proceeding against me under    the act for the punishment of clerical offences in doing    this i cannot say that the bishop has been illadvised    even though the advice may have come from that    eviltongued lady his wife and i hold that a woman may    be called on for advice with most salutary effect in    affairs as to which any show of female authority would be    equally false and pernicious with me it has ever been so    and i have had a counsellor by me as wise as she has been    devoted  it must be noticed that in the draught copy of his letter which mr crawley gave to his wife to read this last sentence was not inserted intending that she should read his letter he omitted it till he made the fair copy     over this commission his lordship has appointed dr    tempest of silverbridge to preside and with him i have    been in communication i trust that the labours of the    gentlemen of whom it is composed may be brought to a    speedy close and having regard to their trouble which    in such a matter is i fear left without remuneration i    have informed dr tempest that i should write this letter    to you with the intent and assured purpose of resigning    the perpetual curacy of hogglestock into your hands     you will be good enough therefore to understand that    i do so resign the living and that i shall continue to    administer the services of the church only till some    clergyman certified to me as coming from you or from    the bishop may present himself in the parish and shall    declare himself prepared to undertake the cure should it    be so that mr thumble be sent hither again i will sit    under him endeavouring to catch improvement from his    teaching and striving to overcome the contempt which i    felt for him when he before visited this parish i annex    beneath my signature a copy of the letter which i have    written to the bishop on this subject     and now it behoves me as the guardianship of the souls of    those around me was placed in my hands by you to explain    to you as shortly as may be possible the reasons which    have induced me to abandon my work one or two whose    judgment i do not discreditand i am allowed to name    dr tempest of silverbridge as onehave suggested to me    that i should take no step myself till after my trial    they think that i should have regard to the chance of the    verdict so that the preferment may still be mine should    i be acquitted and they say that should i be acquitted    the bishops action against me must of necessity cease    that they are right in these facts i do not doubt but    in giving such advice they look only to facts having no    regard to the conscience i do not blame them i should    give such advice myself knowing that a friend may give    counsel as to outer things but that a man must satisfy    his inner conscience by his own perceptions of what is    right and what is wrong     i find myself to be illspoken of to be regarded with    hard eyes by those around me my people thinking that i    have stolen this money two farmers in this parish have    as i am aware expressed opinions that no jury could    acquit me honestly and neither of these men have appeared    in my church since the expression of that opinion i doubt    whether they have gone to other churches and if not they    have been deterred from all public worship by my presence    if this be so how can i with a clear conscience remain    among these men shall i take from their hands wages for    those administrations which their deliberately formed    opinions will not allow them to accept from my hands  and yet though he thus pleaded against himself he knew that the two men of whom he was speaking were thickheaded dolts who were always tipsy on saturday nights and who came to church perhaps once in three weeks     your kind heart will doubtless prompt you to tell me    that no clergyman could be safe in his parish if he were    to allow the opinion of chance parishioners to prevail    against him and you would probably lay down for my    guidance that grand old doctrine nil conscire sibi    nullâ pallescere culpâ presuming that you may do so i    will acknowledge such guidance to be good if my mind were    clear in this matter i would not budge an inch for any    farmerno nor for any bishop further than he might by    law compel me but my mind is not clear i do grow pale    and my hair stands on end with horror as i confess to    myself that i do not know whether i stole this money or    no such is the fact in all sincerity i tell you that i    know not whether i be guilty or innocent it may be that    i picked up the cheque from the floor of my room and    afterwards took it out and used it not knowing whence it    had come to me if it be so i stole it and am guilty    before the laws of my country if it be so i am not fit    to administer the lords sacraments to these people when    the cup was last in my hand and i was blessing them    i felt that i was not fit and i almost dropped the    chalice that god will know my weakness and pardon me    the perplexity of my mindthat is between him and his    creature     as i read my letter over to myself i feel how weak are my    words and how inefficient to explain to you the exact    position in which i stand but they will suffice to    convince you that i am assuredly purposed to resign this    parish of hogglestock and that it is therefore incumbent    on you as patron of the living to nominate my successor    to the benefice i have only further to ask your pardon    for this long letter and to thank you again for the many    and great marks of friendship which you have conferred on    me alas could you have foreseen in those old days how    barren of all good would have been the life of him you    then esteemed you might perhaps have escaped the disgrace    of being called the friend of one whom no one now regards    with esteem     nevertheless i may still say that i am    with all affection yours truly     josiah crawley   the last paragraph of the letter was also added since his wife had read it when he had first composed his letter he had been somewhat proud of his words thinking that he had clearly told his story but when sitting alone at his desk he read it again filling his mind as he went on with ideas which he would fain have expressed to his old friend were it not that he feared to indulge himself with too many words he began to tell himself that his story was anything but well told there was no expression there of the hoggethan doctrine in answer to such a letter as that the dean might well say think again of it try yet to save yourself never mind the two farmers or mr thumble or the bishop stick to the ship while there is a plank above the water whereas it had been his desire to use words that should make the dean clearly understand that the thing was decided he had failedas he had failed in everything throughout his life but nevertheless the letter must go were he to begin again he would not do it better so he added to what he had written a copy of his note to the bishop and the letter was fastened and sent  mrs crawley might probably have been more instant in her efforts to stop the letter had she not felt that it would not decide everything in the first place it was not improbable that the letter might not reach the dean till after his return homeand mrs crawley had long since made up her mind that she would see the dean as soon as possible after his return she had heard from lady lufton that it was not doubted in barchester that he would be back at any rate before the judges came into the city and then in the next place was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy even if he did get it she trusted in the dean and knew that he would help them if any help were possible should the verdict go against her husband then indeed it might be that no help would be possible in such case she thought that the bishop with his commission might prevail but she still believed that the verdict would be favourableif not with an assured belief still with a hope that was sufficient to stand in lieu of a belief no single man let alone no twelve men could think that her husband had intended to appropriate that money dishonestly that he had taken it improperlywithout real possessionshe herself believed but he had not taken it as a thief and could not merit a thiefs punishment  after two days he got a reply from the bishops chaplain in which the chaplain expressed the bishops commendation of mr crawleys present conduct mr thumble shall proceed from hence to hogglestock on next sunday said the chaplain and shall relieve you for the present from the burden of your duties as to the future status of the parish it will perhaps be best that nothing shall be done till the dean returnsor perhaps till the assizes shall be over this is the bishops opinion it need hardly be explained that the promised visit of mr thumble to hogglestock was gall and wormwood to mr crawley he had told the dean that should mr thumble come he would endeavour to learn something even from him but it may be doubted whether mr crawley in his present mood could learn anything useful from mr thumble giles hoggett was a much more effective teacher  i will endure even that he said to his wife as she handed to him back the letter from the bishops chaplain     chapter lxiii  two visitors to hogglestock   the crossgrainedness of men is so great that things will often be forced to go wrong even when they have the strongest possible natural tendency of their own to go right it was so now in these affairs between the archdeacon and his son the original difficulty was solved by the good feeling of the young ladyby that and by the real kindness of the archdeacons nature they had come to terms which were satisfactory to both of them and those terms admitted of perfect reconciliation between the father and his son whether the major did marry the lady or whether he did not his allowance was to be continued to him the archdeacon being perfectly willing to trust himself in the matter to the pledge which he had received from miss crawley all that he required from his son was simply thisthat he should pull down the bills advertising the sale of his effects was any desire ever more rational the sale had been advertised for a day just one week in advance of the assizes and the time must have been selectedso thought the archdeaconwith a malicious intention why at any rate should the things be sold before any one knew whether the father of the young lady was or was not to be regarded as a thief and why should the things be sold at all when the archdeacon had tacitly withdrawn his threatswhen he had given his son to understand that the allowance would still be paid quarterly with the customary archidiaconal regularity and that no alteration was intended in those settlements under which the plumstead foxes would in the ripeness of time become the property of the major himself it was thus that the archdeacon looked at it and as he did so he thought that his son was the most crossgrained of men  but the major had his own way of looking at the matter he had he flattered himself dealt very fairly with his father when he had first made up his mind to make miss crawley his wife he had told his father of his intention the archdeacon had declared that if he did so such and such results would followresults which as was apparent to every one would make it indispensable that the major should leave cosby lodge the major had never complained so he told himself he had simply said to his fatheri shall do as i have said you can do as you have said therefore i shall prepare to leave cosby lodge he had so prepared and as a part of that preparation the auctioneers bills had been stuck up on the posts and walls then the archdeacon had gone to work surreptitiously with the ladythe reader will understand that we are still following the workings of the majors mindand having succeeded in obtaining a pledge which he had been wrong to demand came forward very graciously to withdraw his threats he withdrew his threats because he had succeeded in his object by other means the major knew nothing of the kiss that had been given of the two tears that had trickled down his fathers nose of the generous epithets which the archdeacon had applied to grace he did not guess how nearly his father had yielded altogether beneath the pressure of graces charmshow willing he was to yield altogether at the first decent opportunity his father had obtained a pledge from grace that she would not marry in certain circumstancesas to which circumstances the major was strongly resolved that they should form no bar to his marriageand then came forward with his eager demand that the sale should be stopped the major could not submit to so much indignity he had resolved that his father should have nothing to do with his marriage one way or the other he would not accept anything from his father on the understanding that his father had any such right his father had asserted such right with threats and he the major taking such threats as meaning something had seen that he must leave cosby lodge let his father come forward and say that they meant nothing that he abandoned all right to any interference as to his sons marriage and then the sonwould dutifully consent to accept his fathers bounty they were both crossgrained as mrs grantly declared but i think that the major was the most crossgrained of the two  something of the truth made its way into henry grantlys mind as he drove himself home from barchester after seeing his grandfather it was not that he began to think that his father was right but that he almost perceived that it might be becoming in him to forgive some fault in his father he had been implored to honour his father and he was willing to do so understanding that such honour must to a certain degree imply obedienceif it could be done at no more than a moderate expense to his feelings the threatened auctioneer was the cause of offence to his father and he might see whether it would not be possible to have the sale postponed there would of course be a pecuniary loss and that in his diminished circumstanceshe would still talk to himself of his diminished circumstancesmight be inconvenient but so much he thought himself bound to endure on his fathers behalf at any rate he would consult the auctioneer at silverbridge  but he would not make any pause in the measures which he had proposed to himself as likely to be conducive to his marriage as for graces pledge such pledges from young ladies never went for anything it was out of the question that she should be sacrificed even though her father had taken the money and moreover the very gist of the majors generosity was to consist in his marrying her whether the father were guilty or innocent he understood that perfectly and understood also that it was his duty to make his purpose in this respect known to graces family he determined therefore that he would go over to hogglestock and see mr crawley before he saw the auctioneer  hitherto major grantly had never even spoken to mr crawley it may be remembered that the major was at the present moment one of the bailsmen for the due appearance of mr crawley before the judge and that he had been present when the magistrates sat at the inn in silverbridge he therefore knew the mans presence but except on that occasion he had never even seen his intended future fatherinlaw from the moment when he had first allowed himself to think of grace he had desired yet almost feared to make acquaintance with the father but had been debarred from doing so by the peculiar position in which mr crawley was placed he had felt that it would be impossible to speak to the father of his affection for the daughter without any allusion to the coming trial and he did not know how such allusion could be made thinking of this he had at different times almost resolved not to call at hogglestock till the trial should be over then he would go there let the result of the trial have been what it might but it had now become necessary for him to go on at once his father had precipitated matters by his appeal to grace he would appeal to graces father and reach grace through his influence  he drove over to hogglestock feeling himself to be anything but comfortable as he came near to the house and when he did reach the spot he was somewhat disconcerted to find that another visitor was in the house before him he presumed this to be the case because there stood a little pony horsean animal which did not strongly recommend itself to his instructed eyeattached by its rein to the palings it was a poor humblelooking beast whose knees had very lately become acquainted with the hard and sharp stones of a newlymended highway the blood was even now red upon the wounds  hell never be much good again said the major to his servant  that he wont sir said the man but i dont think hes been very much good for some time back  i shouldnt like to have to ride him into silverbridge said the major descending from the gig and instructing his servant to move the horse and gig about as long as he might remain within the house then he walked across the little garden and knocked at the door the door was immediately opened and in the passage he found mr crawley and another clergyman whom the reader will recognize as mr thumble mr thumble had come over to make arrangements as to the sunday services and the parochial work and had been very urgent in impressing on mr crawley that the duties were to be left entirely to himself hence had come some bitter words in which mr crawley though no doubt he said the sharper things of the two had not been able to vanquish his enemy so completely as he had done on former occasions  there must be no interference my dear sirnone whatever if you please mr thumble had said  there shall be none of which the bishop shall have reason to complain mr crawley had replied  there must be none at all mr crawley if you please it is only on that understanding that i have consented to take the parish temporarily into my hands mrs crawley i hope that there may be no mistake about the schools it must be exactly as though i were residing on the spot  sir said mr crawley very irate at this appeal to his wife and speaking in a loud voice do you misdoubt my word or do you think that if i were minded to be false to you that i should be corrected in my falsehood by the firmer faith of my wife  i meant nothing about falsehood mr crawley  having resigned this benefice for certain reasons of my own with which i shall not trouble you and acknowledging as i doand have done in writing under my hand to the bishopthe propriety of his lordships interference in providing for the services of the parish till my successor shall have been instituted i shall with what feelings of regret i need not say leave you to the performance of your temporary duties  that is all that i require mr crawley  but it is wholly unnecessary that you should instruct me in mine  the bishop especially desires began mr thumble but mr crawley interrupted him instantly  if the bishop has directed you to give me such instruction the bishop has been much in error i will submit to receive none from him through you sir if you please sir let there be an end of it and mr crawley waved his hand i hope that the reader will conceive the tone of mr crawleys voice and will appreciate the aspect of his face and will see the motion of his hand as he spoke these latter words mr thumble felt the power of the man so sensibly that he was unable to carry on the contest though mr crawley was now but a broken reed and was beneath his feet yet mr thumble acknowledged to himself that he could not hold his own in debate with this broken reed but the words had been spoken and the tone of the voice had died away and the fire in the eyes had burned itself out before the moment of the majors arrival mr thumble was now returning to his horse and having enjoyedif he did enjoyhis little triumph about the parish was becoming unhappy at the future dangers that awaited him perhaps he was the more unhappy because it had been proposed to him by authorities at the palace that he should repeatedly ride on the same animal from barchester to hogglestock and back mr crawley was in the act of replying to lamentations on this subject with his hand on the latch when the major arrivedi regret to say sir that i cannot assist you by supplying any other steed then the major had knocked and mr crawley had at once opened the door  you probably do not remember me mr crawley said the major i am major grantly mrs crawley who heard these words inside the room sprang up from her chair and could hardly resist the temptation to rush into the passage she too had barely seen major grantly and now the only bright gleam which appeared on her horizon depended on his constancy under circumstances which would have justified his inconstancy but had he meant to be inconstant surely he would never have come to hogglestock  i remember you well sir said mr crawley i am under no common obligation to you you are at present one of my bailsmen  theres nothing in that said the major  mr thumble who had caught the name of grantly took off his hat which he had put on his head he had not been particular in keeping off his hat before mr crawley but he knew very well that archdeacon grantly was a big man in the diocese and though the grantlys and the proudies were opposed to each other still it might be well to take off his hat before any one who had to do with the big ones of the diocese i hope your respected father is well sir said mr thumble  pretty well i thank you the major stood close up against the wall of the passage so as to allow room for mr thumble to pass out his business was one on which he could hardly begin to speak until the other visitor should have gone mr crawley was standing with the door wide open in his hand he also was anxious to be rid of mr thumbleand was perhaps not so solicitous as a brother clergyman should have been touching the future fate of mr thumble in the matter of the bishops old cob  really i dont know what to do as to getting upon him again said mr thumble  if you will allow him to progress slowly said mr crawley he will probably travel with the greater safety  i dont know what you call slow mr crawley i was ever so much over two hours coming here from barchester he stumbled almost at every step  did he fall while you were on him asked the major  indeed he did sir you never saw such a thing major grantly look here then mr thumble turning round showed that the rear portion of his clothes had not escaped without injury  it was well he was not going fast or you would have come on to your head said grantly  it was a mercy said thumble but sir as it was i came to the ground with much violence it was on spigglewick hill where the road is covered with loose stones i see sir you have a gig and horse here with a servant perhaps as the circumstances are so very peculiar then mr thumble stopped and looked up into the majors face with imploring eyes but the major had no tenderness for such sufferings im sorry to say that i am going quite the other way he said i am returning to silverbridge  mr thumble hesitated and then made a renewed request if you would not mind taking me to silverbridge i could get home from thence by railway and perhaps you would allow your servant to take the horse to barchester  major grantly was for a moment dumfounded the request is most unreasonable sir said mr crawley  that is as major grantly pleases to look at it said mr thumble  i am sorry to say that it is quite out of my power said the major  you can surely walk leading the beast if you fear to mount him said mr crawley  illustration mrs proudies emissary  i shall do as i please about that said mr thumble and mr crawley if you will have the kindness to leave things in the parish just as they arejust as they are i will be obliged to you it is the bishops wish that you should touch nothing mr thumble was by this time on the step and mr crawley instantly slammed the door the gentleman is a clergyman from barchester said mr crawley modestly folding his hands upon his breast whom the bishop has sent over here to take upon himself temporarily the services of the church and as it appears the duties also of the parish i refrain from animadverting upon his lordships choice  and are you leaving hogglestock  when i have found a shelter for my wife and children i shall do so nay peradventure i must do so before any such shelter can be found i shall proceed in that matter as i am bid i am one who can regard myself as no longer possessing the privilege of free action in anything but while i have a room at your service permit me to ask you to enter it then mr crawley motioned him in with his hand and major grantly found himself in the presence of mrs crawley and her younger daughter  he looked at them both for a moment and could trace much of the lines of that face which he loved so well but the troubles of life had almost robbed the elder lady of her beauty and with the younger the awkward thinness of the last years of feminine childhood had not yet given place to the fulfilment of feminine grace but the likeness in each was quite enough to make him feel that he ought to be at home in that room he thought that he could love the woman as his mother and the girl as his sister he found it very difficult to begin any conversation in their presence and yet it seemed to be his duty to begin mr crawley had marshalled him into the room and having done so stood aside near the door mrs crawley had received him very graciously and having done so seemed to be ashamed of her own hospitality poor jane had shrunk back into a distant corner near the open standing desk at which she was accustomed to read greek to her father and of course could not be expected to speak if major grantly could have found himself alone with any one of the threenay if he could have been there with any two he could have opened his budget at once but before all the family he felt the difficulty of his situation mrs crawley said he i have been most anxious to make your acquaintance and i trust you will excuse the liberty i have taken in calling  i feel grateful to you as i am sure does also my husband so much she said and then felt angry with herself for saying so much was she not expressing her strong hope that he might stand fast by her child whereby the whole crawley family would gain so muchand the grantly family lose much in the same proportion  sir said mr crawley i owe you thanks still unexpressed in that you came forward together with mr robarts of framley to satisfy the not unnatural requisition of the magistrates before whom i was called upon to appear in the early winter i know not why any one should have ventured into such jeopardy on my account  there was no jeopardy mr crawley any one in the county would have done it  i know not that nor can i see that there was no jeopardy i trust that i may assure you that there is no dangernone i mean to you the danger to myself and those belonging to me is alas very urgent the facts of my position are pressing close upon me methinks i suffer more from the visit of the gentleman who has just departed from me than from anything that has yet happened to me and yet he is in his righthe is altogether in his right  no papa he is not said jane from her standing ground near the upright desk  my dear said her father you should be silent on such a subject it is a matter hard to be understood in all its bearingseven by those who are most conversant with them but as to this we need not trouble major grantly  after that there was silence among them and for a while it seemed as though there could be no approach to the subject on which grantly had come thither to express himself mrs crawley in her despair said something about the weather and the major trying to draw near the special subject became bold enough to remark that he had had the pleasure of seeing miss crawley at framley mrs robarts has been very kind said mrs crawley very kind indeed you can understand major grantly that this must be a very sad house for any young person i dont think it is at all sad said jane still standing in the corner by the upright desk  then major grantly rose from his seat and walked across to the girl and took her hand you are so like your sister said he your sister is a great friend of mine she has often spoken to me of you i hope we shall be friends some day but jane could make no answer to this though she had been able to vindicate the general character of the house while she was left in her corner by herself i wonder whether you would be angry with me continued the major if i told you that i wanted to speak a word to your father and mother alone to this jane made no reply but was out of the room almost before the words had reached the ears of her father and mother though she was only sixteen and had as yet read nothing but latin and greekunless we are to count the twelve books of euclid and woods algebra and sundry smaller exercises of the same descriptionshe understood as well as any one then present the reason why her absence was required  as she closed the door the major paused for a moment expecting or perhaps hoping that the father or the mother would say a word but neither of them had a word to say they sat silent and as though consciencestricken here was a rich man come of whom they had heard that he might probably wish to wed their daughter it was manifest enough to both of them that no man could marry into their family without subjecting himself to a heavy portion of that reproach and disgrace which was attached to them but how was it possible that they should not care more for their daughterfor their own flesh and blood than for the incidental welfare of this rich man as regarded the man himself they had heard everything that was good such a marriage was like the opening of paradise to their child nil conscire sibi said the father to himself as he buckled on his armour for the fight  when he had waited for a moment or two the major began mrs crawley he said addressing himself to the mother i do not quite know how far you may be aware that ithat i have for some time beenbeen acquainted with your eldest daughter  i have heard from her that she is acquainted with you said mrs crawley almost panting with anxiety  i may as well make a clean breast of it at once said the major smiling and say outright that i have come here to request your permission and her fathers to ask her to be my wife then he was silent and for a few moments neither mr nor mrs crawley replied to him she looked at her husband and he gazed at the fire and the smile died away from the majors face as he watched the solemnity of them both there was something almost forbidding in the peculiar gravity of mr crawleys countenance when as at present something operated within him to cause him to express dissent from any proposition that was made to him i do not know how far this may be altogether new to you mrs crawley said the major waiting for a reply  it is not new to us said mrs crawley  may i hope then that you will not disapprove  sir said mr crawley i am so placed by the untoward circumstances of my life that i can hardly claim to exercise over my own daughter that authority which should belong to a parent  my dear do not say that exclaimed mrs crawley  but i do say it within three weeks of this time i may be a prisoner subject to the criminal laws of my country at this moment i am without the power of earning bread for myself or for my wife or for my children major grantly you have even now seen the departure of the gentleman who has been sent here to take my place in this parish i am as it were an outlaw here and entitled neither to obedience nor respect from those who under other circumstances would be bound to give me both  major grantly said the poor woman no husband or father in the county is more closely obeyed or more thoroughly respected and loved  i am sure of it said the major  all this however matters nothing continued mr crawley and all speech on such homely matters would amount to an impertinence before you sir were it not that you have hinted at a purpose of connecting yourself at some future time with this unfortunate family  i meant to be plainspoken mr crawley  i did not mean to insinuate sir that there was aught of reticence in your words so contrived that you might fall back upon the vagueness of your expression for protection should you hereafter see fit to change your purpose i should have wronged you much by such a suggestion i rather was minded to make known to you that ior i should rather say we and mr crawley pointed to his wifeshall not accept your plainness of speech as betokening aught beyond a conceived idea in furtherance of which you have thought it expedient to make certain inquiries  i dont quite follow you said the major but what i want you to do is to give me your consent to visit your daughter and i want mrs crawley to write to grace and tell her that its all right mrs crawley was quite sure that it was all right and was ready to sit down and write the letter that moment if her husband would permit her to do so  i am sorry that i have not been explicit said mr crawley but i will endeavour to make myself more plainly intelligible my daughter sir is so circumstanced in reference to her father that i as her father and as a gentleman cannot encourage any man to make a tender to her of his hand  but i have made up my mind about all that  and i sir have made up mine i dare not tell my girl that i think she will do well to place her hand in yours a lady when she does that should feel at least that her hand is clean  it is the cleanest and the sweetest and the fairest hand in barsetshire said the major mrs crawley could not restrain herself but running up to him took his hand in hers and kissed it  there is unfortunately a stain which is vicarial began mr crawley sustaining up to that point his voice with roman fortitudewith a fortitude which would have been roman had it not at that moment broken down under the pressure of human feeling he could keep it up no longer but continued his speech with broken sobs and with a voice altogether changed in its tonerapid now whereas it had before been slownatural whereas it had hitherto been affectedhuman whereas it had hitherto been roman major grantly he said i am sore beset but what can i say to you my darling is as pure as the light of dayonly that she is soiled with my impurity she is fit to grace the house of the best gentleman in england had i not made her unfit  she shall grace mine said the major by god she shalltomorrow if shell have me mrs crawley who was standing beside him again raised his hand and kissed it  it may not be so as i began by sayingor rather strove to say for i have been overtaken by weakness and cannot speak my mindi cannot claim authority over my child as would another man how can i exercise authority from between a prisons bars  she would obey your slightest wish said mrs crawley  i could express no wish said he but i know my girl and i am sure that she will not consent to take infamy with her into the house of the man who loves her  there will be no infamy said the major infamy i tell you that i shall be proud of the connexion  you sir are generous in your prosperity we will strive to be at least just in our adversity my wife and children are to be pitiedbecause of the husband and the father  no said mrs crawley i will not hear that said without denying it  but they must take their lot as it has been given to them continued he such a position in life as that which you have proposed to bestow upon my child would be to her as regards human affairs great elevation and from what i have heardi may be permitted to add also from what i now learn by personal experiencesuch a marriage would be laden with fair promise of future happiness but if you ask my mind i think that my child is not free to make it you sir have many relatives who are not in love as you are all of whom would be affected by the stain of my disgrace you have a daughter to whom all your solicitude is due no one should go to your house as your second wife who cannot feel that she will serve your child my daughter would feel that she was bringing an injury upon the babe i cannot bid her do thisand i will not nor do i believe that she would do so if i bade her then he turned his chair round and sat with his face to the wall wiping away the tears with a tattered handkerchief  mrs crawley led the major away to the further window and there stood looking up into his face it need hardly be said that they also were crying whose eyes could have been dry after such a sceneupon hearing such words you had better go said mrs crawley i know him so well you had better go  mrs crawley he said whispering to her if i ever desert her may all that i love desert me but you will help me  you would want no help were it not for this trouble  but you will help me  then she paused a moment i can do nothing she said but what he bids me  you will trust me at any rate said the major  i do trust you she replied then he went without saying a word further to mr crawley as soon as he was gone the wife went over to her husband and put her arm gently round his neck as he was sitting for a while the husband took no notice of his wifes caress but sat motionless with his face still turned to the wall then she spoke to him a word or two telling him that their visitor was gone my child he said my poor child my darling she has found grace in this mans sight but even of that has her father robbed her the lord has visited upon the children the sins of the father and will do so to the third and fourth generation     chapter lxiv  the tragedy in hook court   illustration  conway dalrymple had hurried out of the room in mrs broughtons house in which he had been painting jael and sisera thinking that it would be better to meet an angry and perhaps tipsy husband on the stairs than it would be either to wait for him till he should make his way into his wifes room or to hide away from him with the view of escaping altogether from so disagreeable an encounter he had no fear of the man he did not think that there would be any violencenor as regarded himself did he much care if there was to be violence but he felt that he was bound as far as it might be possible to screen the poor woman from the ill effects of her husbands temper and condition he was therefore prepared to stop broughton on the stairs and to use some force in arresting him on his way should he find the man to be really intoxicated but he had not descended above a stair or two before he was aware that the man below him whose step had been heard in the hall was not intoxicated and that he was not dobbs broughton it was mr musselboro  it is you is it said conway i thought it was broughton then he looked into the mans face and saw that he was ashy pale all that appearance of lowbred jauntiness which used to belong to him seemed to have been washed out of him his hair had forgotten to curl his gloves had been thrown aside and even his trinkets were out of sight what has happened said conway what is the matter something is wrong then it occurred to him that musselboro had been sent to the house to tell the wife of the husbands ruin  the servant told me that i should find you upstairs said musselboro  yes i have been painting here for some time past i have been doing a picture of miss van siever mrs van siever has been here today conway thought that this information would produce some strong effect on claras proposed husband but he did not seem to regard the matter of the picture nor the mention of miss van sievers name  she knows nothing of it said he she doesnt know yet  know what asked conway she knows that her husband has lost money  dobbs hasdestroyed himself  what  blew his brains out this morning just inside the entrance at hook court the horror of drink was on him and he stood just in the pathway and shot himself bangles was standing at the top of their vaults and saw him do it i dont think bangles will ever be a man again o lord i shall never get over it myself the body was there when i went in then musselboro sank back against the wall of the staircase and stared at dalrymple as though he still saw before him the terrible sight of which he had just spoken  dalrymple seated himself on the stairs and strove to bring his mind to bear on the tale which he had just heard what was he to do and how was that poor woman upstairs to be informed you came here intending to tell her he said in a whisper he feared every moment that mrs broughton would appear on the stairs and learn from a word or two what had happened without any hint to prepare her for the catastrophe  i thought you would be here i knew you were doing the picture he knew it hed had a letter to say soone of those anonymous ones  but that didnt influence him  i dont think it was that said musselboro he meant to have had it out with her but it wasnt that as brought this about perhaps you didnt know that he was clean ruined  she had told me  then she knew it  oh yes she knew that mrs van siever had told her poor creature how are we to break this to her  you and she are very thick said musselboro i suppose youll do it best by this time they were in the drawingroom and the door was closed dalrymple had put his hand on the other mans arm and had led him downstairs out of reach of hearing from the room above youll tell herwont you said musselboro then dalrymple tried to think what loving female friend there was who could break the news to the unfortunate woman he knew of the van sievers and he knew of the demolines and he almost knew that there was no other woman within reach whom he was entitled to regard as closely connected with mrs broughton he was well aware that the anonymous letter of which musselboro had just spoken had come from miss demolines and he could not go there for sympathy and assistance nor could he apply to mrs van siever after what had passed this morning to clara van siever he would have applied but that it was impossible he should reach clara except through her mother i suppose i had better go to her he said after a while and then he went leaving musselboro in the drawingroom im so bad with it said musselboro that i really dont know how i shall ever go up that court again  conway dalrymple made his way up the stairs with very slow steps and as he did so he could not but think seriously of the nature of his friendship with this woman and could not but condemn himself heartily for the folly and iniquity of his own conduct scores of times he had professed his love to her with halfexpressed words intended to mean nothing as he said to himself when he tried to excuse himself but enough to turn her head even if they did not reach her heart now this woman was a widow and it came to be his duty to tell her that she was so what if she should claim from him now the love which he had so often proffered to her it was not that he feared that she would claim anything from him at this momentneither now nor tomorrow nor the next daybut the agony of the present meeting would produce others in which there would be some tenderness mixed with the agony and so from one meeting to another the thing would progress dalrymple knew well enough how such things might progress but in this danger before him it was not of himself that he was thinking but of her how could he assist her at such a time without doing her more injury than benefit and if he did not assist her who would do so he knew her to be heartless but even heartless people have hearts which can be touched and almost broken by certain sorrows her heart would not be broken by her husbands death but it would become very sore if she were utterly neglected he was now at the door with his hand on the lock and was wondering why she should remain so long within without making herself heard then he opened it and found her seated in a loungingchair with her back to the door and he could see that she had a volume of a novel in her hand he understood it all she was pretending to be indifferent to her husbands return he walked up to her thinking that she would recognize his step but she made no sign of turning towards him he saw the motion of her hair over the back of the chair as she affected to make herself luxuriously comfortable she was striving to let her husband see that she cared nothing for him or for his condition or for his jealousy if he were jealousor even for his ruin mrs broughton he said when he was close to her then she jumped up quickly and turned round facing him where is dobbs she said where is broughton  he is not here  he is in the house for i heard him why have you come back  dalrymples eye fell on the tattered canvas and he thought of the doings of the past month he thought of the picture of three graces which was hanging in the room below and he thoroughly wished that he had never been introduced to the broughton establishment how was he to get through his present difficulty no said he broughton did not come it was mr musselboro whose steps you heard below  what is he here for what is he doing here where is dobbs conway there is something the matter he has gone off  yeshe has gone off  the coward  no he was not a cowardnot in that way  the use of the past tense unintentional as it had been told the story to the woman at once he is dead she said then he took both her hands in his and looked into her face without speaking a word and she gazed at him with fixed eyes and rigid mouth while the quick coming breath just moved the curl of her nostrils it occurred to him at the moment that he had never before seen her so wholly unaffected and had never before observed that she was so totally deficient in all the elements of real beauty she was the first to speak again conway she said tell it me all why do you not speak to me  there is nothing further to tell said he  then she dropped his hands and walked away from him to the windowand stood there looking out upon the stuccoed turret of a huge house that stood opposite as she did so she was employing herself in counting the windows her mind was paralysed by the blow and she knew not how to make any exertion with it for any purpose everything was changed with herand was changed in such a way that she could make no guess as to her future mode of life she was suddenly a widow a pauper and utterly desolatewhile the only person in the whole world that she really liked was standing close to her but in the midst of it all she counted the windows of the house opposite had it been possible for her she would have put her mind altogether to sleep  he let her stand for a few minutes and then joined her at the window my friend he said what shall i do for you  do she said what do you mean bydoing  come and sit down and let me talk to you he replied then he led her to the sofa and as she seated herself i doubt whether she had not almost forgotten that her husband was dead  what a pity it was to cut it up she said pointing to the rags of jael and sisera  never mind the picture now dreadful as it is you must allow yourself to think of him for a few minutes  think of what o god yes conway you must tell me what to do was everything gone it isnt about myself i dont mind about myself i wish it was me instead of him i do i do  no wishing is of any avail  but conway how did it happen do you think it is true that man would say anything to gain his object is he here now  i believe he is here still  i wont see him remember that nothing on earth shall make me see him  it may be necessary but i do not think it will beat any rate not yet  i will never see him i believe that he has murdered my husband i do i feel sure of it now i think of it i am quite sure of it and he will murder you tooabout that girl he will i tell you i know the man dalrymple simply shook his head smiling sadly very well you will see but conway how do you know that it is true do you believe it yourself  i do believe it  and how did it happen  he could not bear the ruin that he had brought upon himself and you  thenthen she went no further in her speech but dalrymple assented by a slight motion of his head and she had been informed sufficiently that her husband had perished by his own hand what am i to do she said oh conwayyou must tell me was there ever so miserable a woman was itpoison  he got up and walked quickly across the room and back again to the place where she was sitting never mind about that now you shall know all that in time do not ask any questions about that if i were you i think i would go to bed you will be better there than up and this shock will make you sleep  no she said i will not go to bed how should i know that that man would not come to me and kill me i believe he murdered dobbsi do you are not going to leave me conway  i think i had better for a while there are things which should be done shall i send one of the women to you  there is not one of them that cares for me in the least oh conway do not go not yet i will not be left alone in the house with him you will be very cruel if you go and leave me nowwhen you have so often said that youthat youthat you were my friend and now at last she began to weep  i think it will be best he said that i should go to mrs van siever if i can manage it i will get clara to come to you  i do not want her said mrs broughton she is a heartless cold creature and i do not want to have her near me my poor husband was ruined among themyes ruined among them it has all been done that she may marry that horrid man and live here in this house i have known ever so long that he has not been safe among them  you need fear nothing from clara said dalrymple with some touch of anger in his voice  of course you will say so i can understand that very well and it is natural that you should wish to be with her pray go  then he sat beside her and took her hand and endeavoured to speak to her so seriously that she herself might become serious and if it might be possible in some degree contemplative he told her how necessary it was that she should have some woman near her in her trouble and explained to her that as far as he knew her female friends there would be no one who would be so considerate with her as clara van siever she at one time mentioned the name of miss demolines but dalrymple altogether opposed the notion of sending for that ladyexpressing his opinion that the amiable madalina had done all in her power to create quarrels both between mrs broughton and her husband and between dobbs broughton and mrs van siever and he spoke his opinion very fully about miss demolines and yet you liked her once said mrs broughton i never liked her said dalrymple with energy but all that matters nothing now of course you can send for her if you please but i do not think her trustworthy and i will not willingly come in contact with her then mrs broughton gave him to understand that of course she must give way but that in giving way she felt herself to be submitting to that illusage which is the ordinary lot of women and to which she among women had been specially subjected she did not exactly say as much fearing that if she did he would leave her altogether but that was the gist of her plaints and wails and final acquiescence  and you are going she said catching hold of his arm  i will employ myself altogether and only about your affairs till i see you again  but i want you to stay  it would be madness look herelie down till clara comes or till i return do not go beyond this room and your own if she cannot come this evening i will return goodby now i will see the servants as i go out and tell them what ought to be told  oh conway she said clutching hold of him again i know that you despise me  i do not despise you and i will be as good a friend to you as i can god bless you then he went and as he descended the stairs he could not refrain from telling himself that he did in truth despise her  his first object was to find musselboro and to dismiss that gentleman from the house for though he himself did not attribute to mrs van sievers favourite any of those terrible crimes and potentialities for crime with which mrs dobbs broughton had invested him still he thought it reasonable that the poor woman upstairs should not be subjected to the necessity of either seeing him or hearing him but musselboro had gone and dalrymple could not learn from the head womanservant whom he saw whether before going he had told to any one in the house the tale of the catastrophe which had happened in the city servants are wonderful actors looking often as though they knew nothing when they know everythingas though they understood nothing when they understand all dalrymple made known all that was necessary and the discreet upper servant listened to the tale with a proper amount of awe and horror and commiseration shot hisself in the citylaws youll excuse me sir but we all knowd as master was coming to no good but she promised to do her best with her mistressand kept her promise it is seldom that servants are not good in such straits as that  from mrs broughtons house dalrymple went directly to mrs van sievers and learned that musselboro had been there about half an hour before and had then gone off in a cab with mrs van siever it was now nearly four oclock in the afternoon and no one in the house knew when mrs van siever would be back miss van siever was out and had been out when mr musselboro had called but was expected in every minute conway therefore said that he would call again and on returning found clara alone she had not then heard a word of the fate of dobbs broughton of course she would go at once to mrs broughton and if necessary stay with her during the night she wrote a line at once to her mother saying where she was and went across to mrs broughton leaning on dalrymples arm be good to her said conway as he left her at the door i will said clara i will be as kind as my nature will allow me and remember said conway whispering into her ear as he pressed her hand at leaving her that you are all the world to me it was perhaps not a proper time for an expression of love but clara van siever forgave the impropriety     chapter lxv  miss van siever makes her choice   clara van siever did stay all that night with mrs broughton in the course of the evening she received a note from her mother in which she was told to come home to breakfast you can go back to her afterwards said mrs van siever and i will see her myself in the course of the day if she will let me the note was written on a scrap of paper and had neither beginning nor end but this was after the manner of mrs van siever and clara was not in the least hurt or surprised my mother will come to see you after breakfast said clara as she was taking her leave  oh goodness and what shall i say to her  you will have to say very little she will speak to you  i suppose everything belongs to her now said mrs broughton  i know nothing about that i never do know anything of mammas money matters  of course shell turn me out i do not mind a bit about thatonly i hope shell let me have some mourning then she made clara promise that she would return as soon as possible having in claras presence overcome all that feeling of dislike which she had expressed to conway dalrymple mrs broughton was generally affectionate to those who were near to her had musselboro forced himself into her presence she would have become quite confidential with him before he left her  mr musselboro will be here directly said mrs van siever as she was starting for mrs broughtons house you had better tell him to come to me there or stopperhaps you had better keep him here till i come back tell him to be sure and wait for me  very well mamma i suppose he can wait below  why should he wait below said mrs van siever very angrily  clara had made the uncourteous proposition to her mother with the express intention of making it understood that she would have nothing to say to him he can come upstairs if he likes it said clara and i will go up to my room  if you fight shy of him miss you may remember thisthat you will fight shy of me at the same time  i am sorry for that mamma for i shall certainly fight shy of mr musselboro  you can do as you please i cant force you and i shant try but i can make your life a burden to youand i will whats the matter with the man that he isnt good enough for you hes as good as any of your own people ever was i hate your newfangled airswith pictures painted on the sly and all the rest of it i hate such ways see what they have brought that wretched man to and the poor fool his wife if you go and marry that painter some of these days youll be very much like what she is only i doubt whether he has got courage enough to blow his brains out with these comfortable words the old woman took herself off leaving clara to entertain her lover as best she might choose  mr musselboro was not long in coming and in accordance with mrs van sievers implied directions to her daughter was shown up into the drawingroom clara gave him her mothers message in a very few words i was expressly told sir to ask you to stop if it is not inconvenient as she very much wants to see you mr musselboro declared that of course he would stop he was only too happy to have an opportunity of remaining in such delightful society as clara answered nothing to this he went on to say that he hoped that the melancholy occasion of mrs van sievers visit to mrs broughton might make a long absence necessaryhe did not indeed care how long it might be he had recovered now from that paleness and that want of gloves and jewellery which had befallen him on the previous day immediately after the sight he had seen in the city clara made no answer to the last speech but putting some things together in her workbasket prepared to leave the room i hope you are not going to leave me he said in a voice that was intended to convey much of love and something of melancholy  i am so shocked by what has happened mr musselboro that i am altogether unfit for conversation i was with poor mrs broughton last night and i shall return to her when mamma comes home  it is sad certainly but what was there to be expected if youd only seen how he used to go on to this clara made no answer dont go yet said he there is something that i want to say to you there is indeed  clara van siever was a young woman whose presence of mind rarely deserted her it occurred to her now that she must undergo on some occasion the nuisance of a direct offer from this man and that she could have no better opportunity of answering him after her own fashion than the present her mother was absent and the field was her own and moreover it was a point in her favour that the tragedy which had so lately occurred and to which she had just now alluded would give her a fair excuse for additional severity at such a moment no man could she told herself be justified in making an offer of his love and therefore she might rebuke him with the less remorse i wonder whether the last words which conway dalrymple had spoken to her stung her conscience as she thought of this she had now reached the door and was standing close to it as mr musselboro did not at once begin she encouraged him if you have anything special to tell me of course i will hear you she said  miss clara he began rising from his chair and coming into the middle of the room i think you know what my wishes are then he put his hand upon his heart and your respected mother is the same way of thinking its that that emboldens me to be so sudden not but what my heart has been yours and yours only all along before the old lady so much as mentioned it clara would give him no assistance not even the aid of a negative but stood there quite passive with her hand on the door since i first had the pleasure of seeing you i have always said to myself augustus musselboro that is the woman for you if you can only win her but then there was so much against mewasnt there she would not even take advantage of this by assuring him that there certainly always had been much against him but allowed him to go on till he should run out all the length of his tether i mean of course in the way of money he continued i hadnt much that i could call my own when your respected mamma first allowed me to become acquainted with you but its different now and i think i may say that im all right in that respect poor broughtons going in this way will make it a deal smoother to me and i may say that i and your mamma will be all in all to each other now about money then he stopped  i dont quite understand what you mean by all this said clara  i mean that there isnt a more devoted fellow in all london than what i am to you then he was about to go down on one knee but it occurred to him that it would not be convenient to kneel to a lady who would stand quite close to the door one and one if theyre put together well will often make more than two and so they shall with us said musselboro who began to feel that it might be expedient to throw a little spirit into his words  if you have done said clara you may as well hear me for a minute and i hope you will have sense to understand that i really mean what i say  i hope you will remember what are your mammas wishes  mammas wishes have no influence whatsoever with me in such matters as this mammas arrangements with you are for her own convenience and i am not a party to them i do not know anything about mammas money and i do not want to know but under no possible circumstances will i consent to become your wife nothing that mamma could say or do would induce me even to think of it i hope you will be man enough to take this for an answer and say nothing more about it  but miss clara  its no good your miss claraing me sir what i have said you may be sure i mean goodmorning sir then she opened the door and left him  by jove she is a tartar said musselboro to himself when he was alone theyre both tartars but the younger is the worse then he began to speculate whether fortune was not doing the best for him in so arranging that he might have the use of the tartarmothers money without binding himself to endure for life the tartar qualities of the daughter  it had been understood that clara was to wait at home till her mother should return before she again went across to mrs broughton at about eleven mrs van siever came in and her daughter intercepted her at the diningroom door before she had made her way upstairs to mr musselboro how is she mamma said clara with something of hypocrisy in her assumed interest for mrs broughton  she is an idiot said mrs van siever  she has had a terrible misfortune  that is no reason why she should be an idiot and she is heartless too she never cared a bit for himnot a bit  he was a man whom it was impossible to care for much i will go to her now mamma  where is musselboro  he is upstairs  well  mamma that is quite out of the question quite i would not marry him to save myself from starving  you do not know what starving is yet my dear tell me the truth at once are you engaged to that painter clara paused a moment before she answered not hesitating as to the expediency of telling her mother any truth on the matter in question but doubting what the truth might really be could she say that she was engaged to mr dalrymple or could she say that she was not if you tell me a lie miss ill have you put out of the house  illustration you do not know what starving is my dear  i certainly shall not tell you a lie mr dalrymple has asked me to be his wife and i have made him no answer if he asks me again i shall accept him  then i order you not to leave this house said mrs van siever  surely i may go to mrs broughton  i order you not to leave this house said mrs van siever againand thereupon she stalked out of the diningroom and went upstairs clara had been standing with her bonnet on ready dressed to go out and the mother made no attempt to send the daughter up to her room that she did not expect to be obeyed in her order may be inferred from the first words which she spoke to mr musselboro she has gone off to that man now you are no good musselboro at this kind of work  you see mrs van he had the start of me so much and then being at the west end and all that gives a man such a standing with a girl  bother said mrs van siever as her quick ear caught the sound of the closing halldoor clara had stood a minute or two to consider and then had resolved that she would disobey her mother she tried to excuse her own conduct to her own satisfaction as she went there are some things she said which even a daughter cannot hear from her mother if she chooses to close the door against me she must do so  she found mrs broughton still in bed and could not but agree with her mother that the woman was both silly and heartless  your mother says that everything must be sold up said mrs broughton  at any rate you would hardly choose to remain here said clara  but i hope shell let me have my own things a great many of them are altogether my own i know theres a law that a woman may have her own things even though her husband hasdone what poor dobbs did and i think she was hard upon me about the mourning they never do mind giving credit for such things as that and though there is a bill due to mrs morell now she has had a deal of dobbss money clara promised her that she should have mourning to her hearts content i will see to that myself she said  presently there was a knock at the door and the discreet headservant beckoned clara out of the room you are not going away said mrs broughton clara promised her that she would not go without coming back again he will be here soon i suppose and perhaps you had better see him though for the matter of that perhaps you had better not because he is so much cut up about poor dobbs the servant had come up to tell clara that the he in question was at the present moment waiting for her below stairs  the first words which passed between dalrymple and clara had reference to the widow he told her what he had learned in the citythat broughtons property had never been great and that his personal liabilities at the time of his death were supposed to be small but he had fallen lately altogether into the hands of musselboro who though penniless himself in the way of capital was backed by the money of mrs van siever there was no doubt that broughton had destroyed himself in the manner told by musselboro but the opinion in the city was that he had done so rather through the effects of drink than because of his losses as to the widow dalrymple thought that mrs van siever or nominally perhaps musselboro might be induced to settle an annuity on her if she would give up everything quietly i doubt whether your mother is not responsible for everything broughton owed when he diedfor everything that is in the way of business and if so mrs broughton will certainly have a claim upon the estate it occurred to dalrymple once or twice that he was talking to clara about mrs van siever as though he and clara were more closely bound together than were clara and her mother but clara seemed to take this in good part and was as solicitous as was he himself in the matter of mrs broughtons interest  then the discreet headservant knocked and told them that mrs broughton was very anxious to see mr dalrymple but that miss van siever was on no account to go away she was up and in her dressinggown and had gone into the sittingroom i will come directly said dalrymple and the discreet headservant retired  clara said conway i do not know when i may have another chance of asking for an answer to my question you heard my question  yes i heard it  and will you answer it  if you wish it i will  of course i wish it you understood what i said upon the doorstep yesterday  i dont think much of that men say those things so often what you said before was serious i suppose  serious heavens do you think that i am joking  mamma wants me to marry mr musselboro  he is a vulgar brute it would be impossible  it is impossible but mamma is very obstinate i have no fortune of my ownnot a shilling she told me today that she would turn me into the street she forbade me to come here thinking i should meet you but i came because i had promised mrs broughton i am sure that she will never give me one shilling  dalrymple paused for a moment it was certainly true that he had regarded clara van siever as an heiress and had at first been attracted to her because he thought it expedient to marry an heiress but there had since come something beyond that and there was perhaps less of regret than most men would have felt as he gave up his golden hopes he took her into his arms and kissed her and called her his own now we understand each other he said  if you wish it to be so  i do wish it  and i shall tell my mother today that i am engaged to youunless she refuses to see me go to mrs broughton now i feel that we are almost cruel to be thinking of ourselves in this house at such a time upon this dalrymple went and clara van siever was left to her reflections she had never before had a lover she had never had even a friend whom she loved and trusted her life had been passed at school till she was nearly twenty and since then she had been vainly endeavouring to accommodate herself and her feelings to her mother now she was about to throw herself into the absolute power of a man who was nearly a stranger to her but she did love him as she had never loved any one elseand then on the other side there was mr musselboro  dalrymple was upstairs for an hour and clara did not see him again before he left the house it was clear to her from mrs broughtons first words that conway had told her what had passed of course i shall never see anything more of either of you now said mrs broughton  i should say that probably you will see a great deal of us both  there are some people said mrs broughton who can do well for their friends but can never do well for themselves i am one of them i saw at once how great a thing it would be for both of you to bring you two togetherespecially for you clara and therefore i did it i may say that i never had it out of my mind for months past poor dobbs misunderstood what i was doing god knows how far that may have brought about what has happened  oh mrs broughton  of course he could not be blind to one thingnor was i i mention it now because it is right but i shall never never allude to it again of course he saw and i saw that conwaywas attached to me poor conway meant no harm i was aware of that but there was the terrible fact i knew at once that the only cure for him was a marriage with some girl that he could respect admiring you as i do i immediately resolved on bringing you two together my dear i have been successful and i heartily trust that you may be happier than maria broughton  miss van siever knew the woman understood all the facts and pitying the condition of the wretched creature bore all this without a word of rebuke she scorned to put out her strength against one who was in truth so weak     chapter lxvi  requiescat in pace   things were very gloomy at the palace it has been already said that for many days after dr tempests visit to barchester the intercourse between the bishop and mrs proudie had not been of a pleasant nature he had become so silent so sullen and so solitary in his ways that even her courage had been almost cowed and for a while she had condescended to use gentler measures with the hope that she might thus bring her lord round to his usual state of active submission or perhaps if we strive to do her full justice we may say of her that her effort was made conscientiously with the idea of inducing him to do his duty with proper activity for she was a woman not without a conscience and by no means indifferent to the real service which her husband as bishop of the diocese was bound to render to the affairs of the church around her of her own struggles after personal dominion she was herself unconscious and no doubt they gave her when recognized and acknowledged by herself many stabs to her inner self of which no single being in the world knew anything and now as after a while she failed in producing any amelioration in the bishops mood her temper also gave way and things were becoming very gloomy and very unpleasant  the bishop and his wife were at present alone in the palace their married daughter and her husband had left them and their unmarried daughter was also away how far the bishops mood may have produced this solitude in the vast house i will not say probably mrs proudies state of mind may have prevented her from having other guests in the place of those who were gone she felt herself to be almost disgraced in the eyes of all those around her by her husbands long absence from the common rooms of the house and by his dogged silence at meals it was better she thought that they two should be alone in the palace  her own efforts to bring him back to something like life to some activity of mind if not of body were made constantly and when she failed as she did fail day after day she would go slowly to her own room and lock her door and look back in her solitude at all the days of her life she had agonies in these minutes of which no one near her knew anything she would seize with her arm the part of the bed near which she would stand and hold by it grasping it as though she were afraid to fall and then when it was at the worst with her she would go to her closeta closet that no eyes ever saw unlocked but her ownand fill for herself and swallow some draught and then she would sit down with the bible before her and read it sedulously she spent hours every day with her bible before her repeating to herself whole chapters which she almost knew by heart  it cannot be said that she was a bad woman though she had in her time done an indescribable amount of evil she had endeavoured to do good failing partly by ignorance and partly from the effects of an unbridled ambitious temper and now even amidst her keenest sufferings her ambition was by no means dead she still longed to rule the diocese by means of her husbandbut was made to pause and hesitate by the unwonted mood that had fallen upon him before this on more than one occasion and on one very memorable occasion he had endeavoured to combat her he had fought with her striving to put her down he had failed and given up the hope of any escape for himself in that direction on those occasions her courage had never quailed for a moment while he openly struggled to be master she could openly struggle to be mistressand could enjoy the struggle but nothing like this moodiness had ever come upon him before  she had yielded to it for many days striving to coax him by little softnesses of which she herself had been ashamed as she practised them they had served her nothing and at last she determined that something else must be done if only for his sake to keep some life in him something else must be done were he to continue as he was now he must give up his diocese or at any rate declare himself too ill to keep the working of it in his own hands how she hated mr crawley for all the sorrow that he had brought upon her and her house  and it was still the affair of mr crawley which urged her on to further action when the bishop received mr crawleys letter he said nothing of it to her but he handed it over to his chaplain the chaplain fearing to act upon it himself handed it to mr thumble whom he knew to be one of the bishops commission and mr thumble equally fearing responsibility in the present state of affairs at the palace found himself obliged to consult mrs proudie mrs proudie had no doubt as to what should be done the man had abdicated his living and of course some provision must be made for the services she would again make an attempt upon her husband and therefore she went into his room holding mr crawleys letter in her hand  my dear she said here is mr crawleys letter i suppose you have read it  yes said the bishop i have read it  and what will you do about it something must be done  i dont know said he he did not even look at her as he spoke he had not turned his eyes upon her since she had entered the room  but bishop it is a letter that requires to be acted upon at once we cannot doubt that the man is doing right at last he is submitting himself where his submission is due but his submission will be of no avail unless you take some action upon his letter do you not think that mr thumble had better go over  no i dont i think mr thumble had better stay where he is said the irritated bishop  what then would you wish to have done  never mind said he  but bishop that is nonsense said mrs proudie adding something of severity to the tone of her voice  no it isnt nonsense said he still he did not look at her nor had he done so for a moment since she had entered the room mrs proudie could not bear this and as her anger became strong within her breast she told herself that she would be wrong to bear it she had tried what gentleness would do and she had failed it was now imperatively necessary that she should resort to sterner measures she must make him understand that he must give her authority to send mr thumble to hogglestock  why do you not turn round and speak to me properly she said  i do not want to speak to you at all the bishop answered  this was very badalmost anything would be better than this he was sitting now over the fire with his elbows on his knees and his face buried in his hands she had gone round the room so as to face him and was now standing almost over him but still she could not see his countenance this will not do at all she said my dear do you know that you are forgetting yourself altogether  i wish i could forget myself  that might be all very well if you were in a position in which you owed no service to any one or rather it would not be well then but the evil would not be so manifest you cannot do your duty in the diocese if you continue to sit there doing nothing with your head upon your hands why do you not rally and get to your work like a man  i wish you would go away and leave me he said  no bishop i will not go away and leave you you have brought yourself to such a condition that it is my duty as your wife to stay by you and if you neglect your duty i will not neglect mine  it was you that brought me to it  no sir that is not true i did not bring you to it  it is the truth and now he got up and looked at her for a moment he stood upon his legs and then again he sat down with his face turned towards her it is the truth you have brought on me such disgrace that i cannot hold up my head you have ruined me i wish i were dead and it is all through you that i am driven to wish it  of all that she had suffered in her life this was the worst she clasped both her hands to her side as she listened to him and for a minute or two she made no reply when he ceased from speaking he again put his elbows on his knees and again buried his face in his hands what had she better do or how was it expedient that she should treat him at this crisis the whole thing was so important to her that she would have postponed her own ambition and would have curbed her temper had she thought that by doing so she might in any degree have benefited him but it seemed to her that she could not rouse him by conciliation neither could she leave him as he was something must be done bishop she said the words that you speak are sinful very sinful  you have made them sinful he replied  i will not hear that from you i will not indeed i have endeavoured to do my duty by you and i do not deserve it i am endeavouring to do my duty now and you must know that it would ill become me to remain quiescent while you are in such a state the world around you is observing you and knows that you are not doing your work all i want of you is that you should arouse yourself and go to your work  i could do my work very well he said if you were not here  i suppose then you wish that i were dead said mrs proudie to this he made no reply nor did he stir himself how could flesh and blood bear thisfemale flesh and bloodmrs proudies flesh and blood now at last her temper once more got the better of her judgment probably much to her immediate satisfaction and she spoke out ill tell you what it is my lord if you are imbecile i must be active it is very sad that i should have to assume your authority  i will not allow you to assume my authority  i must do so or must else obtain a medical certificate as to your incapacity and beg that some neighbouring bishop may administer the diocese things shall not go on as they are now i at any rate will do my duty i shall tell mr thumble that he must go over to hogglestock and arrange for the duties of the parish  i desire that you will do no such thing said the bishop now again looking up at her  you may be sure that i shall said mrs proudie and then she left the room  he did not even yet suppose that she would go about this work at once the condition of his mind was in truth bad and was becoming worse probably from day to day but still he did make his calculations about things and now reflected that it would be sufficient if he spoke to his chaplain tomorrow about mr crawleys letter since the terrible scene that dr tempest had witnessed he had never been able to make up his mind as to what great step he would take but he had made up his mind that some great step was necessary there were moments in which he thought that he would resign his bishopric for such resignation without acknowledged incompetence on the score of infirmity the precedents were very few but even if there were no precedents it would be better to do that than to remain where he was of course there would be disgrace but then it would be disgrace from which he could hide himself now there was equal disgrace and he could not hide himself and then such a measure as that would bring punishment where punishment was due it would bring his wife to the groundher who had brought him to the ground the suffering should not be all his own when she found that her income and her palace and her position were all gone then perhaps she might repent the evil that she had done him now when he was left alone his mind went back to this and he did not think of taking immediate measuresmeasures on that very dayto prevent the action of mr thumble  but mrs proudie did take immediate steps mr thumble was at this moment in the palace waiting for instructions it was he who had brought mr crawleys letter to mrs proudie and she now returned to him with that letter in her hand the reader will know what was the result mr thumble was sent off to hogglestock at once on the bishops old cob andas will be rememberedfell into trouble on the road late in the afternoon he entered the palace yard having led the cob by the bridle the whole way home from hogglestock  some hour or two before mr thumbles return mrs proudie returned to her husband thinking it better to let him know what she had done she resolved to be very firm with him but at the same time she determined not to use harsh language if it could be avoided my dear she said i have arranged with mr thumble she found him on this occasion sitting at his desk with papers before him with a pen in his hand and she could see at a glance that nothing had been written on the paper what would she have thought had she known that when he placed the sheet before him he was proposing to consult the archbishop as to the propriety of his resignation he had not however progressed so far as to write even the date of his letter  you have done what said he throwing down the pen  i have arranged with mr thumble as to going out to hogglestock said she firmly indeed he has gone already then the bishop jumped up from his seat and rang the bell with violence what are you going to do said mrs proudie  i am going to depart from here said he i will not stay here to be the mark of scorn for all mens fingers i will resign the diocese  you cannot do that said his wife  i can try at any rate said he then the servant entered john said he addressing the man let mr thumble know the moment he returns to the palace that i wish to see him here perhaps he may not come to the palace in that case let word be sent to his house  mrs proudie allowed the man to go before she addressed her husband again what do you mean to say to mr thumble when you see him  that is nothing to you  she came up to him and put her hand upon his shoulder and spoke to him very gently tom she said is that the way in which you speak to your wife  yes it is you have driven me to it why have you taken upon yourself to send that man to hogglestock  because it was right to do so i came to you for instructions and you would give none  i should have given what instructions i pleased in proper time thumble shall not go to hogglestock next sunday  who shall go then  never mind nobody it does not matter to you if you will leave me now i shall be obliged to you there will be an end of all this very soonvery soon  mrs proudie after this stood for a while thinking what she would say but she left the room without uttering another word as she looked at him a hundred different thoughts came into her mind she had loved him dearly and she loved him still but she knew nowat this moment felt absolutely surethat by him she was hated in spite of all her roughness and temper mrs proudie was in this like other womenthat she would fain have been loved had it been possible she had always meant to serve him she was conscious of that conscious also in a way that although she had been industrious although she had been faithful although she was clever yet she had failed at the bottom of her heart she knew that she had been a bad wife and yet she had meant to be a pattern wife she had meant to be a good christian but she had so exercised her christianity that not a soul in the world loved her or would endure her presence if it could be avoided she had sufficient insight to the minds and feelings of those around her to be aware of this and now her husband had told her that her tyranny to him was so overbearing that he must throw up his great position and retire to an obscurity that would be exceptionally disgraceful to them both because he could no longer endure the public disgrace which her conduct brought upon him in his high place before the world her heart was too full for speech and she left him very quietly closing the door behind her  she was preparing to go up to her chamber with her hand on the banisters and with her foot on the stairs when she saw the servant who had answered the bishops bell john she said when mr thumble comes to the palace let me see him before he goes to my lord  yes maam said john who well understood the nature of these quarrels between his master and his mistress but the commands of the mistress were still paramount among the servants and john proceeded on his mission with the view of accomplishing mrs proudies behests then mrs proudie went upstairs to her chamber and locked her door  mr thumble returned to barchester that day leading the brokendown cob and a dreadful walk he had he was not good at walking and before he came near barchester had come to entertain a violent hatred for the beast he was leading the leading of a horse that is tired or in pain or lame or even stiff in his limbs is not pleasant work the brute will not accommodate his paces to the man and will contrive to make his head very heavy on the bridle and he will not walk on the part of the road which the man intends for him but will lean against the man and will make himself altogether very disagreeable it may be understood therefore that mr thumble was not in a good humour when he entered the palace yard nor was he altogether quiet in his mind as to the injury which he had done to the animal it was the brutes fault said mr thumble it comes generally of not knowing how to ride em said the groom for mr thumble though he often had a horse out of the episcopal stables was not ready with his shillings to the man who waited upon him with the steed  he had not however come to any satisfactory understanding respecting the broken knees when the footman from the palace told him he was wanted it was in vain that mr thumble pleaded that he was nearly dead with fatigue that he had walked all the way from hogglestock and must go home to change his clothes john was peremptory with him insisting that he must wait first upon mrs proudie and then upon the bishop mr thumble might perhaps have turned a deaf ear to the latter command but the former was one which he felt himself bound to obey so he entered the palace rather cross very much soiled as to his outer man and in this condition went up a certain small staircase which was familiar to him to a small parlour which adjoined mrs proudies room and there awaited the arrival of the lady that he should be required to wait some quarter of an hour was not surprising to him but when half an hour was gone and he remembered himself of his own wife at home and of the dinner which he had not yet eaten he ventured to ring the bell mrs proudies own maid mrs draper by name came to him and said that she had knocked twice at mrs proudies door and would knock again two minutes after that she returned running into the room with her arms extended and exclaiming oh heavens sir mistress is dead mr thumble hardly knowing what he was about followed the woman into the bedroom and there he found himself standing awestruck before the corpse of her who had so lately been the presiding spirit of the palace  the body was still resting on its legs leaning against the end of the side of the bed while one of the arms was close clasped round the bedpost the mouth was rigidly closed but the eyes were open as though staring at him nevertheless there could be no doubt from the first glance that the woman was dead he went up close to it but did not dare to touch it there was no one as yet there but he and mrs draperno one else knew what had happened  its her heart said mrs draper  did she suffer from heart complaint he asked  we suspected it sir though nobody knew it she was very shy of talking about herself  we must send for the doctor at once said mr thumble we had better touch nothing till he is here then they retreated and the door was locked  in ten minutes everybody in the house knew it except the bishop and in twenty minutes the nearest apothecary with his assistant were in the room and the body had been properly laid upon the bed even then the husband had not been tolddid not know either his relief or his loss it was now past seven which was the usual hour for dinner at the palace and it was probable that he would come out of his room among the servants if he were not summoned when it was proposed to mr thumble that he should go in to him and tell him he positively declined saying that the sight which he had just seen and the exertions of the day together had so unnerved him that he had not physical strength for the task the apothecary who had been summoned in a hurry had escaped probably being equally unwilling to be the bearer of such a communication the duty therefore fell to mrs draper and under the pressing instance of the other servants she descended to her masters room had it not been that the hour of dinner had come so that the bishop could not have been left much longer to himself the evil time would have been still postponed  she went very slowly along the passage and was just going to pause ere she reached the room when the door was opened and the bishop stood close before her it was easy to be seen that he was cross his hands and face were unwashed and his face was haggard in these days he would not even go through the ceremony of dressing himself before dinner mrs draper he said why dont they tell me that dinner is ready are they going to give me any dinner she stood a moment without answering him while the tears streamed down her face what is the matter said he has your mistress sent you here  oh laws said mrs draperand she put out her hands to support him if such support should be necessary  what is the matter he demanded angrily  oh my lordbear it like a christian mistress isnt no more he leaned back against the doorpost and she took hold of him by the arm it was the heart my lord dr filgrave hisself has not been yet but thats what it was the bishop did not say a word but walked back to his chair before the fire     chapter lxvii  in memoriam   illustration  the bishop when he had heard the tidings of his wifes death walked back to his seat over the fire and mrs draper the housekeeper came and stood over him without speaking thus she stood for ten minutes looking down at him and listening but there was no sound not a word nor a moan nor a sob it was as though he also were dead but that a slight irregular movement of his fingers on the top of his bald head told her that his mind and body were still active my lord she said at last would you wish to see the doctor when he comes she spoke very low and he did not answer her then after another minute of silence she asked the same question again  what doctor he said  dr filgrave we sent for him perhaps he is here now shall i go and see my lord mrs draper found that her position there was weary and she wished to escape anything on his behalf requiring trouble or work she would have done willingly but she could not stand there for ever watching the motion of his fingers  i suppose i must see him said the bishop mrs draper took this as an order for her departure and crept silently out of the room closing the door behind her with the long protracted elaborate click which is always produced by an attempt at silence on such occasions he did not care for noise or for silence had she slammed the door he would not have regarded it a wonderful silence had come upon him which for the time almost crushed him he would never hear that wellknown voice again  he was free now even in his miseryfor he was very miserablehe could not refrain from telling himself that no one could now press uncalledfor into his study contradict him in the presence of those before whom he was bound to be authoritative and rob him of all his dignity there was no one else of whom he was afraid she had at least kept him out of the hands of other tyrants he was now his own master and there was a feelingi may not call it of relief for as yet there was more of pain in it than of satisfactiona feeling as though he had escaped from an old trouble at a terrible cost of which he could not as yet calculate the amount he knew that he might now give up all idea of writing to the archbishop  she had in some ways and at certain periods of his life been very good to him she had kept his money for him and made things go straight when they had been poor his interests had always been her interests without her he would never have been a bishop so at least he told himself now and so told himself probably with truth she had been very careful of his children she had never been idle she had never been fond of pleasure she had neglected no acknowledged duty he did not doubt that she was now on her way to heaven he took his hands down from his head and clasping them together said a little prayer it may be doubted whether he quite knew for what he was praying the idea of praying for her soul now that she was dead would have scandalized him he certainly was not praying for his own soul i think he was praying that god might save him from being glad that his wife was dead  but she was deadand as it were in a moment he had not stirred out of that room since she had been there with him then there had been angry words between themperhaps more determined enmity on his part than ever had before existed and they had parted for the last time with bitter animosity but he told himself that he had certainly been right in what he had done then he thought he had been right then and so his mind went back to the crawley and thumble question and he tried to alleviate the misery which that last interview with his wife now created by assuring himself that he at least had been justified in what he had done  but yet his thoughts were very tender to her nothing reopens the springs of love so fully as absence and no absence so thoroughly as that which must needs be endless we want that which we have not and especially that which we can never have she had told him in the very last moments of her presence with him that he was wishing that she were dead and he had made her no reply at the moment he had felt with savage anger that such was his wish her words had now come to pass and he was a widowerand he assured himself that he would give all that he possessed in the world to bring her back again  yes he was a widower and he might do as he pleased the tyrant was gone and he was free the tyrant was gone and the tyranny had doubtless been very oppressive who had suffered as he had done but in thus being left without his tyrant he was wretchedly desolate might it not be that the tyranny had been good for himthat the lord had known best what wife was fit for him then he thought of a story which he had readand had well marked as he was readingof some man who had been terribly afflicted by his wife whose wife had starved him and beaten him and reviled him and yet this man had been able to thank his god for having thus mortified him in the flesh might it not be that the mortification which he himself had doubtless suffered in his flesh had been intended for his welfare and had been very good for him but if this were so it might be that the mortification was now removed because the lord knew that his servant had been sufficiently mortified he had not been starved or beaten but the mortification had been certainly severe then there came wordsinto his mind not into his mouththe lord sent the thorn and the lord has taken it away blessed be the name of the lord after that he was very angry with himself and tried to pray that he might be forgiven while he was so striving there came a low knock at the door and mrs draper again entered the room  dr filgrave my lord was not at home said mrs draper but he will be sent the very moment he arrives  very well mrs draper  but my lord will you not come to your dinner a little soup or a morsel of something to eat and a glass of wine will enable your lordship to bear it better he allowed mrs draper to persuade him and followed her into the diningroom do not go mrs draper he said i would rather that you should stay with me so mrs draper stayed with him and administered to his wants he was desirous of being seen by as few eyes as possible in these the first moments of his freedom  he saw dr filgrave twice both before and after the doctor had been upstairs there was no doubt dr filgrave said that it was as mrs draper had surmised the poor lady was suffering and had for years been suffering from heartcomplaint to her husband she had never said a word on the subject to mrs draper a word had been said now and againa word when some moment of fear would come when some sharp stroke of agony would tell of danger but mrs draper had kept the secret of her mistress and none of the family had known that there was aught to be feared dr filgrave indeed did tell the bishop that he had dreaded all along exactly that which had happened he had said the same to mr rerechild the surgeon when they two had had a consultation together at the palace on the occasion of a somewhat alarming birth of a grandchild but he mixed up this information with so much medical latin and was so pompous over it and the bishop was so anxious to be rid of him that his words did not have much effect what did it all matter the thorn was gone and the wife was dead and the widower must balance his gain and loss as best he might  he slept well but when he woke in the morning the dreariness of his loneliness was very strong on him he must do something and must see somebody but he felt that he did not know how to bear himself in his new position he must send of course for his chaplain and tell his chaplain to open all letters and to answer them for a week then he remembered how many of his letters in days of yore had been opened and been answered by the helpmate who had just gone from him since dr tempests visit he had insisted that the palace letterbag should always be brought in the first instance to himand this had been done greatly to the annoyance of his wife in order that it might be done the bishop had been up every morning an hour before his usual time and everybody in the household had known why it was so he thought of this now as the bag was brought to him on the first morning of his freedom he could have it where he pleased noweither in his bedroom or left for him untouched on the breakfasttable till he should go to it blessed be the name of the lord he said as he thought of all this but he did not stop to analyse what he was saying on this morning he would not enjoy his liberty but desired that the letterbag might be taken to mr snapper the chaplain  the news of mrs proudies death had spread all over barchester on the evening of its occurrence and had been received with that feeling of distant awe which is always accompanied by some degree of pleasurable sensation there was no one in barchester to lament a mother or a sister or a friend who was really loved there were those doubtless who regretted the womans deathand even some who regretted it without any feeling of personal damage done to themselves there had come to be around mrs proudie a party who thought as she thought on church matters and such people had lost their head and thereby their strength and she had been staunch to her own party preferring bad tea from a lowchurch grocer to good tea from a grocer who went to the ritualistic church or to no church at all and it is due to her to say that she did not forget those who were true to herlooking after them mindfully where looking after might be profitable and fighting their battles where fighting might be more serviceable i do not think that the appetite for breakfast of any man or woman in barchester was disturbed by the news of mrs proudies death but there were some who felt that a trouble had fallen on them  tidings of the catastrophe reached hirams hospital on the evening of its occurrencehirams hospital where dwelt mr and mrs quiverful with all their children now mrs quiverful owed a debt of gratitude to mrs proudie having been placed in her present comfortable home by that ladys patronage mrs quiverful perhaps understood the character of the deceased woman and expressed her opinion respecting it as graphically as did any one in barchester there was the natural surprise felt at the wardens lodge in the hospital when the tidings were first received there and the quiverful family was at first too full of dismay regrets and surmises to be able to give themselves impartially to criticism but on the following morning conversation at the breakfasttable naturally referring to the great loss which the bishop had sustained mrs quiverful thus pronounced her opinion of her friends character youll find that hell feel it q she said to her husband in answer to some sarcastic remark made by him as to the removal of the thorn hell feel it though she was almost too many for him while she was alive  i daresay hell feel it at first said quiverful but i think hell be more comfortable than he has been  of course hell feel it and go on feeling it till he dies if hes the man i take him to be youre not to think that there has been no love because there used to be some words that hell find himself the happier because he can do things more as he pleases she was a great help to him and he must have known that she was in spite of the sharpness of her tongue no doubt she was sharp no doubt she was upsetting and she could make herself a fool too in her struggles to have everything her own way but q there were worse women than mrs proudie she was never one of your idle ones and im quite sure that no man or woman ever heard her say a word against her husband behind his back  all the same she gave him a terribly bad life of it if all is true that we hear  there are men who must have what you call a terribly bad life of it whatever way it goes with them the bishop is weak and he wants somebody near to him to be strong she was strongperhaps too strong but he had his advantage out of it after all i dont know that his life has been so terribly bad i daresay hes had everything very comfortable about him and a man ought to be grateful for that though very few men ever are  mr quiverfuls predecessor at the hospital old mr harding whose halcyon days in barchester had been passed before the coming of the proudies was in bed playing catscradle with posy seated on the counterpane when the tidings of mrs proudies death were brought to him by mrs baxter oh sir said mrs baxter seating herself on a chair by the bedside mr harding liked mrs baxter to sit down because he was almost sure on such occasions to have the advantage of a prolonged conversation  what is it mrs baxter  oh sir  is anything the matter and the old man attempted to raise himself in his bed  you mustnt frighten grandpa said posy  no my dear and there isnt nothing to frighten him there isnt indeed mr harding theyre all well at plumstead and when i heard from the missus at venice everything was going on well  but what is it mrs baxter  god forgive her all her sinsmrs proudie aint no more now there had been a terrible feud between the palace and the deanery for years in carrying on which the persons of the opposed households were wont to express themselves with eager animosity mrs baxter and mrs draper never spoke to each other the two coachmen each longed for an opportunity to take the other before a magistrate for some breach of the law of the road in driving the footmen abused each other and the grooms occasionally fought the masters and mistresses contented themselves with simple hatred therefore it was not surprising that mrs baxter in speaking of the death of mrs proudie should remember first her sins  mrs proudie dead said the old man  indeed she is mr harding said mrs baxter putting both her hands together piously were just grass aint we sir and dust and clay and flowers of the field whether mrs proudie had most partaken of the clayey nature or of the flowery nature mrs baxter did not stop to consider  mrs proudie dead said posy with a solemnity that was all her own then she wont scold the poor bishop any more  no my dear she wont scold anybody any more and it will be a blessing for some i must say everybody is always so considerate in this house miss posy that we none of us know nothing about what that is  dead said mr harding again i think if you please mrs baxter you shall leave me for a little time and take miss posy with you he had been in the city of barchester some fifty years and here was one who might have been his daughter who had come there scarcely ten years since and who now had gone before him he had never loved mrs proudie perhaps he had gone as near to disliking mrs proudie as he had ever gone to disliking any person mrs proudie had wounded him in every part that was most sensitive it would be long to tell nor need it be told now how she had ridiculed his cathedral work how she had made nothing of him how she had despised him always manifesting her contempt plainly he had been even driven to rebuke her and it had perhaps been the only personal rebuke which he had ever uttered in barchester but now she was gone and he thought of her simply as an active pious woman who had been taken away from her work before her time and for the bishop no idea ever entered mr hardings mind as to the removal of a thorn the man had lost his lifes companion at that time of life when such a companion is most needed and mr harding grieved for him with sincerity  the news went out to plumstead episcopi by the postman and happened to reach the archdeacon as he was talking to his sexton at the little gate leading into the churchyard mrs proudie dead he almost shouted as the postman notified the fact to him impossible  it be so for zartain yer reverence said the postman who was proud of his news  heavens ejaculated the archdeacon and then hurried in to his wife my dear he saidand as he spoke he could hardly deliver himself of his words so eager was he to speak themwho do you think is dead gracious heavens mrs proudie is dead mrs grantly dropped from her hand the teaspoonful of tea that was just going into the pot and repeated her husbands words mrs proudie dead there was a pause during which they looked into each others faces my dear i dont believe it said mrs grantly  but she did believe it very shortly there were no prayers at plumstead rectory that morning the archdeacon immediately went out into the village and soon obtained sufficient evidence of the truth of that which the postman had told him then he rushed back to his wife its true he said its quite true shes dead theres no doubt about that shes dead it was last night about seven that was when they found her at least and she may have died about an hour before filgrave says not more than an hour  and how did she die  heartcomplaint she was standing up taking hold of the bedstead and so they found her then there was a pause during which the archdeacon sat down to his breakfast i wonder how he felt when he heard it  of course he was terribly shocked  ive no doubt he was shocked any man would be shocked but when you come to think of it what a relief  how can you speak of it in that way said mrs grantly  how am i to speak of it in any other way said the archdeacon of course i shouldnt go and say it out in the street  i dont think you ought to say it anywhere said mrs grantly the poor man no doubt feels about his wife in the same way that anybody else would  and if any other poor man has got such a wife as she was you may be quite sure that he would be glad to be rid of her i dont say that he wished her to die or that he would have done anything to contrive her death  gracious archdeacon do pray hold your tongue  but it stands to reason that her going will be a great relief to him what has she done for him she has made him contemptible to everybody in the diocese by her interference and his life has been a burden to him through her violence  is that the way you carry out your proverb of de mortuis said mrs grantly  the proverb of de mortuis is founded on humbug humbug out of doors is necessary it would not do for you and me to go into the high street just now and say what we think about mrs proudie but i dont suppose that kind of thing need be kept up in here between you and me she was an uncomfortable womanso uncomfortable that i cannot believe that any one will regret her dear me only to think that she has gone you may as well give me my tea  i do not think that mrs grantlys opinion differed much from that expressed by her husband or that she was in truth the least offended by the archdeacons plain speech but it must be remembered that there was probably no house in the diocese in which mrs proudie had been so thoroughly hated as she had been at the plumstead rectory there had been hatred at the deanery but the hatred at the deanery had been mild in comparison with the hatred at plumstead the archdeacon was a sound friend but he was also a sound enemy from the very first arrival of the proudies at barchester mrs proudie had thrown down her gauntlet to him and he had not been slow in picking it up the war had been internecine and each had given the other terrible wounds it had been understood that there should be no quarter and there had been none his enemy was now dead and the archdeacon could not bring himself to adopt before his wife the nambypamby everyday decency of speaking well of one of whom he had ever thought ill or of expressing regret when no regret could be felt may all her sins be forgiven her said mrs grantly amen said the archdeacon there was something in the tone of his amen which thoroughly implied that it was uttered only on the understanding that her departure from the existing world was to be regarded as an unmitigated good and that she should at any rate never come back again to barchester  when lady lufton heard the tidings she was not so bold in speaking of it as was her friend the archdeacon mrs proudie dead she said to her daughterinlaw this was some hours after the news had reached the house and when the fact of the poor ladys death had been fully recognized what will he do without her  the same as other men do said young lady lufton  but my dear he is not the same as other men he is not at all like other men he is so weak that he cannot walk without a stick to lean upon no doubt she was a virago a woman who could not control her temper for a moment no doubt she had led him a terrible life i have often pitied him with all my heart but nevertheless she was useful to him i suppose she was useful to him i can hardly believe that mrs proudie is dead had he gone it would have seemed so much more natural poor woman i daresay she had her good points the reader will be pleased to remember that the luftons had ever been strong partisans on the side of the grantlys  the news made its way even to hogglestock on the same day mrs crawley when she heard it went out after her husband who was in the school dead said he in answer to her whisper do you tell me that the woman is dead then mrs crawley explained that the tidings were credible may god forgive her all her sins said mr crawley she was a violent woman certainly and i think that she misunderstood her duties but i do not say that she was a bad woman i am inclined to think that she was earnest in her endeavours to do good it never occurred to mr crawley that he and his affair had in truth been the cause of her death  it was thus that she was spoken of for a few days and then men and women ceased to speak much of her and began to talk of the bishop instead a month had not passed before it was surmised that a man so long accustomed to the comforts of married life would marry again and even then one lady connected with lowchurch clergymen in and around the city was named as a probable successor to the great lady who was gone for myself i am inclined to think that the bishop will for the future be content to lean upon his chaplain  the monument that was put up to our old friends memory in one of the side aisles of the choir of the cathedral was supposed to be designed and executed in good taste there was a broken column and on the column simply the words my beloved wife then there was a slab by the column bearing mrs proudies name with the date of her life and death beneath this was the common inscription     requiescat in pace     chapter lxviii  the obstinacy of mr crawley   dr tempest when he heard the news sent immediately to mr robarts begging him to come over to silverbridge but this message was not occasioned solely by the death of mrs proudie dr tempest had also heard that mr crawley had submitted himself to the bishop that instant advantageand as dr tempest thought unfair advantagehad been taken of mr crawleys submission and that the pernicious thumble had been at once sent over to hogglestock had these palace doings with reference to mr crawley been unaccompanied by the catastrophe which had happened the doctor much as he might have regretted them would probably have felt that there was nothing to be done he could not in such case have prevented thumbles journey to hogglestock on the next sunday and certainly he could not have softened the heart of the presiding genius at the palace but things were very different now the presiding genius was gone everybody at the palace would for a while be weak and vacillating thumble would be then thoroughly cowed and it might at any rate be possible to make some movement in mr crawleys favour dr tempest therefore sent for mr robarts  im giving you a great deal of trouble robarts said the doctor but then you are so much younger than i am and ive an idea that you would do more for this poor man than any one else in the diocese mr robarts of course declared that he did not begrudge his trouble and that he would do anything in his power for the poor man i think that you should see him again and that you should then see thumble also i dont know whether you can condescend to be civil to thumble i could not  i am not quite sure that incivility would not be more efficacious said mr robarts  very likely there are men who are deaf as adders to courtesy but who are compelled to obedience at once by illusage very likely thumble is one of them but of that you will be the best judge yourself i would see crawley first and get his consent  thats the difficulty  then i should go on without his consent and i would see thumble and the bishops chaplain snapper i think you might manage just at this moment when they will all be a little abashed and perplexed by this womans death to arrange that simply nothing shall be done the great thing will be that crawley should go on with the duty till the assizes if it should then happen that he goes into barchester is acquitted and comes back again the whole thing will be over and there will be no further interference in the parish if i were you i think i would try it mr robarts said that he would try it i daresay mr crawley will be a little stiffnecked with you  he will be very stiffnecked with me said mr robarts  but i can hardly think that he will throw away the only means he has of supporting his wife and children when he finds that there can be no occasion for his doing so i do not suppose that any person wishes him to throw up his work now that that poor woman has gone  mr crawley had been almost in good spirits since the last visit which mr thumble had made to him it seemed as though the loss of everything in the world was in some way satisfactory to him he had now given up his living by his own doing and had after a fashion acknowledged his guilt by this act he had proclaimed to all around him that he did not think himself to be any longer fit to perform the sacred functions of his office he spoke of his trial as though a verdict against him must be the result he knew that in going into prison he would leave his wife and children dependent on the charity of their friendson charity which they must condescend to accept though he could not condescend to ask it and yet he was able to carry himself now with a greater show of fortitude than had been within his power when the extent of his calamity was more doubtful i must not ask the reader to suppose that he was cheerful to have been cheerful under such circumstances would have been inhuman but he carried his head on high and walked firmly and gave his orders at home with a clear voice his wife who was necessarily more despondent than ever wondered at himbut wondered in silence it certainly seemed as though the very extremity of illfortune was good for him and he was very diligent with his school passing the greater part of the morning with the children mr thumble had told him that he would come on sunday and that he would then take charge of the parish up to the coming of mr thumble he would do everything in the parish that could be done by a clergyman with a clear spirit and a free heart mr thumble should not find that spiritual weeds had grown rank in the parish because of his misfortunes  mrs proudie had died on the tuesdaythat having been the day of mr thumbles visit to hogglestockand mr robarts had gone over to silverbridge in answer to dr tempests invitation on the thursday he had not therefore the command of much time it being his express object to prevent the appearance of mr thumble at hogglestock on the next sunday he had gone to silverbridge by railway and had therefore been obliged to postpone his visit to mr crawley till the next day but early on the friday morning he rode over to hogglestock that he did not arrive there with a brokenkneed horse the reader may be quite sure in all matters of that sort mr robarts was ever above reproach he rode a good horse and drove a neat gig and was always well dressed on this account mr crawley though he really liked mr robarts and was thankful to him for many kindnesses could never bear his presence with perfect equanimity robarts was no scholar was not a great preacher had obtained no celebrity as a churchmanhad in fact done nothing to merit great reward and yet everything had been given to him with an abundant hand within the last twelvemonth his wife had inherited mr crawley did not care to know how many thousand pounds and yet mr robarts had won all that he possessed by being a clergyman was it possible that mr crawley should regard such a man with equanimity robarts rode over with a groom behind himreally taking the groom because he knew that mr crawley would have no one to hold his horse for himand the groom was the source of great offence he came upon mr crawley standing at the school door and stopping at once jumped off his nag there was something in the way in which he sprang out of the saddle and threw the reins to the man which was not clerical in mr crawleys eyes no man could be so quick in the matter of a horse who spent as many hours with the poor and with the children as should be spent by a parish clergyman it might be probable that mr robarts had never stolen twenty poundsmight never be accused of so disgraceful a crimebut nevertheless mr crawley had his own ideas and made his own comparisons  crawley said robarts i am so glad to find you at home  i am generally to be found in the parish said the perpetual curate of hogglestock  i know you are said robarts who knew the man well and cared nothing for his friends peculiarities when he felt his own withers to be unwrung but you might have been down at hoggle end with the brickmakers and then i should have had to go after you  i should have grieved began crawley but robarts interrupted him at once  let us go for a walk and ill leave the man with the horses ive something special to say to you and i can say it better out here than in the house grace is quite well and sends her love she is growing to look so beautiful  i hope she may grow in grace with god said mr crawley  shes as good a girl as i ever knew bytheby you had henry grantly over here the other day  major grantly whom i cannot name without expressing my esteem for him did do us the honour of calling upon us not very long since if it be with reference to him that you have taken this trouble  no no not at all ill allow him and the ladies to fight out that battle ive not the least doubt in the world how that will go when im told that she made a complete conquest of the archdeacon there cannot be a doubt about that  a conquest of the archdeacon  but mr robarts did not wish to have to explain anything further about the archdeacon were you not terribly shocked crawley he asked when you heard of the death of mrs proudie  it was sudden and very awful said mr crawley such deaths are always shocking not more so perhaps as regards the wife of a bishop than with any other woman  only we happened to know her  no doubt the finite and meagre nature of our feelings does prevent us from extending our sympathies to those whom we have not seen in the flesh it should not be so and would not with one who had nurtured his heart with proper care and we are prone to permit an evil worse than that to canker our regards and to foster and to mar our solicitudes those who are high in station strike us more by their joys and sorrows than do the poor and lowly were some young dukes wife wedded but the other day to die all england would put on some show of mourningnay would feel some true gleam of pity but nobody cares for the widowed brickmaker seated with his starving infant on his cold hearth  of course we hear more of the big people said robarts  ay and think more of them but do not suppose sir that i complain of this man or that woman because his sympathies or hers run out of that course which my reason tells me they should hold the man with whom it would not be so would simply be a god among men it is in his perfection as a man that we recognize the divinity of christ it is in the imperfection of men that we recognize our necessity for a christ yes sir the death of the poor lady at barchester was very sudden i hope that my lord the bishop bears with becoming fortitude the heavy misfortune they say that he was a man much beholden to his wifeprone to lean upon her in his goings out and comings in for such a man such a loss is more dreadful perhaps than for another  they say she led him a terrible life you know  i am not prone sir to believe much of what i hear about the domesticities of other men knowing how little any other man can know of my own and i have methinks observed a proneness in the world to ridicule that dependence on a woman which every married man should acknowledge in regard to the wife of his bosom if he can trust her as well as love her when i hear jocose proverbs spoken as to men such as that in this house the gray mare is the better horse or that in that house the wife wears that garment which is supposed to denote virile command knowing that the joke is easy and that meekness in a man is more truly noble than a habit of stern authority i do not allow them to go far with me in influencing my judgment  so spoke mr crawley who never permitted the slightest interference with his own word in his own family and who had himself been a witness of one of those scenes between the bishop and his wife in which the poor bishop had been so cruelly misused but to mr crawley the thing which he himself had seen under such circumstances was as sacred as though it had come to him under the seal of confession in speaking of the bishop and mrs proudienay as far as was possible in thinking of themhe was bound to speak and to think as though he had not witnessed that scene in the palace study  i dont suppose that there is much doubt about her real character said robarts but you and i need not discuss that  by no means such discussion would be both useless and unseemly  and just at present there is something else that i specially want to say to you indeed i went to silverbridge on the same subject yesterday and have come here expressly to have a little conversation with you  if it be about affairs of mine mr robarts i am indeed troubled in spirit that so great labour should have fallen upon you  never mind my labour indeed your saying that is a nuisance to me because i hoped that by this time you would have understood that i regard you as a friend and that i think nothing any trouble that i do for a friend your position just now is so peculiar that it requires a great deal of care  no care can be of any avail to me  there i disagree with you you must excuse me but i do and so does dr tempest we think that you have been a little too much in a hurry since he communicated to you the result of our first meeting  as how sir  it is perhaps hardly worth while for us to go into the whole question but that man thumble must not come here on next sunday  i cannot say mr robarts that the reverend mr thumble has recommended himself to me strongly either by his outward symbols of manhood or by such manifestation of his inward mental gifts as i have succeeded in obtaining but my knowledge of him has been so slight and has been acquired in a manner so likely to bias me prejudicially against him that i am inclined to think my opinion should go for nothing it is however the fact that the bishop has nominated him to this duty and that as i have myself simply notified my desire to be relieved from the care of the parish on account of certain unfitness of my own i am the last man who should interfere with the bishop in the choice of my temporary successor  it was her choice not his  excuse me mr robarts but i cannot allow that assertion to pass unquestioned i must say that i have adequate cause for believing that he came here by his lordships authority  no doubt he did will you just listen to me for a moment ever since this unfortunate affair of the cheque became known mrs proudie has been anxious to get you out of this parish she was a violent woman and chose to take this matter up violently pray hear me out before you interrupt me there would have been no commission at all but for her  the commission is right and proper and just said mr crawley who could not keep himself silent  very well let it be so but mr thumbles coming over here is not proper or right and you may be sure the bishop does not wish it  let him send any other clergyman whom he may think more fitting said mr crawley  but we do not want him to send anybody  somebody must be sent mr robarts  no not so let me go over and see thumble and snappersnapper you know is the domestic chaplain and all that you need do is to go on with your services on sunday if necessary i will see the bishop i think you may be sure that i can manage it if not i will come back to you mr robarts paused for an answer but it seemed for awhile that all mr crawleys impatient desire to speak was over he walked on silently along the lane by his visitors side and when after some five or six minutes robarts stood still in the road mr crawley even then said nothing it cannot be but that you should be anxious to keep the income of the parish for your wife and children said mark robarts  of course i am anxious for my wife and children crawley answered  then let me do as i say why should you throw away a chance even if it be a bad one but here the chance is all in your favour let me manage it for you at barchester  of course i am anxious for my wife and children said crawley repeating his words how anxious i fancy no man can conceive who has not been near enough to absolute want to know how terrible is its approach when it threatens those who are weak and who are very dear but mr robarts you spoke just now of the chance of the thingthe chance of your arranging on my behalf that i should for a while longer be left in the enjoyment of the freehold of my parish it seemeth to me that there should be no chance on such a subject that in the adjustment of so momentous a matter there should be a consideration of right and wrong and no consideration of aught beside i have been growing to feel for some weeks past that circumstanceswhether through my own fault or not is an outside question as to which i will not further delay you by offering even an opinionthat unfortunate circumstances have made me unfit to remain here as guardian of the souls of the people of this parish then there came to me the letter from dr tempestfor which i am greatly beholden to himstrengthening me altogether in this view what could i do then mr robarts could i allow myself to think of my wife and my children when such a question as that was before me for selfdiscussion  i wouldcertainly said robarts  no sir excuse the bluntness of my contradiction but i feel assured that in such emergency you would look solely to dutyas by gods help i will endeavour to do mr robarts there are many of us who in many things are much worse than we believe ourselves to be but in other matters and perhaps of larger moment we can rise to ideas of duty as the need for such ideas comes upon us i say not this at all as praising myself i speak of men as i believe that they will be found to beof yourself of myself and of others who strive to live with clean hands and a clear conscience i do not for a moment think that you would retain your benefice at framley if there had come upon you after much thought an assured conviction that you could not retain it without grievous injury to the souls of others and grievous sin to your own wife and children dear as they are to you and to meas dear to me as to youfade from the sight when the time comes for judgment on such a matter as that they were standing quite still now facing each other and crawley as he spoke with a low voice looked straight into his friends eyes and kept his hand firmly fixed on his friends arm  i cannot interfere further said robarts  noyou cannot interfere further robarts when he told the story of the interview to his wife that evening declared that he had never heard a voice so plaintively touching as was the voice of mr crawley when he uttered those last words  they returned back to the servant and the house almost without a word and robarts mounted without offering to see mrs crawley nor did mr crawley ask him to do so it was better now that robarts should go may god send you through all your troubles said mr robarts  mr robarts i thank you warmly for your friendship said mr crawley and then they parted in about half an hour mr crawley returned to the house now for pindar jane he said seating himself at his old desk     chapter lxix  mr crawleys last appearance in his own pulpit   no word or message from mr crawley reached barchester throughout the week and on the sunday morning mr thumble was under a positive engagement to go out to hogglestock and perform the services of the church dr tempest had been quite right in saying that mr thumble would be awed by the death of his patroness such was altogether the case and he was very anxious to escape from the task he had undertaken at her instance if it were possible in the first place he had never been a favourite with the bishop himself and had now therefore nothing to expect in the diocese the crusts from bits of loaves and the morsels of broken fishes which had come in his way had all come from the bounty of mrs proudie and then as regarded this special hogglestock job how was he to get paid for it whence indeed was he to seek repayment for the actual money which he would be out of pocket in finding his way to hogglestock and back again but he could not get to speak to the bishop nor could he induce any one who had access to his lordship to touch upon the subject mr snapper avoided him as much as possible and mr snapper when he was caught and interrogated declared that he regarded the matter as settled nothing could be in worse taste mr snapper thought than to undo immediately after the poor ladys death work in the diocese which had been arranged and done by her mr snapper expressed his opinion that mr thumble was bound to go out to hogglestock and when mr thumble declared petulantly that he would not stir a step out of barchester mr snapper protested that mr thumble would have to answer for it in this world and in the next if there were no services at hogglestock on that sunday on the saturday evening mr thumble made a desperate attempt to see the bishop but was told by mrs draper that the bishop had positively declined to see him the bishop himself probably felt unwilling to interfere with his wifes doings so soon after her death so mr thumble with a heavy heart went across to the dragon of wantly and ordered a gig resolving that the bill should be sent in to the palace he was not going to trust himself again upon the bishops cob  up to saturday evening mr crawley did the work of his parish and on the saturday evening he made an address to his parishioners from his pulpit he had given notice among the brickmakers and labourers that he wished to say a few words to them in the schoolroom but the farmers also heard of this and came with their wives and daughters and all the brickmakers came and most of the labourers were there so that there was no room for them in the schoolhouse the congregation was much larger than was customary even in the church they will come he said to his wife to hear a ruined man declare his own ruin but they will not come to hear the word of god when it was found that the persons assembled were too many for the schoolroom the meeting was adjourned to the church and mr crawley was forced to get into his pulpit he said a short prayer and then he began his story  illustration they will come to hear a ruined man declare his own ruin  his story as he told it then shall not be repeated now as the same story has been told too often already in these pages surely it was a singular story for a parish clergyman to tell of himself in so solemn a manner that he had applied the cheque to his own purposes and was unable to account for the possession of it was certain he did not know when or how he had got it speaking to them then in gods house he told them that he was to be tried by a jury and all he could do was to tell the jury the same he would not expect the jury to believe him the jury would of course believe only that which was proved to them but he did expect his old friends at hogglestock who had known him so long to take his word as true that there was no sufficient excuse for his conduct even in his own sight this his voluntary resignation of his parish was he said sufficient evidence then he explained to them as clearly as he was able what the bishop had done what the commission had done and what he had done himself that he spoke no word of mrs proudie to that audience need hardly be mentioned here and now dearest friends i leave you he said with that weighty solemnity which was so peculiar to the man and which he was able to make singularly impressive even on such a congregation as that of hogglestock and i trust that the heavy but pleasing burden of the charge which i have had over you may fall into hands better fitted than mine have been for such work i have always known my own unfitness by reason of the worldly cares with which i have been laden poverty makes the spirit poor and the hands weak and the heart soreand too often makes the conscience dull may the latter never be the case with any of you then he uttered another short prayer and stepping down from the pulpit walked out of the church with his weeping wife hanging on his arm and his daughter following them almost dissolved in tears he never again entered that church as the pastor of the congregation  there was an old lame man from hoggle end leaning on his stick near the door as mr crawley went out and with him was his old lame wife hell pull through yet said the old man to his wife youll see else hell pull through because hes so dogged its dogged as does it  on that night the position of the members of mr crawleys household seemed to have been changed there was something almost of elation in his mode of speaking and he said soft loving words striving to comfort his wife she on the other hand could say nothing to comfort him she had been averse to the step he was taking but had been unable to press her objection in opposition to his great argument as to duty since he had spoken to her in that strain which he had used with robarts she also had felt that she must be silent but she could not even feign to feel the pride which comes from the performance of a duty what will he do when he comes out she said to her daughter the coming out spoken of by her was the coming out of prison it was natural enough that she should feel no elation  the breakfast on sunday morning was to her perhaps the saddest scene of her life they sat down the three together at the usual hournine oclockbut the morning had not been passed as was customary on sundays it had been mr crawleys practice to go into the school from eight to nine but on this sunday he felt as he told his wife that his presence would be an intrusion there but he requested jane to go and perform her usual task if mr thumble should come he said to her be submissive to him in all things then he stood at his door watching to see at what hour mr thumble would reach the school but mr thumble did not attend the school on that morning and yet he was very express to me in his desire that i would not myself meddle with the duties said mr crawley to his wife as he stood at the doorunnecessarily urgent as i must say i thought at the time if mrs crawley could have spoken out her thoughts about mr thumble at that moment her words would i think have surprised her husband  at breakfast there was hardly a word spoken mr crawley took his crust and eat it mournfullyalmost ostentatiously jane tried and failed and tried to hide her failure failing in that also mrs crawley made no attempt she sat behind her old teapot with her hands clasped and her eyes fixed it was as though some last day had come upon herthis the first sunday of her husbands degradation mary he said to her why do you not eat  i cannot she replied speaking not in a whisper but in words which would hardly get themselves articulated i cannot do not ask me  for the honour of the lord you will want the strength which bread alone can give you he said intimating to her that he wished her to attend the service  do not ask me to be there josiah i cannot it is too much for me  nay i will not press it he said i can go alone he uttered no word expressive of a wish that his daughter should attend the church but when the moment came jane accompanied him what shall i do mamma she said if i find i cannot bear it try to bear it the mother said try for his sake you are stronger now than i am  the tinkle of the church bell was heard at the usual time and mr crawley hat in hand stood ready to go forth he had heard nothing of mr thumble but had made up his mind that mr thumble would not trouble him he had taken the precaution to request his churchwarden to be early at the church so that mr thumble might encounter no difficulty the church was very near to the house and any vehicle arriving might have been seen had mr crawley watched closely but no one had cared to watch mr thumbles arrival at the church he did not doubt that mr thumble would be at the church with reference to the school he had had some doubt  but just as he was about to start he heard the clatter of a gig up came mr thumble to the door of the parsonage and having come down from his gig was about to enter the house as though it were his own mr crawley greeted him in the pathway raising his hat from his head and expressing a wish that mr thumble might not feel himself fatigued with his drive i will not ask you into my poor house he said standing in the middle of the pathway for that my wife is ill  nothing catching i hope said mr thumble  her malady is of the spirit rather than of the flesh said mr crawley shall we go on to the church  certainlyby all means how about the surplice  you will find i trust that the churchwarden has everything in readiness i have notified to him expressly your coming with the purport that it may be so  youll take a part in the service i suppose said mr thumble  no partno part whatever said mr crawley standing still for a moment as he spoke and showing plainly by the tone of his voice how dismayed he was how indignant he had been made by so indecent a proposition was he giving up his pulpit to a stranger for any reason less cogent than one which made it absolutely imperative on him to be silent in that church which had so long been his own  just as you please said mr thumble only its rather hard lines to have to do it all myself after coming all the way from barchester this morning to this mr crawley condescended to make no reply whatever  in the porch of the church which was the only entrance mr crawley introduced mr thumble to the churchwarden simply by a wave of the hand and then passed on with his daughter to a seat which opened upon the aisle jane was going on to that which she had hitherto always occupied with her mother in the little chancel but mr crawley would not allow this neither to him nor to any of his family was there attached any longer the privilege of using the chancel of the church of hogglestock  mr thumble scrambled into the readingdesk some ten minutes after the proper time and went through the morning service under what must be admitted to be serious difficulties there were the eyes of mr crawley fixed upon him throughout the work and a feeling pervaded him that everybody there regarded him as an intruder at first this was so strong upon him that mr crawley pitied him and would have encouraged him had it been possible but as the work progressed and as custom and the sound of his own voice emboldened him there came to the man some touches of the arrogance which so generally accompanies cowardice and mr crawleys acute ear detected the moment when it was so an observer might have seen that the motion of his hands was altered as they were lifted in prayer though he was praying even in prayer he could not forget the man who was occupying his desk  then came the sermon preached very often before lasting exactly halfanhour and then mr thumbles work was done itinerant clergymen who preach now here and now there as it had been the lot of mr thumble to do have at any rate this reliefthat they can preach their sermons often from the communiontable mr thumble had stated that in the present peculiar circumstances of the parish there would be no second service at hogglestock for the present and this was all he said or did peculiar to the occasion the moment the service was over he got into his gig and was driven back to barchester  mamma said jane as they sat at their dinner such a sermon i am sure was never heard in hogglestock before indeed you can hardly call it a sermon it was downright nonsense  my dear said mr crawley energetically keep your criticisms for matters that are profane then though they be childish and silly they may at least be innocent be critical on euripides if you must be critical but when jane kissed her father after dinner she knowing his humour well felt assured that her remarks had not been taken altogether in ill part  mr thumble was neither seen nor heard of again in the parish during the entire week     chapter lxx  mrs arabin is caught   illustration  one morning about the middle of april mr toogood received a telegram from venice which caused him instantly to leave his business in bedford row and take the first train for silverbridge it seems to me that this job will be a deal of time and very little money said his partner to him when toogood on the spur of the moment was making arrangements for his sudden departure and uncertain period of absence thats about it said toogood a deal of time some expense and no returns its not the kind of business a man can live upon is it the partner growled and toogood went but as we must go with mr toogood down to silverbridge and as we cannot make the journey in this chapter we will just indicate his departure and then go back to john eames who as will be remembered was just starting for florence when we last saw him  our dear old friend johnny had been rather proud of himself as he started from london he had gotten an absolute victory over sir raffle buffle and that alone was gratifying to his feelings he liked the excitement of a journey and especially of a journey to italy and the importance of the cause of his journey was satisfactory to him but above all things he was delighted at having found that lily dale was pleased at his going he had seen clearly that she was much pleased and that she made something of a hero of him because of his alacrity in the cause of his cousin he had partially understoodhad understood in a dim sort of waythat his want of favour in lilys eyes had come from some deficiency of his own in this respect she had not found him to be a hero she had known him first as a boy with boyish belongings around him and she had seen him from time to time as he became a man almost with too much intimacy for the creation of that love with which he wished to fill her heart his rival had come before her eyes for the first time with all the glories of pall mall heroism about him and lily in her weakness had been conquered by them since that she had learned how weak she had beenhow silly how childish she would say to herself when she allowed her memory to go back to the details of her own story but not the less on that account did she feel the want of something heroic in a man before she could teach herself to look upon him as more worthy of her regard than other men she had still unconsciously hoped in regard to crosbie but now that hope had been dispelled as unconsciously simply by his appearance there had been moments in which john eames had almost risen to the necessary pointhad almost made good his footing on the top of some moderate but still sufficient mountain but there had still been a succession of little tumblesunfortunate slips for which he himself should not always have been held responsible and he had never quite stood upright on his pinnacle visible to lilys eyes as being really excelsior of all this john eames himself had an inkling which had often made him very uncomfortable what the mischief was it she wanted of him and what was he to do the days for plucking glory from the nettle danger were clean gone by he was well dressed he knew a good many of the right sort of people he was not in debt he had saved an old noblemans life once upon a time and had been a good deal talked about on that score he had even thrashed the man who had illtreated her his constancy had been as the constancy of a jacob what was it that she wanted of him but in a certain way he did know what was wanted and now as he started for florence intending to stop nowhere till he reached that city he hoped that by this chivalrous journey he might even yet achieve the thing necessary  but on reaching paris he heard tidings of mrs arabin which induced him to change his plans and make for venice instead of for florence a banker at paris to whom he brought a letter told him that mrs arabin would now be found at venice this did not perplex him at all it would have been delightful to see florencebut was more delightful still to see venice his journey was the same as far as turin but from turin he proceeded through milan to venice instead of going by bologna to florence he had fortunately come armed with an austrian passportas was necessary in those bygone days of venetias thraldom he was almost proud of himself as though he had done something great when he tumbled in to his inn at venice without having been in a bed since he left london  but he was barely allowed to swim in a gondola for on reaching venice he found that mrs arabin had gone back to florence he had been directed to the hotel which mrs arabin had used and was there told that she had started the day before she had received some letter from her husband as the landlord thought and had done so that was all the landlord knew johnny was vexed but became a little prouder than before as he felt it to be his duty to go on to florence before he went to bed there would be another night in a railway carriage but he would live through it there was just time to have a tub and a breakfast to swim in a gondola to look at the outside of the doges palace and to walk up and down the piazza before he started again it was hard work but i think he would have been pleased had he heard that mrs arabin had retreated from florence to rome had such been the case he would have folded his cloak around him and have gone onregardless of brigandsthinking of lily and wondering whether anybody else had ever done so much before without going to bed as it was he found that mrs arabin was at the hotel in florencestill in bed as he had arrived early in the morning so he had another tub another breakfast and sent up his card mr john eamesand across the top of it he wrote has come from england about mr crawley then he threw himself on to a sofa in the hotel readingroom and went fast to sleep  john had found an opportunity of talking to a young lady in the breakfastroom and had told her of his deeds i only left london on tuesday night and i have come here taking venice on the road  then you have travelled fast said the young lady  i havent seen a bed of course said john  the young lady immediately afterwards told her father i suppose he must be one of those foreign office messengers said the young lady  anything but that said the gentleman people never talk about their own trades hes probably a clerk with a fortnights leave of absence seeing how many towns he can do in the time its the usual way of travelling nowadays when i was young and there were no railways i remember going from paris to vienna without sleeping luckily for his present happiness john did not hear this  he was still fast asleep when a servant came to him from mrs arabin to say that she would see him at once yes yes im quite ready to go on said johnny jumping up and thinking of the journey to rome but there was no journey to rome before him mrs arabin was almost in the next room and there he found her  the reader will understand that they had never met before and hitherto knew nothing of each other mrs arabin had never heard the name of john eames till johns card was put into her hands and would not have known his business with her had he not written those few words upon it you have come about mr crawley she said to him eagerly i have heard from my father that somebody was coming  yes mrs arabin as hard as i could travel i had expected to find you at venice  have you been at venice  i have just arrived from venice they told me at paris i should find you there however that does not matter as i have found you here i wonder whether you can help us  do you know mr crawley are you a friend of his  i never saw him in my life but he married my cousin  i gave him the cheque you know said mrs arabin  what exclaimed eames literally almost knocked backwards by the easiness of the words which contained a solution for so terrible a difficulty the crawley case had assumed such magnitude and the troubles of the crawley family had been so terrible that it seemed to him to be almost sacrilegious that words so simply uttered should suffice to cure everything he had hardly hopedhad at least barely hopedthat mrs arabin might be able to suggest something which would put them all on a track towards discovery of the truth but he found that she had the clue in her hand and that the clue was one which required no further delicacy of investigation there would be nothing more to unravel no journey to jerusalem would be necessary  yes said mrs arabin i gave it to him they have been writing to my husband about it and never wrote to me and till i received a letter about it from my father and another from my sister at venice the day before yesterday i knew nothing of the particulars of mr crawleys trouble  had you not heard that he had been taken before the magistrates  no not so much even as that i had seen in galignani something about a clergyman but i did not know what clergyman and i heard that there was something wrong about mr crawleys money but there has always been something wrong about money with poor mr crawley and as i knew that my husband had been written to also i did not interfere further than to ask the particulars my letters have followed me about and i only learned at venice just before i came here what was the nature of the case  and did you do anything  i telegraphed at once to mr toogood who i understand is acting as mr crawleys solicitor my sister sent me his address  he is my uncle  i telegraphed to him telling him that i had given mr crawley the cheque and then i wrote to archdeacon grantly giving him the whole history i was obliged to come here before i could return home but i intended to start this evening  and what is the whole history asked john eames  the history of the gift of the cheque was very simple it has been told how mr crawley in his dire distress had called upon his old friend at the deanery asking for pecuniary assistance this he had done with so much reluctance that his spirit had given way while he was waiting in the deans library and he had wished to depart without accepting what the dean was quite willing to bestow upon him from this cause it had come to pass there had been no time for explanatory words even between the dean and his wifefrom whose private funds had in truth come the money which had been given to mr crawley for the private wealth of the family belonged to mrs arabin and not to the dean and was left entirely in mrs arabins hands to be disposed of as she might please previously to mr crawleys arrival at the deanery this matter had been discussed between the dean and his wife and it had been agreed between them that a sum of fifty pounds should be given it should be given by mrs arabin but it was thought that the gift would come with more comfort to the recipient from the hands of his old friend than from those of his wife there had been much discussion between them as to the mode in which this might be done with least offence to the mans feelingsfor they knew mr crawley and his peculiarities well at last it was agreed that the notes should be put into an envelope which envelope the dean should have ready with him but when the moment came the dean did not have the envelope ready and was obliged to leave the room to seek his wife and mrs arabin explained to john eames that even she had not had it ready and had been forced to go to her own desk to fetch it then at the last moment with the desire of increasing the good to be done to people who were so terribly in want she put the cheque for twenty pounds which was in her possession as money of her own along with the notes and in this way the cheque had been given by the dean to mr crawley i shall never forgive myself for not telling the dean she said had i done that all this trouble would have been saved  but where did you get the cheque eames asked with natural curiosity  exactly said mrs arabin i have got to show now that i did not steal ithave i not mr soames will indict me now and indeed i have had some trouble to refresh my memory as to all the particulars for you see it is more than a year past but mrs arabins mind was clearer on such matters than mr crawleys and she was able to explain that she had taken the cheque as part of the rent due to her from the landlord of the dragon of wantly which inn was her property having been the property of her first husband for some years past there had been a difficulty about the rent things not having gone at the dragon of wantly as smoothly as they had used to go at one time the money had been paid halfyearly by the landlords cheque on the bank at barchester for the last yearandahalf this had not been done and the money had come into mrs arabins hands at irregular periods and in irregular sums there was at this moment rent due for twelve months and mrs arabin expressed her doubt whether she would get it on her return to barchester on the occasion to which she was now alluding the money had been paid into her own hands in the deanery breakfastparlour by a man she knew very wellnot the landlord himself but one bearing the landlords name whom she believed to be the landlords brother or at least his cousin the man in question was named daniel stringer and he had been employed in the dragon of wantly as a sort of clerk or managing man as long as she had known it the rent had been paid to her by daniel stringer quite as often as by daniels brother or cousin john stringer who was in truth the landlord of the hotel when questioned by john respecting the persons employed at the inn she said that she did believe that there had been rumours of something wrong the house had been in the hands of the stringers for many yearsbefore the property had been purchased by her husbands fatherand therefore there had been an unwillingness to move them but gradually so she said there had come upon her and her husband a feeling that the house must be put into other hands but did you say nothing about the cheque john asked yes i said a good deal about it i asked why a cheque of mr soamess was brought to me instead of being taken to the bank for money and stringer explained to me that they were not very fond of going to the bank as they owed money there but that i could pay it into my account only i kept my account at the other bank  you might have paid it in there said johnny  i suppose i might but i didnt i gave it to poor mr crawley insteadlike a fool as i know now that i was and so i have brought all this trouble on him and on her and now i must rush home without waiting for the dean as fast as the trains will carry me  eames offered to accompany her and this offer was accepted it is hard upon you though she said you will see nothing of florence three hours in venice and six in florence and no hours at all anywhere else will be a hard fate to you on your first trip to italy but johnny said excelsior to himself once more and thought of lily dale who was still in london hoping that she might hear of his exertions and he felt perhaps also that it would be pleasant to return with a deans wife and never hesitated nor would it do he thought for him to be absent in the excitement caused by the news of mr crawleys innocence and injuries i dont care a bit about that he said of course i should like to see florence and of course i should like to go to bed but i will live in hopes that i may do both some day and so there grew to be a friendship between him and mrs arabin even before they had started  he was driven once through florence he saw the venus de medici and he saw the seggiola he looked up from the side of the duomo to the top of the campanile and he walked round the back of the cathedral itself he tried to inspect the doors of the baptistery and declared that the david was very fine then he went back to the hotel dined with mrs arabin and started for england  the dean was to have joined his wife at venice and then they were to have returned together coming round by florence mrs arabin had not therefore taken her things away from florence when she left it and had been obliged to return to pick them up on her journey homewards hethe deanhad been delayed in his eastern travels neither syria nor constantinople had got themselves done as quickly as he had expected and he had consequently twice written to his wife begging her to pardon the transgression of his absence for even yet a few days longer everything therefore as mrs arabin said has conspired to perpetuate this mystery which a word from me would have solved i owe more to mr crawley than i can ever pay him  he will be very well paid i think said john when he hears the truth if you could see inside his mind at this moment im sure youd find that he thinks he stole the cheque  he cannot think that mr eames besides at this moment i hope he has heard the truth  that may be but he did think so i do believe that he had not the slightest notion where he got it and which is more not a single person in the whole county had a notion people thought that he had picked it up and used it in his despair and the bishop has been so hard upon him  oh mr eames that is the worst of all  so i am told the bishop has a wife i believe  yes he has a wife certainly said mrs arabin  and people say that she is not very goodnatured  there are some of us at barchester who do not love her very dearly i cannot say that she is one of my own especial friends  i believe she has been hard to mr crawley said john eames  i should not be in the least surprised said mrs arabin  then they reached turin and there taking up galignanis messenger in the readingroom of trompettas hotel john eames saw that mrs proudie was dead look at that said he taking the paragraph to mrs arabin mrs proudie is dead mrs proudie dead she exclaimed poor woman then there will be peace at barchester i never knew her very intimately she afterwards said to her companion and i do not know that i have a right to say that she ever did me an injury but i remember well her first coming into barchester my sisters fatherinlaw the late bishop was just dead he was a mild kind dear old man whom my father loved beyond all the world except his own children you may suppose we were all a little sad i was not specially connected with the cathedral then except through my fatherand mrs arabin as she told all this remembered that in the days of which she was speaking she was a young mourning widowbut i think i can never forget the sort of harshtoned pæan of lowchurch trumpets with which that poor woman made her entry into the city she might have been more lenient as we had never sinned by being very high she might at any rate have been more gentle with us at first i think we had never attempted much beyond decency goodwill and comfort our comfort she utterly destroyed goodwill was not to her taste and as for decency when i remember some things i must say that when the comfort and goodwill went the decency went along with them and now she is dead i wonder how the bishop will get on without her  like a house on fire i should think said johnny  fie mr eames you shouldnt speak in such a way on such a subject  mrs arabin and johnny became fast friends as they journeyed home there was a sweetness in his character which endeared him readily to women though as we have seen there was a want of something to make one woman cling to him he could be soft and pleasantmannered he was fond of making himself useful and was a perfect master of all those little caressing modes of behaviour in which the caress is quite impalpable and of which most women know the value and appreciate the comfort by the time that they had reached paris john had told mrs arabin the whole story of lily dale and crosbie and mrs arabin had promised to assist him if any assistance might be in her power  of course i have heard of miss dale she said because we know the de courcys then she turned away her face almost blushing as she remembered the first time that she had seen that lady alexandrina de courcy whom mr crosbie had married it had been at mr thornes house at ullathorne and on that day she had done a thing which she had never since remembered without blushing but it was an old story now and a story of which her companion knew nothingof which he never could know anything that day at ullathorne mrs arabin the wife of the dean of barchester than whom there was no more discreet clerical matron in the diocese hadboxed a clergymans ears  yes said john speaking of crosbie he was a wise fellow he knew what he was about he married an earls daughter  and now i remember hearing that somebody gave him a terrible beating perhaps it was you  it wasnt terrible at all said johnny  then it was you  oh yes it was i  then it was you who saved poor old lord de guest from the bull  go on mrs arabin there is no end of the grand things ive done  youre quite a hero of romance  he bit his lip as he told himself that he was not enough of a hero i dont know about that said johnny i think what a man ought to do in these days is to seem not to care what he eats and drinks and to have his linen very well got up then hell be a hero but that was hard upon lily  is that what miss dale requires said mrs arabin  i was not thinking about her particularly said johnny lying  they slept a night in paris as they had done also at turinmrs arabin not finding herself able to accomplish such marvels in the way of travelling as her companion had achievedand then arrived in london in the evening she was taken to a certain quiet clerical hotel at the top of suffolk street much patronized by bishops and deans of the better sort expecting to find a message there from her husband and there was the messagejust arrived the dean had reached florence three days after her departure and as he would do the journey home in twentyfour hours less than she had taken he would be there at the hotel on the day after tomorrow i suppose i may wait for him mr eames said mrs arabin  i will see mr toogood tonight and i will call here tomorrow whether i see him or not at what hour will you be in  dont trouble yourself to do that you must take care of sir raffle buffle you know  i shant go near sir raffle buffle tomorrow nor yet the next day you mustnt suppose that i am afraid of sir raffle buffle  you are only afraid of lily dale from all which it may be seen that mrs arabin and john eames had become very intimate on their way home  it was then arranged that he should call on mr toogood that same night or early the next morning and that he should come to the hotel at twelve oclock on the next day going along one of the passages he passed two gentlemen in shovelhats with very black new coats and kneebreeches and johnny could not but hear a few words which one clerical gentleman said to the other she was a woman of great energy of wonderful spirit but a firebrand my lorda complete firebrand then johnny knew that the dean of a was talking to the bishop of b about the late mrs proudie     chapter lxxi  mr toogood at silverbridge   we will now go back to mr toogood as he started for silverbridge on the receipt of mrs arabins telegram from venice i gave cheque to mr crawley it was part of a sum of money will write to archdeacon grantly today and return home at once that was the telegram which mr toogood received at his office and on receiving which he resolved that he must start to barchester immediately it isnt certainly what you may call a paying business he said to his partner who continued to grumble but it must be done all the same if it dont get into the ledger in one way it will in another so mr toogood started for silverbridge having sent to his house in tavistock square for a small bag a clean shirt and a toothbrush and as he went down in the railwaycarriage before he went to sleep he turned it all over in his mind poor devil i wonder whether any man ever suffered so much before and as for that womanits ten thousand pities that she should have died before she heard it talk of heartcomplaint shed have had a touch of heartcomplaint if she had known this then as he was speculating how mrs arabin could have become possessed of the cheque he went to sleep  he made up his mind that the first person to be seen was mr walker and after that he would if possible go to archdeacon grantly he was at first minded to go at once out to hogglestock but when he remembered how very strange mr crawley was in all his ways and told himself professionally that telegrams were but bad sources of evidence on which to depend for details he thought that it would be safer if he were first to see mr walker there would be very little delay in a day or two the archdeacon would receive his letter and in a day or two after that mrs arabin would probably be at home  it was late in the evening before mr toogood reached the house of the silverbridge solicitor having the telegram carefully folded in his pocket and he was shown into the diningroom while the servant took his name up to mr walker the clerks were gone and the office was closed and persons coming on business at such timesas they often did come to that housewere always shown into the parlour i dont know whether master can see you tonight said the girl but if he can hell come down  when the card was brought up to mr walker he was sitting alone with his wife its toogood said he poor crawleys cousin  i wonder whether he has found anything out said mrs walker may he not come up here then mr toogood was summoned into the drawingroom to the maids astonishment for mr toogood had made no toilet sacrifices to the goddess or grace who presides over evening society in provincial townsand presented himself with the telegram in his hand we have found out all about poor crawleys cheque he said before the maidservant had closed the door look at that and he handed the telegram to mr walker the poor girl was obliged to go though she would have given one of her ears to know the exact contents of that bit of paper  walker what is it said his wife before walker had had time to make the contents of the document his own  he got it from mrs arabin said toogood  no said mrs walker i thought that was it all along  its a pity you didnt say so before said mr walker  so i did but a lawyer thinks that nobody can ever see anything but himselfbegging your pardon mr toogood but i forgot you were one of us but walker do read it then the telegram was read i gave cheque to mr crawley it was part of a sum of moneywith the rest of it i knew it would come out said mrs walker i was quite sure of it  but why the mischief didnt he say so said walker  he did say that he got it from the dean said toogood  but he didnt get it from the dean and the dean clearly knew nothing about it  ill tell you what it is said mrs walker it has been some private transaction between mr crawley and mrs arabin which the dean was to know nothing about and so he wouldnt tell i must say i honour him  i dont think it has been that said walker had he known all through that it had come from mrs arabin he would never have said that mr soames gave it to him and then that the dean gave it him  the truth has been that he has known nothing about it said toogood and we shall have to tell him  at that moment mary walker came into the room and mrs walker could not constrain herself mary mr crawley is all right he didnt steal the cheque mrs arabin gave it to him  who says so how do you know oh dear i am so happy if its true then she saw mr toogood and curtseyed  it is quite true my dear said mr walker mr toogood has had a message by the wires from mrs arabin at venice she is coming home at once and no doubt everything will be put right in the meantime it may be a question whether we should not hold our tongues mr crawley himself i suppose knows nothing of it yet  not a word said toogood  papa i must tell miss prettyman said mary  i should think that probably all silverbridge knows it by this time said mrs walker because jane was in the room when the announcement was made you may be sure that every servant in the house has been told mary walker not waiting for any further command from her father hurried out of the room to convey the secret to her special circle of friends  it was known throughout silverbridge that night and indeed it made so much commotion that it kept many people for an hour out of their beds ladies who were not in the habit of going out late at night without the fly from the george and vulture tied their heads up in their handkerchiefs and hurried up and down the street to tell each other that the great secret had been discovered and that in truth mr crawley had not stolen the cheque the solution of the mystery was not known to allwas known on that night only to the very select portion of the aristocracy of silverbridge to whom it was communicated by mary walker or miss anne prettyman for mary walker when earnestly entreated by jane the parlourmaid to tell her something more of the great news had so far respected her fathers caution as to say not a word about mrs arabin is it true miss mary that he didnt steal it jane asked imploringly it is true he did not steal it and who did miss mary indeed i wont tell anybody nobody but dont ask any more questions for i wont answer them get me my hat at once for i want to go up to miss prettymans then jane got miss walkers hat and immediately afterwards scampered into the kitchen with the news oh law cook its all come out mr crawleys as innocent as the unborn babe the gentleman upstairs whats just come and was here once beforefor i knowd him immediatei heard him say so and master said so too  did master say so his own self asked the cook  indeed he did and miss mary told me the same this moment  if master said so then there aint a doubt as theyll find him innocent and who tookd it jane  miss mary says as nobody didnt steal it  thats nonsense jane it stands to reason as somebody had it as hadnt ought to have had it but im as glad as anything as how that poor reverend gent ll come offi am they tells me its weeks sometimes before a bit of butchers meat finds its way into his house then the groom and the housemaid and the cook one after another took occasion to slip out of the backdoor and poor jane who had really been the owner of the news was left alone to answer the bell  miss walker found the two miss prettymans sitting together over their accounts in the elder miss prettymans private room and she could see at once by signs which were not unfamiliar to her that miss anne prettyman was being scolded it often happened that miss anne prettyman was scolded especially when the accounts were brought out upon the table sister they are illegible mary walker heard as the servant opened the door for her  i dont think its quite so bad as that said miss anne unable to restrain her defence then as mary entered the room miss prettyman the elder laid her hands down on certain books and papers as though to hide them from profane eyes  i am glad to see you mary said miss prettyman gravely  ive brought such a piece of news said mary i knew youd be glad to hear it so i ventured to disturb you  is it good news said anne prettyman  very good news mr crawley is innocent  both the ladies sprung on to their legs even miss prettyman herself jumped up on to her legs no said anne your father has discovered it said miss prettyman  not exactly that mr toogood has come down from london to tell him mr toogood you know is mr crawleys cousin and he is a lawyer like papa it may be observed that ladies belonging to the families of solicitors always talk about lawyers and never about attorneys or barristers  and does mr toogood say that mr crawley is innocent asked miss prettyman  he has heard it by a message from mrs arabin but you mustnt mention this you wont please because papa has asked me not i told him that i should tell you then for the first time the frown passed away entirely from miss prettymans face and the papers and accountbooks were pushed aside as being of no moment the news had been momentous enough to satisfy her mary continued her story almost in a whisper it was mrs arabin who sent the cheque to mr crawley she says so herself so that makes mr crawley quite innocent i am so glad  but isnt it odd he didnt say so said miss prettyman  nevertheless its true said mary  perhaps he forgot said anne prettyman  men dont forget such things as that said the elder sister  i really do think mr crawley could forget anything said the younger sister  you may be sure its true said mary walker because papa said so  if he said so it must be true said miss prettyman and i am rejoiced i really am rejoiced poor man poor illused man and nobody has ever believed that he has really been guilty even though they may have thought that he spent the money without any proper right to it and now he will get off but dear me mary mr smithe told me yesterday that he had already given up his living and that mr spooner the minor canon was trying to get it from the dean but that was because mr spooner and mrs proudie had quarrelled and as mrs proudie is gone mr spooner very likely wont want to move now  theyll never go and put anybody into hogglestock annabella over mr crawleys head said anne  i didnt say that they would surely i may be allowed to repeat what i hear like another person without being snapped up  i didnt mean to snap you up annabella  youre always snapping me up but if this is true i cannot say how glad i am my poor grace now i suppose there will be no difficulty and grace will become a great lady then they discussed very minutely the chances of grace crawleys promotion  john walker mr winthrop and several others of the chosen spirits of silverbridge were playing whist at a provincial club which had established itself in the town when the news was brought to them though mr winthrop was the partner of the great walker and though john walker was the great mans son i fear that the news reached their ears in but an underhand sort of way as for the great man himself he never went near the club preferring his slippers and tea at home the walkerian groom rushing up the street to the george and vulture paused a moment to tell his tidings to the club porter from the club porter it was whispered respectfully to the silverbridge apothecary who by special grace was a member of the cluband was by him repeated with much cautious solemnity over the cardtable who told you that balsam said john walker throwing down his cards  ive just heard it said balsam  i dont believe it said john  i shouldnt wonder if its true said winthrop i always said that something would turn up  will you bet three to one he is not found guilty said john walker  done said winthrop in pounds that morning the odds in the club against the event had been only two to one but as the matter was discussed the men in the club began to believe the tidings and before he went home john walker would have been glad to hedge his bet on any terms after he had spoken to his father he gave his money up for lost  but mr walkerthe great walkerhad more to do that night before his son came home from the club he and mr toogood agreed that it would be right that they should see dr tempest at once and they went over together to the rectory it was past ten at this time and they found the doctor almost in the act of putting out the candles for the night i could not but come to you doctor said mr walker with the news my friend has brought mrs arabin gave the cheque to crawley here is a telegram from her saying so and the telegram was handed to the doctor  he stood perfectly silent for a few minutes reading it over and over again i see it all he said when he spoke at last i see it all now and i must own i was never before so much puzzled in my life  i own i cant see why she should have given him mr soamess cheque said mr walker  i cant say where she got it and i own i dont much care said dr tempest but i dont doubt but what she gave it him without telling the dean and that crawley thought it came from the dean im very glad i am indeed very glad i do not know that i ever pitied a man so much in my life as i have pitied mr crawley  it must have been a hard case when it has moved him said mr walker to mr toogood as they left the clergymans house and then the silverbridge attorney saw the attorney from london home to his inn  it was the general opinion at silverbridge that the news from venice ought to be communicated to the crawleys by major grantly mary walker had expressed this opinion very strongly and her mother had agreed with her miss prettyman also felt that poetical justice or at least the romance of justice demanded this and as she told her sister anne after mary walker left her she was of opinion that such an arrangement might tend to make things safe i do think he is an honest man and a fine fellow said miss prettyman but my dear you know what the proverb says theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip miss prettyman thought that anything which might be done to prevent a slip ought to be done the idea that the pleasant task of taking the news out to hogglestock ought to be confided to major grantly was very general but then mr walker was of opinion that the news ought not to be taken to hogglestock at all till something more certain than the telegram had reached them early on the following morning the two lawyers again met and it was arranged between them that the london lawyer should go over at once to barchester and that the silverbridge lawyer should see major grantly mr toogood was still of opinion that with due diligence something might yet be learned as to the cheque by inquiry among the denizens of the dragon of wantly and his opinion to this effect was stronger than ever when he learned from mr walker that the dragon of wantly belonged to mrs arabin  mr walker after breakfast had himself driven up in his open carriage to cosby lodge and as he entered the gates observed that the auctioneers bills as to the sale had been pulled down the mr walkers of the world know everything and our mr walker had quite understood that the major was leaving cosby lodge because of some misunderstanding with his father the exact nature of the misunderstanding he did not know even though he was mr walker but had little doubt that it referred in some way to grace crawley if the archdeacons objection to grace arose from the imputation against the father that objection would now be removed but the abolition of the posters could not as yet have been owing to any such cause as that mr walker found the major at the gate of the farmyard attached to cosby lodge and perceived that at that very moment he was engaged in superintending the abolition of sundry other auctioneers bills from sundry other posts what is all this about said mr walker greeting the major is there to be no sale after all  illustration no sale after all  it has been postponed said the major  postponed for good i hope bill to be read again this day six months said mr walker  i rather think not but circumstances have induced me to have it put off  mr walker had got out of the carriage and had taken major grantly aside just come a little further he said ive something special to tell you news reached me last night which will clear mr crawley altogether we know now where he got the cheque  you dont tell me so  yes i do and though the news has reached us in such a way that we cannot act upon it till its confirmed i do not in the least doubt it  and how did he get it  you cannot guess  not in the least said the major unless after all soames gave it to him  soames did not give it to him but mrs arabin did  mrs arabin  yes mrs arabin  not the dean  no not the dean what we know is this that your aunt has telegraphed to crawleys cousin toogood to say that she gave crawley that cheque and that she has written to your father about it at length we do not like to tell crawley till that letter has been received it is so easy you know to misunderstand a telegram and the wrong copying of a word may make such a mistake  when was it received  toogood received it in london only yesterday morning your father will not get his letter as i calculate till the day after tomorrow but perhaps you had better go over and see him and prepare him for it toogood has gone to barchester this morning to this proposition grantly made no immediate answer he could not but remember the terms on which he had left his father and though he had most unwillingly pulled down the auctioneers bills in compliance with his mothers last prayer to himand indeed had angrily told the auctioneer to send him in his bill when the auctioneer had demurred to these proceedingsnevertheless he was hardly prepared to discuss the matter of mr crawley with his father in pleasant wordsin words which should be full of rejoicing it was a great thing for him henry grantly that mr crawley should be innocent and he did rejoice but he had intended his father to understand that he meant to persevere whether mr crawley were innocent or guilty and thus he would now lose an opportunity for exhibiting his obstinacyan opportunity which had not been without a charm for him he must console himself as best he might with the returning prospect of assured prosperity and with his renewed hopes as to the plumstead foxes we think major that when the time comes you ought to be the bearer of the news to hogglestock said mr walker then the major did undertake to convey the news to hogglestock but he made no promise as to going over to plumstead     chapter lxxii  mr toogood at the dragon of wantly   in accordance with his arrangement with mr walker mr toogood went over to barchester early in the morning and put himself up at the dragon of wantly he now knew the following facts that mr soames when he lost his cheque had had with him one of the servants from that innthat the man who had been with mr soames had gone to new zealandthat the cheque had found its way into the hands of mrs arabin and that mrs arabin was the owner of the inn in question so much he believed to be within his knowledge and if his knowledge should prove to be correct his work would be done as far as mr crawley was concerned if mr crawley had not stolen the cheque and if that could be proved it would be a question of no great moment to mr toogood who had stolen it but he was a sportsman in his own line who liked to account for his own fox as he was down at barchester he thought that he might as well learn how the cheque had got into mrs arabins hands no doubt that for her own personal possession of it she would be able to account on her return probably such account would be given in her first letter home but it might be well that he should be prepared with any small circumstantial details which he might be able to pick up at the inn  he reached barchester before breakfast and in ordering his tea and toast reminded the old waiter with the dirty towel of his former acquaintance with him i remember you sir said the old waiter i remember you very well you was asking questions about the cheque which mr soames lost afore christmas mr toogood certainly had asked one question on the subject he had inquired whether a certain man who had gone to new zealand had been the postboy who accompanied mr soames when the cheque was lost and the waiter had professed to know nothing about mr soames or the cheque he now perceived at once that the gist of the question had remained on the old mans mind and that he was recognized as being in some way connected with the lost money  did i ah yes i think i did and i think you told me that he was the man  no sir i never told you that  then you told me that he wasnt  nor i didnt tell you that neither said the waiter angrily  then what the devil did you tell me to this further question the waiter sulkily declined to give any answer and soon afterwards left the room toogood as soon as he had done his breakfast rang the bell and the same man appeared will you tell mr stringer that i should be glad to see him if hes disengaged said mr toogood i know hes bad with the gout and therefore if hell allow me ill go to him instead of his coming to me mr stringer was the landlord of the inn the waiter hesitated a moment and then declared that to the best of his belief his master was not down he would go and see toogood however would not wait for that but rising quickly and passing the waiter crossed the hall from the coffeeroom and entered what was called the bar the bar was a small room connected with the hall by a large open window at which orders for rooms were given and cash was paid and glasses of beer were consumedand a good deal of miscellaneous conversation was carried on the barmaid was here at the window and there was also in a corner of the room a man at a desk with a red nose toogood knew that the man at the desk with the red nose was mr stringers clerk so much he had learned in his former rummaging about the inn and he also remembered at this moment that he had observed the man with the red nose standing under a narrow archway in the close as he was coming out of the deanery on the occasion of his visit to mr harding it had not occurred to him then that the man with the red nose was watching him but it did occur to him now that the man with the red nose had been there under the arch with the express purpose of watching him on that occasion mr toogood passed quickly through the bar into an inner parlour in which was sitting mr stringer the landlord propped among his cushions toogood as he had entered the hotel had seen mr stringer so placed through the two doors which at that moment had both happened to be open he knew therefore that his old friend the waiter had not been quite true to him in suggesting that his master was not as yet down as toogood cast a glance of his eye on the man with the red nose he told himself the old story of the apparition under the archway  mr stringer said mr toogood to the landlord i hope im not intruding  o dear no sir said the forlorn man nobody ever intrudes coming in here im always happy to see gentlemenonly mostly im so bad with the gout  have you got a sharp touch of it just now mr stringer  not just today sir ive been a little easier since saturday the worst of this burst is over but lord bless you sir it dont leave menot for a fortnight at a time now it dont and it aint what i drink nor it aint what i eat  constitutional i suppose said toogood  look here sir and mr stringer shewed his visitor the chalk stones in all his knuckles they say im all a mass of chalk i sometimes think theyll break me up to mark the scores behind my own door with and mr stringer laughed at his own wit  mr toogood laughed too he laughed loud and cheerily and then he asked a sudden question keeping his eye as he did so upon a little square open window which communicated between the landlords private room and the bar through this small aperture he could see as he stood a portion of the hat worn by the man with the red nose since he had been in the room with the landlord the man with the red nose had moved his head twice on each occasion drawing himself closer into his corner but mr toogood by moving also had still contrived to keep a morsel of the hat in sight he laughed cheerily at the landlords joke and then he asked a sudden questionlooking well at the morsel of the hat as he did so mr stringer said he how do you pay your rent and to whom do you pay it there was immediately a jerk in the hat and then it disappeared toogood stepping to the open door saw that the rednosed clerk had taken his hat off and was very busy at his accounts  how do i pay my rent said mr stringer the landlord well sir since this cursed gout has been so bad its hard enough to pay it at all sometimes you aint sent here to look for it sir are you  not i said toogood it was only a chance question he felt that he had nothing more to do with mr stringer the landlord mr stringer the landlord knew nothing about mr soamess cheque whats the name of your clerk said he  the name of my clerk said mr stringer why do you want to know the name of my clerk  does he ever pay your rent for you  well yes he does at times he pays it into the bank for the lady as owns the house is there any reason for your asking these questions sir it isnt usual you know for a stranger sir  toogood during the whole of this time was standing with his eye upon the rednosed man and the rednosed man could not move the rednosed man heard all the questions and the landlords answers and could not even pretend that he did not hear them i am my cousins clerk said he putting on his hat and coming up to mr toogood with a swagger my name is dan stringer and im mr john stringers cousin ive lived with mr john stringer for twelve year and more and im amost as well known in barchester as himself have you anything to say to me sir  well yes i have said toogood  i believe youre one of them attorneys from london said mr dan stringer  thats true i am an attorney from london  i hope theres nothing wrong said the gouty man trying to get off his chair but not succeeding if there is anything wronger than usual dan do tell me is there anything wrong sir and the landlord appealed piteously to mr toogood  never you mind john said dan you keep yourself quiet and dont answer none of his questions hes one of them low sort he is i know him i knowed him for what he is directly i saw him ferreting aboutthats his game to see if theres anything to be got  but what is he ferreting here for said mr john stringer  im ferreting for mr soamess cheque for twenty pounds said mr toogood  thats the cheque that the parson stole said dan stringer hes to be tried for it at the sizes  youve heard about mr soames and his cheque and about mr crawley i daresay said toogood  ive heard a deal about them said the landlord  and so i daresay have you said toogood turning to dan stringer but dan stringer did not seem inclined to carry on the conversation any further when he was hardly pressed he declared that he just had heard that there was some parson in trouble about a sum of money but that he knew no more about it than that he didnt know whether it was a cheque or a note that the parson had taken and had never been sufficiently interested in the matter to make any inquiry  but youve just said that mr soamess cheque was the cheque the parson stole said the astonished landlord turning with open eyes upon his cousin  you be blowed said dan stringer the clerk to mr john stringer the landlord and then walked out of the room back to the bar  i understand nothing about itnothing at all said the gouty man  i understand pretty nearly all about it said mr toogood following the rednosed clerk there was no necessity that he should trouble the landlord any further he left the room and went through the bar and as he passed out along the hall he found dan stringer with his hat on talking to the waiter the waiter immediately pulled himself up and adjusted his dirty napkin under his arm after the fashion of waiters and showed that he intended to be civil to the customers of the house but he of the red nose cocked his hat and looked with insolence at mr toogood and defied him theres nothing i do hate so much as them lowbred old bailey attorneys said mr dan stringer to the waiter in a voice intended to reach mr toogoods ears then mr toogood told himself that dan stringer was not the thief himself and that it might be very difficult to prove that dan had even been the receiver of stolen goods he had however no doubt in his own mind but that such was the case  he first went to the police office and there explained his business nobody at the police office pretended to forget mr soamess cheque or mr crawleys position the constable went so far as to swear that there wasnt a man woman or child in all barchester who was not talking of mr crawley at that very moment then mr toogood went with the constable to the private house of the mayor and had a little conversation with the mayor not guilty said the mayor with incredulity when he first heard the news about crawley but when he heard mr toogoods story or as much of it as it was necessary that he should hear he yielded reluctantly dear dear he said id have bet anything twas he who stole it and after that the mayor was quite sad only let us think what a comfortable excitement it would create throughout england if it was surmised that an archbishop had forged a deed and how much england would lose when it was discovered that the archbishop was innocent as the archbishop and his forgery would be to england so was mr crawley and the cheque for twenty pounds to barchester and its mayor nevertheless the mayor promised his assistance to mr toogood  mr toogood still neglecting his rednosed friend went next to the deanery hoping that he might again see mr harding mr harding was he was told too ill to be seen mr harding mrs baxter said could never be seen now by strangers nor yet by friends unless they were very old friends theres been a deal of change since you were here last sir i remember your coming sir you were talking to mr harding about the poor clergyman as is to be tried he did not stop to tell mrs baxter the whole story of mr crawleys innocence but having learned that a message had been received to say that mrs arabin would be home on the next tuesdaythis being fridayhe took his leave of mrs baxter his next visit was to mr soames who lived three miles out in the country  he found it very difficult to convince mr soames mr soames was more staunch in his belief of mr crawleys guilt than any one whom toogood had yet encountered i never took the cheque out of his house said mr soames but you have not stated that on oath said mr toogood no rejoined the other and i never will i cant swear to it but yet im sure of it he acknowledged that he had been driven by a man named scuttle and that scuttle might have picked up the cheque if it had been dropped in the gig but the cheque had not been dropped in the gig the cheque had been dropped in mr crawleys house why did he say then that i paid it to him said mr soames when mr toogood spoke confidently of crawleys innocence ah why indeed answered toogood if he had not been fool enough to do that we should have been saved all this trouble all the same he did not steal your money mr soames and jem scuttle did steal it unfortunately jem scuttle is in new zealand by this time of course it is possible said mr soames as he bowed mr toogood out mr soames did not like mr toogood  that evening a gentleman with a red nose asked at the barchester station for a secondclass ticket for london by the up nightmail train he was well known at the station and the stationmaster made some little inquiry all the way to london tonight mr stringer he said  yesall the way said the rednosed man sulkily  i dont think youd better go to london tonight mr stringer said a tall man stepping out of the door of the bookingoffice i think youd better come back with me to barchester i do indeed there was some little argument on the occasion but the stranger who was a detective policeman carried his point and mr dan stringer did return to barchester     chapter lxxiii  there is comfort at plumstead   illustration  henry grantly had written the following short letter to mrs grantly when he made up his mind to pull down the auctioneers bills      dear mother     i have postponed the sale not liking to refuse you    anything as far as i can see i shall still be forced to    leave cosby lodge as i certainly shall do all i can to    make grace crawley my wife i say this that there may be    no misunderstanding with my father the auctioneer has    promised to have the bills removed     your affectionate son     henry grantly   this had been written by the major on the friday before mr walker had brought up to him the tidings of mr toogood and mrs arabins solution of the crawley difficulty but it did not reach plumstead till the following morning mrs grantly immediately took the good news about the sale to her husbandnot of course showing him the letter being far too wise for that and giving him credit for being too wise to ask for it henry has arranged with the auctioneer she said joyfully and the bills have been all pulled down  how do you know  ive just heard from him he has told me so come my dear let me have the pleasure of hearing you say that things shall be pleasant again between you and him he has yielded  i dont see much yielding in it  he has done what you wanted what more can he do  i want him to come over here and take an interest in things and not treat me as though i were nobody within an hour of this the major had arrived at plumstead laden with the story of mrs arabin and the cheque and of mr crawleys innocenceladen not only with such tidings as he had received from mr walker but also with further details which he had received from mr toogood for he had come through barchester and had seen mr toogood on his way this was on the saturday morning and he had breakfasted with mr toogood at the dragon of wantly mr toogood had told him of his suspicionshow the rednosed man had been stopped and had been summoned as a witness for mr crawleys trialand how he was now under the surveillance of the police grantly had not cared very much about the rednosed man confining his present solicitude to the question whether grace crawleys father would certainly be shown to have been innocent of the theft theres not a doubt about it major said mr toogood not a doubt on earth but wed better be a little quiet till your aunt comes homejust a little quiet shell be here in a day or two and i wont budge till she comes in spite of his desire for quiescence mr toogood consented to a revelation being at once made to the archdeacon and mrs grantly and ill tell you what major as soon as ever mrs arabin is here and has given us her own word to act on you and i will go over to hogglestock and astonish them i should like to go myself because you see mrs crawley is my cousin and we have taken a little trouble about this matter to this the major assented but he altogether declined to assist in mr toogoods speculations respecting the unfortunate dan stringer it was agreed between them that for the present no visit should be made to the palace as it was thought that mr thumble had better be allowed to do the hogglestock duties on the next sunday as matters went however mr thumble did not do so he had paid his last visit to hogglestock  it may be as well to explain here that the unfortunate mr snapper was constrained to go out to hogglestock on the sunday which was now approachingwhich fell out as follows it might be all very well for mr toogood to arrange that he would not tell this person or that person of the news which he had brought down from london but as he had told various people in silverbridge as he had told mr soames and as he had told the police at barchester of course the tale found its way to the palace mr thumble heard it and having come by this time thoroughly to hate hogglestock and all that belonged to it he pleaded to mr snapper that this report afforded ample reason why he need not again visit that detestable parish mr snapper did not see it in the same light you may be sure mr crawley will not get into the pulpit after his resignation mr thumble said he  his resignation means nothing said thumble  it means a great deal said snapper and the duties must be provided for  i wont provide for them said thumble and so you may tell the bishop in these days mr thumble was very angry with the bishop for the bishop had not yet seen him since the death of mrs proudie  mr snapper had no alternative but to go to the bishop the bishop in these days was very mild to those whom he saw given but to few words and a little astrayas though he had had one of his limbs cut offas mr snapper expressed it to mrs snapper i shouldnt wonder if he felt as though all his limbs were cut off said mrs snapper you must give him time and hell come round byandby i am inclined to think that mrs snappers opinion of the bishops feelings and condition was correct in his difficulty respecting hogglestock and mr thumble mr snapper went to the bishop and spoke perhaps a little harshly of mr thumble  i think upon the whole snapper that you had better go yourself said the bishop  do you think so my lord said snapper it will be inconvenient  everything is inconvenient but youd better go and look here snapper if i were you i wouldnt say anything out at hogglestock about the cheque we dont know what it may come to yet mr snapper with a heavy heart left his patron not at all liking the task that was before him but his wife encouraged him to be obedient he was the owner of a onehorse carriage and the work was not therefore so hard to him as it would have been and had been to poor mr thumble and moreover his wife promised to go with him mr snapper and mrs snapper did go over to hogglestock and the duty was done mrs snapper spoke a word or two to mrs crawley and mr snapper spoke a word or two to mr crawley but not a word was said about the new news as to mr soamess cheque which were now almost current in barchester indeed no whisper about it had as yet reached hogglestock  one word with you reverend sir said mr crawley to the chaplain as the latter was coming out of the church as to the parish work sir during the weeki should be glad if you would favour me with your opinion  about what mr crawley  whether you think that i may be allowed without scandal to visit the sickand to give instruction in the school  surelysurely mr crawley why not  mr thumble gave me to understand that the bishop was very urgent that i should interfere in no way in the ministrations of the parish twice did he enjoin on me that i should not interfereunnecessarily as it seemed to me  quite unnecessary said mr snapper and the bishop will be obliged to you mr crawley if youll just see that the things go on all straight  i wish it were possible to know with accuracy what his idea of straightness is said mr crawley to his wife it may be that things are straight to him when they are buried as it were out of sight and put away without trouble i hope it be not so with the bishop when he went into his school and rememberedas he did remember through every minute of his teachingthat he was to receive no portion of the poor stipend which was allotted for the clerical duties of the parish he told himself that there was gross injustice in the way in which things were being made straight at hogglestock  but we must go back to the major and to the archdeacon at plumsteadin which comfortable parish things were generally made straight more easily than at hogglestock henry grantly went over from barchester to plumstead in a gig from the dragon and made his way at once into his fathers study the archdeacon was seated there with sundry manuscripts before him and with one halffinished manuscriptas was his wont on every saturday morning halloo harry he said i didnt expect you in the least it was barely an hour since he had told mrs grantly that his complaint against his son was that he wouldnt come and make himself comfortable at the rectory  father said he giving the archdeacon his hand you have heard nothing yet about mr crawley  no said the archdeacon jumping up nothing newwhat is it many ideas about mr crawley at that moment flitted across the archdeacons mind could it be that the unfortunate man had committed suicide overcome by his troubles  it has all come out he got the cheque from my aunt  from your aunt eleanor  yes from my aunt eleanor she has telegraphed over from venice to say that she gave the identical cheque to crawley that is all we know at presentexcept that she has written an account of the matter to you and that she will be here herself as quick as she can come  who got the message henry  crawleys lawyera fellow named toogood a cousin of his wifesa very decent fellow added the major remembering how necessary it was that he should reconcile his father to all the crawley belongings hes to be over here on monday and then will arrange what is to be done  done in what way henry  theres a great deal to be done yet crawley does not know himself at this moment how the cheque got into his hands he must be told and something must be settled about the living theyve taken the living away from him among them and then the indictment must be quashed or something of that kind done toogood has got hold of the scoundrel at barchester who really stole the cheque from soamesor thinks that he has its that dan stringer  hes got hold of a regular scamp then i never knew any good of dan stringer said the archdeacon  then mrs grantly was told and the whole story was repeated again with many expressions of commiseration in reference to all the crawleys the archdeacon did not join in these at first being rather shy on that head it was very hard for him to have to speak to his son about the crawleys as though they were people in all respects estimable and wellconducted and satisfactory mrs grantly understood this so well that every now and then she said some halflaughing word respecting mr crawleys peculiarities feeling that in this way she might ease her husbands difficulties he must be the oddest man that ever lived said mrs grantly not to have known where he got the cheque the archdeacon shook his head and rubbed his hands as he walked about the room i suppose too much learning has upset him said the archdeacon they say hes not very good at talking english but put him on in greek and he never stops  the archdeacon was perfectly aware that he had to admit mr crawley to his goodwill and that as for grace crawleyit was essentially necessary that she should be admitted to his heart of hearts he had promised as much it must be acknowledged that archdeacon grantly always kept his promises and especially such promises as these and indeed it was the nature of the man that when he had been very angry with those he loved he should be unhappy until he had found some escape from his anger he could not endure to have to own himself to have been in the wrong but he could be content with a very incomplete recognition of his having been in the right the posters had been pulled down and mr crawley as he was now told had not stolen the cheque that was sufficient if his son would only drink a glass or two of wine with him comfortably and talk dutifully about the plumstead foxes all should be held to be right and grace crawley should be received with lavish paternal embraces the archdeacon had kissed grace once and felt that he could do so again without an unpleasant strain upon his feelings  say something to your father about the property after dinner said mrs grantly to her son when they were alone together  about what property  about this property or any property you know what i meansomething to show that you are interested about his affairs he is doing the best he can to make things right after dinner over the claret mr thornes terrible sin in reference to the trapping of foxes was accordingly again brought up and the archdeacon became beautifully irate and expressed his animositywhich he did not in the least feelagainst an old friend with an energy which would have delighted his wife if she could have heard him i shall tell thorne my mind certainly he and i are very old friends we have known each other all our lives but i cannot put up with this kind of thingand i will not its all because hes afraid of his own gamekeeper and yet the archdeacon had never ridden after a fox in his life and never meant to do so nor had he in truth been always so very anxious that foxes should be found in his covers that fox which had been so fortunately trapped just outside the plumstead property afforded a most pleasant escape for the steam of his anger when he began to talk to his wife that evening about mr thornes wicked gamekeeper she was so sure that all was right that she said a word of her extreme desire to see grace crawley  if he is to marry her we might as well have her over here said the archdeacon  thats just what i was thinking said mrs grantly and thus things at the rectory got themselves arranged  on the sunday morning the expected letter from venice came to hand and was read on that morning very anxiously not only by mrs grantly and the major but by the archdeacon also in spite of the sanctity of the day indeed the archdeacon had been very stoutly antisabbatarial when the question of stopping the sunday post to plumstead had been mooted in the village giving those who on that occasion were the special friends of the postman to understand that he considered them to be numskulls and little better than idiots the postman finding the parson to be against him had seen that there was no chance for him and had allowed the matter to drop mrs arabins letter was long and eager and full of repetitions but it did explain clearly to them the exact manner in which the cheque had found its way into mr crawleys hand francis came up to me she said in her letterfrancis being her husband the deanand asked me for the money which i had promised to make up in a packet the packet was not ready and he would not wait declaring that mr crawley was in such a flurry that he did not like to leave him i was therefore to bring it down to the door i went to my desk and thinking that i could spare the twenty pounds as well as the fifty i put the cheque into the envelope together with the notes and handed the packet to francis at the door i think i told francis afterwards that i put seventy pounds into the envelope instead of fifty but of this i will not be sure at any rate mr crawley got mr soamess cheque from me these last words she underscored and then went on to explain how the cheque had been paid to her a short time before by dan stringer  then toogood has been right about the fellow said the archdeacon  i hope theyll hang him said mrs grantly he must have known all the time what dreadful misery he was bringing upon this unfortunate family  i dont suppose dan stringer cared much about that said the major  not a straw said the archdeacon and then all hurried off to church and the archdeacon preached the sermon in the fabrication of which he had been interrupted by his son and which therefore barely enabled him to turn the quarter of an hour from the giving out of his text it was his constant practice to preach for full twenty minutes  as barchester lay on the direct road from plumstead to hogglestock it was thought well that word should be sent to mr toogood desiring him not to come out to plumstead on the monday morning major grantly proposed to call for him at the dragon and to take him on from thence to hogglestock you had better take your mothers horses all through said the archdeacon the distance was very nearly twenty miles and it was felt both by the mother and the son that the archdeacon must be in a good humour when he made such a proposition as that it was not often that the rectory carriagehorses were allowed to make long journeys a run into barchester and back which altogether was under ten miles was generally the extent of their work i meant to have posted from barchester said the major you may as well take the horses through said the archdeacon your mother will not want them and i suppose you might as well bring your friend toogood back to dinner well give him a bed  he must be a good sort of man said mrs grantly for i suppose he has done all this for love  yes and spent a lot of money out of his own pocket too said the major enthusiastically and the joke of it is that he has been defending crawley in crawleys teeth mr crawley had refused to employ counsel but toogood had made up his mind to have a barrister on purpose that there might be a fuss about it in court he thought that it would tell with the jury in crawleys favour  bring him here and well hear all about that from himself said the archdeacon the major before he started told his mother that he should call at framley parsonage on his way back but he said nothing on this subject to his father  ill write to her in a day or two said mrs grantly and well have things settled pleasantly     chapter lxxiv  the crawleys are informed   major grantly made an early start knowing that he had a long days work before him he had written overnight to mr toogood naming the hour at which he would reach the dragon and was there punctual to the moment when the attorney came out and got into the open carriage while the groom held the steps for him it was plain to be seen that the respect in which he was held at the dragon was greatly increased it was already known that he was going to plumstead that night and it was partly understood that he was engaged with the grantly and arabin faction in defending mr crawley the clergyman against the proudie faction dan stringer who was still at the inn as he saw his enemy get into the plumstead carriage felt himself to be one of the palace party and felt that if mrs proudie had only lived till after the assizes all this heavy trouble would not have befallen him the waiter with the dirty napkin stood at the door and bowed thinking perhaps that as the proudie party was going down in barchester it might be as well to be civil to mr toogood the days of the stringers were probably drawing to a close at the dragon of wantly and there was no knowing who might be the new landlord  henry grantly and the lawyer found very little to say to each other on their long way out to hogglestock they were thinking probably much of the coming interview and hardly knew how to express their thoughts to each other i will not take the carriage up to the house said the major as they were entering the parish of hogglestock particularly as the man must feed the horses so they got out at a farmhouse about half a mile from the church where the offence of the carriage and liveryservant would be well out of mr crawleys sight and from thence walked towards the parsonage the church and the school close to it lay on their way and as they passed by the school door they heard voices within ill bet twopence hes there said toogood they tell me hes always either in one shop or the other ill slip in and bring him out mr toogood had assumed a comfortable air as though the days work was to be good pastime and even made occasional attempts at drollery he had had his jokes about dan stringer and had attempted to describe the absurdities of mr crawleys visit to bedford row all this would have angered the major had he not seen that it was assumed to cover something below of which mr toogood was a little ashamed but of which as the major thought mr toogood had no cause to be ashamed when therefore toogood proposed to go into the school and bring mr crawley out as though the telling of their story would be the easiest thing in the world the major did not stop him indeed he had no plan of his own ready his mind was too intent on the tragedy which had occurred and which was now to be brought to a close to enable him to form any plan as to the best way of getting up the last scene so mr toogood with quick and easy steps entered the school leaving the major still standing in the road mr crawley was in the schoolas was also jane crawley so here you are said toogood thats fortunate i hope i find you pretty well  if i am not mistaken in the identity my wifes relative mr toogood said mr crawley stepping down from his humble desk  just so my friend said toogood with his hand extended just so and theres another gentleman outside who wants to have a word with you also perhaps you wont mind stepping out these are the young hogglestockians are they  illustration these are the young hogglestockians are they  the young hogglestockians stared at him and so did jane jane who had before heard of him did not like him at first sight seeing that her father was clearly displeased by the tone of the visitors address mr crawley was displeased there was a familiarity about mr toogood which made him sore as having been exhibited before his pupils if you will be pleased to step out sir i will follow you he said waving his hand towards the door jane my dear if you will remain with the children i will return to you presently bobby studge has failed in saying his belief you had better set him on again from the beginning now mr toogood and again he waved with his hand towards the door  so thats my young cousin is it said toogood stretching over and just managing to touch janes fingersof which act of touching jane was very chary then he went forth and mr crawley followed him there was the major standing in the road and toogood was anxious to be the first to communicate the good news it was the only reward he had proposed to himself for the money he had expended and the time he had lost and the trouble he had taken its all right old fellow he said clapping his hand on crawleys shoulder weve got the right sow by the ear at last we know all about it mr crawley could hardly remember the time when he had been called an old fellow last and now he did not like it nor in the confusion of his mind could he understand the allusion to the right sow he supposed that mr toogood had come to him about his trial but it did not occur to him that the lawyer might be bringing him news which might make the trial altogether unnecessary if my eyes are not mistaken there is my friend major grantly said mr crawley  there he is as large as life said toogood but stop a moment before you go to him and give me your hand i must have the first shake of it hereupon crawley extended his hand thats right and now let me tell you we know all about the chequesoamess cheque we know where you got it we know who stole it we know how it came to the person who gave it to you its all very well talking but when youre in trouble always go to a lawyer  by this time mr crawley was looking full into mr toogoods face and seeing that his cousins eyes were streaming with tears began to get some insight into the mans character and also some very dim insight into the facts which the man intended to communicate to himself i do not as yet fully understand you sir said he being perhaps in such matters somewhat dull of intellect but it seemeth to me that you are a messenger of glad tidings whose feet are beautiful upon the mountains  beautiful said toogood by george i should think they are beautiful dont you hear me tell you that we have found out all about the cheque and that youre as right as a trivet they were still on the little causeway leading from the school up to the road and henry grantly was waiting for them at the small wicketgate mr crawley said the major i congratulate you with all my heart i could not but accompany my friend mr toogood when he brought you this good news  i do not even yet altogether comprehend what has been told to me said crawley now standing out on the road between the other two men i am doubtless dullvery dull may i beg some clearer word of explanation before i ask you to go with me to my wife  the cheque was given to you by my aunt eleanor  your aunt eleanor said crawley now altogether in the clouds who was the majors aunt eleanor though he had no doubt at different times heard all the circumstances of the connection he had never realized the fact that his daughters lover was the nephew of his old friend arabin  yes by my aunt mrs arabin  she put it into the envelope with the notes said toogoodslipped it in without saying a word to any one i never heard of a woman doing such a mad thing in my life before if she had died or if we hadnt caught her where should we all have been not but what i think i should have run dan stringer to ground too and worked it out of him  then after all it was given to me by the dean said crawley drawing himself up  it was in the envelope but the dean did not know it said the major  gentlemen said mr crawley i was sure of it i knew it weak as my mind may beand at times it is very weaki was certain that i could not have erred in such a matter the more i struggled with my memory the more fixed with me became the factwhich i had forgotten but for a momentthat the document had formed a part of that small packet handed to me by the dean but look you sirsbear with me yet for a moment i said that it was so and the dean denied it  the dean did not know it man said toogood almost in a passion  bear with me yet awhile so far have i been from misdoubting the deanwhom i have long known to be in all things a true and honest gentlemanthat i postponed the elaborated result of my own memory to his word and i felt myself the more constrained to do this because in a moment of forgetfulness in the wantonness of inconsiderate haste with wicked thoughtlessness i had allowed myself to make a false statementunwittingly false indeed nathless very false unpardonably false i had declared without thinking that the money had come to me from the hands of mr soames thereby seeming to cast a reflection upon that gentleman when i had been guilty of so great a blunder of so gross a violation of that ordinary care which should govern all words between man and man especially when any question of money may be in doubthow could i expect that any one should accept my statement when contravened by that made by the dean how in such an embarrassment could i believe my own memory gentlemen i did not believe my own memory though all the little circumstances of that envelope with its rich but perilous freightage came back upon me from time to time with an exactness that has appeared to me to be almost marvellous yet i have told myself that it was not so gentlemen if you please we will go into the house my wife is there and should no longer be left in suspense they passed on in silence for a few steps till crawley spoke again perhaps you will allow me the privilege to be alone with her for one minutebut for a minute her thanks shall not be delayed where thanks are so richly due  of course said toogood wiping his eyes with a large red bandana handkerchief by all means well take a little walk come along major the major had turned his face away and he also was weeping by george i never heard such a thing in all my life said toogood i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it i wouldnt indeed if i were to tell that up in london nobody would believe me  i call that man a hero said grantly  i dont know about being a hero i never quite knew what makes a hero if it isnt having three or four girls dying in love for you at once but to find a man who was going to let everything in the world go against him because he believed another fellow better than himself theres many a chap thinks another man is woolgathering but this man has thought he was woolgathering himself its not natural and the world wouldnt go on if there were many like that hes beckoning and we had better go in  mr toogood went first and the major followed him when they entered the front door they saw the skirt of a womans dress flitting away through the door at the end of the passage and on entering the room to the left they found mr crawley alone she has fled as though from an enemy he said with a little attempt at a laugh but i will pursue her and bring her back  no crawley no said the lawyer shes a little upset and all that kind of thing we know what women are let her alone  nay mr toogood but then she would be angered with herself afterwards and would lack the comfort of having spoken a word of gratitude pardon me major grantly but i would not have you leave us till she has seen you it is as her cousin says she is somewhat overexcited but still it will be best that she should see you gentlemen you will excuse me  then he went out to fetch his wife and while he was away not a word was spoken the major looked out of one window and mr toogood out of the other and they waited patiently till they heard the coming steps of the husband and wife when the door was opened mr crawley appeared leading his wife by the hand my dear he said you know major grantly this is your cousin mr toogood it is well that you know him too and remember his great kindness to us but mrs crawley could not speak she could only sink on the sofa and hide her face while she strove in vain to repress her sobs she had been very strong through all her husbands troublesvery strong in bearing for him what he could not bear for himself and in fighting on his behalf battles in which he was altogether unable to couch a lance but the endurance of so many troubles and the great overwhelming sorrow at last had so nearly overpowered her that she could not sustain the shock of this turn in their fortunes she was never like this sirs when ill news came to us said mr crawley standing somewhat apart from her  the major sat himself by her side and put his hand upon hers and whispered some word to her about her daughter upon this she threw her arms around him and kissed his face and then his hands and then looked up into his face through her tears she murmured some few words or attempted to do so i doubt whether the major understood their meaning but he knew very well what was in her heart  and now i think we might as well be moving said mr toogood ill see about having the indictment quashed ill arrange all that with walker it may be necessary that you should go into barchester the first day the judges sit and if so ill come and fetch you you may be sure i wont leave the place till its all square  as they were going grantlyspeaking now altogether with indifference as to toogoods presenceasked mr crawleys leave to be the bearer of these tidings to his daughter  she can hear it in no tones that can be more grateful to her said mr crawley  i shall ask her for nothing for myself now said grantly it would be ungenerous but hereafterin a few dayswhen she shall be more at ease may i then use your permission  major grantly said mr crawley solemnly i respect you so highly and esteem you so thoroughly that i give willingly that which you ask if my daughter can bring herself to regard you as a woman should regard her husband with the love that can worship and cling and be constant she will i think have a fair promise of worldly happiness and for you sir in giving to you my girlif so it be that she is given to youi shall bestow upon you a great treasure had grace been a kings daughter with a queens dowry the permission to address her could not have been imparted to her lover with a more thorough appreciation of the value of the privilege conferred  he is a rum un said mr toogood as they got into the carriage together but they say hes a very good un to go  after their departure jane was sent for that she might hear the family news and when she expressed some feeling not altogether in favour of mr toogood mr crawley thus strove to correct her views he is a man my dear who conceals a warm heart and an active spirit and healthy sympathies under an affected jocularity of manner and almost with a touch of assumed vulgarity but when the jewel itself is good any fault in the casket may be forgiven  then papa the next time i see him ill like himif i can said jane  the village of framley lies slightly off the road from hogglestock to barchesterso much so as to add perhaps a mile to the journey if the traveller goes by the parsonage gate on their route to hogglestock our two travellers had passed framley without visiting the village but on the return journey the major asked mr toogoods permission to make the deviation im not in a hurry said toogood i never was more comfortable in my life ill just light a cigar while you go in and see your friends toogood lit his cigar and the major getting down from the carriage entered the parsonage it was his fortune to find grace alone robarts was in barchester and mrs robarts was across the road at lufton court miss crawley was certainly in the servant told him and he soon found himself in miss crawleys presence  i have only called to tell you the news about your father said he  what news  we have just come from hogglestockyour cousin mr toogood that is and myself they have found out all about the cheque my aunt mrs arabin the deans wife you knowshe gave it to your father  oh major grantly  it seems so easily settled does it not  and is it settled  yes everything everything about that now he had hold of her hand as if he were going goodby i told your father that i would just call and tell you  it seems almost more than i can believe  you may believe it indeed you may he still held her hand you will write to your mother i daresay tonight tell her i was here goodby now  goodby she said her hand was still in his as she looked up into his face  dear dear dearest grace my darling grace then he took her into his arms and kissed her and went his way without another word feeling that he had kept his word to her father like a gentleman grace when she was left alone thought that she was the happiest girl in christendom if she could only get to her mother and tell everything and be told everything she had no idea of any promise that her lover might have made to her father nor did she make inquiry of her own thoughts as to his reasons for staying with her so short a time but looking back at it all she thought his conduct had been perfect  in the meantime the major with mr toogood was driven home to dinner at plumstead     chapter lxxv  madalinas heart is bleeding   john eames as soon as he had left mrs arabin at the hotel and had taken his travellingbag to his own lodgings started off for his uncle toogoods house there he found mrs toogood not in the most serene state of mind as to her husbands absence mr toogood had now been at barchester for the best part of a weekspending a good deal of money at the inn mrs toogood was quite sure that he must be doing that indeed how could he help himself johnny remarked that he did not see how in such circumstances his uncle was to help himself and then mr toogood had only written one short scrap of a letterjust three words and they were written in triumph crawley is all right and i think ive got the real simon pure by the heels its all very well john mrs toogood said and of course it would be a terrible thing to the family if anybody connected with it were made out to be a thief it would be quite dreadful said johnny not that i ever looked upon the crawleys as connections of ours but however let that pass im sure im very glad that your uncle should have been able to be of service to them but theres reason in the roasting of eggs and i can tell you that money is not so plenty in this house that your uncle can afford to throw it into the barchester gutters think what twelve children are john it might be all very well if toogood were a bachelor and if some lord had left him a fortune john eames did not stay very long in tavistock square his cousins polly and lucy were gone to the play with mr summerkin and his aunt was not in one of her best humours he took his uncles part as well as he could and then left mrs toogood the little allusion to lord de guests generosity had not been pleasant to him it seemed to rob him of all his own merit he had been rather proud of his journey to italy having contrived to spend nearly forty pounds in ten days he had done everything in the most expensive way feeling that every napoleon wasted had been laid out on behalf of mr crawley but as mrs toogood had just told him all this was nothing to what toogood was doing toogood with twelve children was living at his own charges at barchester and was neglecting his business besides theres mr crump said mrs toogood of course he doesnt like it and what can i say to him when he comes to me this was not quite fair on the part of mrs toogood as mr crump had not troubled her even once as yet since her husbands departure  what was johnny to do when he left tavistock square his club was open to him should he go to his club play a game of billiards and have some supper when he asked himself the question he knew that he would not go to his club and yet he pretended to doubt about it as he made his way to a cabstand in tottenham court road it would be slow he told himself to go to his club he would have gone to see lily dale only that his intimacy with mrs thorne was not sufficient to justify his calling at her house between nine and ten oclock at night but as he must go somewhereand as his intimacy with lady demolines was he thought sufficient to justify almost anythinghe would go to bayswater i regret to say that he had written a mysterious note from paris to madalina demolines saying that he should be in london on this very night and that it was just on the cards that he might make his way up to porchester terrace before he went to bed the note was mysterious because it had neither beginning nor ending it did not contain even initials it was written like a telegraph message and was about as long it was the kind of thing miss demolines liked johnny thought and there could be no reason why he should not gratify her it was her favourite game some people like whist some like croquet and some like intrigue madalina would probably have called it romancebecause by nature she was romantic john who was made of sterner stuff laughed at this he knew that there was no romance in it he knew that he was only amusing himself and gratifying her at the same time by a little innocent pretence he told himself that it was his nature to prefer the society of women to that of men he would have liked the society of lily dale no doubt much better than that of miss demolines but as the society of lily dale was not to be had at that moment the society of miss demolines was the best substitute within his reach so he got into a cab and had himself driven to porchester terrace is lady demolines at home he said to the servant he always asked for lady demolines but the page who was accustomed to open the door for him was less false being young and would now tell him without any further fiction that miss madalina was in the drawingroom such was the answer he got from the page on this evening what madalina did with her mother on these occasions he had never yet discovered there used to be some little excuses given about lady demolines state of health but latterly madalina had discontinued her references to her mothers headaches she was standing in the centre of the drawingroom when he entered it with both her hands raised and an almost terrible expression of mystery in her face her hair however had been very carefully arranged so as to fall with copious carelessness down her shoulders and altogether she was looking her best oh john she said she called him john by accident in the tumult of the moment have you heard what has happened but of course you have heard it  heard what i have heard nothing said johnny arrested almost in the doorway by the nature of the questionand partly also no doubt by the tumult of the moment he had no idea how terrible a tragedy was in truth in store for him but he perceived that the moment was to be tumultuous and that he must carry himself accordingly  come in and close the door she said he came in and closed the door do you mean to say that you havent heard what has happened in hook court  nowhat has happened in hook court miss demolines threw herself back into an armchair closed her eyes and clasped both her hands upon her forehead what has happened in hook court said johnny walking up to her  i do not think i can bring myself to tell you she answered  then he took one of her hands down from her forehead and held it in hiswhich she allowed passively she was thinking no doubt of something far different from that  i never saw you looking better in my life said johnny  dont said she how can you talk in that way when my heart is bleedingbleeding then she pulled away her hand and again clasped it with the other upon her forehead  but why is your heart bleeding what has happened in hook court still she answered nothing but she sobbed violently and the heaving of her bosom showed how tumultuous was the tumult within it you dont mean to say that dobbs broughton has come to griefthat hes to be sold out  man said madalina jumping from her chair standing at her full height and stretching out both her arms he has destroyed himself the revelation was at last made with so much tragic propriety in so excellent a tone and with such an absence of all the customary redundances of commonplace relation that i think that she must have rehearsed the sceneeither with her mother or with the page then there was a minutes silence during which she did not move even an eyelid she held her outstretched hands without dropping a finger half an inch her face was thrust forward her chin projecting with tragic horror but there was no vacillation even in her chin she did not wink an eye or alter to the breadth of a hair the aperture of her lips surely she was a great genius if she did it all without previous rehearsal then before he had thought of words in which to answer her she let her hands fall by her side she closed her eyes and shook her head and fell back again into her chair it is too horrible to be spoken ofto be thought about she said i could not have brought myself to tell the tale to a living beingexcept to you  this would naturally have been flattering to johnny had it not been that he was in truth absorbed by the story which he had heard  do you mean to tell me he said that broughton hascommitted suicide she could not speak of it again but nodded her head at him thrice while her eyes were still closed and how was the manner of it said he asking the question in a low voice he could not even as yet quite bring himself to believe it madalina was so fond of a little playful intrigue that even this story might have something in it of the nature of fiction he was not quite sure of the facts and yet he was shocked by what he had heard  would you have me repeat to you all the bloody details of that terrible scene she said it is impossible go to your friend dalrymple he will tell you he knows it all he has been with maria all through i wishi wish it had not been so but nevertheless she did bring herself to narrate all the details with something more of circumstance than eames desired she soon succeeded in making him understand that the tragedy of hook court was a reality and that poor dobbs broughton had brought his career to an untimely end she had heard everythinghaving indeed gone to musselboro in the city and having penetrated even to the sanctum of mr bangles to mr bangles she had explained that she was bosomfriend of the widow of the unfortunate man and that it was her miserable duty to make herself the mistress of all the circumstances mr banglesthe reader may remember him burton and bangles who kept the stores for himalaya wines at 22s 6d the dozen in hook courtwas a bachelor and rather liked the visit and told miss demolines very freely all he had seen and when she suggested that it might be expedient for the sake of the family that she should come back to mr bangles for further information at a subsequent period he very politely assured her that she would do him proud whenever she might please to call in hook court and then he saw her into lombard street and put her into an omnibus she was therefore well qualified to tell johnny all the particulars of the tragedyand she did so far overcome her horror as to tell them all she told her tale somewhat after the manner of Æneas not forgetting the quorum pars magna fui i feel that it almost makes an old woman of me said she when she had finished  no said johnny remonstratingnot that  but it does to have been concerned in so terrible a tragedy takes more of life out of one than years of tranquil existence as she had told him nothing of her intercourse with bangleswith bangles who had literally picked the poor wretch uphe did not see how she herself had been concerned in the matter but he said nothing about that knowing the character of his madalina i shall seethatbody floating before my eyes while i live she said and the gory wound andand dont said johnny recoiling in truth from the picture by which he was revolted never again she said never again but you forced it from me and now i shall not close my eyes for a week  she then became very comfortably confidential and discussed the affairs of poor mrs dobbs broughton with a great deal of satisfaction i went to see her of course but she sent me down word to say that the shock would be too much for her i do not wonder that she should not see me poor maria she came to me for advice you know when dobbs broughton first proposed to her and i was obliged to tell her what i really thought i knew her character so well dear maria i said if you think that you can love him take him i think i can she replied but said i make yourself quite sure about the business and how has it turned out she never loved him what heart she has she has given to that wretched dalrymple  i dont see that he is particularly wretched said johnny pleading for his friend  he is wretched and so youll find she gave him her heart after giving her hand to poor dobbs and as for the business there isnt as much left as will pay for her mourning i dont wonder that she could not bring herself to see me  and what has become of the business  it belongs to mrs van sieverto her and musselboro poor broughton had some little money and it has gone among them musselboro who never had a penny will be a rich man of course you know that he is going to marry clara  nonsense  i always told you that it would be so and now you may perhaps acknowledge that conway dalrymples prospects are not very brilliant i hope he likes being cut out by mr musselboro of course he will have to marry maria i do not see how he can escape indeed she is too good for himonly after such a marriage as that there would be an end to all his prospects as an artist the best thing for them would be to go to new zealand  john eames certainly liked these evenings with miss demolines he sat at his ease in a comfortable chair and amused himself by watching her different little plots and then she had bright eyes and she flattered him and allowed him to scold her occasionally and now and again there might be some more potent attraction when she would admit him to take her handor the like it was better than to sit smoking with men at the club but he could not sit all night even with madalina demolines and at eleven he got up to take his leave when shall you see miss dale she asked him suddenly  i do not know he answered frowning at her he always frowned at her when she spoke to him of miss dale  i do not in the least care for your frowns she said playfully putting up her hands to smooth his brows i think i know you intimately enough to name your goddess to you  she isnt my goddess  a very cold goddess i should think from what i hear i wish to ask you for a promise respecting her  what promise  will you grant it me  how can i tell till i hear  you must promise me not to speak of me to her when you see her  but why must i promise that  promise me  not unless you tell me why johnny had already assured himself that nothing could be more improbable than that he should mention the name of miss demolines to lily dale  very well sir then you may go and i must say that unless you can comply with so slight a request as that i shall not care to see you here again mr eames why should you want to speak evil of me to miss dale  i do not want to speak evil of you  i know that you could not speak of me to her without at least ridicule come promise me you shall come here on thursday evening and i will tell you why i have asked you  tell me now  she hesitated a moment and then shook her head no i cannot tell you now my heart is still bleeding with the memory of that poor mans fate i will not tell you now and yet it is now that you must give me the promise will you not trust me so far as that  i will not speak of you to miss dale  there is my own friend and now john mind you are here at halfpast eight on thursday punctually at halfpast eight there is a thing i have to tell you which i will tell you then if you will come i had thought to have told you today  and why not now  i cannot my feelings are too many for me i should never go through with it after all that has passed between us about poor broughton i should break down indeed i should go now for i am tired then having probably taken a momentary advantage of that more potent attraction to which we have before alluded he left the room very suddenly  he left the room very suddenly because madalinas movements had been so sudden and her words so full of impulse he had become aware that in this little game which he was playing in porchester terrace everything ought to be done after some unaccustomed and special fashion sohaving clasped madalina for one moment in his armshe made a rush at the room door and was out on the landing in a second he was a little too quick for old lady demolines the skirt of whose nightdressas it seemed to johnnyhe saw whisking away in at another door it was nothing however to him if old lady demolines who was always too ill to be seen chose to roam about her own house in her nightdress  when he found himself alone in the street his mind reverted to dobbs broughton and the fate of the wretched man and he sauntered slowly down palace gardens that he might look at the house in which he had dined with a man who had destroyed himself by his own hands he stood for a moment looking up at the windows in which there was now no light thinking of the poor woman whom he had seen in the midst of luxury and who was now left a widow in such miserable circumstances as for the suggestion that his friend conway would marry her he did not believe it for a moment he knew too well what the suggestions of his madalina were worth and the motives from which they sprung but he thought it might be true that mrs van siever had absorbed all there was of property and possibly also that musselboro was to marry her daughter at any rate he would go to dalrymples rooms and if he could find him would learn the truth he knew enough of dalrymples ways of life and of the ways of his friends chambers and studio to care nothing for the lateness of the hour and in a very few minutes he was sitting in dalrymples armchair he found siph dunn there smoking in unperturbed tranquillity and as long as that lasted he could ask no questions about mrs broughton he told them therefore of his adventures abroad and of crawleys escape but at last having finished his third pipe siph dunn took his leave  tell me said john as soon as dunn had closed the door what is this i hear about dobbs broughton  he has blown his brains out that is all  how terribly shocking  yes it shocked us all at first we are used to it now  and the business  that had gone to the dogs they say at least that his share of it had done so  and he was ruined  they say so that is musselboro says so and mrs van siever  and what do you say conway  the less i say the better i have my hopesonly youre such a talkative fellow one cant trust you  i never told any secret of yours old fellow  wellthe fact is i have an idea that something may be saved for the poor woman i think that they are wronging her of course all i can do is to put the matter into a lawyers hands and pay the lawyers bill so i went to your cousin and he has taken the case up i hope he wont ruin me  then i suppose you are quarrelling with mrs van  that doesnt matter she has quarrelled with me  and what about jael conway they tell me that jael is going to become mrs musselboro  who has told you that  a bird  yes i know who the bird is i dont think that jael will become mrs musselboro i dont think that jael would become mrs musselboro if jael were the only woman and musselboro the only man in london to tell you a little bit of secret johnny i think that jael will become the wife of one conway dalrymple that is my opinion and as far as i can judge it is the opinion of jael also  but not the opinion of mrs van the bird told me another thing conway  what was the other thing  the bird hinted that all this would end in your marrying the widow of that poor wretch who destroyed himself  johnny my boy said the artist after a moments silence if i give you a bit of advice will you profit by it  ill try if its not disagreeable  whether you profit by it or whether you do not keep it to yourself i know the bird better than you do and i strongly caution you to beware of the bird the bird is a bird of prey and altogether an unclean bird the bird wants a mate and doesnt much care how she finds one and the bird wants money and doesnt much care how she gets it the bird is a decidedly bad bird and not at all fit to take the place of domestic hen in a decent farmyard in plain english johnny youll find some day if you go over too often to porchester terrace either that you are going to marry the bird or else that you are employing your cousin toogood for your defence in an action for breach of promise brought against you by that venerable old bird the birds mamma  if its to be either it will be the latter said johnny as he took up his hat to go away     chapter lxxvi  i think he is light of heart   illustration  mrs arabin remained one day in town mr toogood in spite of his asseveration that he would not budge from barchester till he had seen mr crawley through all his troubles did run up to london as soon as the news reached him that john eames had returned he came up and took mrs arabins deposition which he sent down to mr walker it might still be necessary mrs arabin was told that she should go into court and there state on oath that she had given the cheque to mr crawley but mr walker was of opinion that the circumstances would enable the judge to call upon the grand jury not to find a true bill against mr crawley and that the whole affair as far as mr crawley was concerned would thus be brought to an end toogood was still very anxious to place dan stringer in the dock but mr walker declared that they would fail if they made the attempt dan had been examined before the magistrates at barchester and had persisted in his statement that he had heard nothing about mr crawley and the cheque this he said in the teeth of the words which had fallen from him unawares in the presence of mr toogood but they could not punish him for a lienot even for such a lie as that he was not upon oath and they could not make him responsible to the law because he had held his tongue upon a matter as to which it was manifest to them all that he had known the whole history during the entire period of mr crawleys persecution they could only call upon him to account for his possession of the cheque and this he did by saying it had been paid to him by jem scuttle who received all moneys appertaining to the hotel stables and accounted for them once a week jem scuttle had simply told him that he had taken the cheque from mr soames and jem had since gone to new zealand it was quite true that jems departure had followed suspiciously close upon the payment of the rent to mrs arabin and that jem had been in close amity with dan stringer up to the moment of his departure that dan stringer had not become honestly possessed of the cheque everybody knew but nevertheless the magistrates were of opinion mr walker coinciding with them that there was no evidence against him sufficient to secure a conviction the story however of mr crawleys injuries was so well known in barchester and the feeling against the man who had permitted him to be thus injured was so strong that dan stringer did not altogether escape without punishment some rough spirits in barchester called one night at the dragon of wantly and begged that mr dan stringer would be kind enough to come out and take a walk with them that evening and when it was intimated to them that dan stringer had not just then any desire for such exercise they requested to be allowed to go into the back parlour and make an evening with dan stringer in that recess there was a terrible row at the dragon of wantly that night and dan with difficulty was rescued by the police on the following morning he was smuggled out of barchester by an early train and has never more been seen in that city rumours of him however were soon heard from which it appeared that he had made himself acquainted with the casual ward of more than one workhouse in london his cousin john left the inn almost immediatelyas indeed he must have done had there been no question of mr soamess chequeand then there was nothing more heard of the stringers in barchester  mrs arabin remained in town one day and would have remained longer waiting for her husband had not a letter from her sister impressed upon her that it might be as well that she should be with their father as soon as possible i dont mean to make you think that there is any immediate danger mrs grantly said and indeed we cannot say that he is ill but it seems that the extremity of old age has come upon him almost suddenly and that he is as weak as a child his only delight is with the children especially with posy whose gravity in her management of him is wonderful he has not left his room now for more than a week and he eats very little it may be that he will live yet for years but i should be deceiving you if i did not let you know that both the archdeacon and i think that the time of his departure from us is near at hand after reading this letter mrs arabin could not wait in town for her husband even though he was expected in two days and though she had been told that her presence at barchester was not immediately required on behalf of mr crawley  but during that one day she kept her promise to john eames by going to lily dale mrs arabin had become very fond of johnny and felt that he deserved the prize which he had been so long trying to win the reader perhaps may not agree with mrs arabin the reader who may have caught a closer insight into johnnys character than mrs arabin had obtained may perhaps think that a young man who could amuse himself with miss demolines was unworthy of lily dale if so i may declare for myself that i and the reader are not in accord about john eames it is hard to measure worth and worthlessness in such matters as there is no standard for such measurement my old friend john was certainly no herowas very unheroic in many phases of his life but then if all the girls are to wait for heroes i fear that the difficulties in the way of matrimonial arrangements great as they are at present will be very seriously enhanced johnny was not ecstatic nor heroic nor transcendental nor very beautiful in his manliness he was not a man to break his heart for love or to have his story written in an epic but he was an affectionate kindly honest young man and i think most girls might have done worse than take him whether he was wise to ask assistance in his lovemaking so often as he had done that may be another question  mrs arabin was intimately acquainted with mrs thorne and therefore there was nothing odd in her going to mrs thornes house mrs thorne was very glad to see her and told her all the barsetshire newsmuch more than mrs arabin would have learned in a week at the deanery for mrs thorne had a marvellous gift of picking up news she had already heard the whole story of mr soamess cheque and expressed her conviction that the least that could be done in amends to mr crawley was to make him a bishop and you see the palace is vacant said mrs thorne  the palace vacant said mrs arabin  it is just as good now that mrs proudie has gone i dont suppose the poor bishop will count for much i can assure you mrs arabin i felt that poor womans death so much she used to regard me as one of the staunchest of the proudieites she once whispered to me such a delightfully wicked story about the dean and the archdeacon when i told her that they were my particular friends she put on a look of horror but i dont think she believed me then emily dunstable entered the room and with her came lily dale mrs arabin had never before seen lily and of course they were introduced i am sorry to say miss dale is going home to allington tomorrow said emily but she is coming to chaldicotes in may said mrs thorne of course mrs arabin you know what gala doings we are going to have in may then there were various civil little speeches made on each side and mrs arabin expressed a wish that she might meet miss dale again in barsetshire but all this did not bring her at all nearer to her object  i particularly wish to say a word to miss dalehere today if she will allow me said mrs arabin  im sure she willtwenty words wont you lily said mrs thorne preparing to leave the room then mrs arabin apologized and mrs thorne bustling up said that it did not signify and lily remaining quite still on the sofa wondered what it was all aboutand in two minutes lily and mrs arabin were alone together lily had just time to surmise that mrs arabins visit must have some reference to mr crosbieremembering that crosbie had married his wife out of barsetshire and forgetting altogether that mrs arabin had been just brought home from italy by john eames  i am afraid miss dale you will think me very impertinent said mrs arabin  i am sure i shall not think that said lily  i believe you knew before mr eames started that he was going to italy to find me and my husband said mrs arabin then lily put mr crosbie altogether out of her head and became aware that he was not to be the subject of the coming conversation she was almost sorry that it was so there was no doubt in her mind as to what she would have said to any one who might have taken up crosbies cause on that matter she could now have given a very decisive answer in a few words but on that other matter she was much more in doubt she remembered however every word of the note she had received from m d she remembered also the words of johns note to that young woman and her heart was still hard against him yes she said mr eames came here one night and told us why he was going i was very glad that he was going because i thought it was right  you know of course how successful he has been it was i who gave the cheque to mr crawley  so mrs thorne has heard dr thorne has written to tell her the whole story  and now ive come to look for mr eamess reward  his reward mrs arabin  yes or rather to plead for him you will not i hope be angry with him because he has told me much of his history while we were travelling home alone together  oh no said lily smiling how could he have chosen a better friend in whom to trust  he could certainly have chosen none who would take his part more sincerely he is so good and so amiable he is so pleasant in his ways and so fitted to make a woman happy and then miss dale he is also so devoted  he is an old friend of ours mrs arabin  so he has told me  and we all of us love him dearly mamma is very much attached to him  unless he flatters himself there is no one belonging to you who would not wish that he should be nearer and dearer still  it may be so i do not say that it is not so mamma and my uncle are both fond of him  and does not that go a long way said mrs arabin  it ought not to do so said lily it ought not to go any way at all  ought it not it seems to me that i could never have brought myself to marry any one whom my old friends had not liked  ah that is another thing  but is it not a recommendation to a man that he has been so successful with your friends as to make them all feel that you might trust yourself to him with perfect safety to this lily made no answer and mrs arabin went on to plead her friends cause with all the eloquence she could use insisting on all his virtues his good temper his kindness his constancyand not forgetting the fact that the world was inclined to use him very well still lily made no answer she had promised mrs arabin that she would not regard her interference as impertinent and therefore she refrained from any word that might seem to show offence nor did she feel offence it was something gained by john eames in lilys estimation that he should have such a friend as mrs arabin to take an interest in his welfare but there was a selfdependence perhaps one may call it an obstinacy about lily dale which made her determined that she would not be driven hither or thither by any pressure from without why had john eames at the very moment when he should have been doing his best to drive from her breast the memory of past follieswhen he would have striven to do so had he really been earnest in his suitwhy at such a moment had he allowed himself to correspond in terms of affection with such a woman as this m d while mrs arabin was pleading for john eames lily was repeating to herself certain words which john had written to the womanever and always yours unalterably such were not the exact words but such was the form in which lily dishonestly chose to repeat them to herself and why was it so with her in the old days she would have forgiven crosbie any offence at a word or a lookany possible letter to any m d let her have been ever so abominable nayhad she not even forgiven him the offence of deserting herself altogether on behalf of a woman as detestable as could be any m d of johnnys choosinga woman whose only recommendation had been her title and yet she would not forgive john eames though the evidence against him was of so flimsy a naturebut rather strove to turn the flimsiness of that evidence into strength why was it so unheroic as he might be john eames was surely a better man and a bigger man than adolphus crosbie it was simply thisshe had fallen in love with the one and had never fallen in love with the other she had fallen in love with the one man though in her simple way she had made a struggle against such feeling and she had not come to love the other man though she had told herself that it would be well that she should do so if it were possible again and again she had half declared to herself that she would take him as her husband and leave the love to come afterwards but when the moment came for doing so she could not do it  may i not say a word of comfort to him said mrs arabin  he will be very comfortable without any such word said lily laughing  but he is not comfortable of that you may be very sure yours ever and unalterably j e said lily to herself you do not doubt his affection continued mrs arabin  i neither doubt it nor credit it  then i think you wrong him and the reason why i have ventured to come to you is that you may know the impression which he has made upon one who was but the other day a stranger to him i am sure that he loves you  i think he is light of heart  oh no miss dale  and how am i to become his wife unless i love him well enough myself mrs arabin i have made up my mind about it i shall never become any mans wife mamma and i are all in all together and we shall remain together as soon as these words were out of her mouth she hated herself for having spoken them there was a maudlin missish nambymamby sentimentality about them which disgusted her she specially desired to be straightforward resolute of purpose honestspoken and free from all touch of affectation and yet she had excused herself from marrying john eames after the fashion of a sick schoolgirl it is no good talking about it any more she said getting up from her chair quickly  you are not angry with meor at any rate you will forgive me  im quite sure you have meant to be very good and i am not a bit angry  and you will see him before you go  oh yes that is if he likes to come today or early tomorrow i go home tomorrow i cannot refuse him because he is such an old friendalmost like a brother but it is of no use mrs arabin then mrs arabin kissed her and left her telling her that mr eames would come to her that afternoon at halfpast five lily promised that she would be at home to receive him  wont you ride with us for the last time said emily dunstable when lily gave notice that she would not want the horse on that afternoon  no not today  youll never have another opportunity of riding with emily dunstable said the bride electat least i hope not  even under those circumstances i must refuse though i would give a guinea to be with you john eames is coming here to say goodby  oh then indeed you must not come with us lily what will you say to him  nothing  oh lily think of it  i have thought of it i have thought of nothing else i am tired of thinking of it it is not good to think of anything so much what does it matter  it is very good to have some one to love one better than all the world besides  i have some one said lily thinking of her mother but not caring to descend again to the mawkish weakness of talking about her  yes but some one to be always with you to do everything for you to be your very own  it is all very well for you said lily and i think that bernard is the luckiest fellow in the world but it will not do for me i know in what college ill take my degree and i wish theyd let me write the letters after my name as the men do  what letters lily  om for old maid i dont see why it shouldnt be as good as ba for bachelor of arts it would mean a great deal more     chapter lxxvii  the shattered tree   when mrs arabin saw johnny in the middle of that day she could hardly give him much encouragement and yet she felt by no means sure that he might not succeed even yet lily had been very positive in her answers and yet there had been something either in her words or in the tone of her voice which had made mrs arabin feel that even lily was not quite sure of herself there was still room for relenting nothing however had been said which could justify her in bidding john eames simply to go in and win i think he is light of heart lily had said those were the words which of all that had been spoken most impressed themselves on mrs arabins memory she would not repeat them to her friend but she would graft upon them such advice as she had to give him  and this she did telling him that she thought that perhaps lily doubted his actual earnestness i would marry her this moment said johnny but that was not enough as mrs arabin knew to prove his earnestness many men fickle as weathercocks are ready to marry at the momentare ready to marry at the moment because they are fickle and think so little about it but she hears perhaps of your liking other people said mrs arabin i dont care a straw for any other person said johnny i wonder whether if i was to shut myself up in a cage for six months it would do any good if she had the keeping of the cage perhaps it might said mrs arabin she had nothing more to say to him on that subject but to tell him that miss dale would expect him that afternoon at halfpast five i told her that you would come to wish her goodby and she promised to see you  i wish shed say she wouldnt see me then there would be some chance said johnny  between him and mrs arabin the parting was very affectionate she told him how thankful she was for his kindness in coming to her and how grateful she would ever beand the dean alsofor his attention to her remember mr eames that you will always be most welcome at the deanery of barchester and i do hope that before long you may be there with your wife and so they parted  he left her at about two and went to mr toogoods office in bedford row he found his uncle and the two went out to lunch together in holborn between them there was no word said about lily dale and john was glad to have some other subject in his mind for half an hour toogood was full of his triumph about mr crawley and of his successes in barsetshire he gave john a long account of his visit to plumstead and expressed his opinion that if all clergymen were like the archdeacon there would not be so much room for dissenters ive seen a good many parsons in my time said toogood but i dont think i ever saw such a one as him you know he is a clergyman somehow and he never lets you forget it but thats about all most of em are never contented without choking you with their white cravats all the time youre with em as for crawley himself mr toogood continued hes not like anybody else that ever was born saint or sinner parson or layman i never heard of such a man in all my experience though he knew where he got the cheque as well as i know it now he wouldnt say so because the dean had said it wasnt so somebody ought to write a book about itindeed they ought then he told the whole story of dan stringer and how he had found dan out looking at the top of dans hat through the little aperture in the wall of the inn parlour when i saw the twitch in his hat john i knew he had handled the cheque himself i dont mean to say that im sharper than another man and i dont think so but i do mean to say that when you are in any difficulty of that sort you ought to go to a lawyer its his business and a man does what is his business with patience and perseverance its a pity though that that scoundrel should get off then eames gave his uncle an account of his italian trip to and fro and was congratulated also upon his success johns great triumph lay in the fact that he had been only two nights in bed and that he would not have so far condescended on those occasions but for the feminine weakness of his fellowtraveller we shant forget it all in a hurryshall we john said mr toogood in a pleasant voice as they parted at the door of the luncheonhouse in holborn toogood was returning to his office and john eames was to prepare himself for his last attempt  he went home to his lodgings intending at first to change his dressto make himself smart for the work before himbut after standing for a moment or two leaning on the chest of drawers in his bedroom he gave up this idea after all thats come and gone he said to himself if i cannot win her as i am now i cannot win her at all and then he swore to himself a solemn oath resolving that he would repeat the purport of it to lily herselfthat this should be the last attempt whats the use of it everybody ridicules me and i am ridiculous i am an ass its all very well wanting to be prime minister but if you cant be prime minister you must do without being prime minister then he attempted to sing the old songshall i sighing in despair die because a womans fair if she be not fair for me what care i how fair she be but he did care and he told himself that the song did him no good as it was not time for him as yet to go to lily he threw himself on the sofa and strove to read a book then all the weary nights of his journey prevailed over him and he fell asleep  when he awoke it wanted a quarter to six he sprang up and rushing out jumped into a cab berkeley squareas hard as you can go he said number  he thought of rosalind and her counsels to lovers as to the keeping of time and reflected that in such an emergency as his he might really have ruined himself by that unfortunate slumber when he got to mrs thornes door he knocked hurriedly and bustled up to the drawingroom as though everything depended on his saving a minute im afraid im ever so much behind my time he said  it does not matter in the least said lily as mrs arabin said that perhaps you might call i would not be out of the way i supposed that sir raffle was keeping you and that you wouldnt come  sir raffle was not keeping me i fell asleep that is the truth of it  i am so sorry that you should have been disturbed  do not laugh at me lilytoday i had been travelling a good deal and i suppose i was tired  i wont laugh at you she said and of a sudden her eyes became full of tearsshe did not know why but there they were and she was ashamed to put up her handkerchief and she could not bring herself to turn away her face and she had no resource but that he should see them  lily he said  what a paladin you have been john rushing all about europe on your friends behalf  dont talk about that  and such a successful paladin too why am i not to talk about it i am going home tomorrow and i mean to talk about nothing else for a week i am so very very very glad that you have saved your cousin then she did put up her handkerchief making believe that her tears had been due to mr crawley but john eames knew better than that  lily he said ive come for the last time it sounds as though i meant to threaten you but you wont take it in that way i think you will know what i mean i have come for the last timeto ask you to be my wife she had got up to greet him when he entered and they were both still standing she did not answer him at once but turning away from him walked towards the window you knew why i was coming today lily  mrs arabin told me i could not be away when you were coming but perhaps it would have been better  is it so must it be so must you say that to me lily think of it for a moment dear  i have thought of it  one word from you yes or no spoken now is to be everything to me for always lily cannot you say yes she did not answer him but walked further away from him to another window try to say yes look round at me with one look that may only half mean itthat may tell me that it shall not positively be no for ever i think that she almost tried to turn her face to him but be that as it may she kept her eyes steadily fixed upon the windowpane lily he said it is not that you are hardheartedperhaps not altogether that you do not like me i think that you believe things against me that are not true as she heard this she moved her foot angrily upon the carpet she had almost forgotten m d but now he had reminded her of the note she assured herself that she had never believed anything against him except on evidence that was incontrovertible but she was not going to speak to him on such a matter as that it would not become her to accuse him mrs arabin tells me that you doubt whether i am in earnest he said  upon hearing this she flashed round upon him almost angrily i never said that  if you will ask me for any token of earnestness i will give it you  i want no token  the best sign of earnestness a man can give generally in such a matter is to show how ready he is to be married  i never said anything about earnestness  at the risk of making you angry i will go on lily of course when you tell me that you will have nothing to say to me i try to amuse myselfyes by writing loveletters to m d said lily to herselfwhat is a poor fellow to do i tell you fairly that when i leave you i swear to myself that i will make love to the first girl i can see who will listen to meto twenty if twenty will let me i feel i have failed and it is so i punish myself for my failure there was something in this which softened her brow though she did not intend that it should be so and she turned away again that he might not see that her brow was softened but lily the hope ever comes back again and then neither the one nor the twenty are of availeven to punish me when i look forward and see what it might be if you were with me how green it all looks and how lovely in spite of all the vows i have made i cannot help coming back again she was now again near the window and he had not followed her as she neither turned towards him nor answered him he moved from the table near which he was standing on to the rug before the fire and leaned with both his elbows on the mantelpiece he could still watch her in the mirror over the fireplace and could see that she was still seeming to gaze out upon the street and had he not moved her i think he had so far moved her now that she had ceased to think of the woman who had written to herthat she had ceased to reject him in her heart on the score of such levities as that if there were m ds like sunken rocks in his course whose fault was it he was ready enough to steer his bark into the tranquil blue waters if only she would aid him i think that all his sins on that score were at this moment forgiven him he had told her now what to him would be green and beautiful and she did not find herself able to disbelieve him she had banished m d out of her mind but in doing so she admitted other reminiscences into it and thenwas she in a moment to be talked out of the resolution of years and was she to give up herself not because she loved but because the man who talked to her talked so well that he deserved a reward was she now to be as light as foolish as easy as in those former days from which she had learned her wisdom a picture of green lovely things could be delicious to her eyes as to his but even for such a picture as that the price might be too dear of all living menof all men living in their present livesshe loved best this man who was now waiting for some word of answer to his words and she did love him dearly she would have tended him if sick have supplied him if in want have mourned for him if dead with the bitter grief of true affectionbut she could not say to herself that he should be her lord and master the head of her house the owner of herself the ruler of her life the shipwreck to which she had once come and the fierce regrets which had thence arisen had forced her to think too much of these things lily he said still facing towards the mirror will you not come to me and speak to me she turned round and stood a moment looking at him and then having again resolved that it could not be as he wished she drew near to him certainly i will speak to you john here i am and she came close to him  illustration the last denial  he took both her hands and looked into her eyes lily will you be mine  no dear it cannot be so  why not lily  because of that other man  and is that to be a bar for ever  yes for ever  do you still love him  no no no  then why should this be so  i cannot tell dear it is so if you take a young tree and split it it still lives perhaps but it isnt a tree it is only a fragment  then be my fragment  so i will if it can serve you to give standing ground to such a fragment in some corner of your garden but i will not have myself planted out in the middle for people to look at what there is left would die soon he still held her hands and she did not attempt to draw them away john she said next to mamma i love you better than all the world indeed i do i cant be your wife but you need never be afraid that i shall be more to another than i am to you  that will not serve me he said grasping both her hands till he almost hurt them but not knowing that he did so that is no good  it is all the good that i can do you indeed i can do youcan do no one any good the trees that the storms have splintered are never of use  and is this to be the end of all lily  not of our loving friendship  friendship i hate the word i hear some ones step and i had better leave you goodby  goodby john be kinder than that to me as you are going he turned back for a moment took her hand and held it tight against his heart and then he left her in the hall he met mrs thorne but as she said afterwards he had been too much knocked about to be able to throw a word to a dog  to mrs thorne lily said hardly a word about john eames and when her cousin bernard questioned her about him she was dumb and in these days she could assume a manner and express herself with her eyes as well as with her voice after a fashion which was apt to silence unwelcome questioners even though they were as intimate with her as was her cousin bernard she had described her feelings more plainly to her lover than she had ever done to any oneeven to her mother and having done so she meant to be silent on that subject for evermore but of her settled purpose she did say some word to emily dunstable that night i do feel she said that i have got the thing settled at last  and you have settled it as you call it in opposition to the wishes of all your friends  that is true and yet i have settled it rightly and i would not for worlds have it unsettled again there are matters on which friends should not have wishes or at any rate should not express them  is that meant to be severe to me  no not to you i was thinking about mamma and bell and my uncle and bernard who all seem to think that i am to be looked upon as a regular castaway because i am not likely to have a husband of my own of course you in your position must think a girl a castaway who isnt going to be married  i think that a girl who is going to be married has the best of it  and i think a girl who isnt going to be married has the best of itthats all but i feel that the thing is done now and i am contented for the last six or eight months there has come up i know not how a state of doubt which has made me so wretched that i have done literally nothing i havent been able to finish old mrs heards tippet literally because people would talk to me about that dearest of all dear fellows john eames and yet all along i have known how it would beas well as i do now  i cannot understand you lily i cant indeed  i can understand myself i love him so wellwith that intimate close familiar affectionthat i could wash his clothes for him tomorrow out of pure personal regard and think it no shame he could not ask me to do a single thing for himexcept the one thingthat i would refuse and ill go further i would sooner marry him than any man in the world i ever saw or as i believe that i ever shall see and yet i am very glad that it is settled  on the next day lily dale went down to the small house of allington and so she passes out of our sight i can only ask the reader to believe that she was in earnest and express my own opinion in this last word that i shall ever write respecting her that she will live and die as lily dale     chapter lxxvii  the arabins return to barchester   in these days mr harding was keeping his bed at the deanery and most of those who saw him declared that he would never again leave it the archdeacon had been slow to believe so because he had still found his fatherinlaw able to talk to himnot indeed with energy but then mr harding had never been energetic on ordinary mattersbut with the same soft cordial interest in things which had ever been customary with him he had latterly been much interested about mr crawley and would make both the archdeacon and mrs grantly tell him all that they heard and what they thought of the case this of course had been before the allimportant news had been received from mrs arabin mr harding was very anxious firstly as he said for the welfare of the poor man of whom i cannot bring myself to think ill and then for the honour of the cloth in barchester we are as liable to have black sheep here as elsewhere the archdeacon replied but my dear i do not think that the sheep is black and we never have had black sheep in barchester havent we though said the archdeacon thinking however of sheep who were black with a different kind of blackness from this which was now attributed to poor mr crawleyof a blackness which was not absolute blackness to mr hardings milder eyes the archdeacon when he heard his fatherinlaw talk after this fashion expressed his opinion that he might live yet for years he was just the man to linger on living in bedas indeed he had lingered all his life out of bed but the doctor who attended him thought otherwise as did also mrs grantly and as did mrs baxter and as also did posy grandpa wont get up any more will he posy said to mrs baxter i hope he will my dear and that very soon i dont think he will said posy because he said he would never see the big fiddle again that comes of his being a little melancholy like my dear said mrs baxter  mrs grantly at this time went into barchester almost every day and the archdeacon who was very often in the city never went there without passing halfanhour with the old man these two clergymen essentially different in their characters and in every detail of conduct had been so much thrown together by circumstances that the life of each had almost become a part of the life of the other although the fact of mr hardings residence at the deanery had of late years thrown him oftener into the society of the dean than that of his other soninlaw yet his intimacy with the archdeacon had been so much earlier and his memories of the archdeacon were so much clearer that he depended almost more upon the rector of plumstead who was absent than he did upon the dean whom he customarily saw every day it was not so with his daughters his nelly as he had used to call her had ever been his favourite and the circumstances of their joint lives had been such that they had never been further separated than from one street of barchester to anotherand that only for the very short period of the married life of mrs arabins first husband for all that was soft and tender thereforewhich with mr harding was all in the world that was charming to himhe looked to his youngest daughter but for authority and guidance and wisdom and for information as to what was going on in the world he had still turned to his soninlaw the archdeaconas he had done for nearly forty years for so long had the archdeacon been potent as a clergyman in the diocese and throughout the whole duration of such potency his word had been law to mr harding in most of the affairs of lifea law generally to be obeyed and if sometimes to be broken still a law and now when all was so nearly over he would become unhappy if the archdeacons visits were far between dr grantly when he found that this was so would not allow that they should be far between  he puts me so much in mind of my father the archdeacon said to his wife one day  he is not so old as your father was when he died by many years said mrs grantly and i think one sees that difference  yesand therefore i say that he may still live for years my father when he took to his bed at last was manifestly near his death the wonder with him was that he continued to live so long do you not remember how the london doctor was put out because his prophecies were not fulfilled  i remember it wellas if it were yesterday  and in that way there is a great difference my father who was physically a much stronger man did not succumb so easily but the likeness is in their characters there is the same mild sweetness becoming milder and sweeter as they increased in agea sweetness that never could believe much evil but that could believe less and still less as the weakness of age came on them no amount of evidence would induce your father to think that mr crawley stole that money this was said of course before the telegram had come from venice  as far as that goes i agree with him said mrs grantly who had her own reasons for choosing to believe mr crawley to be innocent if your son my dear is to marry a mans daughter it will be as well that you should at least be able to say that you do not believe that man to be a thief  that is neither here nor there said the archdeacon a jury must decide it  no jury in barsetshire shall decide it for me said mrs grantly  im sick of mr crawley and im sorry i spoke of him said the archdeacon but look at mrs proudie youll agree that she was not the most charming woman in the world  she certainly was not said mrs grantly who was anxious to encourage her husband if she could do so without admitting anything which might injure herself afterwards  and she was at one time violently insolent to your father and even the bishop thought to trample upon him do you remember the bishops preaching against your fathers chaunting if i ever forget it and the archdeacon slapped his closed fist against his open hand  dont dear dont what is the good of being violent now  paltry little fool it will be long enough before such a chaunt as that is heard in any english cathedral again then mrs grantly got up and kissed her husband but he somewhat negligent of the kiss went on with his speech but your father remembers nothing of it and if there was a single human being who shed a tear in barchester for that woman i believe it was your father and it was the same with mine it came to that at last that i could not bear to speak to him of any shortcoming as to one of his own clergymen i might as well have pricked him with a penknife and yet they say men become heartless and unfeeling as they grow old  some do i suppose  yes the heartless and unfeeling do as the bodily strength fails and the power of control becomes lessened the natural aptitude of the man pronounces itself more clearly i take it that that is it had mrs proudie lived to be a hundred and fifty she would have spoken spiteful lies on her deathbed then mrs grantly told herself that her husband should he live to be a hundred and fifty would still be expressing his horror of mrs proudieeven on his deathbed  as soon as the letter from mrs arabin had reached plumstead the archdeacon and his wife arranged that they would both go together to the deanery there were the double tidings to be toldthose of mr crawleys assured innocence and those also of mrs arabins instant return and as they went together various ideas were passing through their minds in reference to the marriage of their son with grace crawley they were both now reconciled to it mrs grantly had long ceased to feel any opposition to it even though she had not seen grace and the archdeacon was prepared to give way had he not promised that in a certain case he would give way and had not that case now come to pass he had no wish to go back from his word but he had a difficulty in thisthat he liked to make all the affairs of his life matter for enjoyment almost for triumph but how was he to be triumphant over this marriage or how even was he to enjoy it seeing that he had opposed it so bitterly those posters though they were now pulled down had been up on all barn ends and walls patentalas too patentto all the world of barsetshire what will mr crawley do now do you suppose said mrs grantly  what will he do  yes must he go on at hogglestock  what else said the archdeacon  it is a pity something could not be done for him after all he has undergone how on earth can he be expected to live there with a wife and family and no private means to this the archdeacon made no answer mrs grantly had spoken almost immediately upon their quitting plumstead and the silence was continued till the carriage had entered the suburbs of the city then mrs grantly spoke again asking a question with some internal trepidation which however she managed to hide from her husband when poor papa does go what shall you do about st ewolds now st ewolds was a rural parish lying about two miles out of barchester the living of which was in the gift of the archdeacon and to which the archdeacon had presented his fatherinlaw under certain circumstances which need not be repeated in this last chronicle of barsetshire have they not been written in other chronicles when poor papa does go what will you do about st ewolds said mrs grantly trembling inwardly a word too much might as she well knew settle the question against mr crawley for ever but were she to postpone the word till too late the question would be settled as fatally  i havent thought about it he said sharply i dont like thinking of such things while the incumbent is still living oh archdeacon archdeacon unless that other chronicle be a false chronicle how hast thou forgotten thyself and thy past life particularly not when that incumbent is your father said the archdeacon mrs grantly said nothing more about st ewolds she would have said as much as she had intended to say if she had succeeded in making the archdeacon understand that st ewolds would be a very nice refuge for mr crawley after all the miseries which he had endured at hogglestock  they learned as they entered the deanery that mrs baxter had already heard of mrs arabins return o yes maam mr harding got a letter hisself and i got anotherseparate both from venice maam but when master is to come nobody seems to know mrs baxter knew that the dean had gone to jerusalem and was inclined to think that from such distant bournes there was no return for any traveller the east is always further than the west in the estimation of the mrs baxters of the world had the dean gone to canada she would have thought that he might come back tomorrow but still there was the news to be told of mr crawley and there was also joy to be expressed at the sudden coming back of the muchwishedfor mistress of the deanery  its so good of you to come both together said mr harding  we thought we should be too many for you said the archdeacon  too many o dear no i like to have people by me and as for voices and noise and all that the more the better but i am weak im weak in my legs i dont think i shall ever stand again  yes you will said the archdeacon  we have brought you good news said mrs grantly  is it not good news that nelly will be home this week you cant understand what a joy it is to me i used to think sometimes at night that i should never see her again that she would come back in time was all i have had to wish for he was lying on his back and as he spoke he pressed his withered hands together above the bedclothes they could not begin immediately to tell him of mr crawley but as soon as his mind had turned itself away from the thoughts of his absent daughter mrs grantly again reverted to her news  we have come to tell you about mr crawley papa  what about him  he is quite innocent  i knew it my dear i always said so did i not always say so archdeacon  indeed you did ill give you that credit  and is it all found out asked mr harding  as far as he is concerned everything is found out said mrs grantly eleanor gave him the cheque herself  nelly gave it to him  yes papa the dean meant her to give him fifty pounds but it seems she got to be soft of heart and made it seventy she had the cheque by her and put it into the envelope with the notes  some of stringers people seem to have stolen the cheque from mr soames said the archdeacon  o dear i hope not  somebody must have stolen it papa  i had hoped not susan said mr harding both the archdeacon and mrs grantly knew that it was useless to argue with him on such a point and so they let that go  then they came to discuss mr crawleys present position and mr harding ventured to ask a question or two as to graces chance of marriage he did not often interfere in the family arrangements of his soninlawand never did so when those family arrangements were concerned with high matters he had hardly opened his mouth in reference to the marriage of that august lady who was now the marchioness of hartletop and of the lady anne the wife of the rev charles grantly who was always prodigiously civil to him speaking to him very loud as though he were deaf because he was old and bringing him cheap presents from london of which he did not take much heedof her he rarely said a word or of her children to either of his daughters but now his grandson henry grantly was going to marry a girl of whom he felt that he might speak without impropriety i suppose it will be a match wont it my dears  not a doubt about it said mrs grantly mr harding looked at his soninlaw but his soninlaw said nothing the archdeacon did not even frownbut only moved himself a little uneasily in his chair  dear dear what a comfort that must be said the old man  i have not seen her yet said mrs grantly but the archdeacon declares that she is all the graces rolled into one  i never said anything half so absurd replied the archdeacon  but he really is quite in love with her papa said mrs grantly he confessed to me that he gave her a kiss and he only saw her once for five minutes  i should like to give her a kiss said mr harding  so you shall papa and ill bring her here on purpose as soon as ever the thing is settled we mean to ask her to plumstead  do you though how nice how happy henry will be  and if she comesand of course she willill lose no time in bringing her over to you nelly must see her of course  as they were leaving the room mr harding called the archdeacon back and taking him by the hand spoke one word to him in a whisper i dont like to interfere he said but might not mr crawley have st ewolds the archdeacon took up the old mans hand and kissed it then he followed his wife out of the room without making any answer to mr hardings question  three days after this mrs arabin reached the deanery and the joy at her return was very great my dear i have been sick for you said mr harding  oh papa i ought not to have gone  nay my dear do not say that would it make me happy that you should be a prisoner here for ever it was only when i seemed to get so weak that i thought about it i felt that it must be near when they bade me not to go to the cathedral any more  if i had been here i could have gone with you papa  it is better as it is i know now that i was not fit for it when your sister came to me i never thought of remonstrating i knew then that i had seen it for the last time  we need not say that yet papa  i did think that when you came home we might crawl there together some warm morning i did think of that for a time but it will never be so dear i shall never see anything now that i do not see from hereand not that for long do not cry nelly i have nothing to regret nothing to make me unhappy i know how poor and weak has been my life but i know how rich and strong is that other life do not cry nellynot till i am gone and then not beyond measure why should any one weep for those who go away full of yearsand full of hope  on the day but one following the dean also reached his home the final arrangements of his tour as well as those of his wife had been made to depend on mr crawleys trial for he also had been hurried back by john eamess visit to florence i should have come at once he said to his wife when they wrote to ask me whether crawley had taken the cheque from me had anybody then told me that he was in actual trouble but i had no idea then that they were charging him with theft  as far as i can learn they never really suspected him until after your answer had come they had been quite sure that your answer would be in the affirmative  what he must have endured it is impossible to conceive i shall go out to him tomorrow  would he not come to us said mrs arabin  i doubt it i will ask him of course i will ask them all here this about henry and the girl may make a difference he has resigned the living and some of the palace people are doing the duty  but he can have it again  oh yes he can have it again for the matter of that i need simply give him back his letter only he is so oddso unlike other people and he has tried to live there and has failed and is now in debt i wonder whether grantly would give him st ewolds  i wish he would but you must ask him i should not dare  as to the matter of the cheque the dean acknowledged to his wife at last that he had some recollection of her having told him that she had made the sum of money up to seventy pounds i dont feel certain of it now but i think you may have done so i am quite sure i could not have done it without telling you she replied at any rate you said nothing of the cheque pleaded the dean i dont suppose i did said mrs arabin i thought that cheques were like any other money but i shall know better for the future  on the following morning the dean rode over to hogglestock and as he drew near to the house of his old friend his spirits flaggedfor to tell the truth he dreaded the meeting since the day on which he had brought mr crawley from a curacy in cornwall into the diocese of barchester his friend had been a trouble to him rather than a joy the trouble had been a trouble of spirit altogethernot at all of pocket he would willingly have picked the crawleys out from the pecuniary mud into which they were ever falling time after time had it been possible for though the dean was hardly to be called a rich man his lines had fallen to him not only in pleasant places but in easy circumstancesand mr crawleys embarrassments though overwhelming to him were not so great as to have been heavy to the dean but in striving to do this he had always failed had always suffered and had generally been rebuked crawley would attempt to argue with him as to the improper allotment of church endowmentsdeclaring that he did not do so with any reference to his own circumstances but simply because the subject was one naturally interesting to clergymen and this he would do as he was waving off with his hand offers of immediate assistance which were indispensable then there had been scenes between the dean and mrs crawleyterribly painfuland which had taken place in direct disobedience to the husbands positive injunctions sir he had once said to the dean i request that nothing may pass from your hands to the hands of my wife tush tush the dean had answered i will have no tushing or pshawing on such a matter a mans wife is his very own the breath of his nostril the blood of his heart the rib from his body it is for me to rule my wife and i tell you that i will not have it after that the gifts had come from the hands of mrs arabinand then again after that in the direst hour of his need crawley had himself come and taken money from the deans hands the interview had been so painful that arabin would hardly have been able to count the money or to know of what it had consisted had he taken the notes and cheque out of the envelope in which his wife had put them since that day the two had not met each other and since that day these new troubles had come arabin as yet knew but little of the manner in which they had been borne except that crawley had felt himself compelled to resign the living of hogglestock he knew nothing of mrs proudies persecution except what he gathered from the fact of the clerical commission of which he had been informed but he could imagine that mrs proudie would not lie easy on her bed while a clergyman was doing duty almost under her nose who was guilty of the double offence of being accused of a theft and of having been put into his living by the dean the dean therefore as he rode on pictured to himself his old friend in a terrible condition and it might be that even now that condition would hardly have been improved he was no longer suspected of being a thief but he could have no money in his pocket and it might well be that his sufferings would have made him almost mad  the dean also got down and left his horse at a farmyardas grantly had done with his carriage and walked on first to the school he heard voices inside but could not distinguish from them whether mr crawley was there or not slowly he opened the door and looking round saw that jane crawley was in the ascendant jane did not know him at once but told him when he had introduced himself that her father had gone down to hoggle end he had started two hours ago but it was impossible to say when he might be back he sometimes stays all day long with the brickmakers said jane her mother was at home and she would take the dean into the house as she said this she told him that her father was sometimes better and sometimes worse but he has never been so very very bad since henry grantly and mammas cousin came and told us about the cheque that word henry grantly made the dean understand that there might yet be a ray of sunshine among the crawleys  there is papa said jane as they got to the gate then they waited for a few minutes till mr crawley came up very hot wiping the sweat from his forehead  crawley said the dean i cannot tell you how glad i am to see you and how rejoiced i am that this accusation has fallen off from you  verily the news came in time arabin said the other but it was a narrow pincha narrow pinch will you not enter and see my wife     chapter lxxix  mr crawley speaks of his coat   illustration  at this time grace had returned home from framley as long as the terrible tragedy of the forthcoming trial was dragging itself on she had been content to stay away at her mothers bidding it has not been possible in these pages to tell of all the advice that had been given to the ladies of the crawley family in their great difficulty and of all the assistance that had been offered the elder lady lufton and the younger and mrs robarts had continually been in consultation on the subject mrs grantlys opinion had been asked and given and even the miss prettymans and mrs walker had found means of expressing themselves the communications to mrs crawley had been very frequentthough they had not of course been allowed to reach the ears of mr crawley what was to be done when the living should be gone and mr crawley should be in prison some said that he might be there for six weeks and some for two years old lady lufton made anxious inquiries about judge medlicote before whom it was said that the trial would be taken judge medlicote was a dissenter and old lady lufton was in despair when she was assured by some liberallydisposed friend that this would certainly make no difference she shook her head woefully i dont know why we are to have dissenters at all she said to try people who belong to the established church when she heard that judge medlicote would certainly be the judge she made up her mind that two years would be the least of it she would not have minded it she said if he had been a roman catholic and whether the punishment might be for six weeks or for two years what should be done with the family where should they be housed how should they be fed what should be done with the poor man when he came out of prison it was a case in which the generous softhearted old lady lufton was almost beside herself as for grace said young lady lufton it will be a great deal better that we should keep her amongst us of course she will become mrs grantly and it will be nicer for her that it should be so in those days the posters had been seen and the flitting to pau had been talked of and the framley opinion was that grace had better remain at framley till she should be carried off to pau there were schemes too about jane but what was to be done for the wife and what was to be done for mr crawley then came the news from mrs arabin and all interest in judge medlicote was at an end  but even now after this great escape what was to be done as to grace she had felt the absolute necessity of being obedient to her friendswith the consent of course of her motherduring the great tribulation of her family things were so bad that she had not the heart to make them worse by giving any unnecessary trouble as to herself having resolvedand having made her mother so understandthat on one point she would guide herself by her own feelings she was contented to go hither and thither as she was told and to do as she was bid her hope was that miss prettyman would allow her to go back to her teaching but it had come to be understood among them all that nothing was to be said on that subject till the trial should be over till that time she would be passive but then as i have said had come the news from mrs arabin and grace with all the others understood that there would be no trial when this was known and acknowledged she declared her purpose of going back to hogglestock she would go back at once when asked both by lady lufton and by mrs robarts why she was in so great a haste she merely said that it must be so she was as it were absolved from her passive obedience to framley authorities by the diminution of the family misfortunes  mrs robarts understood the feeling by which grace was hurried away do you know why she is so obstinate lady lufton asked  i think i do said mrs robarts  and what is it  should major grantly renew his offer to her she is under a pledge to accept him now  of course he will renew it and of course she will accept him  just so but she prefers that he should come for her to her own housebecause of its poverty if he chooses to seek her there i dont think she will make much difficulty lady lufton demurred to this not however with anger and expressed a certain amount of mild displeasure she did not quite see why major grantly should not be allowed to come and do his lovemaking comfortably where there was a decent dinner for him to eat and chairs and tables and sofas and carpets she said that she thought that something was due to major grantly she was in truth a little disappointed that she was not allowed to have her own way and to arrange the marriage at framley under her own eye but through it all she appreciated grace and they who knew her well and heard what she said upon the occasion understood that her favour was not to be withdrawn all young women were divided by old lady lufton into sheep and goatsvery white sheep and very black goatsand grace was to be a sheep thus it came to pass that grace crawley was at home when the dean visited hogglestock mamma she said looking out of the window there is the dean with papa at the gate  it was a narrow squeaka very narrow squeak mr crawley had said when his friend congratulated him on his escape the dean felt at the moment that not for many years had he heard the incumbent of hogglestock speak either of himself or of anything else with so manifest an attempt at jocularity arabin had expected to find the man broken down by the weight of his sorrows and lo at the first moment of their first interview he himself began to ridicule them crawley having thus alluded to the narrow squeak had asked his visitor to enter the house and see his wife  of course i will said arabin but i will speak just a word to you first jane who had accompanied the dean from the school now left them and went into the house to her mother my wife cannot forgive herself about the cheque continued he  there is nothing to be forgiven said mr crawley nothing  she feels that what she did was awkward and foolish she ought never to have paid a cheque away in such a manner she knows that now  it was givennot paid said crawley and as he spoke something of the black cloud came back upon his face and i am well aware how hard mrs arabin strove to take away from the alms she bestowed the bitterness of the sting of eleemosynary aid if you please arabin we will not talk any more of that i can never forget that i have been a beggar but i need not make my beggary the matter of conversation i hope the holy land has fulfilled your expectation  it has more than done so said the dean bewildered by the sudden change  for myself it is of course impossible that i should ever visit any scenes except those to which my immediate work may call menever in this world the new jerusalem is still within my reachif it be not forfeited by pride and obstinacy but the old jerusalem i can never behold methinks because it is so i would sooner stand with my foot on mount olivet or drink a cup of water in the village of bethany than visit any other spot within the travellers compass the sources of the nile of which men now talk so muchi see it in the papers and reviews which the ladies at framley are so good as to send to my wifedo not interest me much i have no ambition to climb mont blanc or the matterhorn rome makes my mouth water but little nor even athens much i can realize without seeing all that athens could show me and can fancy that the existing truth would destroy more than it would build up but to have stood on calvary  we dont know where calvary was said the dean  i fancy that i should knowshould know enough said the illogical and unreasonable mr crawley is it true that you can look over from the spot on which he stood as he came across the brow of the hill and see the huge stones of the temple placed there by solomons menas he saw themright across the brook cedron is it not  it is all there crawleyjust as your knowledge of it tells you  in the privilege of seeing those places i can almost envy a man hismoney the last word he uttered after a pause he had been about to say that under such temptation he could almost envy a man his promotion but he bethought himself that on such an occasion as this it would be better that he should spare the dean and now if you wish it we will go in i fancy that i see my wife at the window as though she were waiting for us so saying he strode on along the little path and the dean was fain to follow him even though he had said so little of all that he had intended to say  as soon as he was with mrs crawley he repeated his apology about the cheque and found himself better able to explain himself than he could do when alone with her husband of course it has been our fault he said  oh no said mrs crawley how can you have been in fault when your only object was to do us good but nevertheless the dean took the blame upon his own shoulders or rather upon those of his wife and declared himself to be responsible for all the trouble about the cheque  let it go said crawley after sitting for awhile in silence let it pass  you cannot wonder crawley said the dean that i should have felt myself obliged to speak of it  for the future it will be well that it should be forgotten said crawley or if not forgotten treated as though forgotten and now dean what must i do about the living  just resume it as though nothing had happened  but that may hardly be done without the bishops authority i speak of course with deference to your higher and better information on such subjects my experience in the taking up and laying down of livings has not been extended but it seemeth to me that though it may certainly be in your power to nominate me again to the perpetual curacy of this parishpresuming your patronage to be unlimited and not to reach you in rotation onlyyet the bishop may demand to institute again and must so demand unless he pleases to permit that my letter to him shall be revoked and cancelled  of course he will do anything of that kind he must know the circumstances as well as you and i do  at present they tell me that he is much afflicted by the death of his wife and therefore can hardly be expected to take immediate action there came here on the last sunday one mr snapper his lordships chaplain  we all know snapper said the dean snapper is not a bad little fellow  i say nothing of his being bad my friend but merely mention the fact that on sunday morning last he performed the service in our church on the sunday previous one mr thumble was here  we all know thumble too said the dean or at least know something about him  he has been a thorn in our sides said mrs crawley unable to restrain the expression of her dislike when mr thumbles name was mentioned  nay my dear naydo not allow yourself the use of language so strong against a brother our flesh at that time was somewhat prone to fester and little thorns made us very sore  he is a horrible man said jane almost in a whisper but the words were distinctly audible by the dean  they need not come any more said arabin  that is where i fear we differ i think they must comeor some others in their placetill the bishop shall have expressed his pleasure to the contrary i have submitted myself to his lordship and having done so feel that i cannot again go up into my pulpit till he shall have authorized me to do so for a time arabin i combated the bishop believingthen and nowthat he put forth his hand against me after a fashion which the law had not sanctioned and i made bold to stand in his presence and to tell him that i would not obey him except in things legal but afterwards when he proceeded formally through the action of a commission i submitted myself and i regard myself still as being under submission  it was impossible to shake him arabin remained there for more than an hour trying to pass on to another subject but being constantly brought back by mr crawley himself to the fact of his own dependent position nor would he condescend to supplicate the bishop it was he surmised the duty of dr tempest together with the other four clergymen to report to the bishop on the question of the alleged theft and then doubtless the bishop when he had duly considered the report andas mr crawley seemed to think was essentially necessaryhad sufficiently recovered from the grief at his wifes death would at his leisure communicate his decision to mr crawley nothing could be more complete than mr crawleys humility in reference to the bishop and he never seemed to be tired of declaring that he had submitted himself  and then the dean finding it to be vain to expect to be left alone with mr crawley for a momentin vain also to wait for a proper opening for that which he had to sayrushed violently at his other subject and now mrs crawley he said mrs arabin wishes you all to come over to the deanery for a while and stay with us  mrs arabin is too kind said mrs crawley looking across at her husband  we should like it of all things said the dean with perhaps more of good nature than of truth of course you must have been knocked about a good deal  indeed we have said mrs crawley  and till you are somewhat settled again i think that the change of scene would be good for all of you come crawley ill talk to you every evening about jerusalem for as long as you pleaseand then there will perhaps come back to us something of the pleasantness of old days as she heard this mrs crawleys eyes became full of tears and she could not altogether hide them what she had endured during the last four months had almost broken her spirit the burden had at last been too heavy for her strength you cannot fancy crawley how often i have thought of the old days and wished that they might return i have found it very hard to get an opportunity of saying so much to you but i will say it now  it may hardly be as you say said crawley grimly  you mean that the old days can never be brought back  assuredly they cannot but it was not that that i meant it may not be that i and mine should transfer ourselves to your roof and sojourn there  why should you not  the reasons are many and on the face of things the reason perhaps the most on the face is to be found in my wifes gown and in my coat this mr crawley said very gravely looking neither to the right nor to the left nor at the face of any of them nor at his own garment nor at hers but straight before him and when he had so spoken he said not a word furthernot going on to dilate on his poverty as the dean expected that he would do  at such a time such reasons should stand for nothing said the dean  and why not now as they always do and always must till the power of tailors shall have waned and the daughters of eve shall toil and spin no more like to like is true and should be held to be true of all societies and of all compacts for cooperation and mutual living here where if i may venture to say so you and i are like to likefor the new gloss of your coatthe dean as it happened had on at the moment a very old coat his oldest coat selected perhaps with some view to this special visitdoes not obtrude itself in my household as would the threadbare texture of mine in yoursi can open my mouth to you and converse with you at my ease you are now to me that frank arabin who has so often comforted me and so often confuted me whom i may perhaps on an occasion have confutedand perhaps have comforted but were i sitting with you in your library in barchester my threadbare coat would be too much for me i should be silent if not sullen i should feel the weight of all my poverty and the greater weight of all your wealth for my children let them go i have come to know that they will be better away from me  papa said jane  papa does not mean it said grace coming up to him and standing close to him  there was silence amongst them for a few moments and then the master of the house shook himselfliterally shook himself till he had shaken off the cloud he had taken grace by the hand and thrusting out the other arm had got it round janes waist when a man has girls arabin he said as you have but not big girls yet like grace here of course he knows that they will fly away  i shall not fly away said jane  i dont know what papa means said grace  upon the whole the dean thought it the pleasantest visit he had ever made to hogglestock and when he got home he told his wife that he believed that the accusation made against mr crawley had done him good i could not say a word in private to her he said but i did promise that you would go and see her on the very next day mrs arabin went over and i think that the visit was a comfort to mrs crawley     chapter lxxx  miss demolines desires to become a fingerpost   john eames had passed mrs thorne in the hall of her own house almost without noticing her as he took his departure from lily dale she had told him as plainly as words could speak that she could not bring herself to be his wifeand he had believed her he had sworn to himself that if he did not succeed now he would never ask her again it would be foolish and unmanly to do so he said to himself as he rushed along the street towards his club no that romance was over at last there had come an end to it it has taken a good bit out of me he said arresting his steps suddenly that he might stand still and think of it all by george yes a man doesnt go through that kind of thing without losing some of the caloric i couldnt do it again if an angel came in my way he went to his club and tried to be jolly he ordered a good dinner and got some man to come and dine with him for an hour or so he held himself up and did appear to be jolly but as he walked home at night and gave himself time to think over what had taken place with deliberation he stopped in the gloom of a deserted street and leaning against the rails burst into tears he had really loved her and she was never to be his he had wanted herand it is so painful a thing to miss what you want when you have done your very best to obtain it to struggle in vain always hurts the pride but the wound made by the vain struggle for a woman is sorer than any other wound so made he gnashed his teeth and struck the iron railings with his stickand then he hurried home swearing that he would never give another thought to lily dale in the dead of the night thinking of it still he asked himself whether it would not be a fine thing to wait another ten years and then go to her again in such a way would he not make himself immortal as a lover beyond any jacob or any leander  the next day he went to his office and was very grave when sir raffle complimented him on being back before his time he simply said that when he had accomplished that for which he had gone he had of course come back sir raffle could not get a word out from him about mr crawley he was very grave and intent upon his work indeed he was so serious that he quite afflicted sir rafflewhose mock activity felt itself to be confounded by the official zeal of his private secretary during the whole of that day johnny was resolving that there could be no cure for his malady but hard work he would not only work hard at the office if he remained there but he would take to heavy reading he rather thought that he would go deep into greek and do a translation or take up the exact sciences and make a name for himself that way but as he had enough for the life of a secluded literary man without his salary he rather thought that he would give up his office altogether he had a mutton chop at home that evening and spent his time in endeavouring to read out loud to himself certain passages from the iliadfor he had bought a homer as he returned from his office at nine oclock he went halfprice to the strand theatre how he met there his old friend boulger and went afterwards to the cock and had a supper need not here be told with more accurate detail  on the evening of the next day he was bound by his appointment to go to porchester terrace in the moments of his enthusiasm about homer he had declared to himself that he would never go near miss demolines again why should he all that kind of thing was nothing to him now he would simply send her his compliments and say that he was prevented by business from keeping his engagement she of course would go on writing to him for a time but he would simply leave her letters unanswered and the thing of course would come to an end at last he afterwards said something to boulger about miss demolinesbut that was during the jollity of their supperand he then declared that he would follow out that little game i dont see why a fellow isnt to amuse himself eh boulger old boy boulger winked and grinned and said that some amusements were dangerous i dont think that there is any danger there said johnny i dont believe she is thinking of that kind of thing herselfnot with me at least what she likes is the pretence of a mystery and as it is amusing i dont see why a fellow shouldnt indulge her but that determination was pronounced after two mutton chops at the cock between one and two oclock in the morning on the next day he was cooler and wiser greek he thought might be tedious as he discovered that he would have to begin again from the very alphabet he would therefore abandon that idea greek was not the thing for him but he would take up the sanitary condition of the poor in london a fellow could be of some use in that way in the meantime he would keep his appointment with miss demolines simply because it was an appointment a gentleman should always keep his word to a lady  he did keep his appointment with miss demolines and was with her almost precisely at the hour she had named she received him with a mysterious tranquillity which almost perplexed him he remembered however that the way to enjoy the society of miss demolines was to take her in all her moods with perfect seriousness and was therefore very tranquil himself on the present occasion she did not rise as he entered the room and hardly spoke as she tendered to him the tips of her fingers to be touched as she said almost nothing he said nothing at all but sank into a chair and stretched his legs out comfortably before him it had been always understood between them that she was to bear the burden of the conversation  youll have a cup of tea she said  yesif you do then the page brought the tea and john eames amused himself with swallowing three slices of very thin bread and butter  none for methanks said madalina i rarely eat after dinner and not often much then i fancy that i should best like a world in which there was no eating  a good dinner is a very good thing said john and then there was again silence he was aware that some great secret was to be told to him during this evening but he was much too discreet to show any curiosity upon that subject he sipped his tea to the end and then having got up to put his cup down stood on the rug with his back to the fire have you been out today he asked  indeed i have  and you are tired  very tired  then perhaps i had better not keep you up  your remaining will make no difference in that respect i dont suppose that i shall be in bed for the next four hours but do as you like about going  i am in no hurry said johnny then he sat down again stretched out his legs and made himself comfortable  i have been to see that woman said madalina after a pause  what woman  maria clutterbuckas i must always call her for i cannot bring myself to pronounce the name of that poor wretch who was done to death  he blew his brains out in delirium tremens said johnny  and what made him drink said madalina with emphasis never mind i decline altogether to speak of it such a scene as i have had i was driven at last to tell her what i thought of her anything so callous so heartless so selfish so stonecold and so childish i never saw before that maria was childish and selfish i always knewbut i thought there was some hearta vestige of heart i found today that there was nonenone if you please we wont speak of her any more  certainly not said johnny  you need not wonder that i am tired and feverish  that sort of thing is fatiguing i dare say i dont know whether we do not lose more than we gain by those strong emotions  i would rather die and go beneath the sod at once than live without them said madalina  its a matter of taste said johnny  it is there that that poor wretch is so deficient she is thinking now this moment of nothing but her creature comforts that tragedy has not even stirred her pulses  if her pulses were stirred ever so that would not make her happy  happy who is happy are you happy  johnny thought of lily dale and paused before he answered no certainly he was not happy but he was not going to talk about his unhappiness to miss demolines of course i amas jolly as a sandboy he said  mr eames said madalina raising herself on her sofa if you can not express yourself in language more suitable to the occasion and to the scene than that i think that you had better  hold my tongue  just sothough i should not have chosen myself to use words so abruptly discourteous  what did i sayjolly as a sandboy there is nothing wrong in that what i meant was that i think that this world is a very good sort of world and that a man can get along in it very well if he minds his ps and qs  but suppose its a woman  easier still  and suppose she does not mind her ps and qs  women always do  do they your knowledge of women goes as far as that does it tell me fairlydo you think you know anything about women madalina as she asked the question looked full into his face and shook her locks and smiled when she shook her locks and smiled there was a certain attraction about her of which john eames was fully sensible she could throw a special brightness into her eyes which though it probably betokened nothing truly beyond illnatured mischief seemed to convey a promise of wit and intellect  i dont mean to make any boast about it said johnny  i doubt whether you know anything the pretty simplicity of your excellent lily dale has sufficed for you  never mind about her said johnny impatiently  i do not mind about her in the least but an insight into that sort of simplicity will not teach you the character of a real woman you cannot learn the flavour of wines by sipping sherry and water for myself i do not think that i am simple i own it fairly if you must have simplicity i cannot be to your taste  nobody likes partridge always said johnny laughing  i understand you sir and though what you say is not complimentary i am willing to forgive that fault for its truth i dont consider myself to be always partridge i can assure you i am as changeable as the moon  and as fickle  i say nothing about that sir i leave you to find that out it is a mans business to discover that for himself if you really do know aught of women  i did not say that i did  but if you do you will perhaps have discovered that a woman may be as changeable as the moon and yet as true as the sunthat she may flit from flower to flower quite unheeding while no passion exists but that a passion fixes her at once do you believe me now she looked into his eyes again but did not smile and did not shake her locks  oh yesthats true enough and when they have a lot of children then they become steady as milestones  children said madalina getting up and walking about the room  they do have them you know said johnny  do you mean to say sir that i should be a milestone  a fingerpost said johnny to show a fellow the way he ought to go  she walked twice across the room without speaking then she came and stood opposite to him still without speakingand then she walked about again what could a woman better be than a fingerpost as you call it with such a purpose  nothing better of coursethough a milestone to tell a fellow his distances is very good  psha  you dont like the idea of being a milestone  no  then you can make up your mind to be a fingerpost  john shall i be a fingerpost for you she stood and looked at him for a moment or two with her eyes full of love as though she were going to throw herself into his arms and she would have done so no doubt instantly had he risen to his legs as it was after having gazed at him for the moment with her loveladen eyes she flung herself on the sofa and hid her face among the cushions  he had felt that it was coming for the last quarter of an hourand he had felt also that he was quite unable to help himself he did not believe that he should ever be reduced to marrying miss demolines but he did see plainly enough that he was getting into trouble and yet for his life he could not help himself the moth who flutters round the light knows that he is being burned and yet he cannot fly away from it when madalina had begun to talk to him about women in general and then about herself and had told him that such a woman as herselfeven one so liable to the disturbance of violent emotionsmight yet be as true and honest as the sun he knew that he ought to get up and make his escape he did not exactly know how the catastrophe would come but he was quite sure that if he remained there he would be called upon in some way for a declaration of his sentimentsand that the call would be one which all his wit would not enable him to answer with any comfort it was very well jesting about milestones but every jest brought him nearer to the precipice he perceived that however ludicrous might be the image which his words produced she was clever enough in some way to turn that image to her own purpose he had called a woman a fingerpost and forthwith she had offered to come to him and be fingerpost to him for life what was he to say to her it was clear that he must say something as at this moment she was sobbing violently he could not pass the offer by as a joke women will say that his answer should have been very simple and his escape very easy but men will understand that it is not easy to reject even a miss demolines when she offers herself for matrimony and moreoveras johnny bethought himself at this crisis of his fatelady demolines was no doubt at the other side of the drawingroom door ready to stop him should he attempt to run away in the meantime the sobs on the sofa became violent and still more violent he had not even yet made up his mind what to do when madalina springing to her feet stood before him with her curls wildly waving and her arms extended let it be as though it were unsaid she exclaimed john eames had not the slightest objection but nevertheless there was a difficulty even in this were he simply to assent to this latter proposition it could not be but that the feminine nature of miss demolines would be outraged by so uncomplimentary an acquiescence he felt that he ought at least to hesitate a littleto make some pretence at closing upon the rich offer that had been made to him only that were he to show any such pretence the rich offer would no doubt be repeated his madalina had twitted him in the earlier part of their interview with knowing nothing of the nature of women he did know enough to feel assured that any false step on his part now would lead him into very serious difficulties let it be as though it were unsaid why oh why have i betrayed myself exclaimed madalina  john now had risen from his chair and coming up to her took her by the arm and spoke a word compose yourself he said he spoke in his most affectionate voice and he stood very close to her  how easy it is to bid me do that said madalina tell the sea to compose itself when it rages  madalina said he  wellwhat of madalina madalina has lost her own respectfor ever  do not say that  oh johnwhy did you ever come here why why did we meet at that fatal womans house or meeting so why did we not part as strangers sir why have you come here to my mothers house day after day evening after evening if oh heavens what am i saying i wonder whether you will scorn me always  i will never scorn you  and you will pardon me  madalina there is nothing to pardon  andyou will love me then without waiting for any more encouraging replyunable probably to wait a moment longer she sunk upon his bosom he caught her of courseand at that moment the drawingroom door was opened and lady demolines entered the chamber john eames detected at a glance the skirt of the old white dressing gown which he had seen whisking away on the occasion of his last visit at porchester terrace but on the present occasion lady demolines wore over it a short red opera cloak and the cap on her head was ornamented with coloured ribbons what is this she said and why am i thus disturbed madalina lay motionless in johnnys arms while the old woman glowered at him from under the coloured ribbons mr eames what is it that i behold she said  illustration what is it that i behold  your daughter madam seems to be a little unwell said johnny madalina kept her feet firm upon the ground but did not for a moment lose her purchase against johnnys waistcoat her respirations came very strong but they came a good deal stronger when he mentioned the fact that she was not so well as she might be  unwell said lady demolines and john was stricken at the moment with a conviction that her ladyship must have passed the early years of her life upon the stage you would trifle with me sir beware that you do not trifle with herwith madalina  my mother said madalina but still she did not give up her purchase and the voice seemed to come half from her and half from johnny come to me my mother then lady demolines hastened to her daughter and madalina between them was gradually laid at her length upon the sofa the work of laying her out however was left almost entirely to the stronger arm of mr john eames thanks mother said madalina but she had not as yet opened her eyes even for an instant perhaps i had better go now said johnny the old woman looked at him with eyes which asked him whether he didnt wish he might get it as plainly as though the words had been pronounced of course ill wait if i can be of any service said johnny  i must know more of this sir before you leave the house said lady demolines he saw that between them both there might probably be a very bad quarter of an hour in store for him but he swore to himself that no union of dragon and tigress should extract from him a word that could be taken as a promise of marriage  the old woman was now kneeling by the head of the sofa and johnny was standing close by her side suddenly madalina opened her eyesopened them very wide and gazed around her then slowly she raised herself on the sofa and turned her face first upon her mother and then upon johnny you here mamma she said  dearest one i am near you be not afraid said her ladyship  afraid why should i be afraid john my own john mamma he is my own and she put out her arms to him as though calling to him to come to her things were now very bad with john eamesso bad that he would have given a considerable lump out of lord de guests legacy to be able to escape at once into the street the power of a woman when she chooses to use it recklessly is for the moment almost unbounded  i hope you find yourself a little better said john struggling to speak as though he were not utterly crushed by the occasion  lady demolines slowly raised herself from her knees helping herself with her hands against the shoulder of the sofafor though still very clever she was old and stiffand then offered both her hands to johnny johnny cautiously took one of them finding himself unable to decline them both my son she exclaimed and before he knew where he was the old woman had succeeded in kissing his nose and his whiskers my son she said again  now the time had come for facing the dragon and the tigress in their wrath if they were to be faced at all the time for facing them had certainly arrived i fear that johns heart sank low in his bosom at that moment i dont quite understand he said almost in a whisper madalina put out one arm towards him and the fingers trembled her lips were opened and the white row of interior ivory might be seen plainly but at the present conjuncture of affairs she spoke not a word she spoke not a word but her arm remained stretched out towards him and her fingers did not cease to tremble  you do not understand said lady demolines drawing herself back and looking in her short open cloak like a knight who has donned his cuirass but has forgotten to put on his leggear and she shook the bright ribbons of her cap as a knight in his wrath shakes the crest of his helmet you do not understand mr eames what is it sir that you do not understand  there is some misconception i mean said johnny  mother said madalina turning her eyes from her recreant lover to her tender parent trembling all over but still keeping her hand extended mother  my darling but leave him to me dearest compose yourself  twas the word that he saidthis moment before he pressed me to his heart  i thought you were fainting said johnny  sir and lady demolines as she spoke shook her crest and glared at him and almost flew at him in her armour  it may be that nature has given way with me and that i have been in a dream said madalina  that which mine eyes saw was no dream said lady demolines mr eames i have given to you the sweetest name that can fall from an old womans lips i have called you my son  yes you did i know but as i said before there is some mistake i know how proud i ought to be and how happy and all that kind of thing but then there came a screech from madalina which would have awakened the dead had there been any dead in that house the page and the cook however took no notice of it whether they were awakened or not and having screeched madalina stood erect upon the floor and she also glared upon her recreant lover the dragon and the tiger were there before him now and he knew that it behoved him to look to himself as he had a battle to fight might it not be best to put a bold face upon it the truth is said he that i dont understand this kind of thing at all  not understand it sir said the dragon  leave him to me mother said the tigress shaking her head again but with a kind of shake differing from that which she had used before this is my business and ill have it out for myself if he thinks im going to put up with his nonsense hes mistaken ive been straightforward and above board with you mr eames and i expect to be treated in the same way in return do you mean to tell my mother that you deny that we are engaged  well yes i do im very sorry you know if i seem to be uncivil  its because ive no brother said the tigress he thinks that i have no man near me to protect me but he shall find that i can protect myself john eames why are you treating me like this  i shall consult my cousin the serjeant tomorrow said the dragon in the meantime he must remain in this house i shall not allow the front door to be unlocked for him  this i think was the bitterest moment of all to johnny to be confined all night in lady demolines drawingroom would of itself be an intolerable nuisance and then the absurdity of the thing and the story that would go abroad and what should he say to the dragons cousin the serjeant if the serjeant should be brought upon the field before he was able to escape from it he did not know what a serjeant might not do to him in such circumstances there was one thing no serjeant should do and no dragon between them all they should never force him to marry the tigress at this moment johnny heard a tramp along the pavement and he rushed to the window before the dragon or even the tigress could arrest him he had thrown up the sash and had appealed in his difficulty to the guardian of the night i say old fellow said johnny dont you stir from that till i tell you the policeman turned his bullseye upon the window and stood perfectly motionless now if you please ill say goodnight said johnny but as he spoke he still held the open window in his hand  what means this violence in my house said the dragon  mamma you had better let him go said the tigress we shall know where to find him  you will certainly be able to find me said johnny  go said the dragon shaking her crestshaking all her armour at him dastard go  policeman shouted johnny while he still held the open window in his hand mind you dont stir till i come out the bullseye was shifted a little but the policeman spoke never a word  i wish you goodnight lady demolines said johnny goodnight miss demolines then he left the window and made a run for the door but the dragon was there before him  let him go mamma said the tigress as she closed the window we shall only have a rumpus  that will be all said johnny there isnt the slightest use in your trying to keep me here  and are we never to see you again said the tigress almost languishing again with one eye  well no what would be the use no man likes to be shut in you know  go then said the tigress but if you think that this is to be the end of it youll find yourself wonderfully mistaken you poor false drivelling creature lily dale wont touch you with a pair of tongs its no use your going to her  go away sir this moment and dont contaminate my room an instant longer by your presence said the dragon who had observed through the window that the bullseye was still in full force before the house then john eames withdrew and descending into the hall made his way in the dark to the front door for aught he knew there might still be treachery in regard to the lock but his heart was comforted as he heard the footfall of the policeman on the doorstep with much fumbling he succeeded at last in turning the key and drawing the bolt and then he found himself at liberty in the street before he even spoke a word to the policeman he went out into the road and looked up at the window he could just see the figure of the dragons helmet as she was closing the shutters it was the last he ever saw of lady demolines or of her daughter  what was it all about said the policeman  i dont know that i can just tell you said johnny searching in his pocketbook for half a sovereign which he tendered to the man there was a little difficulty and im obliged to you for waiting  there aint nothing wrong said the man suspiciously hesitating for a moment before he accepted the coin  nothing on earth ill wait with you while you have the house opened and inquire if you wish it the truth is somebody inside refused to have the door opened and i didnt want to stay there all night  theyre a rummy couple if what i hear is true  they are a rummy couple said johnny  i suppose its all right said the policeman taking the money and then john walked off home by himself turning in his mind all the circumstances of his connection with miss demolines taking his own conduct as a whole he was rather proud of it but he acknowledged to himself that it would be well that he should keep himself free from the society of madalinas for the future     chapter lxxxi  barchester cloisters   on the morning of the sunday after the deans return mr harding was lying in his bed and posy was sitting on the bed beside him it was manifest to all now that he became feebler and feebler from day to day and that he would never leave his bed again even the archdeacon had shaken his head and had acknowledged to his wife that the last day for her father was near at hand it would very soon be necessary that he should select another vicar for st ewolds  grandpa wont play catscradle said posy as mrs arabin entered the room  no darlingnot this morning said the old man he himself knew well enough that he would never play catscradle again even that was over for him now  she teases you papa said mrs arabin  no indeed said he posy never teases me and he slowly moved his withered hand down outside the bed so as to hold the child by her frock let her stay with me my dear  dr filgrave is downstairs papa you will see him if he comes up now dr filgrave was the leading physician of barchester and nobody of note in the cityor for the matter of that in the eastern division of the countywas allowed to start upon the last great journey without some assistance from him as the hour of going drew nigh i do not know that he had much reputation for prolonging life but he was supposed to add a grace to the hour of departure mr harding had expressed no wish to see the doctorhad rather declared his conviction that dr filgrave could be of no possible service to him but he was not a man to persevere in his objection in opposition to the wishes of the friends around him and as soon as the archdeacon had spoken a word on the subject he assented  of course my dear i will see him  and posy shall come back when he has gone said mrs arabin  posy will do me more good than dr filgrave i am quite surebut posy shall go now so posy scrambled off the bed and the doctor was ushered into the room  a day or two will see the end of it mr archdeaconi should say a day or two said the doctor as he met dr grantly in the hall i should say that a day or two would see the end of it indeed i will not undertake that twentyfour hours may not see the close of his earthly troubles he has no suffering no pain no disturbing cause nature simply retires to rest dr filgrave as he said this made a slow falling motion with his hands which alone on various occasions had been thought to be worth all the money paid for his attendance perhaps you would wish that i should step in in the evening mr dean as it happens i shall be at liberty the dean of course said that he would take it as an additional favour neither the dean nor the archdeacon had the slightest belief in dr filgrave and yet they would hardly have been contented that their fatherinlaw should have departed without him  look at that man now said the archdeacon when the doctor had gone who talks so glibly about nature going to rest ive known him all my life hes an older man by some months than our dear old friend upstairs and he looks as if he were going to attend deathbeds in barchester for ever  i suppose he is right in what he tells us now said the dean  no doubt he is but my belief doesnt come from his saying it then there was a pause as the two church dignitaries sat together doing nothing feeling that the solemnity of the moment was such that it would be hardly becoming that they should even attempt to read his going will make an old man of me said the archdeacon it will be different with you  it will make an old woman of eleanor i fear  i seem to have known him all my life said the archdeacon i have known him ever since i left college and i have known him as one man seldom knows another there is nothing that he has doneas i believe nothing that he has thoughtwith which i have not been cognizant i feel sure that he never had an impure fancy in his mind or a faulty wish in his heart his tenderness has surpassed the tenderness of woman and yet when an occasion came for showing it he had all the spirit of a hero i shall never forget his resignation of the hospital and all that i did and said to make him keep it  but he was right  as septimus harding he was i think right but it would have been wrong in any other man and he was right too about the deanery for promotion had once come in mr hardings way and he too might have been dean of barchester the fact is he never was wrong he couldnt go wrong he lacked guile and he feared godand a man who does both will never go far astray i dont think he ever coveted aught in his lifeexcept a new case for his violoncello and somebody to listen to him when he played it then the archdeacon got up and walked about the room in his enthusiasm and perhaps as he walked some thoughts as to the sterner ambition of his own life passed through his mind what things had he coveted had he lacked guile he told himself that he had feared godbut he was not sure that he was telling himself true even in that  during the whole of the morning mrs arabin and mrs grantly were with their father and during the greater part of the day there was absolute silence in the room he seemed to sleep and they though they knew that in truth he was not sleeping feared to disturb him by a word about two mrs baxter brought him his dinner and he did rouse himself and swallowed a spoonful or two of soup and half a glass of wine at this time posy came to him and stood at the bedside looking at him with her great wide eyes she seemed to be aware that life had now gone so far with her dear old friend that she must not be allowed to sit upon his bed again but he put his hand out to her and she held it standing quite still and silent when mrs baxter came to take away the tray posys mother got up and whispered a word to the child then posy went away and her eyes never beheld the old man again that was a day which posy will never forgetnot though she should live to be much older than her grandfather was when she thus left him  it is so sweet to have you both here he said when he had been lying silent for nearly an hour after the child had gone then they got up and came and stood close to him there is nothing left for me to wish my dearsnothing not long after that he expressed a desire that the two husbandshis two sonsinlawshould come to him and mrs arabin went to them and brought them to the room as he took their hands he merely repeated the same words again there is nothing left for me to wish my dearsnothing he never spoke again above his breath but ever and anon his daughters who watched him could see that he was praying the two men did not stay with him long but returned to the gloom of the library the gloom had almost become the darkness of night and they were still sitting there without any light when mrs baxter entered the room the dear gentleman is no more said mrs baxter and it seemed to the archdeacon that the very moment of his fathers death had repeated itself when dr filgrave called he was told that his services could be of no further use dear dear said the doctor we are all dust mrs baxter are we not there were people in barchester who pretended to know how often the doctor had repeated this little formula during the last thirty years  there was no violence of sorrow in the house that night but there were aching hearts and one heart so sore that it seemed that no cure for its anguish could ever reach it he has always been with me mrs arabin said to her husband as he strove to console her it was not that i loved him better than susan but i have felt so much more of his loving tenderness the sweetness of his voice has been in my ears almost daily since i was born  they buried him in the cathedral which he had loved so well and in which nearly all the work of his life had been done and all barchester was there to see him laid in his grave within the cloisters there was no procession of coaches no hearse nor was there any attempt at funereal pomp from the deans side door across the vaulted passage and into the transeptover the little step upon which he had so nearly fallen when last he made his way out of the buildingthe coffin was carried on mens shoulders it was but a short journey from his bedroom to his grave but the bell had been tolling sadly all the morning and the nave and the aisles and the transepts close up to the door leading from the transept into the cloister were crowded with those who had known the name and the figure and the voice of mr harding as long as they had known anything up to this day no one would have said specially that mr harding was a favourite in the town he had never been forward enough in anything to become the acknowledged possessor of popularity but now that he was gone men and women told each other how good he had been they remembered the sweetness of his smile and talked of loving little words which he had spoken to themeither years ago or the other day for his words had always been loving the dean and the archdeacon came first shoulder to shoulder and after them came their wives i do not know that it was the proper order for mourning but it was a touching sight to be seen and was long remembered in barchester painful as it was for them the two women would be there and the two sisters would walk togethernor would they go before their husbands then there were the archdeacons two sonsfor the rev charles grantly had come to plumstead on the occasion and in the vaulted passage which runs between the deanery and the end of the transept all the chapter with the choir the prebendaries with the fat old chancellor the precentor and the minor canons down to the little choristersthey all were there and followed in at the transept door two by two and in the transept they were joined by another clergyman whom no one had expected to see that day the bishop was there looking old and wornalmost as though he were unconscious of what he was doing since his wifes death no one had seen him out of the palace or of the palace grounds till that day but there he wasand they made way for him into the procession behind the two ladiesand the archdeacon when he saw it resolved that there should be peace in his heart if peace might be possible  they made their way into the cloisters where the grave had been dugas many as might be allowed to follow the place indeed was open to all who chose to come but they who had only slightly known the man refrained from pressing upon those who had a right to stand around his coffin but there was one other there whom the faithful chronicler of barchester should mention before any other one had reached the spot the sexton and the verger between them had led in between them among the graves beneath the cloisters a blind man very old with a wondrous stoop but who must have owned a grand stature before extreme old age had bent him and they placed him sitting on a stone in the corner of the archway but as soon as the shuffling of steps reached his ears he raised himself with the aid of his stick and stood during the service leaning against the pillar the blind man was so old that he might almost have been mr hardings father this was john bunce a bedesman from hirams hospitaland none perhaps there had known mr harding better than he had known him when the earth had been thrown on to the coffin and the service was over and they were about to disperse mrs arabin went up to the old man and taking his hand between hers whispered a word into his ear oh miss eleanor he said oh miss eleanor within a fortnight he also was lying within the cathedral precincts  and so they buried mr septimus harding formerly warden of hirams hospital in the city of barchester of whom the chronicler may say that that city never knew a sweeter gentleman or a better christian     chapter lxxxii  the last scene at hogglestock   illustration  the fortnight following mr hardings death was passed very quietly at hogglestock for during that time no visitor made an appearance in the parish except mr snapper on the sundays mr snapper when he had completed the service on the first of these sundays intimated to mr crawley his opinion that probably that gentleman might himself wish to resume the duties on the following sabbath mr crawley however courteously declined to do anything of the kind he said that it was quite out of the question that he should do so without a direct communication made to him from the bishop or by the bishops order the assizes had of course gone by and all question of the trial was over neverthelessas mr snapper saidthe bishop had not as yet given any order mr snapper was of opinion that the bishop in these days was not quite himself he had spoken to the bishop about it and the bishop had told him peevishlyi must say quite peevishly mr snapper had saidthat nothing was to be done at present mr snapper was not the less clearly of opinion that mr crawley might resume his duties to this however mr crawley would not assent  but even during the fortnight mr crawley had not remained altogether neglected two days after mr hardings death he had received a note from the dean in which he was advised not to resume the duties at hogglestock for the present of course you can understand that we have a sad house here at present the dean had said but as soon as ever we are able to move in the matter we will arrange things for you as comfortably as we can i will see the bishop myself mr crawley had no ambitious idea of any comfort which might accrue to him beyond that of an honourable return to his humble preferment at hogglestock but nevertheless he was in this case minded to do as the dean counselled him he had submitted himself to the bishop and he would wait till the bishop absolved him from his submission  on the day after the funeral the bishop had sent his compliments to the dean with the expression of a wish that the dean would call upon him on any early day that might be convenient with reference to the position of mr crawley of hogglestock the note was in the bishops own handwriting and was as mild and civil as a bishops note could be of course the dean named an early day for the interview but it was necessary before he went to the bishop that he should discuss the matter with the archdeacon if st ewolds might be given to mr crawley the hogglestock difficulties would all be brought to an end the archdeacon after the funeral had returned to plumstead and thither the dean went to him before he saw the bishop he did succeedhe and mrs grantly between thembut with very great difficulty in obtaining a conditional promise they had both thought that when the archdeacon became fully aware that grace was to be his daughterinlaw he would at once have been delighted to have an opportunity of extricating from his poverty a clergyman with whom it was his fate to be so closely connected but he fought the matter on twenty different points he declared at first that as it was his primary duty to give to the people of st ewolds the best clergyman he could select for them he could not give the preferment to mr crawley because mr crawley in spite of all his zeal and piety was a man so quaint in his manners and so eccentric in his mode of speech as not to be the best clergyman whom he could select what is my old friend thorne to do with a man in his parish who wont drink a glass of wine with him for ullathorne the seat of that mr wilfred thorne who had been so guilty in the matter of the foxes was situated in the parish of st ewolds when mrs grantly proposed that mr thornes consent should be asked the archdeacon became very angry he had never heard so unecclesiastical a proposition in his life it was his special duty to do the best he could for mr thorne but it was specially his duty to do so without consulting mr thorne about it as the archdeacons objection had been argued simply on the point of the glass of wine both the dean and mrs grantly thought that he was unreasonable but they had their point to gain and therefore they only flattered him they were sure that mr thorne would like to have a clergyman in the parish who would himself be closely connected with the archdeacon then dr grantly alleged that he might find himself in a trap what if he conferred the living of st ewolds on mr crawley and after all there should be no marriage between his son and grace of course theyll be married said mrs grantly its all very well for you to say that my dear but the whole family are so queer that there is no knowing what the girl may do she may take up some other fad now and refuse him point blank she has never taken up any fad said mrs grantly who now mounted almost to wrath in defence of her future daughterinlaw and you are wrong to say that she has she has behaved beautifullyas nobody knows better than you do then the archdeacon gave way so far as to promise that st ewolds should be offered to mr crawley as soon as grace crawley was in truth engaged to harry grantly  after that the dean went to the palace there had never been any quarrelling between the bishop and the dean either direct or indirectnor indeed had the dean ever quarrelled even with mrs proudie but he had belonged to the antiproudie faction he had been brought into the diocese by the grantly interest and therefore during mrs proudies lifetime he had always been accounted among the enemies there had never been any real intimacy between the houses each house had been always asked to dine with the other house once a year but it had been understood that such dinings were ecclesiasticoofficial and not friendly there had been the same outside diocesan civility between even the palace and plumstead but now when the great chieftain of the palace was no more and the strength of the palace faction was gone peace or perhaps something more than peaceamity perhaps might be more easily arranged with the dean than with the archdeacon in preparation for such arrangements the bishop had gone to mr hardings funeral  and now the dean went to the palace at the bishops behest he found his lordship alone and was received with almost reverential courtesy he thought that the bishop was looking wonderfully aged since he last saw him but did not perhaps take into account the absence of clerical sleekness which was incidental to the bishops private life in his private room and perhaps in a certain measure to his recent great affliction the dean had been in the habit of regarding dr proudie as a man almost young for his agehaving been in the habit of seeing him at his best clothed in authority redolent of the throne conspicuous as regarded his apron and outward signs of episcopality much of all this was now absent the bishop as he rose to greet the dean shuffled with his old slippers and his hair was not brushed so becomingly as used to be the case when mrs proudie was always near him  it was necessary that a word should be said by each as to the loss which the other had suffered mr dean said his lordship allow me to offer you my condolements in regard to the death of that very excellent clergyman and most worthy gentleman your fatherinlaw  thank you my lord he was excellent and worthy i do not suppose that i shall live to see any man who was more so you also have a greata terrible loss  o mr dean yes yes indeed mr dean that was a loss  and hardly past the prime of life  ah yesjust fiftysixand so strong was she not at least everybody thought so and yet she was gone in a minutegone in a minute i havent held up my head since mr dean  it was a great loss my lord but you must struggle to bear it  i do struggle i am struggling but it makes one feel so lonely in this great house ah me i often wish mr dean that it had pleased providence to have left me in some humble parsonage where duty would have been easier than it is here but i will not trouble you with all that what are we to do mr dean about this poor mr crawley  mr crawley is a very old friend of mine and a very dear friend  is he ah a very worthy man i am sure and one who has been much tried by undeserved adversities  most severely tried my lord  sitting among the potsherds like job has he not mr dean well let us hope that all that is over when this accusation about the robbery was brought against him i found myself bound to interfere  he has no complaint to make on that score  i hope not i have not wished to be harsh but what could i do mr dean they told me that the civil authorities found the evidence so strong against him that it could not be withstood  it was very strong  and we thought that he should at least be relieved and we sent for dr tempest who is his rural dean then the bishop remembering all the circumstances of that interview with dr tempestas to which he had ever felt assured that one of the results of it was the death of his wife whereby there was no longer any we left in the palace of barchestersighed piteously looking up at the dean with hopeless face  nobody doubts my lord that you acted for the best  i hope we did i think we did and now what shall we do he has resigned his living both to you and to me as i hearyou being the patron it will simply be necessary i think that he should ask to have the letters cancelled then as i take it there need be no reinstitution you cannot think mr dean how much i have thought about it all  then the dean unfolded his budget and explained to the bishop how he hoped that the living of st ewolds which was after some ecclesiastical fashion attached to the rectory of plumstead and which was now vacant by the demise of mr harding might be conferred by the archdeacon upon mr crawley it was necessary to explain also that this could not be done quite immediately and in doing this the dean encountered some little difficulty the archdeacon he said wished to be allowed another week to think about it and therefore perhaps provision for the duties at hogglestock might yet be made for a few sundays the bishop the dean said might easily understand that after what had occurred mr crawley would hardly wish to go again into that pulpit unless he did so as resuming duties which would necessarily be permanent with him to all this the bishop assented but he was apparently struck with much wonder at the choice made by the archdeacon i should have thought mr dean he said that mr crawley was the last man to have suited the archdeacons choice  the archdeacon and i married sisters my lord  oh ah yes and he puts the nomination of st ewolds at your disposition i am sure i shall be delighted to institute so worthy a gentleman as mr crawley then the dean took his leave of the bishopas will we also poor dear bishop i am inclined to think that he was right in his regrets as to the little parsonage not that his failure at barchester and his present consciousness of lonely incompetence were mainly due to any positive inefficiency on his own part he might have been a sufficiently good bishop had it not been that mrs proudie was so much more than a sufficiently good bishops wife we will now say farewell to him with a hope that the lopped tree may yet become green again and to some extent fruitful although all its beautiful head and richness of waving foliage have been taken from it  about a week after this henry grantly rode over from cosby lodge to hogglestock it has been just said that though the assizes had passed by and though all question of mr crawleys guilt was now set aside no visitor had of late made his way over to hogglestock i fancy that grace crawley forgot in the fulness of her memory as to other things that mr harding of whose death she heard had been her lovers grandfatherand that therefore there might possibly be some delay had there been much said between the mother and the daughter about the lover no doubt all this would have been explained but grace was very reticent and there were other matters in the hogglestock household which in those days occupied mrs crawleys mind how were they again to begin life for in very truth life as it had existed with them before had been brought to an end but grace remembered well the sort of compact which existed between her and her loverthe compact which had been made in very words between herself and her lovers father complete in her estimation as had been the heaven opened to her by henry grantlys offer she had refused it alllest she should bring disgrace upon him but the disgrace was not certain and if her father should be made free from it thenthenthen henry grantly ought to come to her and be at her feet with all the expedition possible to him that was her reading of the compact she had once declared when speaking of the possible disgrace which might attach itself to her family and to her name that her poverty did not signify a bit she was not ashamed of her fatheronly of the accusation against her father therefore she had hurried home when that accusation was withdrawn desirous that her lover should tell her of his loveif he chose to repeat such tellingamidst all the poor things of hogglestock and not among the chairs and tables and good dinners of luxurious framley mrs robarts had given a true interpretation to lady lufton of the haste which grace had displayed but she need not have been in so great a hurry she had been at home already above a fortnight and as yet he had made no sign at last she said a word to her mother might i not ask to go back to miss prettymans now mamma i think dear you had better wait till things are a little settled papa is to hear again from the dean very soon you see they are all in a great sorrow at barchester about poor mr hardings death grace said jane rushing into the house almost speechless at that moment here he ison horseback i do not know why jane should have talked about major grantly as simply he there had been no conversation among the sisters to justify her in such a mode of speech grace had not a moment to put two and two together so that she might realize the meaning of what her mother had said but nevertheless she felt at the moment that the man coming as he had done now had come with all commendable speed how foolish had she been with her wretched impatience  there he was certainly tying his horse up to the railing mamma what am i to say to him  nay dear he is your own friendof your own making you must say what you think fit  you are not going  i think we had better dear then she went and jane with her and jane opened the door for major grantly mr crawley himself was away at hoggle end and did not return till after major grantly had left the parsonage jane as she greeted the grand gentleman whom she had seen and no more than seen hardly knew what to say to him when after a minutes hesitation she told him that grace was in therepointing to the sittingroom door she felt that she had been very awkward henry grantly however did not i think feel her awkwardness being conscious of some small difficulties of his own when however he found that grace was alone the task before him at once lost half its difficulties grace he said am i right to come to you now  i do not know she said i cannot tell  dearest grace there is no reason on earth now why you should not be my wife  is there not  i know of noneif you can love me you saw my father  yes i saw him  and you heard what he said  i hardly remember what he saidbut he kissed me and i thought he was very kind  what little attempt henry grantly then made thinking that he could not do better than follow closely the example of so excellent a father need not be explained with minuteness but i think that his first effort was not successful grace was embarrassed and retreated and it was not till she had been compelled to give a direct answer to a direct question that she submitted to allow his arm round her waist but when she had answered that question she was almost more humble than becomes a maiden who has just been wooed and won a maiden who has been wooed and won generally thinks that it is she who has conquered and chooses to be triumphant accordingly but grace was even mean enough to thank her lover i do not know why you should be so good to me she said  because i love you said he better than all the world  but why should you be so good to me as that why should you love me i am such a poor thing for a man like you to love  i have had the wit to see that you are not a poor thing grace and it is thus that i have earned my treasure some girls are poor things and some are rich treasures  if love can make me a treasure i will be your treasure and if love can make me rich i will be rich for you after that i think he had no difficulty in following in his fathers footsteps  after a while mrs crawley came in and there was much pleasant talking among them while henry grantly sat happily with his love as though waiting for mr crawleys return but though he was there nearly all the morning mr crawley did not return i think he likes the brickmakers better than anybody in all the world except ourselves said grace i dont know how he will manage to get on without his friends before grace had said this major grantly had told all his story and had produced a letter from his father addressed to mr crawley of which the reader shall have a copy although at this time the letter had not been opened the letter was as follows      plumstead rectory  may 186     my dear sir     you will no doubt have heard that mr harding the vicar    of st ewolds who was the father of my wife and of mrs    arabin has been taken from us the loss to us of so    excellent and so dear a man has been very great i have    conferred with my friend the dean of barchester as to a    new nomination and i venture to request your acceptance    of the preferment if it should suit you to move from    hogglestock to st ewolds it may be as well that i should    state plainly my reasons for making this offer to a    gentleman with whom i am not personally acquainted mr    harding on his deathbed himself suggested it moved    thereto by what he had heard of the cruel and undeserved    persecution to which you have lately been subjected    as alsoon which point he was very urgent in what he    saidby the character which you bear in the diocese for    zeal and piety i may also add that the close connection    which as i understand is likely to take place between    your family and mine has been an additional reason for    my taking this step and the long friendship which has    existed between you and my wifes brotherinlaw the dean    of barchester is a third     st ewolds is worth £350 per annum besides the house    which is sufficiently commodious for a moderate family    the population is about twelve hundred of which more than    a half consists of persons dwelling in an outskirt of the    cityfor the parish runs almost into barchester     i shall be glad to have your reply with as little delay    as may suit your convenience and in the event of your    accepting the offerwhich i sincerely trust you may be    enabled to doi shall hope to have an early opportunity    of seeing you with reference to your institution to the    parish     allow me also to say to you and to mrs crawley that if    we have been correctly informed as to that other event    to which i have alluded we both hope that we may have    an early opportunity of making ourselves personally    acquainted with the parents of a young lady who is to    be so dear to us as i have met your daughter i may    perhaps be allowed to send her my kindest love if as my    daughterinlaw she comes up to the impression which she    gave me at our first meeting i at any rate shall be    satisfied     i have the honour to be my dear sir    your most faithful servant     theophilus grantly   this letter the archdeacon had shown to his wife by whom it had not been very warmly approved nothing mrs grantly had said could be prettier than what the archdeacon had said about grace mrs crawley no doubt would be satisfied with that but mr crawley was such a strange man he will be stranger than i take him to be if he does not accept st ewolds said the archdeacon but in offering it said mrs grantly you have not said a word of your own high opinion of his merits i have not a very high opinion of them said the archdeacon your father had and i have said so and as i have the most profound respect for your fathers opinion in such a matter i have permitted that to overcome my own hesitation this was pretty from the husband to the wife as it regarded her father who had now gone from them and therefore mrs grantly accepted it without further argument the reader may probably feel assured that the archdeacon had never during their joint lives acted in any church matter upon the advice given to him by mr harding and it was probably the case also that the living would have been offered to mr crawley if nothing had been said by mr harding on the subject but it did not become mrs grantly even to think of all this the archdeacon having made his gracious speech about her father was not again asked to alter his letter i suppose he will accept it said mrs grantly i should think that he probably may said the archdeacon  so grace knowing what was the purport of the letter sat with it between her fingers while her lover sat beside her full of various plans for the future this was his first lovers present to herand what a present it was comfort and happiness and a pleasant home for all her family st ewolds isnt the best house in the world said the major because it is old and what i call piecemeal but it is very pretty and certainly nice that is just the sort of parsonage that i dream about said jane and the garden is pleasant with old trees said the major i always dream about old trees said jane only im afraid im too old myself to be let to climb up them now mrs crawley said very little but sat by with her eyes full of tears was it possible that at last before the world had closed upon her she was to enjoy something again of the comforts which she had known in her early years and to be again surrounded by those decencies of life which of late had been almost banished from her home by poverty  their various plans for the futurefor the immediate futurewere very startling grace was to go over at once to plumstead whither edith had been already transferred from cosby lodge that was all very well there was nothing very startling or impracticable in that the framley ladies having none of those doubts as to what was coming which had for a while perplexed grace herself had taken little liberties with her wardrobe which enabled such a visit to be made without overwhelming difficulties but the major was equally eageror at any rate equally imperiousin his requisition for a visit from mr and mrs crawley themselves to plumstead rectory mrs crawley did not dare to put forward the plain unadorned reasons against it as mr crawley had done when discussing the subject of a visit to the deanery nor could she quite venture to explain that she feared that the archdeacon and her husband would hardly mix well together in society with whom indeed was it possible that her husband should mix well after his long and hardlytried seclusion she could only plead that both her husband and herself were so little used to going out that she fearedshe fearedshe feared she knew not what well get over all that said the major almost contemptuously it is only the first plunge that is disagreeable perhaps the major did not know how very disagreeable a first plunge may be  at two oclock henry grantly got up to go i should very much like to have seen him but i fear i cannot wait longer as it is the patience of my horse has been surprising then grace walked out with him to the gate and put her hand upon his bridle as he mounted and thought how wonderful was the power of fortune that the goddess should have sent so gallant a gentleman to be her lord and her lover i declare i dont quite believe it even yet she said in the letter which she wrote to lily dale that night  it was four before mr crawley returned to his house and then he was very weary there were many sick in these days at hoggle end and he had gone from cottage to cottage through the day giles hoggett was almost unable to work from rheumatism but still was of opinion that doggedness might carry him on its been a deal o service to you muster crawley he said we hears about it all if you hadnt a been dogged whered you a been now with giles hoggett and others he had remained all the day and now he came home weary and beaten youll tell him first grace had said and then ill give him the letter the wife was the first to tell him of the good fortune that was coming  he flung himself into the old chair as soon as he entered and asked for some bread and tea jane has already gone for it dear said his wife we have had a visitor here josiah  a visitorwhat visitor  graces own friendhenry grantly  grace come here that i may kiss you and bless you he said very solemnly it would seem that the world is going to be very good to you  papa you must read this letter first  before i kiss my own darling then she knelt at his feet i see he said taking the letter it is from your lovers father peradventure he signifies his consent which would be surely needful before such a marriage would be seemly  illustration peradventure he signifies his consent  it isnt about me papa at all  not about you if so that would be most unpromising but in any case you are my best darling then he kissed her and blessed her and slowly opened the letter his wife had now come close to him and was standing over him touching him so that she also could read the archdeacons letter grace who was still in front of him could see the working of his face as he read it but even she could not tell whether he was gratified or offended or dismayed when he had got as far as the first offer of the presentation he ceased reading for a while and looked round about the room as though lost in thought let me see what further he writes to me he then said and after that he continued the letter slowly to the end nay my child you were in error in saying that he wrote not about you tis in writing of you he has put some real heart into his words he writes as though his home would be welcome to you  and does he not make st ewolds welcome to you papa  he makes me welcome to accept itif i may use the word after the ordinary and somewhat faulty parlance of mankind  and you will accept itof course  i know not that my dear the acceptance of a cure of souls is a thing not to be decided on in a momentas is the colour of a garment or the shape of a toy nor would i condescend to take this thing from the archdeacons hands if i thought that he bestowed it simply that the father of his daughterinlaw might no longer be accounted poor  does he say that papa  he gives it as a collateral reason basing his offer first on the kindly expressed judgment of one who is now no more then he refers to the friendship of the dean if he believed that the judgment of his late fatherinlaw in so weighty a matter were the best to be relied upon of all that were at his command then he would have done well to trust to it but in such case he should have bolstered up a good ground for action with no collateral supports which are weakand worse than weak however it shall have my best consideration whereunto i hope that wisdom will be given me where only such wisdom can be had  josiah said his wife to him when they were alone you will not refuse it  not willinglynot if it may be accepted alas you need not urge me when the temptation is so strong     chapter lxxxiii  mr crawley is conquered   it was more than a week before the archdeacon received a reply from mr crawley during which time the dean had been over at hogglestock more than once as had also mrs arabin and lady lufton the youngerand there had been letters written without end and the archdeacon had been nearly beside himself a man who pretends to conscientious scruples of that kind is not fit to have a parish he had said to his wife his wife understood what he meant and i trust that the reader may also understand it in the ordinary cutting of blocks a very fine razor is not an appropriate instrument the archdeacon moreover loved the temporalities of the church as temporalities the church was beautiful to him because one man by interest might have a thousand a year while another man equally good but without interest could only have a hundred and he liked the men who had the interest a great deal better than the men who had it not he had been willing to admit this poor perpetual curate who had so long been kept out in the cold within the pleasant circle which was warm with ecclesiastical good things and the man hesitatedbecause of scruples as the dean told him i always button up my pocket when i hear of scruples the archdeacon said  but at last mr crawley condescended to accept st ewolds reverend and dear sir he said in his letter      for the personal benevolence of the offer made to me in    your letter of the  instant i beg to tender you my    most grateful thanks as also for your generous kindness    to me in telling me of the high praise bestowed upon me    by a gentleman who is now no morewhose character i    have esteemed and whose good opinion i value there is    methinks something inexpressibly dear to me in the    recorded praise of the dead for the further instance    of the friendship of the dean of barchester i am also    thankful     since the receipt of your letter i have doubted much as to    my fitness for the work you have proposed to entrust to    menot from any feeling that the parish of st ewolds    may be beyond my intellectual power but because the    latter circumstances of my life have been of a nature so    strange and perplexing that they have left me somewhat    in doubt as to my own aptitude for going about among men    without giving offence and becoming a stumblingblock     nevertheless reverend and dear sir if after this    confession on my part of a certain faulty demeanour with    which i know well that i am afflicted you are still    willing to put the parish into my hands i will accept the    chargeinstigated to do so by the advice of all whom i    have consulted on the subject and in thus accepting it    i hereby pledge myself to vacate it at a months warning    should i be called upon by you to do so at any period    within the next two years should i be so far successful    during those twentyfour months as to have satisfied both    yourself and myself i may then perhaps venture to regard    the preferment as my own in perpetuity for life     i have the honour to be reverend and dear sir    your most humble and faithful servant     josiah crawley   psha said the archdeacon who professed that he did not at all like the letter i wonder what he would say if i sent him a months notice at next michaelmas  im sure he would go said mrs grantly  the more fool he said the archdeacon  at this time grace was at the parsonage in a seventh heaven of happiness the archdeacon was never rough to her nor did he make any of his harsh remarks about her father in her presence before her st ewolds was spoken of as the home that was to belong to the crawleys for the next twenty years mrs grantly was very loving with her lavishing upon her pretty presents and words that were prettier than the presents graces life had hitherto been so destitute of those prettinesses and softnesses which can hardly be had without money though money alone will not purchase them that it seemed to her now that the heavens rained graciousness upon her it was not that the archdeacons watch or her lovers chain or mrs grantlys locket or the little toy from italy which mrs arabin brought to her from the treasures of the deanery filled her heart with undue exultation it was not that she revelled in her new delights of silver and gold and shining gems but that the silver and gold and shining gems were constant indications to her that things had changed not only for her but for her father and mother and brother and sister she felt now more sure than ever that she could not have enjoyed her love had she accepted her lover while the disgrace of the accusation against her father remained but nowhaving waited till that had passed away everything was a new happiness to her  at last it was settled that mr and mrs crawley were to come to plumsteadand they came it would be too long to tell now how gradually had come about that changed state of things which made such a visit possible mr crawley had at first declared that such a thing was quite out of the question if st ewolds was to depend upon it st ewolds must be given up and i think that it would have been impossible for him to go direct from hogglestock to plumstead but it fell out after this wise  mr hardings curate at st ewolds was nominated to hogglestock and the dean urged upon his friend crawley the expediency of giving up the house as quickly as he could do so gradually at this time mr crawley had been forced into a certain amount of intimacy with the haunts of men he had been twice or thrice at barchester and had lunched with the dean he had been at framley for an hour or two and had been forced into some communication with old mr thorne the squire of his new parish the end of this had been that he had at last consented to transfer himself and wife and daughter to the deanery for a fortnight he had preached one farewell sermon at hogglestocknot as he told his audience as their pastor which he had ceased to be now for some two or three monthsbut as their old and loving friend to whom the use of his former pulpit had been lent that he might express himself thus among them for the last time his sermon was very short and was preached without book or notesbut he never once paused for a word or halted in the string or rhythm of his discourse the dean was there and declared to him afterwards that he had not given him credit for such powers of utterance any man can utter out of a full heart crawley had answered in this trumpery affair about myself my heart is full if we could only have our hearts full in other matters our utterances thereanent would receive more attention to all of which the dean made no reply  on the day after this the crawleys took their final departure from hogglestock all the brickmakers from hoggle end having assembled on the occasion with a purse containing seventeen pounds seven shillings and sixpence which they insisted on presenting to mr crawley and as to which there was a little difficulty and at the deanery they remained for a fortnight how mrs crawley under the guidance of mrs arabin had there so far trenched upon the revenues of st ewolds as to provide for her husband and herself raiment fitting for the worldly splendour of plumstead need not here be told in detail suffice to say the raiment was forthcoming and mr crawley found himself to be the perplexed possessor of a black dress coat in addition to the long frock coming nearly to his feet which was provided for his daily wear touching this garment there had been some discussion between the dean and the new vicar the dean had desired that it should be curtailed in length the vicar had remonstratedbut still with something of the weakness of compliance in his eye then the dean had persisted surely the price of the cloth wanted to perfect the comeliness of the garment cannot be much said the vicar almost woefully after that the dean relented and the comeliness of the coat was made perfect the new black long frock i think mr crawley liked but the dress coat with the suit complete perplexed him sorely  with his new coats and something also of new manners he and his wife went over to plumstead leaving jane at the deanery with mrs arabin the dean also went to plumstead they arrived there not much before dinner and as grace was there before them the first moments were not so bad before mr crawley had had time to feel himself lost in the drawingroom he was summoned away to prepare himself for dinnerfor dinner and for the coat which at the deanery he had been allowed to leave unworn i would with all my heart that i might retire to rest he said to his wife when the ceremony had been perfected  do not say so go down and take your place with them and speak your mind with themas you so well know how who among them can do it so well  i have been told said mr crawley that you shall take a cock which is lord of the farmyardthe cock of all that walkand when you have daubed his feathers with mud he shall be thrashed by every dunghill coward i say not that i was ever the cock of the walk but i know that they have daubed my feathers then he went down among the other poultry into the farmyard  at dinner he was very silent answering however with a sort of graceful stateliness any word that mrs grantly addressed to him mr thorne from ullathorne was there also to meet his new vicar as was also mr thornes very old sister miss monica thorne and lady anne grantly was thereshe having come with the expressed intention that the wives of the two brothers should know each otherbut with a warmer desire i think of seeing mr crawley of whom the clerical world had been talking much since some notice of the accusation against him had become general there were therefore ten or twelve at the dinnertable and mr crawley had not made one at such a board certainly since his marriage all went fairly smooth with him till the ladies left the room for though lady anne who sat at his left hand had perplexed him somewhat with clerical questions he had found that he was not called upon for much more than monosyllabic responses but in his heart he feared the archdeacon and he felt that when the ladies were gone the archdeacon would not leave him alone in his silence  as soon as the door was closed the first subject mooted was that of the plumstead fox which had been so basely murdered on mr thornes ground mr thorne had confessed the iniquity had dismissed the murderous keeper and all was serene but the greater on that account was the feasibility of discussing the question and the archdeacon had a good deal to say about it then mr thorne turned to the new vicar and asked him whether foxes abounded in hogglestock had he been asked as to the rats or the moles he would have known more about it  indeed sir i know not whether or no there be any foxes in the parish of hogglestock i do not remember me that i ever saw one it is an animal whose habits i have not watched  there is an earth at hoggle bushes said the major and i never knew it without a litter  i think i know the domestic whereabouts of every fox in plumstead said the archdeacon with an illnatured intention of astonishing mr crawley  of foxes with two legs our friend is speaking without doubt said the vicar of st ewolds with an attempt at grim pleasantry  of them we have none at plumstead noi was speaking of the dear old fellow with the brush pass the bottle mr crawley wont you fill your glass mr crawley passed the bottle but would not fill his glass then the dean looking up slily saw the vexation written in the archdeacons face the parson whom the archdeacon feared most of all parsons was the parson who wouldnt fill his glass  then the subject was changed im told that the bishop has at last made his reappearance on his throne said the archdeacon  he was in the cathedral last sunday said the dean  does he ever mean to preach again  he never did preach very often said the dean  a great deal too often from all that people say said the archdeacon i never heard him myself and never shall i dare say you have heard him mr crawley  i have never had that good fortune mr archdeacon but living as i shall now do so near to the city i may perhaps be enabled to attend the cathedral service on some holyday of the church which may not require prayers in my own rural parish i think that the clergy of the diocese should be acquainted with the opinions and with the voice and with the very manner and words of their bishop as things are now done this is not possible i could wish that there were occasions on which a bishop might assemble his clergy and preach to them sermons adapted to their use  what do you call a bishops charge then  it is usually in the printed form that i have received it said mr crawley  i think we have quite enough of that kind of thing said the archdeacon    he is a man whose conversation is not pleasing to me mr crawley said to his wife that night  do not judge of him too quickly josiah his wife said there is so much of good in him he is kind and generous and i think affectionate  but he is of the earth earthy when you and the other ladies had retired the conversation at first fell on the habits and value offoxes i have been informed that in these parts the fox is greatly prized as without a fox to run before the dogs that scampering over the country which is called hunting and which delights by the quickness and perhaps by the peril of the exercise is not relished by the riders of the wisdom or taste herein displayed by the hunters of the day i say nothing but it seemed to me that in talking of foxes dr grantly was master of his subject thence the topic glided to the duties of a bishop and to questions of preaching as to which dr grantly was not slow in offering his opinion but i thought that i would rather have heard him talk about the foxes for a week together she said nothing more to him knowing well how useless it was to attempt to turn him by any argument to her thinking the kindness of the archdeacon to them personally demanded some indulgence in the expression and even in the formation of an opinion respecting his clerical peculiarities  on the next day however mr crawley having been summoned by the archdeacon into the library for a little private conversation found that he got on better with him how the archdeacon conquered him may perhaps be best described by a further narration of what mr crawley said to his wife i told him that in regard to money matters as he called them i had nothing to say i only trusted that his son was aware that my daughter had no money and never would have any my dear crawley the archdeacon saidfor of late there seems to have grown up in the world a habit of greater familiarity than that which i think did prevail when last i moved much among menmy dear crawley i have enough for both i would we stood on more equal grounds i said then as he answered me he rose from his chair we stand said he on the only perfect level on which such men can meet each other we are both gentlemen sir i said rising also from the bottom of my heart i agree with you i could not have spoken such words but coming from you who are rich to me who am poor they are honourable to the one and comfortable to the other  and after that  he took down from the shelves a volume of sermons which his father published many years ago and presented it to me i have it now under my arm it hath the old bishops manuscript notes which i will study carefully and thus the archdeacon had hit his bird on both wings     chapter lxxxiv  conclusion   it now only remains for me to gather together a few loose strings and tie them together in a knot so that my work may not become untwisted early in july henry grantly and grace crawley were married in the parish church of plumsteada great impropriety as to which neither archdeacon grantly nor mr crawley could be got to assent for a long time but which was at last carried not simply by a union of mrs grantly and mrs crawley nor even by the assistance of mrs arabin but by the strong intervention of old lady lufton herself of course miss crawley ought to be married from st ewolds vicarage but when the furniture has only half been got in how is it possible when lady lufton thus spoke the archdeacon gave way and mr crawley hadnt a leg to stand upon henry grantly had not an opinion upon the matter he told his father that he expected that they would marry him among them and that that would be enough for him as for grace nobody even thought of asking her and i doubt whether she would have heard anything about the contest had not some tidings of it reached her from her lover married they were at plumsteadand the breakfast was given with all that luxuriance of plenty which was so dear to the archdeacons mind mr crawley was the officiating priest with his hands dropping before him folded humbly he told the archdeaconwhen that plumstead question had been finally settled in opposition to his wishesthat he would fain himself perform the ceremony by which his dearest daughter would be bound to her marriage duties and who else should said the archdeacon mr crawley muttered that he had not known how far his reverend brother might have been willing to waive his rights but the archdeacon who was in high good humourhaving just bestowed a little pony carriage on his new daughterinlawonly laughed at him and if the rumour which was handed about the families be true the archdeacon before the interview was over had poked mr crawley in the ribs mr crawley married them but the archdeacon assistedand the dean gave away the bride the rev charles grantly was there also and as there was as a matter of course a cloud of curates floating in the distance henry grantly was perhaps to be excused for declaring to his wife when the pair had escaped that surely no couple had ever been so tightly buckled since marriage had first become a church ceremony  soon after that mr and mrs crawley became quiet at st ewolds and as i think contented her happiness began very quickly though she had been greatly broken by her troubles the first sight she had of her husband in his new long frockcoat went far to restore her and while he was declaring himself to be a cock so daubed with mud as to be incapable of crowing she was congratulating herself on seeing her husband once more clothed as became his position and they were lucky too as regarded the squires house for mr thorne was old and quiet and oldfashioned and miss thorne was older and though she was not exactly quiet she was very oldfashioned indeed so that there grew to be a pleasant friendship between miss thorne and mrs crawley  johnny eames when last i heard of him was still a bachelor and as i think likely to remain so at last he had utterly thrown over sir raffle buffle declaring to his friends that the special duties of private secretaryship were not exactly to his taste you get so sick at the thirteenth private note he said that you find yourself unable to carry on the humbug any farther but he did not leave his office im the head of a room you know he told lady julia de guest and theres nothing to trouble meand a fellow you know ought to have something to do lady julia told him with a great deal of energy that she would never forgive him if he gave up his office after that eventful night when he escaped ignominiously from the house of lady demolines under the protection of the policemans lantern he did hear more than once from porchester terrace and from allies employed by the enemy who was there resident my cousin the serjeant proved to be a myth johnny found out all about that serjeant runter who was distantly connected indeed with the late husband of lady demolines but had always persistently declined to have any intercourse whatever with her ladyship for the serjeant was a rising man and lady demolines was not exactly progressing in the world johnny heard nothing from the serjeant but from madalina he got letter after letter in the first she asked him not to think too much of the little joke that had occurred in her second she described the vehemence of her love in her third the bitterness of her wrath her fourth she simply invited him to come and dine in porchester terrace her fifth was the outpouring of injured innocence and then came letters from an attorney johnny answered not a word to any of them and gradually the letters were discontinued within six months of the receipt of the last he was delighted by reading among the marriages in the newspapers a notice that peter bangles esq of the firm of burton and bangles wine merchants of hook court had been united to madalina daughter of the late sir confucius demolines at the church of peter the martyr most appropriate said johnny as he read the notice to conway dalrymple who was then back from his wedding tour for most assuredly there will be now another peter the martyr  im not so sure of that said conway who had heard something of mr peter bangles there are men who have strong wills of their own and strong hands of their own  poor madalina said johnny if he does beat her i hope he will do it tenderly it may be that a little of it will suit her fevered temperament  before the summer was over conway dalrymple had been married to clara van siever and by a singular arrangement of circumstances had married her with the full approval of old mrs van mr musselborowhose name i hope has not been altogether forgotten though the part played by him has been subordinatehad opposed dalrymple in the efforts made by the artist to get something out of broughtons estate for the benefit of the widow from circumstances of which dalrymple learned the particulars with the aid of an attorney it seemed to him that certain facts were wilfully kept in the dark by musselboro and he went with his complaint to mrs van siever declaring that he would bring the whole affair into court unless all the workings of the firm were made clear to him mrs van was very insolent to himand even turned him out of the house but nevertheless she did not allow mr musselboro to escape whoever was to be left in the dark she did not wish to be there herselfand it began to dawn upon her that her dear musselboro was deceiving her then she sent for dalrymple and without a word of apology for her former conduct put him upon the right track as he was pushing his inquiries and working heaven and earth for the unfortunate widowas to whom he swore daily that when this matter was settled he would never see her again so terrible was she to him with her mock affection and pretended hysterics and false moralitieshe was told one day that she had gone off with mr musselboro mr musselboro finding that this was the surest plan of obtaining for himself the little business in hook court married the widow of his late partner and is at this moment probably carrying on a lawsuit with mrs van for the lawsuit conway dalrymple cared nothing when the quarrel had become hot between mrs van and her late myrmidon clara fell into conways hands without opposition and let the lawsuit go as it may there will be enough left of mrs vans money to make the house of mr and mrs conway dalrymple very comfortable the picture of jael and sisera was stitched up without any difficulty and i daresay most of my readers will remember it hanging on the walls of the exhibition  before i take my leave of the diocese of barchester for ever which i purpose to do in the succeeding paragraph i desire to be allowed to say one word of apology for myself in answer to those who have accused mealways without bitterness and generally with tendernessof having forgotten in writing of clergymen the first and most prominent characteristic of the ordinary english clergymans life i have described many clergymen they say but have spoken of them all as though their professional duties their high calling their daily workings for the good of those around them were matters of no moment either to me or in my opinion to themselves i would plead in answer to this that my object has been to paint the social and not the professional lives of clergymen and that i have been led to do so firstly by a feeling that as no men affect more strongly by their own character the society of those around than do country clergymen so therefore their social habits have been worth the labour necessary for painting them and secondly by a feeling that though i as a novelist may feel myself entitled to write of clergymen out of their pulpits as i may also write of lawyers and doctors i have no such liberty to write of them in their pulpits when i have done so if i have done so i have so far transgressed there are those who have told me that i have made all my clergymen bad and none good i must venture to hint to such judges that they have taught their eyes to love a colouring higher than nature justifies we are most of us apt to love raphaels madonnas better than rembrandts matrons but though we do so we know that rembrandts matrons existed but we have a strong belief that no such woman as raphael painted ever did exist in that he painted as he may be surmised to have done for pious purposesat least for church purposesraphael was justified but had he painted so for family portraiture he would have been false had i written an epic about clergymen i would have taken st paul for my model but describing as i have endeavoured to do such clergymen as i see around me i could not venture to be transcendental for myself i can only say that i shall always be happy to sit when allowed to do so at the table of archdeacon grantly to walk through the high street of barchester arm in arm with mr robarts of framley and to stand alone and shed a tear beneath the modest black stone in the north transept of the cathedral on which is inscribed the name of septimus harding  and now if the reader will allow me to seize him affectionately by the arm we will together take our last farewell of barset and of the towers of barchester i may not venture to say to him that in this country he and i together have wandered often through the country lanes and have ridden together over the toowell wooded fields or have stood together in the cathedral nave listening to the peals of the organ or have together sat at good mens tables or have confronted together the angry pride of men who were not good i may not boast that any beside myself have so realized the place and the people and the facts as to make such reminiscences possible as those which i should attempt to evoke by an appeal to perfect fellowship but to me barset has been a real county and its city a real city and the spires and towers have been before my eyes and the voices of the people are known to my ears and the pavement of the city ways are familiar to my footsteps to them all i now say farewell that i have been induced to wander among them too long by my love of old friendships and by the sweetness of old faces is a fault for which i may perhaps be more readily forgiven when i repeat with some solemnity of assurance the promise made in my title that this shall be the last chronicle of barset
