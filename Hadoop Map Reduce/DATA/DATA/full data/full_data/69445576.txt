69445576	the valley of the moon  by jack london     book i    chapter 1  you hear me saxon come on along what if it is the bricklayers ill have gentlemen friends there and soll you the al vista bandll be along an you know it plays heavenly an you just love dancin  twenty feet away a stout elderly woman interrupted the girls persuasions the elderly womans back was turned and the backloose bulging and misshapenbegan a convulsive heaving  gawd she cried out o gawd  she flung wild glances like those of an entrapped animal up and down the big whitewashed room that panted with heat and that was thickly humid with the steam that sizzled from the damp cloth under the irons of the many ironers from the girls and women near her all swinging irons steadily but at high pace came quick glances and labor efficiency suffered to the extent of a score of suspended or inadequate movements the elderly womans cry had caused a tremor of moneyloss to pass among the piecework ironers of fancy starch  she gripped herself and her iron with a visible effort and dabbed futilely at the frail frilled garment on the board under her hand  i thought shed gotem againdidnt you the girl said  its a shame a women of her age and condition saxon answered as she frilled a lace ruffle with a hot flutingiron her movements were delicate safe and swift and though her face was wan with fatigue and exhausting heat there was no slackening in her pace  an her with seven an two of em in reform school the girl at the next board sniffed sympathetic agreement but you just got to come to weasel park tomorrow saxon the bricklayers is always livelytugsofwar fatman races real irish jiggin an an everything an the floor of the pavilions swell  but the elderly woman brought another interruption she dropped her iron on the shirtwaist clutched at the board fumbled it caved in at the knees and hips and like a halfempty sack collapsed on the floor her long shriek rising in the pent room to the acrid smell of scorching cloth the women at the boards near to her scrambled first to the hot iron to save the cloth and then to her while the forewoman hurried belligerently down the aisle the women farther away continued unsteadily at their work losing movements to the extent of a minutes setback to the totality of the efficiency of the fancystarch room  enough to kill a dog the girl muttered thumping her iron down on its rest with reckless determination workin girls life aint what its cracked up me to quitthats what im comin to  mary saxon uttered the others name with a reproach so profound that she was compelled to rest her own iron for emphasis and so lose a dozen movements  mary flashed a halffrightened look across  i didnt mean it saxon she whimpered honest i didnt i wouldnt never go that way but i leave it to you if a day like this dont get on anybodys nerves listen to that  the stricken woman on her back drumming her heels on the floor was shrieking persistently and monotonously like a mechanical siren two women clutching her under the arms were dragging her down the aisle she drummed and shrieked the length of it the door opened and a vast muffled roar of machinery burst in and in the roar of it the drumming and the shrieking were drowned ere the door swung shut remained of the episode only the scorch of cloth drifting ominously through the air  its sickenin said mary  and thereafter for a long time the many irons rose and fell the pace of the room in no wise diminished while the forewoman strode the aisles with a threatening eye for incipient breakdown and hysteria occasionally an ironer lost the stride for an instant gasped or sighed then caught it up again with weary determination the long summer day waned but not the heat and under the raw flare of electric light the work went on  by nine oclock the first women began to go home the mountain of fancy starch had been demolishedall save the few remnants here and there on the boards where the ironers still labored  saxon finished ahead of mary at whose board she paused on the way out  saturday night an another week gone mary said mournfully her young cheeks pallid and hollowed her black eyes blueshadowed and tired what dyou think youve made saxon  twelve and a quarter was the answer just touched with pride and id amade more if it wasnt for that fake bunch of starchers  my i got to pass it to you mary congratulated youre a sure fierce hustlerjust eat it up meive only ten an a half an for a hard week see you on the nineforty sure now we can just fool around until the dancin begins a lot of my gentlemen friendsll be there in the afternoon  two blocks from the laundry where an arclight showed a gang of toughs on the corner saxon quickened her pace unconsciously her face set and hardened as she passed she did not catch the words of the muttered comment but the rough laughter it raised made her guess and warmed her checks with resentful blood three blocks more turning once to left and once to right she walked on through the night that was already growing cool on either side were workingmens houses of weathered wood the ancient paint grimed with the dust of years conspicuous only for cheapness and ugliness  dark it was but she made no mistake the familiar sag and screeching reproach of the front gate welcome under her hand she went along the narrow walk to the rear avoided the missing step without thinking about it and entered the kitchen where a solitary gasjet flickered she turned it up to the best of its flame it was a small room not disorderly because of lack of furnishings to disorder it the plaster discolored by the steam of many washdays was crisscrossed with cracks from the big earthquake of the previous spring the floor was ridged widecracked and uneven and in front of the stove it was worn through and repaired with a fivegallon oilcan hammered flat and double a sink a dirty rollertowel several chairs and a wooden table completed the picture  an applecore crunched under her foot as she drew a chair to the table on the frayed oilcloth a supper waited she attempted the cold beans thick with grease but gave them up and buttered a slice of bread  the rickety house shook to a heavy prideless tread and through the inner door came sarah middleaged lopbreasted hairtousled her face lined with care and fat petulance  huh its you she grunted a greeting i just couldnt keep things warm such a day i near died of the heat an little henry cut his lip awful the doctor had to put four stitches in it  sarah came over and stood mountainously by the table  whats the matter with them beans she challenged  nothing only saxon caught her breath and avoided the threatened outburst only im not hungry its been so hot all day it was terrible in the laundry  recklessly she took a mouthful of the cold tea that had been steeped so long that it was like acid in her mouth and recklessly under the eye of her sisterinlaw she swallowed it and the rest of the cupful she wiped her mouth on her handkerchief and got up  i guess ill go to bed  wonder you aint out to a dance sarah sniffed funny aint it you come home so dead tired every night an yet any night in the week you can get out an dance unearthly hours  saxon started to speak suppressed herself with tightened lips then lost control and blazed out wasnt you ever young  without waiting for reply she turned to her bedroom which opened directly off the kitchen it was a small room eight by twelve and the earthquake had left its marks upon the plaster a bed and chair of cheap pine and a very ancient chest of drawers constituted the furniture saxon had known this chest of drawers all her life the vision of it was woven into her earliest recollections she knew it had crossed the plains with her people in a prairie schooner it was of solid mahogany one end was cracked and dented from the capsize of the wagon in rock canyon a bullethole plugged in the face of the top drawer told of the fight with the indians at little meadow of these happenings her mother had told her also had she told that the chest had come with the family originally from england in a day even earlier than the day on which george washington was born  above the chest of drawers on the wall hung a small lookingglass thrust under the molding were photographs of young men and women and of picnic groups wherein the young men with hats rakishly on the backs of their heads encircled the girls with their arms farther along on the wall were a colored calendar and numerous colored advertisements and sketches torn out of magazines most of these sketches were of horses from the gasfixture hung a tangled bunch of wellscribbled dance programs  saxon started to take off her hat but suddenly sat down on the bed she sobbed softly with considered repression but the weaklatched door swung noiselessly open and she was startled by her sisterinlaws voice  now whats the matter with you if you didnt like them beans  no no saxon explained hurriedly im just tired thats all and my feet hurt i wasnt hungry sarah im just beat out  if you took care of this house came the retort an cooked an baked an washed an put up with what i put up youd have something to be beat out about youve got a snap you have but just wait sarah broke off to cackle gloatingly just wait thats all an youll be fool enough to get married some day

with five mouths to feed an nothin comin in  she stopped out of breath but seething with the tirade yet to come  oh sarah please wont you shut the door saxon pleaded  the door slammed violently and saxon ere she fell to crying again could hear her sisterinlaw lumbering about the kitchen and talking loudly to herself    chapter ii  each bought her own ticket at the entrance to weasel park and each as she laid her halfdollar down was distinctly aware of how many pieces of fancy starch were represented by the coin it was too early for the crowd but bricklayers and their families laden with huge lunchbaskets and armfuls of babies were already going ina healthy husky race of workmen wellpaid and robustly fed and with them here and there undisguised by their decent american clothing smaller in bulk and stature weazened not alone by age but by the pinch of lean years and early hardship were grandfathers and mothers who had patently first seen the light of day on old irish soil their faces showed content and pride as they limped along with this lusty progeny of theirs that had fed on better food  not with these did mary and saxon belong they knew them not had no acquaintances among them it did not matter whether the festival were irish german or slavonian whether the picnic was the bricklayers the brewers or the butchers they the girls were of the dancing crowd that swelled by a certain constant percentage the gate receipts of all the picnics  they strolled about among the booths where peanuts were grinding and popcorn was roasting in preparation for the day and went on and inspected the dance floor of the pavilion saxon clinging to an imaginary partner essayed a few steps of the dipwaltz mary clapped her hands  my she cried youre just swell an them stockins is peaches  saxon smiled with appreciation pointed out her foot velvetslippered with high cuban heels and slightly lifted the tight black skirt exposing a trim ankle and delicate swell of calf the white flesh gleaming through the thinnest and flimsiest of fiftycent black silk stockings she was slender not tall yet the due round lines of womanhood were hers on her white shirtwaist was a pleated jabot of cheap lace caught with a large novelty pin of imitation coral over the shirtwaist was a natty jacket elbowsleeved and to the elbows she wore gloves of imitation suede the one essentially natural touch about her appearance was the few curls strangers to curlingirons that escaped from under the little naughty hat of black velvet pulled low over the eyes  marys dark eyes flashed with joy at the sight and with a swift little run she caught the other girl in her arms and kissed her in a breastcrushing embrace she released her blushing at her own extravagance  you look good to me she cried in extenuation if i was a man i couldnt keep my hands off you id eat you i sure would  they went out of the pavilion hand in hand and on through the sunshine they strolled swinging hands gaily reacting exuberantly from the week of deadening toil they hung over the railing of the bearpit shivering at the huge and lonely denizen and passed quickly on to ten minutes of laughter at the monkey cage crossing the grounds they looked down into the little race track on the bed of a natural amphitheater where the early afternoon games were to take place after that they explored the woods threaded by countless paths ever opening out in new surprises of greenpainted rustic tables and benches in leafy nooks many of which were already preempted by family parties on a grassy slope treesurrounded they spread a newspaper and sat down on the short grass already tawnydry under the california sun half were they minded to do this because of the grateful indolence after six days of insistent motion half in conservation for the hours of dancing to come  bert wanhopell be sure to come mary chattered an he said he was going to bring billy robertsbig bill all the fellows call him hes just a big boy but hes awfully tough hes a prizefighter an all the girls run after him im afraid of him he aint quick in talkin hes more like that big bear we saw brrrf brrrfbite your head off just like that he aint really a prizefighter hes a teamsterbelongs to the union drives for coberly and morrison but sometimes he fights in the clubs most of the fellows are scared of him hes got a bad temper an hed just as soon hit a fellow as eat just like that you wont like him but hes a swell dancer hes heavy you know an he just slides and glides around you wanta have a dance withm anyway hes a good spender too never pinches but myhes got one temper  the talk wandered on a monologue on marys part that centered always on bert wanhope  you and he are pretty thick saxon ventured  id marrym tomorrow mary flashed out impulsively then her face went bleakly forlorn hard almost in its helpless pathos only he never asks me hes her pause was broken by sudden passion you watch out for him saxon if he ever comes foolin around you hes no good just the same id marry him tomorrow hell never get me any other way her mouth opened but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh its a funny world aint it she added more like a scream and all the stars are worlds too i wonder where god hides bert wanhope says there aint no god but hes just terrible he says the most terrible things i believe in god dont you what do you think about god saxon  saxon shrugged her shoulders and laughed  but if we do wrong we get ours dont we mary persisted thats what they all say except bert he says he dont care what he does hell never get his because when he dies hes dead an when hes dead hed like to see any one put anything across on him thatd wake him up aint he terrible though but its all so funny sometimes i get scared when i think gods keepin an eye on me all the time do you think he knows what im sayin now what do you think he looks like anyway  i dont know saxon answered hes just a funny proposition  oh the other gasped  he is just the same from what all people say of him saxon went on stoutly my brother thinks he looks like abraham lincoln sarah thinks he has whiskers  an i never think of him with his hair parted mary confessed daring the thought and shivering with apprehension he just couldnt have his hair parted thatd be funny  you know that little wrinkly mexican that sells wire puzzles saxon queried well god somehow always reminds me of him  mary laughed outright  now that is funny i never thought of him like that how do you make it out  well just like the little mexican he seems to spend his time peddling puzzles he passes a puzzle out to everybody and they spend all their lives tryin to work it out they all get stuck i cant work mine out i dont know where to start and look at the puzzle he passed sarah and shes part of toms puzzle and she only makes his worse and they all an everybody i knowyou tooare part of my puzzle  mebbe the puzzles is all right mary considered but god dont look like that yellow little greaser that i wont fall for god dont look like anybody dont you remember on the wall at the salvation army it says god is a spirit  thats another one of his puzzles i guess because nobody knows what a spirit looks like  thats right too mary shuddered with reminiscent fear whenever i try to think of god as a spirit i can see hen miller all wrapped up in a sheet an runnin us girls we didnt know an it scared the life out of us little maggie murphy fainted dead away and beatrice peralta fell an scratched her face horrible when i think of a spirit all i can see is a white sheet runnin in the dark just the same god dont look like a mexican an he dont wear his hair parted  a strain of music from the dancing pavilion brought both girls scrambling to their feet  we can get a couple of dances in before we eat mary proposed an then itll be afternoon an all the fellows ll be here most of them are pinchersthats why they dont come early so as to get out of taking the girls to dinner but berts free with his money an so is billy if we can beat the other girls to it theyll take us to the restaurant come on hurry saxon  there were few couples on the floor when they arrived at the pavilion and the two girls essayed the first waltz together  theres bert now saxon whispered as they came around the second time  dont take any notice of them mary whispered back well just keep on goin they neednt think were chasin after them  but saxon noted the heightened color in the others cheek and felt her quicker breathing  did you see that other one mary asked as she backed saxon in a long slide across the far end of the pavilion that was billy roberts bert said hed come hell take you to dinner and bertll take me its goin to be a swell day youll see my i only wish the musicll hold out till we can get back to the other end  down the floor they danced on mantrapping and dinnergetting intent two fresh young things that undeniably danced well and that were delightfully surprised when the music stranded them perilously near to their desire  bert and mary addressed each other by their given names but to saxon bert was mr wanhope though he called her by her first name the only introduction was of saxon and billy roberts mary carried it off with a flurry of nervous carelessness  mr robertmiss brown shes my best friend her first names saxon aint it a scream of a name  sounds good to me billy retorted hat off and hand extended pleased to meet you miss brown  as their hands clasped and she felt the teamster callouses on his palm her quick eyes saw a score of things about all that he saw was her eyes and then it was with a vague impression that they were blue not till later in the day did he realize that they were gray she on the contrary saw his eyes as they really weredeep blue wide and handsome in a sullenboyish way she saw that they were straightlooking and she liked them as she had liked the glimpse she had caught of his hand and as she liked the contact of his hand itself then too but not sharply she had perceived the short squareset nose the rosiness of cheek and the firm short upper lip ere delight centered her flash of gaze on the wellmodeled large clean mouth where red lips smiled clear of the white enviable teeth a boy a great big manboy was her thought and as they smiled at each other and their hands slipped apart she was startled by a glimpse of his hairshort and crisp and sandy hinting almost of palest gold save that it was too flaxen to hint of gold at all  so blond was he that she was reminded of stagetypes she had seen such as ole olson and yon yonson but there resemblance ceased it was a matter of color only for the eyes were darklashed and browed and were cloudy with temperament rather than staring a childgaze of wonder and the suit of smooth brown cloth had been made by a tailor saxon appraised the suit on the instant and her secret judgment was not a cent less than fifty dollars further he had none of the awkwardness of the scandinavian immigrant on the contrary he was one of those rare individuals that radiate muscular grace through the ungraceful mangarments of civilization every movement was supple slow and apparently considered this she did not see nor analyze she saw only a clothed man with grace of carriage and movement she felt rather than perceived the calm and certitude of all the muscular play of him and she felt too the promise of easement and rest that was especially grateful and cravedfor by one who had incessantly for six days and at topspeed ironed fancy starch as the touch of his hand had been good so to her this subtler feel of all of him body and mind was good  as he took her program and skirmished and joked after the way of young men she realized the immediacy of delight she had taken in him never in her life had she been so affected by any man she wondered to herself is this the man  he danced beautifully the joy was hers that good dancers take when they have found a good dancer for a partner the grace of those slowmoving certain muscles of his accorded perfectly with the rhythm of the music there was never doubt never a betrayal of indecision she glanced at bert dancing tough with mary caroming down the long floor with more than one collision with the increasing couples graceful himself in his slender tall leanstomached way bert was accounted a good dancer yet saxon did not remember ever having danced with him with keen pleasure just a hit of a jerk spoiled his dancinga jerk that did not occur usually but that always impended there was something spasmodic in his mind he was too quick or he continually threatened to be too quick he always seemed just on the verge of overrunning the time it was disquieting he made for unrest  youre a dream of a dancer billy roberts was saying ive heard lots of the fellows talk about your dancing  i love it she answered  but from the way she said it he sensed her reluctance to speak and danced on in silence while she warmed with the appreciation of a woman for gentle consideration gentle consideration was a thing rarely encountered in the life she lived is this the man she remembered marys id marry him tomorrow and caught herself speculating on marrying billy roberts by the next dayif he asked her  with eyes that dreamily desired to close she moved on in the arms of this masterful guiding pressure a prizefighter she experienced a thrill of wickedness as she thought of what sarah would say could she see her now only he wasnt a prizefighter but a teamster  came an abrupt lengthening of step the guiding pressure grew more compelling and she was caught up and carried along though her velvetshod feet never left the floor then came the sudden control down to the shorter step again and she felt herself being held slightly from him so that he might look into her face and laugh with her in joy at the exploit at the end as the band slowed in the last bars they too slowed their dance fading with the music in a lengthening glide that ceased with the last lingering tone  were sure cut out for each other when it comes to dancin he said as they made their way to rejoin the other couple  it was a dream she replied  so low was her voice that he bent to hear and saw the flush in her cheeks that seemed communicated to her eyes which were softly warm and sensuous he took the program from her and gravely and gigantically wrote his name across all the length of it  an now its no good he dared aint no need for it  he tore it across and tossed it aside  me for you saxon for the next was berts greeting as they came up you take mary for the next whirl bill  nothin doin bo was the retort me an saxons framed up to last the day  watch out for him saxon mary warned facetiously hes liable to get a crush on you  i guess i know a good thing when i see it billy responded gallantly  and so do i saxon aided and abetted  id a known you if id seen you in the dark billy added  mary regarded them with mock alarm and bert said goodnaturedly  all i got to say is you aint wastin any time gettin together just the same if you can spare a few minutes from each other after a couple more whirls mary an med be complimented to have your presence at dinner  just like that chimed mary  quit your kiddin billy laughed back turning his head to look into saxons eyes dont listen to em theyre grouched because they got to dance together berts a rotten dancer and mary aint so much come on there she goes see you after two more dances    chapter iii  they had dinner in the openair treewalled diningroom and saxon noted that it was billy who paid the reckoning for the four they knew many of the young men and women at the other tables and greetings and fun flew back and forth bert was very possessive with mary almost roughly so resting his hand on hers catching and holding it and once forcibly slipping off her two rings and refusing to return them for a long while at times when he put his arm around her waist mary promptly disengaged it and at other times with elaborate obliviousness that deceived no one she allowed it to remain  and saxon talking little but studying billy roberts very intently was satisfied that there would be an utter difference in the way he would do such things if ever he would do them anyway hed never paw a girl as bert and lots of the other fellows did she measured the breadth of billys heavy shoulders  why do they call you big bill she asked youre not so very tall  nope he agreed im only five feet eight an threequarters i guess it must be my weight  he fights at a hundred an eighty bert interjected  oh out it billy said quickly a cloudrift of displeasure showing in his eyes i aint a fighter i aint fought in six months ive quit it it dont pay  yon got two hundred the night you put the frisco slasher to the bad bert urged proudly  cut it cut it nowsay saxon you aint so big yourself are you but youre built just right if anybody should ask you youre round an slender at the same time i bet i can guess your weight  everybody guesses over it she warned while inwardly she was puzzled that she should at the same time be glad and regretful that he did not fight any more  not me he was saying im a wooz at weightguessin just you watch me he regarded her critically and it was patent that warm approval played its little rivalry with the judgment of his gaze wait a minute  he reached over to her and felt her arm at the biceps the pressure of the encircling fingers was firm and honest and saxon thrilled to it there was magic in this manboy she would have known only irritation had bert or any other man felt her arm but this man is he the man she was questioning when he voiced his conclusion  your clothes dont weigh moren seven pounds and seven fromhumsay one hundred an twentythreeone hundred an sixteen is your stripped weight  but at the penultimate word mary cried out with sharp reproof  why billy roberts people dont talk about such things  he looked at her with slowgrowing uncomprehending surprise  what things he demanded finally  there you go again you ought to be ashamed of yourself look youve got saxon blushing  i am not saxon denied indignantly  an if you keep on mary youll have me blushing billy growled i guess i know whats right an what aint it aint what a guy says but what he thinks an im thinkin right an saxon knows it an she an i aint thinkin what youre thinkin at all  oh oh mary cried youre gettin worse an worse i never think such things  whoa mary backup bert checked her peremptorily youre in the wrong stall billy never makes mistakes like that  but he neednt be so raw she persisted  come on mary an be good an cut that stuff was billys dismissal of her as he turned to saxon how near did i come to it  one hundred and twentytwo she answered looking deliberately at mary one twenty two with my clothes  billy burst into hearty laughter in which bert joined  i dont care mary protested youre terrible both of youan you too saxon id never athought it of you  listen to me kid bert began soothingly as his arm slipped around her waist  but in the false excitement she had worked herself into mary rudely repulsed the arm and then fearing that she had wounded her lovers feelings she took advantage of the teasing and banter to recover her good humor his arm was permitted to return and with heads bent together they talked in whispers  billy discreetly began to make conversation with saxon  say you know your name is a funny one i never heard it tagged on anybody before but its all right i like it  my mother gave it to me she was educated and knew all kinds of words she was always reading books almost until she died and she wrote lots and lots ive got some of her poetry published in a san jose newspaper long ago the saxons were a race of peopleshe told me all about them when i was a little girl they were wild like indians only they were white and they had blue eyes and yellow hair and they were awful fighters  as she talked billy followed her solemnly his eyes steadily turned on hers  never heard of them he confessed did they live anywhere around here  she laughed  no they lived in england they were the first english and you know the americans came from the english were saxons you an me an mary an bert and all the americans that are real americans you know and not dagoes and japs and such  my folks lived in america a long time billy said slowly digesting the information she had given and relating himself to it anyway my mothers folks did they crossed to maine hundreds of years ago  my father was state of maine she broke in with a little gurgle of joy and my mother was horn in ohio or where ohio is now she used to call it the great western reserve what was your father  dont know billy shrugged his shoulders he didnt know himself nobody ever knew though he was american all right all right  his names regular old american saxon suggested theres a big english general right now whose name is roberts ive read it in the papers  but roberts wasnt my fathers name he never knew what his name was roberts was the name of a goldminer who adopted him you see it was this way when they was indianfightin up there with the modoc indians a lot of the miners an settlers took a hand roberts was captain of one outfit and once after a fight they took a lot of prisonerssquaws an kids an babies an one of the kids was my father they figured he was about five years old he didnt know nothin but indian  saxon clapped her hands and her eyes sparkled hed been captured on an indian raid  thats the way they figured it billy nodded they recollected a wagontrain of oregon settlers thatd been killed by the modocs four years before roberts adopted him and thats why i dont know his real name but you can bank on it he crossed the plains just the same  so did my father saxon said proudly  an my mother too billy added pride touching his own voice anyway she came pretty close to crossin the plains because she was born in a wagon on the river platte on the way out  my mother too said saxon she was eight years old an she walked most of the way after the oxen began to give out  billy thrust out his hand  put her there kid he said were just like old friends what with the same kind of folks behind us  with shining eyes saxon extended her hand to his and gravely they shook  isnt it wonderful she murmured were both old american stock and if you arent a saxon there never was oneyour hair your eyes your skin everything and youre a fighter too  i guess all our old folks was fighters when it comes to that it come natural to em an doggone it they just had to fight or theyd never come through  what are you two talkin about mary broke in upon them  theyre thickern mush in no time bert girded youd think theyd known each other a week already  oh we knew each other longer than that saxon returned before ever we were born our folks were walkin across the plains together  when your folks was waitin for the railroad to be built an all the indians killed off before they dasted to start for california was billys way of proclaiming the new alliance were the real goods saxon ann me if anybody should ride up on a buzzwagon an ask you  oh i dont know mary boasted with quiet petulance my father stayed behind to fight in the civil war he was a drummerboy thats why he didnt come to california until afterward  and my father went back to fight in the civil war saxon said  and mine too said billy  they looked at each other gleefully again they had found a new contact  well theyre all dead aint they was berts saturnine comment there aint no difference dyin in battle or in the poorhouse the thing is theyre deado i wouldnt care a rap if my fatherd been hanged its all the same in a thousand years this braggin about folks makes me tired besides my father couldnt afought he wasnt born till two years after the war just the same two of my uncles were killed at gettysburg guess we done our share  just like that mary applauded  berts arm went around her waist again  were here aint we he said an thats what counts the dead are dead an you can bet your sweet life they just keep on stayin dead  mary put her hand over his mouth and began to chide him for his awfulness whereupon he kissed the palm of her hand and put his head closer to hers  the merry clatter of dishes was increasing as the diningroom filled up here and there voices were raised in snatches of song there were shrill squeals and screams and bursts of heavier male laughter as the everlasting skirmishing between the young men and girls played on among some of the men the signs of drink were already manifest at a near table girls were calling out to billy and saxon the sense of temporary possession already strong on her noted with jealous eyes that he was a favorite and desired object to them  aint they awful mary voiced her disapproval they got a nerve i know who they are no respectable girl d have a thing to do with them listen to that  oh you bill you one of them a buxom young brunette was calling hope you aint forgotten me bill  oh you chicken he called back gallantly  saxon flattered herself that he showed vexation and she conceived an immense dislike for the brunette  goin to dance the latter called  mebbe he answered and turned abruptly to saxon say we old americans oughta stick together dont you think they aint many of us left the countrys fillin up with all kinds of foreigners  he talked on steadily in a low confidential voice head close to hers as advertisement to the other girl that he was occupied  from the next table on the opposite side a young man had singled out saxon his dress was tough his companions male and female were tough his face was inflamed his eyes touched with wildness  hey you he called you with the velvet slippers me for you  the girl beside him put her arm around his neck and tried to hush him and through the mufflement of her embrace they could hear him gurgling  i tell you shes some goods watch me go across an win her from them cheap skates  butchertown hoodlums mary sniffed  saxons eyes encountered the eyes of the girl who glared hatred across at her and in billys eyes she saw moody anger smouldering the eyes were more sullen more handsome than ever and clouds and veils and lights and shadowe shifted and deepened in the blue of them until they gave her a sense of unfathomable depth he had stopped talking and he made no effort to talk  dont start a rough house bill bert cautioned theyre from across the hay an they dont know you thats all  bert stood up suddenly stepped over to the other table whispered briefly and came back every face at the table was turned on billy the offender arose brokenly shook off the detaining hand of his girl and came over he was a large man with a hard malignant face and bitter eyes also he was a subdued man  youre big bill roberts he said thickly clinging to the table as he reeled i take my hat off to you i apologize i admire your taste in skirts an take it from me thats a compliment but i didnt know who you was if id knowed you was bill roberts there wouldnt been a peep from my flytrap dye get me i apologize will you shake hands  gruffly billy said its all rightforget it sport and sullenly he shook hands and with a slow massive movement thrust the other back toward his own table  saxon was glowing here was a man a protector something to lean against of whom even the butchertown toughs were afraid as soon as his name was mentioned    chapter iv  after dinner there were two dances in the pavilion and then the band led the way to the race track for the games the dancers followed and all through the grounds the picnic parties left their tables to join in five thousand packed the grassy slopes of the amphitheater and swarmed inside the race track here first of the events the men were lining up for a tug of war the contest was between the oakland bricklayers and the san francisco bricklayers and the picked braves huge and heavy were taking their positions along the rope they kicked heelholds in the soft earth rubbed their hands with the soil from underfoot and laughed and joked with the crowd that surged about them  the judges and watchers struggled vainly to keep back this crowd of relatives and friends the celtic blood was up and the celtic faction spirit ran high the air was filled with cries of cheer advice warning and threat many elected to leave the side of their own team and go to the side of the other team with the intention of circumventing foul play there were as many women as men among the jostling supporters the dust from the trampling scuffling feet rose in the air and mary gasped and coughed and begged bert to take her away but he the imp in him elated with the prospect of trouble insisted on urging in closer saxon clung to billy who slowly and methodically elbowed and shouldered a way for her  no place for a girl he grumbled looking down at her with a masked expression of absentmindedness while his elbow powerfully crushed on the ribs of a big irishman who gave room thingsll break loose when they start pullin theys been too much drink an you know what the micks are for a rough house  saxon was very much out of place among these largebodied men and women she seemed very small and childlike delicate and fragile a creature from another race only billys skilled bulk and muscle saved her he was continually glancing from face to face of the women and always returning to study her face nor was she unaware of the contrast he was making  some excitement occurred a score of feet away from them and to the sound of exclamations and blows a surge ran through the crowd a large man wedged sidewise in the jam was shoved against saxon crushing her closely against billy who reached across to the mans shoulder with a massive thrust that was not so slow as usual an involuntary grunt came from the victim who turned his head showing sunreddened blond skin and unmistakable angry irish eyes  whats eatin yeh he snarled  get off your foot youre standin on it was billys contemptuous reply emphasized by an increase of thrust  the irishman grunted again and made a frantic struggle to twist his body around but the wedging bodies on either side held him in a vise  ill break yer ugly face for yeh in a minute he announced in wraththick tones  then his own face underwent transformation the snarl left the lips and the angry eyes grew genial  an sure an its yerself he said i didnt know it was yeh ashovin i seen yeh lick the terrible swede if yeh was robbed on the decision  no you didnt bo billy answered pleasantly you saw me take a good beatin that night the decision was all right  the irishman was now beaming he had endeavored to pay a compliment with a lie and the prompt repudiation of the lie served only to increase his heroworship  sure an a bad beatin it was he acknowledged but yeh showed the grit of a bunch of wildcats soon as i can get me arm free im goin to shake yeh by the hand an help yeh aise yer young lady  frustrated in the struggle to get the crowd back the referee fired his revolver in the air and the tugofwar was on pandemonium broke loose saxon protected by the two big men was near enough to the front to see much that ensued the men on the rope pulled and strained till their faces were red with effort and their joints crackled the rope was new and as their hands slipped their wives and daughters sprang in scooping up the earth in double handfuls and pouring it on the rope and the hands of their men to give them better grip  a stout middleaged woman carried beyond herself by the passion of the contest seized the rope and pulled beside her husband encouraged him with loud cries a watcher from the opposing team dragged her screaming away and was dropped like a steer by an earblow from a partisan from the womans team he in turn went down and brawny women joined with their men in the battle vainly the judges and watchers begged pleaded yelled and swung with their fists men as well as women were springing in to the rope and pulling no longer was it team against team but all oakland against all san francisco festooned with a freeforall fight hands overlaid hands two and three deep in the struggle to grasp the rope and hands that found no holds doubled into bunches of knuckles that impacted on the jaws of the watchers who strove to tear handholds from the rope  bert yelped with joy while mary clung to him mad with fear close to the rope the fighters were going down and being trampled the dust arose in clouds while from beyond all around unable to get into the battle could be heard the shrill and impotent ragescreams and rageyells of women and men  dirty work dirty work billy muttered over and over and though he saw much that occurred assisted by the friendly irishman he was coolly and safely working saxon back out of the melee  at last the break came the losing team accompanied by its host of volunteers was dragged in a rush over the ground and disappeared under the avalanche of battling forms of the onlookers  leaving saxon under the protection of the irishman in an outer eddy of calm billy plunged back into the mixup several minutes later he emerged with the missing couplebert bleeding from a blow on the ear but hilarious and mary rumpled and hysterical  this aint sport she kept repeating its a shame a dirty shame  we got to get outa this billy said the funs only commenced  aw wait bert begged its worth eight dollars its cheap at any price i aint seen so many black eyes and bloody noses in a month of sundays  well go on back an enjoy yourself billy commended ill take the girls up there on the side hill where we can look on but i wont give much for your good looks if some of them micks lands on you  the trouble was over in an amazingly short time for from the judges stand beside the track the announcer was bellowing the start of the boys footrace and bert disappointed joined billy and the two girls on the hillside looking down upon the track  there were boys races and girls races races of young women and old women of fat men and fat women sack races and threelegged races and the contestants strove around the small track through a bedlam of cheering supporters the tugofwar was already forgotten and good nature reigned again  five young men toed the mark crouching with fingertips to the ground and waiting the starters revolvershot three were in their stockingfeet and the remaining two wore spiked runningshoes  young mens race bert read from the program an only one prizetwentyfive dollars see the redhead with the spikesthe one next to the outside san franciscos set on him winning hes their crack an theres a lot of bets up  whos goin to win mary deferred to billys superior athletic knowledge  how can i tell he answered i never saw any of em before but they all look good to me may the best one win thats all  the revolver was fired and the five runners were off and away three were outdistanced at the start redhead led with a blackhaired young man at his shoulder and it was plain that the race lay between these two halfway around the blackhaired one took the lead in a spurt that was intended to last to the finish ten feet he gained nor could redhead cut it down an inch  the boys a streak billy commented he aint tryin his hardest an redheads just bustin himself  still ten feet in the lead the blackhaired one breasted the tape in a hubbub of cheers yet yells of disapproval could be distinguished bert hugged himself with joy  mmmm he gloated aint frisco sore watch out for fireworks now see hes bein challenged the judges aint payin him the money an hes got a gang behind him oh oh oh aint had so much fun since my old woman broke her leg  why dont they pay him billy saxon asked he won  the frisco bunch is challengin him for a professional billy elucidated thats what theyre all beefin about but it aint right they all ran for that money so theyre all professional  the crowd surged and argued and roared in front of the judges stand the stand was a rickety twostory affair the second story open at the front and here the judges could be seen debating as heatedly as the crowd beneath them  there she starts bert cried oh you roughhouse  the blackhaired racer backed by a dozen supporters was climbing the outside stairs to the judges  the purseholders his friend billy said see hes paid him an some of the judges is willin an some are beefin an now that other gangs going uptheyre redheads he turned to saxon with a reassuring smile were well out of it this time theres goin to be rough stuff down there in a minute  the judges are tryin to make him give the money back bert explained an if he dont the other gangll take it away from him see theyre reachin for it now  high above his head the winner held the roll of paper containing the twentyfive silver dollars his gang around him was shouldering back those who tried to seize the money no blows had been struck yet but the struggle increased until the frail structure shook and swayed from the crowd beneath the winner was variously addressed give it back you dog hang on to it tim you won fair timmy give it back you dirty robber abuse unprintable as well as friendly advice was hurled at him  the struggle grew more violent tims supporters strove to hold him off the floor so that his hand would still be above the grasping hands that shot up once for an instant his arm was jerked down again it went up but evidently the paper had broken and with a last desperate effort before he went down tim flung the coin out in a silvery shower upon the heads of the crowd beneath then ensued a weary period of arguing and quarreling  i wish theyd finish so as we could get back to the dancin mary complained this aint no fun  slowly and painfully the judges stand was cleared and an announcer stepping to the front of the stand spread his arms appealing for silence the angry clamor died down   the judges have decided he shouted that this day of good fellowship an brotherhood  hear hear many of the cooler heads applauded thats the stuff no fightin no hard feelins  an therefore the announcer became audible again the judges have decided to put up another purse of twentyfive dollars an run the race over again  an tim bellowed scores of throats what about tim hes been robbed the judges is rotten  again the announcer stilled the tumult with his arm appeal  the judges have decided for the sake of good feelin that timothy mcmanus will also run if he wins the moneys his  now wouldnt that jar you billy grumbled disgustedly if tims eligible now he was eligible the first time an if he was eligible the first time then the money was his  redheadll bust himself wide open this time bert jubilated  an so will tim billy rejoined you can bet hes mad clean through and hell let out the links he was holdin in last time  another quarter of an hour was spent in clearing the track of the excited crowd and this time only tim and redhead toed the mark the other three young men had abandoned the contest  the leap of tim at the report of the revolver put him a clean yard in the lead  i guess hes professional all right all right billy remarked an just look at him go  halfway around tim led by fifty feet and running swiftly maintaining the same lead he came down the homestretch an easy winner when directly beneath the group on the hillside the incredible and unthinkable happened standing close to the inside edge of the track was a dapper young man with a light switch cane he was distinctly out of place in such a gathering for upon him was no earmark of the working class afterward bert was of the opinion that he looked like a swell dancing master while billy called him the dude  so far as timothy mcmanus was concerned the dapper young man was destiny for as tim passed him the young man with utmost deliberation thrust his cane between tims flying legs tim sailed through the air in a headlong pitch struck spreadeagled on his face and plowed along in a cloud of dust  there was an instant of vast and gasping silence the young man too seemed petrified by the ghastliness of his deed it took an appreciable interval of time for him as well as for the onlookers to realize what he had done they recovered first and from a thousand throats the wild irish yell went up redhead won the race without a cheer the storm center had shifted to the young man with the cane after the yell he had one moment of indecision then he turned and darted up the track  go it sport bert cheered waving his hat in the air youre the goods for me whod athought it whod athought it saywouldnt it now just wouldnt it  phew hes a streak himself billy admired but what did he do it for hes no bricklayer  like a frightened rabbit the mad roar at his heels the young man tore up the track to an open space on the hillside up which he clawed and disappeared among the trees behind him toiled a hundred vengeful runners  its too bad hes missing the rest of it billy said look at em goin to it  bert was beside himself he leaped up and down and cried continuously  look at em look at em look at em  the oakland faction was outraged twice had its favorite runner been jobbed out of the race this last was only another vile trick of the frisco faction so oakland doubled its brawny fists and swung into san francisco for blood and san francisco consciously innocent was no less willing to join issues to be charged with such a crime was no less monstrous than the crime itself besides for too many tedious hours had the irish heroically suppressed themselves five thousands of them exploded into joyous battle the women joined with them the whole amphitheater was filled with the conflict there were rallies retreats charges and countercharges weaker groups were forced fighting up the hillsides other groups bested fled among the trees to carry on guerrilla warfare emerging in sudden dashes to overwhelm isolated enemies half a dozen special policemen hired by the weasel park management received an impartial trouncing from both sides  nobodys the friend of a policeman bert chortled dabbing his handkerchief to his injured ear which still bled  the bushes crackled behind him and he sprang aside to let the locked forms of two men go by rolling over and over down the hill each striking when uppermost and followed by a screaming woman who rained blows on the one who was patently not of her clan  the judges in the second story of the stand valiantly withstood a fierce assault until the frail structure toppled to the ground in splinters  whats that woman doing saxon asked calling attention to an elderly woman beneath them on the track who had sat down and was pulling from her foot an elasticsided shoe of generous dimensions  goin swimming bert chuckled as the stocking followed  they watched fascinated the shoe was pulled on again over the bare foot then the woman slipped a rock the size of her fist into the stocking and brandishing this ancient and horrible weapon lumbered into the nearest fray  ohohoh bert screamed with every blow she struck hey old flannelmouth watch out youll get yours in a second oh oh a peach did you see it hurray for the old lady look at her tearin into em watch out old girl ahhh  his voice died away regretfully as the one with the stocking whose hair had been clutched from behind by another amazon was whirled about in a dizzy semicircle  vainly mary clung to his arm shaking him back and forth and remonstrating  cant you be sensible she cried its awful i tell you its awful  but bert was irrepressible  go it old girl he encouraged you win me for you every time nows your chance swat oh my a peach a peach  its the biggest roughhouse i ever saw billy confided to saxon it sure takes the micks to mix it but what did that dude wanta do it for thats what gets me he wasnt a bricklayernot even a workingmanjust a regular sissy dude that didnt know a livin soul in the grounds but if he wanted to raise a roughhouse he certainly done it look at em theyre fightin everywhere  he broke into sudden laughter so hearty that the tears came into his eyes  what is it saxon asked anxious not to miss anything  its that dude billy explained between gusts what did he wanta do it for thats what gets my goat whatd he wanta do it for  there was more crashing in the brush and two women erupted upon the scene one in flight the other pursuing almost ere they could realize it the little group found itself merged in the astounding conflict that covered if not the face of creation at least all the visible landscape of weasel park  the fleeing woman stumbled in rounding the end of a picnic bench and would have been caught had she not seized marys arm to recover balance and then flung mary full into the arms of the woman who pursued this woman largely built middleaged and too irate to comprehend clutched marys hair by one hand and lifted the other to smack her before the blow could fall billy had seized both the womans wrists  come on old girl cut it out he said appeasingly youre in wrong she aint done nothin  then the woman did a strange thing making no resistance but maintaining her hold on the girls hair she stood still and calmly began to scream the scream was hideously compounded of fright and fear yet in her face was neither fright nor fear she regarded billy coolly and appraisingly as if to see how he took ither scream merely the cry to the clan for help  aw shut up you battleax bert vociferated trying to drag her off by the shoulders  the result was that the four rocked back and forth while the woman calmly went on screaming the scream became touched with triumph as more crashing was heard in the brush  saxon saw billys slow eyes glint suddenly to the hardness of steel and at the same time she saw him put pressure on his wristholds the woman released her grip on mary and was shoved back and free then the first man of the rescue was upon them he did not pause to inquire into the merits of the affair it was sufficient that he saw the woman reeling away from billy and screaming with pain that was largely feigned  its all a mistake billy cried hurriedly we apologize sport  the irishman swung ponderously billy ducked cutting his apology short and as the sledgelike fist passed over his head he drove his left to the others jaw the big irishman toppled over sidewise and sprawled on the edge of the slope halfscrambled back to his feet and out of balance he was caught by berts fist and this time went clawing down the slope that was slippery with short dry grass bert was redoubtable that for you old girlmy compliments was his cry as he shoved the woman over the edge on to the treacherous slope three more men were emerging from the brush  in the meantime billy had put saxon in behind the protection of the picnic table mary who was hysterical had evinced a desire to cling to him and he had sent her sliding across the top of the table to saxon  come on you flannelmouths bert yelled at the newcomers himself swept away by passion his black eyes flashing wildly his dark face inflamed by the tooready blood come on you cheap skates talk about gettysburg well show you all the americans aint dead yet  shut your trapwe dont want a scrap with the girls here billy growled harshly holding his position in front of the table he turned to the three rescuers who were bewildered by the lack of anything visible to rescue go on sports we dont want a row youre in wrong they aint nothin doin in the fight line we dont wanta fightdye get me  they still hesitated and billy might have succeeded in avoiding trouble had not the man who had gone down the bank chosen that unfortunate moment to reappear crawling groggily on hands and knees and showing a bleeding face again bert reached him and sent him downslope and the other three with wild yells sprang in on billy who punched shifted position ducked and punched and shifted again ere he struck the third time his blows were clean end hard scientifically delivered with the weight of his body behind  saxon looking on saw his eyes and learned more about him she was frightened but clearseeing and she was startled by the disappearance of all depth of light and shadow in his eyes they showed surface onlya hard bright surface almost glazed devoid of all expression save deadly seriousness berts eyes showed madness the eyes of the irishmen were angry and serious and yet not all serious there was a wayward gleam in them as if they enjoyed the fracas but in billys eyes was no enjoyment it was as if he had certain work to do and had doggedly settled down to do it  scarcely more expression did she note in the face though there was nothing in common between it and the one she had seen all day the boyishness had vanished this face was mature in a terrifying ageless way there was no anger in it nor was it even pitiless it seemed to have glazed as hard and passionlessly as his eyes something came to her of her wonderful mothers tales of the ancient saxons and he seemed to her one of those saxons and she caught a glimpse on the well of her consciousness of a long dark boat with a prow like the beak of a bird of prey and of huge halfnaked men winghelmeted and one of their faces it seemed to her was his face she did not reason this she felt it and visioned it as by an unthinkable clairvoyance and gasped for the flurry of war was over it had lasted only seconds bert was dancing on the edge of the slippery slope and mocking the vanquished who had slid impotently to the bottom but billy took charge  come on you girls he commanded get onto yourself bert we got to get onta this we cant fight an army  he led the retreat holding saxons arm and bert giggling and jubilant brought up the rear with an indignant mary who protested vainly in his unheeding ears  for a hundred yards they ran and twisted through the trees and then no signs of pursuit appearing they slowed down to a dignified saunter bert the troubleseeker pricked his ears to the muffled sound of blows and sobs and stepped aside to investigate  oh look what ive found he called  they joined him on the edge of a dry ditch and looked down in the bottom were two men strays from the fight grappled together and still fighting they were weeping out of sheer fatigue and helplessness and the blows they only occasionally struck were openhanded and ineffectual  hey you sportthrow sand in his eyes bert counseled thats it blind him an hes yourn  stop that billy shouted at the man who was following instructions or ill come down there an beat you up myself its all overdye get me its all over an everybodys friends shake an make up the drinks are on both of you thats righthere gimme your hand an ill pull you out  they left them shaking hands and brushing each others clothes  it soon will be over billy grinned to saxon i know em fights fun with them an this big scraps made the days howlin success what did i tell youlook over at that table there  a group of disheveled men and women still breathing heavily were shaking hands all around  come on lets dance mary pleaded urging them in the direction of the pavilion  all over the park the warring bricklayers were shaking hands and making up while the openair bars were crowded with the drinkers  saxon walked very close to billy she was proud of him he could fight and he could avoid trouble in all that had occurred he had striven to avoid trouble and also consideration for her and mary had been uppermost in his mind  you are brave she said to him  its like takin candy from a baby he disclaimed they only roughhouse they dont know boxin theyre wide open an all you gotta do is hit em it aint real fightin you know with a troubled boyish look in his eyes he stared at his bruised knuckles an ill have to drive team tomorrow with em he lamented which aint fun im tellin you when they stiffen up    chapter v  at eight oclock the al vista band played home sweet home and following the hurried rush through the twilight to the picnic train the four managed to get double seats facing each other when the aisles and platforms were packed by the hilarious crowd the train pulled out for the short run from the suburbs into oakland all the car was singing a score of songs at once and bert his head pillowed on marys breast with her arms around him started on the banks of the wabash and he sang the song through undeterred by the bedlam of two general fights one on the adjacent platform the other at the opposite end of the car both of which were finally subdued by special policemen to the screams of women and the crash of glass  billy sang a lugubrious song of many stanzas about a cowboy the refrain of which was bury me out on the lone prrairie  thats one you never heard before my father used to sing it he told saxon who was glad that it was ended  she had discovered the first flaw in him he was tonedeaf not once had he been on the key  i dont sing often he added  you bet your sweet life he dont bert exclaimed his friendsd kill him if he did  they all make fun of my singin he complained to saxon honest now do you find it as rotten as all that  its its maybe flat a bit she admitted reluctantly  it dont sound flat to me he protested its a regular josh on me ill bet bert put you up to it you sing something now saxon i bet you sing good i can tell it from lookin at you  she began when the harvest days are over bert and mary joined in but when billy attempted to add his voice he was dissuaded by a shinkick from bert saxon sang in a clear true soprano thin but sweet and she was aware that she was singing to billy  now that is singing what is he proclaimed when she had finished sing it again aw go on you do it just right its great  his hand slipped to hers and gathered it in and as she sang again she felt the tide of his strength flood warmingly through her  look at em holdin hands bert jeered just aholdin hands like they was afraid look at mary an me come on an kick in you coldfeets get together if you dont itll look suspicious i got my suspicions already youre framin somethin up  there was no mistaking his innuendo and saxon felt her cheeks flaming  get onto yourself bert billy reproved  shut up mary added the weight of her indignation youre awfully raw bert wanhope an i wont have anything more to do with youthere  she withdrew her arms and shoved him away only to receive him forgivingly half a dozen seconds afterward   come on the four of us bert went on irrepressibly the nights young lets make a time of itpabsts cafe first and then some what you say bill what you say saxon marys game  saxon waited and wondered half sick with apprehension of this man beside her whom she had known so short a time  nope he said slowly i gotta get up to a hard days work tomorrow and i guess the girls has got to too  saxon forgave him his tonedeafness here was the kind of man she always had known existed it was for some such man that she had waited she was twentytwo and her first marriage offer had come when she was sixteen the last had occurred only the month before from the foreman of the washingroom and he had been good and kind but not young but this one beside herhe was strong and kind and good and young she was too young herself not to desire youth there would have been rest from fancy starch with the foreman but there would have been no warmth but this man beside her she caught herself on the verge involuntarily of pressing his hand that held hers  no bert dont tease hes right mary was saying weve got to get some sleep its fancy starch tomorrow and all day on our feet  it came to saxon with a chill pang that she was surely older than billy she stole glances at the smoothness of his face and the essential boyishness of him so much desired shocked her of course he would marry some girl years younger than himself than herself how old was he could it be that he was too young for her as he seemed to grow inaccessible she was drawn toward him more compellingly he was so strong so gentle she lived over the events of the day there was no flaw there he had considered her and mary always and he had torn the program up and danced only with her surely he had liked her or he would not have done it  she slightly moved her hand in his and felt the harsh contact of his teamster callouses the sensation was exquisite he too moved his hand to accommodate the shift of hers and she waited fearfully she did not want him to prove like other men and she could have hated him had he dared to take advantage of that slight movement of her fingers and put his arm around her he did not and she flamed toward him there was fineness in him he was neither rattlebrained like bert nor coarse like other men she had encountered for she had had experiences not nice and she had been made to suffer by the lack of what was termed chivalry though she in turn lacked that word to describe what she divined and desired  and he was a prizefighter the thought of it almost made her gasp yet he answered not at all to her conception of a prizefighter but then he wasnt a prizefighter he had said he was not she resolved to ask him about it some time if if he took her out again yet there was little doubt of that for when a man danced with one girl a whole day he did not drop her immediately almost she hoped that he was a prizefighter there was a delicious tickle of wickedness about it prizefighters were such terrible and mysterious men in so far as they were out of the ordinary and were not mere common workingmen such as carpenters and laundrymen they represented romance power also they represented they did not work for bosses but spectacularly and magnificently with their own might grappled with the great world and wrung splendid living from its reluctant hands some of them even owned automobiles and traveled with a retinue of trainers and servants perhaps it had been only billys modesty that made him say he had quit fighting and yet there were the callouses on his hands that showed he had quit    chapter vi  they said goodbye at the gate billy betrayed awkwardness that was sweet to saxon he was not one of the takeitforgranted young men there was a pause while she feigned desire to go into the house yet waited in secret eagerness for the words she wanted him to say  when am i goin to see you again he asked holding her hand in his  she laughed consentingly  i live way up in east oakland he explained you know theres where the stable is an most of our teaming is done in that section so i dont knock around down this way much but say his hand tightened on hers we just gotta dance together some more ill tell you the orindore club has its dance wednesday if you havent a datehave you  no she said  then wednesday what timell i come for you  and when they had arranged the details and he had agreed that she should dance some of the dances with the other fellows and said good night again his hand closed more tightly on hers and drew her toward him she resisted slightly but honestly it was the custom but she felt she ought not for fear he might misunderstand and yet she wanted to kiss him as she had never wanted to kiss a man when it came her face upturned to his she realized that on his part it was an honest kiss there hinted nothing behind it rugged and kind as himself it was virginal almost and betrayed no long practice in the art of saying goodbye all men were not brutes after all was her thought  good night she murmured the gate screeched under her hand and she hurried along the narrow walk that led around to the corner of the house  wednesday he celled softly  wednesday she answered  but in the shadow of the narrow alley between the two houses she stood still and pleasured in the ring of his foot falls down the cement sidewalk not until they had quite died away did she go on she crept up the back stairs and across the kitchen to her room registering her thanksgiving that sarah was asleep  she lighted the gas and as she removed the little velvet hat she felt her lips still tingling with the kiss yet it had meant nothing it was the way of the young men they all did it but their goodnight kisses had never tingled while this one tingled in her brain as wall as on her lip what was it what did it mean with a sudden impulse she looked at herself in the glass the eyes were happy and bright the color that tinted her cheeks so easily was in them and glowing it was a pretty reflection and she smiled partly in joy partly in appreciation and the smile grew at sight of the even rows of strong white teeth why shouldnt billy like that face was her unvoiced query other men had liked it other men did like it even the other girls admitted she was a goodlooker charley long certainly liked it from the way he made life miserable for her  she glanced aside to the rim of the lookingglass where his photograph was wedged shuddered and made a moue of distaste there was cruelty in those eyes and brutishness he was a brute for a year now he had bullied her other fellows were afraid to go with her he warned them off she had been forced into almost slavery to his attentions she remembered the young bookkeeper at the laundrynot a workingman but a softhanded softvoiced gentlemanwhom charley had beaten up at the corner because he had been bold enough to come to take her to the theater and she had been helpless for his own sake she had never dared accept another invitation to go out with him  and now wednesday night she was going with billy billy her heart leaped there would be trouble but billy would save her from him shed like to see him try and beat billy up  with a quick movement she jerked the photograph from its niche and threw it face down upon the chest of drawers it fell beside a small square case of dark and tarnished leather with a feeling as of profanation she again seized the offending photograph and flung it across the room into a corner at the same time she picked up the leather case springing it open she gazed at the daguerreotype of a worn little woman with steady gray eyes and a hopeful pathetic mouth opposite on the velvet lining done in gold lettering was carlton from daisy she read it reverently for it represented the father she had never known and the mother she had so little known though she could never forget that those wise sad eyes were gray  despite lack of conventional religion saxons nature was deeply religious her thoughts of god were vague and nebulous and there she was frankly puzzled she could not vision god here in the daguerreotype was the concrete much she had grasped from it and always there seemed an infinite more to grasp she did not go to church this was her high altar and holy of holies she came to it in trouble in loneliness for counsel divination end comfort in so far as she found herself different from the girls of her acquaintance she quested here to try to identify her characteristics in the pictured face her mother had been different from other women too this forsooth meant to her what god meant to others to this she strove to be true and not to hurt nor vex and how little she really knew of her mother and of how much was conjecture and surmise she was unaware for it was through many years she had erected this mothermyth  yet was it all myth she resented the doubt with quick jealousy and opening the bottom drawer of the chest drew forth a battered portfolio out rolled manuscripts faded and worn and arose a faint far scent of sweetkept age the writing was delicate and curled with the quaint fineness of half a century before she read a stanza to herself  sweet as a windlutes airy strains your gentle muse has learned to sing and californias boundless plains prolong the soft notes echoing  she wondered for the thousandth time what a windlute was yet much of beauty much of beyondness she sensed of this dimly remembered beautiful mother of hers she communed a while then unrolled a second manuscript to c b it read to carlton brown she knew to her father a lovepoem from her mother saxon pondered the opening lines  i have stolen away from the crowd in the groves where the nude statues stand and the leaves point and shiver at ivycrowned bacchus the queen of the loves pandora and psyche struck voiceless forever  this too was beyond her but she breathed the beauty of it bacchus and pandora and psychetalismans to conjure with but alas the necromancy was her mothers strange meaningless words that meant so much her marvelous mother had known their meaning saxon spelled the three words aloud letter by letter for she did not dare their pronunciation and in her consciousness glimmered august connotations profound and unthinkable her mind stumbled and halted on the starbright and dazzling boundaries of a world beyond her world in which her mother had roamed at will again and again solemnly she went over the four lines they were radiance and light to the world haunted with phantoms of pain and unrest in which she had her being there hidden among those cryptic singing lines was the clue if she could only grasp it all would be made clear of this she was sublimely confident she would understand sarahs sharp tongue her unhappy brother the cruelty of charley long the justness of the bookkeepers beating the daylong monthlong yearlong toil at the ironingboard  she skipped a stanza that she knew was hopelessly beyond her and tried again       the dusk of the greenhouse is luminous yet      with quivers of opal and tremors of gold      for the sun is at rest and the light from the west      like delicate wine that is mellow and old  flushes faintly the brow of a naiad that stands in the spray of a fountain whose seedamethysts tremble lightly a moment on bosom and hands then dip in their basin from bosom and wrists  its beautiful just beautiful she sighed and then appalled at the length of all the poem at the volume of the mystery she rolled the manuscript and put it away again she dipped in the drawer seeking the clue among the cherished fragments of her mothers hidden soul  this time it was a small package wrapped in tissue paper and tied with ribbon she opened it carefully with the deep gravity and circumstance of a priest before an altar appeared a little redsatin spanish girdle whaleboned like a tiny corset pointed the pioneer finery of a frontier woman who had crossed the plains it was handmade after the californiaspanish model of forgotten days the very whalebone had been homeshaped of the raw material from the whaleships traded for in hides and tallow the black lace trimming her mother had made the triple edging of black velvet stripsher mothers hands had sewn the stitches  saxon dreamed over it in a maze of incoherent thought this was concrete this she understood this she worshiped as mancreated gods have been worshiped on less tangible evidence of their sojourn on earth  twentytwo inches it measured around she knew it out of many verifications she stood up and put it about her waist this was part of the ritual it almost met in places it did meet without her dress it would meet everywhere as it had met on her mother closest of all this survival of old californiaventura days brought saxon in touch hers was her mothers form physically she was like her mother her grit her ability to turn off work that was such an amazement to others were her mothers just so had her mother been an amazement to her generationher mother the toylike creature the smallest and the youngest of the strapping pioneer brood who nevertheless had mothered the brood always it had been her wisdom that was sought even by the brothers and sisters a dozen years her senior daisy it was who had put her tiny foot down and commanded the removal from the fever flatlands of colusa to the healthy mountains of ventura who had backed the savage old indianfighter of a father into a corner and fought the entire family that vila might marry the man of her choice who had flown in the face of the family and of community morality and demanded the divorce of laura from her criminally weak husband and who on the other hand had held the branches of the family together when only misunderstanding and weak humanness threatened to drive them apart  the peacemaker and the warrior all the old tales trooped before saxons eyes they were sharp with detail for she had visioned them many times though their content was of things she had never seen so far as details were concerned they were her own creation for she had never seen an ox a wild indian nor a prairie schooner yet palpitating and real shimmering in the sunflashed dust of ten thousand hoofs she saw pass from east to west across a continent the great hegira of the landhungry anglosaxon it was part and fiber of her she had been nursed on its traditions and its facts from the lips of those who had taken part clearly she saw the long wagontrain the lean gaunt men who walked before the youths goading the lowing oxen that fell and were goaded to their feet to fall again and through it all a flying shuttle weaving the golden dazzling thread of personality moved the form of her little indomitable mother eight years old and nine ere the great traverse was ended a necromancer and a lawgiver willing her way and the way and the willing always good and right  saxon saw punch the little roughcoated skyeterrier with the honest eyes who had plodded for weary months gone lame and abandoned she saw daisy the chit of a child hide punch in the wagon she saw the savage old worried father discover the added burden of the several pounds to the dying oxen she saw his wrath as he held punch by the scruff of the neck and she saw daisy between the muzzle of the longbarreled rifle and the little dog and she saw daisy thereafter through days of alkali and heat walking stumbling in the dust of the wagons the little sick dog like a baby in her arms  but most vivid of all saxon saw the fight at little meadowand daisy dressed as for a gala day in white a ribbon sash about her waist ribbons and a roundcomb in her hair in her hands small waterpails step forth into the sunshine on the flowergrown open ground from the wagon circle wheels interlocked where the wounded screamed their delirium and babbled of flowing fountains and go on through the sunshine and the wonderinhibition of the bulletdealing indians a hundred yards to the waterhole and back again  saxon kissed the little red satin spanish girdle passionately and wrapped it up in haste with dewy eyes abandoning the mystery and godhead of mother and all the strange enigma of living  in bed she projected against her closed eyelids the few rich scenes of her mother that her childmemory retained it was her favorite way of wooing sleep she had done it all her lifesunk into the deathblackness of sleep with her mother limned to the last on her fading consciousness but this mother was not the daisy of the plains nor of the daguerreotype they had been before saxons time this that she saw nightly was an older mother broken with insomnia and brave with sorrow who crept always crept a pale frail creature gentle and unfaltering dying from lack of sleep living by will and by will refraining from going mad who nevertheless could not will sleep and whom not even the whole tribe of doctors could make sleep creptalways she crept about the house from weary bed to weary chair and back again through long days and weeks of torment never complaining though her unfailing smile was twisted with pain and the wise gray eyes still wise and gray were grown unutterably larger and profoundly deep  but on this night saxon did not win to sleep quickly the little creeping mother came and went and in the intervals the face of billy with the clouddrifted sullen handsome eyes burned against her eyelids and once again as sleep welled up to smother her she put to herself the question is this the man    chapter vii  tun work in the ironingroom slipped off but the three days until wednesday night were very long she hummed over the fancy starch that flew under the iron at an astounding rate  i cant see how you do it mary admired youll make thirteen or fourteen this week at that rate  saxon laughed and in the steam from the iron she saw dancing golden letters that spelled wednesday  what do you think of billy mary asked  i like him was the frank answer  well dont let it go farther than that  i will if i want to saxon retorted gaily  better not came the warning youll only make trouble for yourself he aint marryin many a girls found that out they just throw themselves at his head too  im not going to throw myself at him or any other man  just thought id tell you mary concluded a word to the wise  saxon had become grave  hes not not she began than looked the significance of the question she could not complete  oh nothin like thatthough theres nothin to stop him hes straight all right all right but he just wont fall for anything in skirts he dances an runs around an has a good time an beyond thatnitsky a lot of ems got fooled on him i bet you theres a dozen girls in love with him right now an he just goes on turnin em down there was lily sandersonyou know her you seen her at that slavonic picnic last summer at shellmoundthat tall nicelookin blonde that was with butch willows  yes i remember her saxon sald what about her  well shed been runnin with butch willows pretty steady an just because she could dance billy dances a lot with her butch aint afraid of nothin he wades right in for a showdown an nails billy outside before everybody an reads the riot act an billy listens in that slow sleepy way of his an butch gets hotter an hotter an everybody expects a scrap  an then billy says to butch are you done yes butch says ive said my say an what are you goin to do about it an billy saysan what dye think he said with everybody lookin on an butch with blood in his eye well he said i guess nothin butch just like that butch was that surprised you could knocked him over with a feather an never dance with her no more he says not if you say i cant butch billy says just like that  well you know any other man to take water the way he did from butchwhy everybodyd despise him but not billy you see he can afford to hes got a rep as a fighter an when he just stood back an let butch have his way everybody knew he wasnt scared or backin down or anything he didnt care a rap for lily sanderson that was all an anybody could see she was just crazy after him  the telling of this episode caused saxon no little worry hers was the average womans pride but in the matter of manconquering prowess she was not unduly conceited billy had enjoyed her dancing and she wondered if that were all if charley long bullied up to him would he let her go as he had let lily sanderson go he was not a marrying man nor could saxon blind her eyes to the fact that he was eminently marriageable no wonder the girls ran after him and he was a mansubduer as well as a womansubduer men liked him bert wanhope seemed actually to love him she remembered the butchertown tough in the diningroom at weasel park who had come over to the table to apologize and the irishman at the tugofwar who had abandoned all thought of fighting with him the moment he learned his identity  a very much spoiled young man was a thought that flitted frequently through saxons mind and each time she condemned it as ungenerous he was gentle in that tantalizing slow way of his despite his strength he did not walk roughshod over others there was the affair with lily sanderson saxon analysed it again and again he had not cared for the girl and he had immediately stepped from between her and butch it was just the thing that bert out of sheer wickedness and love of trouble would not have done there would have been a fight hard feelings butch turned into an enemy and nothing profited to lily but billy had done the right thingdone it slowly and imperturbably and with the least hurt to everybody all of which made him more desirable to saxon and less possible  she bought another pair of silk stockings that she had hesitated at for weeks and on tuesday night sewed and drowsed wearily over a new shirtwaist and earned complaint from sarah concerning her extravagant use of gas  wednesday night at the orindore dance was not all undiluted pleasure it was shameless the way the girls made up to billy and at times saxon found his easy consideration for them almost irritating yet she was compelled to acknowledge to herself that he hurt none of the other fellows feelings in the way the girls hurt hers they all but asked him outright to dance with them and little of their open pursuit of him escaped her eyes she resolved that she would not be guilty of throwing herself at him and withheld dance after dance and yet was secretly and thrillingly aware that she was pursuing the right tactics she deliberately demonstrated that she was desirable to other men as he involuntarily demonstrated his own desirableness to the women  her happiness came when he coolly overrode her objections and insisted on two dances more than she had allotted him and she was pleased as well as angered when she chanced to overhear two of the strapping young cannery girls the way that little sawedoff is monopolizin him said one and the other youd think she might have the good taste to run after somebody of her own age cradlesnatcher was the final sting that sent the angry blood into saxons cheeks as the two girls moved away unaware that they had been overheard  billy saw her home kissed her at the gate and got her consent to go with him to the dance at germania hall on friday night  i wasnt thinkin of goin he sald but if youll say the word berts goin to be there  next day at the ironing boards mary told her that she and bert were dated for germania hall  are you goin mary asked  saxon nodded  billy roberts  the nod was repeated and mary with suspended iron gave her a long and curions look  say an what if charley long butts in  saxon shrugged her shoulders  they ironed swiftly and silently for a quarter of an hour  well mary decided if he does butt in maybe hell get his id like to see him get itthe big stiff it all depends how billy feelsabout you i mean  im no lily sanderson saxon answered indignantly ill never give billy roberts a chance to turn me down  you will if charley long butts in take it from me saxon he aint no gentleman look what he done to mr moody that was a awful beatin an mr moody only a quiet little man that wouldnt harm a fly well he wont find billy roberts a sissy by a long shot  that night outside the laundry entrance saxon found charley long waiting as he stepped forward to greet her and walk alongside she felt the sickening palpitation that he had so thoroughly taught her to know the blood ebbed from her face with the apprehension and fear his appearance caused she was afraid of the rough bulk of the man of the heavy brown eyes dominant and confident of the big blacksmithhands and the thick strong fingers with the hairpads on the back to every first joint he was unlovely to the eye and he was unlovely to all her finer sensibilities it was not his strength itself but the quality of it and the misuse of it that affronted her the beating he had given the gentle mr moody had meant halfhours of horror to her afterward always did the memory of it come to her accompanied by a shudder and yet without shock she had seen billy fight at weasel park in the same primitive mananimal way but it had been different she recognized but could not analyze the difference she was aware only of the brutishness of this mans hands and mind  youre lookin white an all beat to a frazzle he was saying why dont you cut the work you got to some time anyway you cant lose me kid  i wish i could she replied  he laughed with harsh joviality nothin to it saxon youre just cut out to be mrs long an youre sure goin to be  i wish i was as certain about all things as you are she said with mild sarcasm that missed  take it from me he went on theres just one thing you can be certain ofan that is that i am certain he was pleased with the cleverness of his idea and laughed approvingly when i go after anything i get it an if anything gets in between it gets hurt dye get that its me for you an thats all there is to it so you might as well make up your mind and go to workin in my home instead of the laundry why its a snap there wouldnt be much to do i make good money an you wouldnt want for anything you know i just washed up from work an skinned over here to tell it to you once more so you wouldnt forget i aint ate yet an that shows how much i think of you  youd better go and eat then she advised though she knew the futility of attempting to get rid of him  she scarcely heard what he said it had come upon her suddenly that she was very tired and very small and very weak alongside this colossus of a man would he dog her always she asked despairingly and seemed to glimpse a vision of all her future life stretched out before her with always the form and face of the burly blacksmith pursuing her  come on kid an kick in he continued its the good old summer time an thats the time to get married  but im not going to marry you she protested ive told you a thousand times already  aw forget it you want to get them ideas out of your thinkbox of course youre goin to marry me its a pipe an ill tell you another pipe you an mes goin acrost to frisco friday night theres goin to be big doins with the horseshoers  only im not she contradicted  oh yes you are he asserted with absolute assurance well catch the last boat back an youll have one fine time an ill put you next to some of the good dancers oh i aint a pincher an i know you like dancin  but i tell you i cant she reiterated  he shot a glance of suspicion at her from under the black thatch of brows that met above his nose and were as one brow  why cant you  a date she said  whos the bloke  none of your business charley long ive got a date thats all  ill make it my business remember that lahdedah bookkeeper rummy well just keep on rememberin him an what he got  i wish youd leave me alone she pleaded resentfully cant you be kind just for once  the blacksmith laughed unpleasantly  if any rummy thinks he can butt in on you an me hell learn different an im the little boy thatll learn mfriday night eh where  i wont tell you  where he repeated  her lips were drawn in tight silence and in her cheeks were little angry spots of blood  huhas if i couldnt guess germania hall well ill be there an ill take you home afterward dye get that an youd better tell the rummy to beat it unless you want to seem get his face hurt  saxon hurt as a prideful woman can be hurt by cavalier treatment was tempted to cry out the name and prowess of her newfound protector and then came fear this was a big man and billy was only a boy that was the way he affected her she remembered her first impression of his hands and glanced quickly at the hands of the man beside her they seemed twice as large as billys and the mats of hair seemed to advertise a terrible strength no billy could not fight this big brute he must not and then to saxon came a wicked little hope that by the mysterious and unthinkable ability that prizefighters possessed billy might be able to whip this bully and rid her of him with the next glance doubt came again for her eye dwelt on the blacksmiths broad shoulders the cloth of the coat musclewrinkled and the sleeves bulging above the biceps  if you lay a hand on anybody im going with again she began  why theyll get hurt of course long grinned and theyll deserve it too any rummy that comes between a fellow an his girl ought to get hurt  but im not your girl and all your saying so doesnt make it so  thats right get mad he approved i like you for that too youve got spunk an fight i like to see it its what a man needs in his wifeand not these fat cows of women theyre the dead ones now youre a live one all wool a yard long and a yard wide  she stopped before the house and put her hand on the gate  goodbye she said im going in  come on out afterward for a run to idora park he suggested  no im not feeling good and im going straight to bed as soon as i eat supper  huh he sneered gettin in shape for the fling tomorrow night eh  with an impatient movement she opened the gate and stepped inside  ive given it to you straight he went on if you dont go with me tomorrow night somebodyll get hurt  i hope it will be you she cried vindictively  he laughed as he threw his head back stretched his big chest and halflifted his heavy arms the action reminded her disgustingly of a great ape she had once seen in a circus  well goodbye he said see you tomorrow night at germania hall  i havent told you it was germania hall  and you havent told me it wasnt all the same ill be there and ill take you home too be sure an keep plenty of round dances open fer me thats right get mad it makes you look fine    chapter viii  the music stopped at the end of the waltz leaving billy and saxon at the big entrance doorway of the ballroom her hand rested lightly on his arm and they were promenading on to find seats when charley long evidently just arrived thrust his way in front of them  so youre the buttinsky eh he demanded his face malignant with passion and menace  whome billy queried gently some mistake sport i never butt in  youre goin to get your head beaten off if you dont make yourself scarce pretty lively  i wouldnt want that to happen for the world billy drawled come on saxon this neighborhoods unhealthy for us  he started to go on with her but long thrust in front again  youre too fresh to keep young fellow he snarled you need saltin down dye get me  billy scratched his head on his face exaggerated puzzlement  no i dont get you he said now just what was it you said  but the big blacksmith turned contemptuously away from him to saxon  come here you lets see your program  do you want to dance with him billy asked  she shook her head  sorry sport nothin doin billy said again making to start on  for the third time the blacksmith blocked the way  get off your foot said billy youre standin on it  long all but sprang upon him his hands clenched one arm just starting back for the punch while at the same instant shoulders and chest were coming forward but he restrained himself at sight of billys unstartled body and cold and cloudy ayes he had made no move of mind or muscle it was as if he were unaware of the threatened attack all of which constituted a new thing in longs experience  maybe you dont know who i am he bullied  yep i do billy answered airily youre a recordbreaker at roughhousin here longs face showed pleasure you ought to have the police gazette diamond belt for roughbousin baby buggies i guess there aint a one youre afraid to tackle  leave m alone charley advised one of the young men who had crowded about them hes bill roberts the fighter you knowm big bill  i dont care if hes jim jeffries he cant butt in on me this way  nevertheless it was noticeable even to saxon that the fire had gone out of his fierceness billys name seemed to have a quieting effect on obstreperous males  do you know him billy asked her  she signified yes with her eyes though it seemed she must cry out a thousand things against this man who so steadfastly persecuted her billy turned to the blacksmith  look here sport you dont want trouble with me ive got your number besides what do we want to fight for hasnt she got a say so in the matter  no she hasnt this is my affair an yourn  billy shook his head slowly no youre in wrong i think she has a say in the matter  well say it then long snarled at saxon whore you goin to go withme or him lets get it settled  for reply saxon reached her free hand over to the hand that rested on billys arm  nuff said was billys remark  long glared at saxon then transferred the glare to her protector  ive a good mind to mix it with you anyway long gritted through his teeth  saxon was elated as they started to move away lily sandersons fate had not been hers and her wonderful manboy without the threat of a blow slow of speech and imperturbable had conquered the big blacksmith  hes forced himself upon me all the time she whispered to billy hes tried to run me and beaten up every man that came near me i never want to see him again  billy halted immediately long who was reluctantly moving to get out of the way also halted  she says she dont want anything more to do with you billy said to him an what she says goes if i get a whisper any time that youve been botherin her ill attend to your case dye get that  long glowered and remained silent  dye get that billy repeated more imperatively  a growl of assent came from the blacksmith  all right then see you remember it an now get outa the way or ill walk over you  long slunk back muttering inarticulate threats and saxon moved on as in a dream charley long had taken water he had been afraid of this smoothskinned blueeyed boy she was quit of himsomething no other man had dared attempt for her and billy had liked her better than lily sanderson  twice saxon tried to tell billy the details of her acquaintance with long but each time was put off  i dont care a rap about it billy said the second time youre here aint you  but she insisted and when worked up and angry by the recital she had finished he patted her hand soothingly  its all right saxon he said hes just a big stiff i took his measure as soon as i looked at him he wont bother you again i know his kind hes a dog roughhouse he couldnt roughhouse a milk wagon  but how do you do it she asked breathlessly why are men so afraid of you youre just wonderful  he smiled in an embarrassed way and changed the subject  say he said i like your teeth theyre so white an regular an not big an not dinky little babys teeth either theyre  theyre just right an they fit you i never seen such fine teeth on a girl yet dye know honest they kind of make me hungry when i look at em theyre good enough to eat  at midnight leaving the insatiable bert and mary still dancing billy and saxon started for home it was on his suggestion that they left early and he felt called upon to explain  its one thing the fightin games taught me he said to take care of myself a fellow cant work all day and dance all night and keep in condition its the same way with drinkinan not that im a little tin angel i know what it is ive been soused to the guards an all the rest of it i like my beerbig schooners of it but i dont drink all i want of it ive tried but it dont pay take that big stiff tonight that butted in on us he ought to had my number hes a dog anyway but besides he had beer bloat i sized that up the first rattle an thats the difference about who takes the other fellows number condition thats what it is  but he is so big saxon protested why his fists are twice as big as yours  that dont mean anything what counts is whats behind the fists hed turn loose like a buckin bronco if i couldnt drop him at the start all id do is to keep away smother up an wait an all of a sudden hed blow upgo all to pieces you know wind heart everything and then id have him where i wanted him and the point is he knows it too  youre the first prizefighter i ever knew saxon said after a pause  im not any more he disclaimed hastily thats one thing the fightin game taught meto leave it alone it dont pay a fellow trains as fine as silktill hes all silk his skin everything and hes fit to live for a hundred years an then he climbs through the ropes for a hard twenty rounds with some tough customer thats just as good as he is and in those twenty rounds he frazzles out all his silk an blows in a year of his life yes sometimes he blows in five years of it or cuts it in half or uses up all of it ive watched em ive seen fellows strong as bulls fight a hard battle and die inside the year of consumption or kidney disease or anything else now whats the good of it money cant buy what they throw away thats why i quit the game and went back to drivin team i got my silk an im goin to keep it thats all  it must make you feel proud to know you are the master of other men she said softly aware herself of pride in the strength and skill of him  it does he admitted frankly im glad i went into the gamejust as glad as i am that i pulled out of it yep its taught me a lotto keep my eyes open an my head cool oh ive got a temper a peach of a temper i get scared of myself sometimes i used to be always breakin loose but the fightin taught me to keep down the steam an not do things id be sorry for afterward  why youre the sweetest easiest tempered man i know she interjected  dont you believe it just watch me and sometime youll see me break out that bad that i wont know what im doin myself oh im a holy terror when i get started  this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joythrill  say he said as they neared her neighborhood what are you doin next sunday  nothing no plans at all  well suppose you an me go buggyriding all day out in the hills  she did not answer immediately and for the moment she was seeing the nightmare vision of her last buggyride of her fear and her leap from the buggy and of the long miles and the stumbling through the darkness in thinsoled shoes that bruised her feet on every rock and then it came to her with a great swell of joy that this man beside her was not such a man  i love horses she said i almost love them better than i do dancing only i dont know anything about them my father rode a great roan warhorse he was a captain of cavalry you know i never saw him but somehow i always can see him on that big horse with a sash around his waist and his sword at his side my brother george has the sword now but tomhes the brother i live with says it is mine because it wasnt his fathers you see theyre only my halfbrothers i was the only child by my mothers second marriage that was her real marriageher lovemarriage i mean  saxon ceased abruptly embarrassed by her own garrulity and yet the impulse was strong to tell this young man all about herself and it seemed to her that these far memories were a large part of her  go on an tell me about it billy urged i like to hear about the old people of the old days my people was along in there too an somehow i think it was a better world to live in than now things was more sensible and natural i dont exactly say what i mean but its like this i dont understand life today theres the labor unions an employers associations an strikes an hard times an huntin for jobs an all the rest things wasnt like that in the old days everybody farmed an shot their meat an got enough to eat an took care of their old folks but now its all a mixup that i cant understand mebbe im a fool i dont know but anyway go ahead an tell us about your mother  well you see when she was only a young woman she and captain brown fell in love he was a soldier then before the war and he was ordered east for the war when she was away nursing her sister laura and then came the news that he was killed at shiloh and she married a man who had loved her for years and years he was a boy in the same wagontrain coming across the plains she liked him but she didnt love him and afterward came the news that my father wasnt killed after all so it made her very sad but it did not spoil her life she was a good mother end a good wife and all that but she was always sad and sweet and gentle and i think her voice was the most beautiful in the world  she was game all right billy approved  and my father never married he loved her all the time ive got a lovely poem home that she wrote to him its just wonderful and it sings like music well long long afterward her husband died and then she and my father made their love marriage they didnt get married until 1882 and she was pretty well along  more she told him as they stood by the gate and saxon tried to think that the goodbye kiss was a trifle longer than just ordinary  how about nine oclock he queried across the gate dont bother about lunch or anything ill fix all that up you just be ready at nine    chapter ix  sunday morning saxon was beforehand in getting ready and on her return to the kitchen from her second journey to peep through the front windows sarah began her customary attack  its a shame an a disgrace the way some people can afford silk stockings she began look at me atoilin and astewin day an night and i never get silk stockingsnor shoes three pairs of them all at one time but theres a just god in heaven and therell be some mighty big surprises for some when the end comes and folks get passed out whats comin to them  tom smoking his pipe and cuddling his youngestborn on his knees dropped an eyelid surreptitiously on his cheek in token that sarah was in a tantrum saxon devoted herself to tying a ribbon in the hair of one of the little girls sarah lumbered heavily about the kitchen washing and putting away the breakfast dishes she straightened her back from the sink with a groan and glared at saxon with fresh hostility  you aint sayin anything eh an why dont you because i guess you still got some natural shame in you arunnin with a prizefighter oh ive heard about your goingson with bill roberts a nice specimen he is but just you wait till charley long gets his hands on him thats all  oh i dont know tom intervened bill roberts is a pretty good boy from what i hear  saxon smiled with superior knowledge and sarah catching her was infuriated  why dont you marry charley long hes crazy for you and he aint a drinkin man  i guess he gets outside his share of beer saxon retorted  thats right her brother supplemented an i know for a fact that he keeps a keg in the house all the time as well  maybe youve been guzzling from it sarah snapped  maybe i have tom said wiping his mouth reminiscently with the back of his hand  well he can afford to keep a keg in the house if he wants to she returned to the attack which now was directed at her husband as well he pays his bills and he certainly makes good moneybetter than most men anyway  an he hasnt a wife an children to watch out for tom said  nor everlastin dues to unions that dont do him no good  oh yes he has tom urged genially blamed little hed work in that shop or any other shop in oakland if he didnt keep in good standing with the blacksmiths you dont understand labor conditions sarah the unions have got to stick if the men arent to starve to death  oh of course not sarah sniffed i dont understand anything i aint got a mind im a fool an you tell me so right before the children she turned savagely on her eldest who startled and shrank away willie your mother is a fool do you get that your father says shes a foolsays it right before her face and yourn shes just a plain fool next hell be sayin shes crazy an puttin her away in the asylum an how will you like that willie how will you like to see your mother in a straitjacket an a padded cell shut out from the light of the sun an beaten like a nigger before the war willie beaten an clubbed like a regular black nigger thats the kind of a father youve got willie think of it willie in a padded cell the mother that bore you with the lunatics screechin an screamin all around an the quicklime eatin into the dead bodies of them thats beaten to death by the cruel wardens  she continued tirelessly painting with pessimistic strokes the growing black future her husband was meditating for her while the boy fearful of some vague incomprehensible catastrophe began to weep silently with a pendulous trembling underlip saxon for the moment lost control of herself  oh for heavens sake cant we be together five minutes without quarreling she blazed  sarah broke off from asylum conjurations and turned upon her sisterinlaw  whos quarreling cant i open my head without bein jumped on by the two of you  saxon shrugged her shoulders despairingly and sarah swung about on her husband  seein you love your sister so much better than your wife why did you want to marry me thats borne your children for you an slaved for you an toiled for you an worked her fingernails off for you with no thanks an insultin me before the children an sayin im crazy to their faces an what have you ever did for me thats what i want to knowme thats cooked for you an washed your stinkin clothes and fixed your socks an sat up nights with your brats when they was ailin look at that  she thrust out a shapeless swollen foot encased in a monstrous untended shoe the dry raw leather of which showed white on the edges of bulging cracks  look at that thats what i say look at that her voice was persistently rising and at the same time growing throaty the only shoes i got me your wife aint you ashamed where are my three pairs look at that stockin  speech failed her and she sat down suddenly on a chair at the table glaring unutterable malevolence and misery she arose with the abrupt stiffness of an automaton poured herself a cup of cold coffee and in the same jerky way sat down again as if too hot for her lips she filled her saucer with the greasylooking nondescript fluid and continued her set glare her breast rising and falling with staccato mechanical movement  now sarah be cam be cam tom pleaded anxiously  in response slowly with utmost deliberation as if the destiny of empires rested on the certitude of her act she turned the saucer of coffee upside down on the table she lifted her right hand slowly hugely and in the same slow huge way landed the open palm with a sounding slap on toms astounded cheek immediately thereafter she raised her voice in the shrill hoarse monotonous madness of hysteria sat down on the floor and rocked back and forth in the throes of an abysmal grief  willies silent weeping turned to noise and the two little girls with the fresh ribbons in their hair joined him toms face was drawn and white though the smitten cheek still blazed and saxon wanted to put her arms comfortingly around him yet dared not he bent over his wife  sarah you aint feelin well let me put you to bed and ill finish tidying up  dont touch medont touch me she screamed jerking violently away from him  take the children out in the yard tom for a walk anythingget them away saxon said she was sick and white and trembling go tom please please theres your hat ill take care of her i know just how  left to herself saxon worked with frantic haste assuming the calm she did not possess but which she must impart to the screaming bedlamite upon the floor the light frame house leaked the noise hideously and saxon knew that the houses on either side were hearing and the street itself and the houses across the street her fear was that billy should arrive in the midst of it further she was incensed violated every fiber rebelled almost in a nausea yet she maintained cool control and stroked sarahs forehead and hair with slow soothing movements soon with one arm around her she managed to win the first diminution in the strident atrocious unceasing scream a few minutes later sobbing heavily the elder woman lay in bed across her forehead and eyes a wetpack of towel for easement of the headache she and saxon tacitly accepted as substitute for the brainstorm  when a clatter of hoofs came down the street and stopped saxon was able to slip to the front door and wave her hand to billy in the kitchen she found tom waiting in sad anxiousness  its all right she said billy roberts has come and ive got to go you go in and sit beside her for a while and maybe shell go to sleep but dont rush her let her have her own way if shell let you take her hand why do it try it anyway but first of all as an opener and just as a matter of course start wetting the towel over her eyes  he was a kindly easygoing man but after the way of a large percentage of the western stock he was undemonstrative he nodded turned toward the door to obey and paused irresolutely the look he gave back to saxon was almost doglike in gratitude and allbrotherly in love she felt it and in spirit leapt toward it  its all righteverythings all right she cried hastily  tom shook his head  no it aint its a shame a blamed shame thats what it is he shrugged his shoulders oh i dont care for myself but its for you you got your life before you yet little kid sister youll get old and all that means fast enough but its a bad start for a day off the thing for you to do is to forget all this and skin out with your fellow an have a good time in the open door his hand on the knob to close it after him he halted a second time a spasm contracted his brow hell think of it sarah and i used to go buggyriding once on a time and i guess she had her three pairs of shoes too can you beat it  in her bedroom saxon completed her dressing for an instant stepping upon a chair so as to glimpse critically in the small wallmirror the hang of her readymade linen skirt this and the jacket she had altered to fit and she had doublestitched the seams to achieve the coveted tailored effect still on the chair all in the moment of quick clearseeing she drew the skirt tightly back and raised it the sight was good to her nor did she underappraise the lines of the slender ankle above the low tan tie nor did she underappraise the delicate yet mature swell of calf outlined in the fresh brown of a new cotton stocking down from the chair she pinned on a firm sailor hat of white straw with a brown ribbon around the crown that matched her ribbon belt she rubbed her cheeks quickly and fiercely to bring back the color sarah had driven out of them and delayed a moment longer to put on her tan lislethread gloves once in the fashionpage of a sunday supplement she had read that no lady ever put on her gloves after she left the door  with a resolute selfgrip as she crossed the parlor and passed the door to sarahs bedroom through the thin wood of which came elephantine moanings and low slubberings she steeled herself to keep the color in her cheeks and the brightness in her eyes and so well did she succeed that billy never dreamed that the radiant live young thing tripping lightly down the steps to him had just come from a bout with soulsickening hysteria and madness  to her in the bright sun billys blondness was startling his cheeks smooth as a girls were touched with color the blue eyes seemed more cloudily blue than usual and the crisp sandy hair hinted more than ever of the pale strawgold that was not there never had she seen him quite so royally young as he smiled to greet her with a slow white flash of teeth from between red lips she caught again the promise of easement and rest fresh from the shattering chaos of her sisterinlaws mind billys tremendous calm was especially satisfying and saxon mentally laughed to scorn the terrible temper he had charged to himself  she had been buggyriding before but always behind one horse jaded and livery in a topbuggy heavy and dingy such as livery stables rent because of sturdy unbreakableness but here stood two horses headtossing and restless shouting in every highlight glint of their satin goldensorrel coats that they had never been rented out in all their glorious young lives between them was a pole inconceivably slender on them were harnesses preposterously stringlike and fragile and billy belonged here by elemental right a part of them and of it a masterpart and a component along with the spiderydelicate narrowboxed wide and yellowwheeled rubbertired rig efficient and capable as different as he was different from the other man who had taken her out behind stolid lumbering horses he held the reins in one hand yet with low steady voice confident and assuring held the nervous young animals more by the will and the spirit of him  it was no time for lingering with the quick glance and foreknowledge of a woman saxon saw not merely the curious children clustering about but the peering of adult faces from open doors and windows and past windowshades lifted up or held aside with his free hand billy drew back the linen robe and helped her to a place beside him the highbacked luxuriously upholstered seat of brown leather gave her a sense of great comfort yet even greater it seemed to her was the nearness and comfort of the man himself and of his body  how dye like em he asked changing the reins to both hands and chirruping the horses which went out with a jerk in an immediacy of action that was new to her theyre the bosss you know couldnt rent animals like them he lets me take them out for exercise sometimes if they aint exercised regular theyre a handfullook at king there prancin some style eh some style the other ones the real goods though prince is his name got to have some bit on him to holdmah would youdid you seem saxon some horse some horse  from behind came the admiring cheer of the neighborhood children and saxon with a sigh of content knew that the happy day had at last begun    chapter x  i dont know horses saxon said ive never been on ones back and the only ones ive tried to drive were single and lame or almost falling down or something but im not afraid of horses i just love them i was born loving them i guess  billy threw an admiring appreciative glance at her  thats the stuff thats what i like in a womangrit some of the girls ive had outwell take it from me they made me sick oh im hep to em nervous an trembly an screechy an wabbly i reckon they come out on my account an not for the ponies but me for the brave kid that likes the ponies youre the real goods saxon honest to god you are why i can talk like a streak with you the rest of em make me sick im like a clam they dont know nothin an theyre that scared all the timewell i guess you get me  you have to be born to love horses maybe she answered maybe its because i always think of my father on his roan warhorse that makes me love horses but anyway i do when i was a little girl i was drawing horses all the time my mother always encouraged me ive a scrapbook mostly filled with horses i drew when i was little do you know billy sometimes i dream i actually own a horse all my own and lots of times i dream im on a horses back or driving him  ill let you drive em after a while when theyve worked their edge off theyre pullin nowthere put your hands in front of minetake hold tight feel that sure you feel it an you aint feelin it all by a long shot i dont dast slack you bein such a lightweight  her eyes sparkled as she felt the apportioned pull of the mouths of the beautiful live things and he looking at her sparkled with her in her delight  whats the good of a woman if she cant keep up with a man he broke out enthusiastically  people that like the same things always get along best together she answered with a triteness that concealed the joy that was hers at being so spontaneously in touch with him  why saxon ive fought battles good ones frazzlin my silk away to beat the band before whiskysoaked smokin audiences of rotten fightfans that just made me sick clean through an them that couldnt take just one stiff jolt or hook to jaw or stomach

close that prince baring his teeth like a stallion plunged his head down against reins and check in an effort to seize the dog  now hes some fighter that prince an hes natural he didnt make that reach just for some lowlifer to yellm on he just done it outa pure cussedness and himself thats clean thats right because its natural but them fightfans honest to god saxon  and saxon glimpsing him sidewise as he watched the horses and their way on the sunday morning streets checking them back suddenly and swerving to avoid two boys coasting across street on a toy wagon saw in him deeps and intensities all the magic connotations of temperament the glimmer and hint of rages profound bleaknesses as cold and far as the stars savagery as keen as a wolfs and clean as a stallions wrath as implacable as a destroying angels and youth that was fire and life beyond time and place she was awed and fascinated with the hunger of woman bridging the vastness to him daring to love him with arms and breast that ached to him murmuring to herself and through all the halls of her soul you dear you dear  honest to god saxon he took up the broken thread theys times when ive hated them when i wanted to jump over the ropes and wade into them knockdown and dragout an showm what fightin was take that night with billy murphy billy murphyif you only knew him my friend as clean an game a boy as ever jumped inside

an help bringm around well they aint no kick comin they pay their money an they get their blood an a knockout an a better man than them that i love layin there dead to the world with a skinned face on the mat  for a moment he was still gazing straight before him at the horses his face hard and angry he sighed looked at saxon and smiled  an i quit the game right there an billy murphys laughed at me for it he still follows it a sideline you know because he works at a good trade but once in a while when the house needs paintin or the doctor bills are up or his oldest kid wants a bicycle he jumps out an makes fifty or a hundred bucks before some of the clubs i want you to meet him when it comes handy hes some boy im tellin you but it did make me sick that night  again the harshness and anger were in his face and saxon amazed herself by doing unconsciously what women higher in the social scale have done with deliberate sincerity her hand went out impulsively to his holding the lines resting on top of it for a moment with quick firm pressure her reward was a smile from lips and eyes as his face turned toward her  gee he exclaimed i never talk a streak like this to anybody i just hold my hush an keep my thinks to myself but somehow i guess its funny i kind of have a feelin i want to make good with you an thats why im tellin you my thinks anybody can dance  the way led uptown past the city hall and the fourteenth street skyscrapers and out broadway to mountain view turning to the right at the cemetery they climbed the piedmont heights to blair park and plunged into the green coolness of jack hayes canyon saxon could not suppress her surprise and joy at the quickness with which they covered the ground  they are beautiful she said i never dreamed id ever ride behind horses like them im afraid ill wake up now and find its a dream you know i dream horses all the time id give anything to own one some time  its funny aint it billy answered i like horses that way the boss says im a wooz at horses an i know hes a dub he dont know the first thing an yet he owns two hundred big heavy draughts besides this light drivin pair an i dont own one  yet god makes the horses saxon said  its a sure thing the boss dont then how does he have so manytwo hundred of em im tellin you he thinks he likes horses honest to god saxon he dont like all his horses as much as i like the last hair on the last tail of the scrubbiest of the bunch yet theyre his wouldnt it jar you  wouldnt it saxon laughed appreciatively i just love fancy shirtwaists an i spent my life ironing some of the beautifullest ive ever seen its funny an it isnt fair  billy gritted his teeth in another of his rages  an the way some of them women gets their shirtwaists it makes me sick thinkin of you ironin em you know what i mean saxon they aint no use wastin words over it you know i know everybody knows an its a hell of a world if men an women sometimes cant talk to each other about such things his manner was almost apologetic yet it was defiantly and assertively right i never talk this way to other girls theyd think im workin up to designs on em they make me sick the way theyre always lookin for them designs but youre different i can talk to you that way i know ive got to its the square thing youre like billy murphy or any other man a man can talk to  she sighed with a great happiness and looked at him with unconscious loveshining eyes  its the same way with me she said the fellows ive run with ive never dared let talk about such things because i knew theyd take advantage of it why all the time with them ive a feeling that were cheating and lying to each other playing a game like at a masquerade ball she paused for a moment hesitant and debating then went on in a queer low voice i havent been asleep ive seen and heard ive had my chances when i was that tired of the laundry id have done almost anything i could have got those fancy shirtwaists an all the rest and maybe a horse to ride there was a bank cashier married too if you please he talked to me straight out i didnt count you know i wasnt a girl with a girls feelings or anything i was nobody it was just like a business talk i learned about men from him he told me what hed do he  her voice died away in sadness and in the silence she could hear billy grit his teeth  you cant tell me he cried i know its a dirty worldan unfair lousy world i cant make it out theys no squareness in itwomen with the best thats in em bought an sold like horses i dont understand women that way i dont understand men that way i cant see how a man gets anything but cheated when he buys such things its funny aint it take my boss an his horses he owns women too he might aowned you just because hes got the price an saxon you was made for fancy shirtwaists an all that but honest to god i cant see you payin for them that way itd be a crime  he broke off abruptly and reined in the horses around a sharp turn speeding down the grade upon them had appeared an automobile with slamming of brakes it was brought to a stop while the faces of the occupants took new lease of interest of life and stared at the young man and woman in the light rig that barred the way billy held up his hand  take the outside sport he said to the chauffeur  nothin doin kiddo came the answer as the chauffeur measured with hard wise eyes the crumbling edge of the road and the downfall of the outside bank  then we camp billy announced cheerfully i know the rules of the road these animals aint automobile broke altogether an if you think im goin to have em shy off the grade you got another guess comin  a confusion of injured protestation arose from those that sat in the car  you neednt be a roadhog because youre a rube said the chauffeur we aint agoin to hurt your horses pull out so we can pass if you dont  thatll do you sport was billys retort you cant talk that way to yours truly i got your number an your tag my son youre standin on your foot back up the grade an get off of it stop on the outside at the first psssinplace an well pass you youve got the juice throw on the reverse  after a nervous consultation the chauffeur obeyed and the car backed up the hill and out of sight around the turn  them cheap skates billy sneered to saxon with a couple of gallons of gasoline an the price of a machine athinkin they own the roads your folks an my folks made  talkin all night about it came the chauffeurs voice from around the bend get a move on you can pass  get off your foot billy retorted contemptuously im acomin when im ready to come an if you aint given room enough ill go clean over you an your load of chicken meat  he slightly slacked the reins on the restless headtossing animals and without need of chirrup they took the weight of the light vehicle and passed up the hill and apprehensively on the inside of the purring machine  where was we billy queried as the clear road showed in front yep take my boss why should he own two hundred horses an women an the rest an you an me own nothin  you own your silk billy she said softly  an you yours yet we sell it to em like it was cloth across the counter at so much a yard i guess youre hep to what a few more years in the laundryll do to you take me im sellin my silk slow every day i work see that little finger he shifted the reins to one hand for a moment and held up the free hand for inspection i cant straighten it like the others an its growin i never put it out fightin the teamins done it thats silk gone across the counter thats all ever see a old fourhorse teamsters hands they look like claws theyre that crippled an twisted  things werent like that in the old days when our folks crossed the plains she answered they might agot their fingers twisted but they owned the best goin in the way of horses and such  sure they worked for themselves they twisted their fingers for themselves but im twistin my fingers for my boss why dye know saxon his hands is soft as a womans thats never done any work yet he owns the horses an the stables an never does a tap of work an i manage to scratch my mealticket an my clothes its got my goat the way things is run an who runs em that way thats what i want to know times has changed who changed em  god didnt  you bet your life he didnt an thats another thing that gets me whos god anyway if hes runnin thingsan what good is he if he aintthen why does he let my boss an men like that cashier you mentioned why does he let them own the horses an buy the women the nice little girls that oughta be lovin their own husbands an havin children theyre not ashamed of an just bein happy accordin to their nature    chapter xi  the horses resting frequently and lathered by the work had climbed the steep grade of the old road to moraga valley and on the divide of the contra costa hills the way descended sharply through the green and sunny stillness of redwood canyon  say aint it swell billy queried with a wave of his hand indicating the circled treegroups the trickle of unseen water and the summer hum of bees  i love it saxon affirmed it makes me want to live in the country and i never have  me too saxon ive never lived in the country in my lifean all my folks was country folks  no cities then everybody lived in the country  i guess youre right he nodded they just had to live in the country  there was no brake on the light carriage and billy became absorbed in managing his team down the steep winding road saxon leaned back eyes closed with a feeling of ineffable rest time and again he shot glances at her closed eyes  whats the matter he asked finally in mild alarm you aint sick  its so beautiful im afraid to look she answered its so brave it hurts  bravenow thats funny  isnt it but it just makes me feel that way its brave now the houses and streets and things in the city arent brave but this is i dont know why it just is  by golly i think youre right he exclaimed it strikes me that way now you speak of it they aint no games or tricks here no cheatin an no lyin them trees just stand up natural an strong an clean like young boys their first time in the ring before theyve learned its rottenness an how to doublecross an lay down to the bettin odds an the fightfans yep it is brave say saxon you see things dont you his pause was almost wistful and he looked at her and studied her with a caressing softness that ran through her in resurgent thrills dye know id just like you to see me fight some timea real fight with something doin every moment id be proud to death to do it for you an id sure fight some with you lookin on an understandin thatd be a fight what is take it from me an thats funny too i never wanted to fight before a woman in my life they squeal and screech an dont understand but youd understand its dead open an shut you would  a little later swinging along the flat of the valley through the little clearings of the farmers and the ripe grainstretches golden in the sunshine billy turned to saxon again  say youve ben in love with fellows lots of times tell me about it whats it like  she shook her head slowly  i only thought i was in loveand not many times either  many times he cried  not really ever she assured him secretly exultant at his unconscious jealousy i never was really in love if i had been id be married now you see i couldnt see anything else to it but to marry a man if i loved him  but suppose he didnt love you  oh i dont know she smiled half with facetiousness and half with certainty and pride i think i could make him love me  i guess you sure could billy proclaimed enthusiastically  the trouble is she went on the men that loved me i never cared for that wayoh look  a cottontail rabbit had scuttled across the road and a tiny dust cloud lingered like smoke marking the way of his flight at the next turn a dozen quail exploded into the air from under the noses of the horses billy and saxon exclaimed in mutual delight  gee he muttered i almost wisht id ben born a farmer folks wasnt made to live in cities  not our kind at least she agreed followed a pause and a long sigh its all so beautiful it would be a dream just to live all your life in it id like to be an indian squaw sometimes  several times billy checked himself on the verge of speech  about those fellows you thought you was in love with he said finally you aint told me yet  you want to know she asked they didnt amount to anything  of course i want to know go ahead fire away  well first there was al stanley  what did he do for a livin billy demanded almost as with authority  he was a gambler  billys face abruptly stiffened and she could see his eyes cloudy with doubt in the quick glance he flung at her  oh it was all right she laughed i was only eight years old you see im beginning at the beginning it was after my mother died and when i was adopted by cady he kept a hotel and saloon it was down in los angeles just a small hotel workingmen just common laborers mostly and some railroad men stopped at it and i guess al stanley got his share of their wages he was so handsome and so quiet and softspoken and he had the nicest eyes and the softest cleanest hands i can see them now he played with me sometimes in the afternoon and gave me candy and little presents he used to sleep most of the day i didnt know why then i thought he was a fairy prince in disguise and then he got killed right in the barroom but first he killed the man that killed him so that was the end of that love affair  next was after the asylum when i was thirteen and living with my brotherive lived with him ever since he was a boy that drove a bakery wagon almost every morning on the way to school i used to pass him he would come driving down wood street and turn in on twelfth maybe it was because he drove a horse that attracted me anyway i must have loved him for a couple of months then he lost his job or something for another boy drove the wagon and wed never even spoken to each other  then there was a bookkeeper when i was sixteen i seem to run to bookkeepers it was a bookkeeper at the laundry that charley long beat up this other one was when i was working in hickmeyers cannery he had soft hands too but i quickly got all i wanted of him he was well anyway he had ideas like your boss and i never really did love him truly and honest billy i felt from the first that he wasnt just right and when i was working in the paperbox factory i thought i loved a clerk in kahns emporiumyou know on eleventh and washington he was all right that was the trouble with him he was too much all right he didnt have any life in him any go he wanted to marry me though but somehow i couldnt see it that shows i didnt love him he was narrowchested and skinny and his hands were always cold and fishy but my he could dressjust like he came out of a bandbox he said he was going to drown himself and all kinds of things but i broke with him just the same  and after that well there isnt any after that i must have got particular i guess but i didnt see anybody i could love it seemed more like a game with the men i met or a fight and we never fought fair on either side seemed as if we always had cards up our sleeves we werent honest or outspoken but instead it seemed as if we were trying to take advantage of each other charley long was honest though and so was that bank cashier and even they made me have the fight feeling harder than ever all of them always made me feel i had to take care of myself they wouldnt that was sure  she stopped and looked with interest at the clean profile of his face as he watched and guided the homes he looked at her inquiringly and her eyes laughed lazily into his as she stretched her arms  thats all she concluded ive told you everything which ive never done before to any one and its your turn now  not much of a turn saxon ive never cared for girlsthat is not enough to want to marry em i always liked men betterfellows like billy murphy besides i guess i was too interested in trainin an fightin to bother with women much why saxon honest while i aint ben altogether goodyou understand what i meanjust the same i aint never talked love to a girl in my life they was no call to  the girls have loved you just the same she teased while in her heart was a curious elation at his virginal confession  he devoted himself to the horses  lots of them she urged  still he did not reply  now havent they  well it wasnt my fault he said slowly if they wanted to look sideways at me it was up to them and it was up to me to sidestep if i wanted to wasnt it youve no idea saxon how a prizefighter is run after why sometimes its seemed to me that girls an women aint got an ounce of natural shame in their makeup oh i was never afraid of them believe muh but i didnt hanker after em a mans a fool thatd let them kind get his goat  maybe you havent got love in you she challenged  maybe i havent was his discouraging reply anyway i dont see myself lovin a girl that runs after me its all right for charleyboys but a man that is a man dont like bein chased by women  my mother always said that love was the greatest thing in the world saxon argued she wrote poems about it too some of them were published in the san jose mercury  what do you think about it  oh i dont know she baffled meeting his eyes with another lazy smile all i know is its pretty good to be alive a day like this  on a trip like thisyou bet it is he added promptly  at one oclock billy turned off the road and drove into an open space among the trees  heres where we eat he announced i thought itd be better to have a lunch by ourselves than atop at one of these roadside dinner counters an now just to make everything safe an comfortable im goin to unharness the horses we got lots of time you can get the lunch basket out an spread it on the laprobe  as saxon unpacked she basket she was appalled at his extravagance she spread an amazing array of ham and chicken sandwiches crab salad hardboiled eggs pickled pigs feet ripe olives and dill pickles swiss cheese salted almonds oranges and bananas and several pint bottles of beer it was the quantity as well as the variety that bothered her it had the appearance of a reckless attempt to buy out a whole delicatessen shop  you oughtnt to blow yourself that way she reproved him as he sat down beside her why its enough for half a dozen bricklayers  its all right isnt it  yes she acknowledged but thats the trouble its too much so  then its all right he concluded i always believe in havin plenty have some beer to wash the dust away before we begin watch out for the glasses i gotta return them  later the meal finished he lay on his back smoking a cigarette and questioned her about her earlier history she had been telling him of her life in her brothers house where she paid four dollars and a half a week board at fifteen she had graduated from grammar school and gone to work in the jute mills for four dollars a week three of which she had paid to sarah  how about that saloonkeeper billy asked how come it he adopted you  she shrugged her shoulders i dont know except that all my relatives were hard up it seemed they just couldnt get on they managed to scratch a lean living for themselves and that was all cadyhe was the saloonkeeperhad been a soldier in my fathers company and he always swore by captain kit which was their nickname for him my father had kept the surgeons from amputating his leg in the war and he never forgot it he was making money in the hotel and saloon and i found out afterward he helped out a lot to pay the doctors and to bury my mother alongside of father i was to go to uncle willthat was my mothers wish but there had been fighting up in the ventura mountains where his ranch was and men had been killed it was about fences and cattlemen or something and anyway he was in jail a long time and when he got his freedom the lawyers had got his ranch he was an old man then and broken and his wife took sick and he got a job as night watchman for forty dollars a month so he couldnt do anything for me and cady adopted me  cady was a good man if he did run a saloon his wife was a big handsomelooking woman i dont think she was all right and ive heard so since but she was good to me i dont care what they say about her or what she was she was awful good to me after he died she went altogether bad and so i went into the orphan asylum it wasnt any too good there and i had three years of it and then tom had married and settled down to steady work and he took me out to live with him andwell ive been working pretty steady ever since  she gazed sadly away across the fields until her eyes came to rest on a fence brightsplashed with poppies at its base billy who from his supine position had been looking up at her studying and pleasuring in the pointed oval of her womans face reached his hand out slowly as he murmured  you poor little kid  his hand closed sympathetically on her bare forearm and as she looked down to greet his eyes she saw in them surprise and delight  say aint your skin cool though he said now me im always warm feel my hand  it was warmly moist and she noted microscopic beads of sweat on his forehead and cleanshaven upper lip  my but you are sweaty  she bent to him and with her handkerchief dabbed his lip and forehead dry then dried his palms  i breathe through my skin i guess he explained the wise guys in the trainin camps and gyms say its a good sign for health but somehow im sweatin more than usual now funny aint it  she had been forced to unclasp his hand from her arm in order to dry it and when she finished it returned to its old position  but say aint your skin cool he repeated with renewed wonder soft as velvet too an smooth as silk it feels great  gently explorative he slid his hand from wrist to elbow and came to rest half way back tired and languid from the morning in the sun she found herself thrilling to his touch and halfdreamily deciding that here was a man she could love hands and all  now ive taken the cool all out of that spot he did not look up to her and she could see the roguish smile that curled on his lips so i guess ill try another  he shifted his hand along her arm with soft sensuousness and she looking down at his lips remembered the long tingling they had given hers the first time they had met  go on and talk he urged after a delicious five minutes of silence i like to watch your lips talking its funny but every move they make looks like a tickly kiss  greatly she wanted to stay where she was instead she said  if i talk you wont like what i say  go on he insisted you cant say anything i wont like  well theres some poppies over there by the fence i want to pick and then its time for us to be going  i lose he laughed but you made twentyfive tickle kisses just the same i counted em ill tell you what you sing when the harvest days are over and let me have your other cool arm while youre doin it and then well go  she sang looking down into his eyes which ware centered not on hers but on her lips when she finished she slipped his hands from her arms and got up he was about to start for the horses when she held her jacket out to him despite the independence natural to a girl who earned her own living she had an innate love of the little services and finenesses and also she remembered from her childhood the talk by the pioneer women of the courtesy and attendance of the caballeros of the spanishcalifornia days  sunset greeted them when after a wide circle to the east and south they cleared the divide of the contra costa hills and began dropping down the long grade that led past redwood peak to fruitvale beneath them stretched the flatlands to the bay checkerboarded into fields and broken by the towns of elmhurst san leandro and haywards the smoke of oakland filled the western sky with haze and murk while beyond across the bay they could see the first winking lights of san francisco  darkness was on them and billy had become curiously silent for half an hour he had given no recognition of her existence save once when the chill evening wind caused him to tuck the robe tightly about her and himself half a dozen times saxon found herself on the verge of the remark whats on your mind but each time let it remain unuttered she sat very close to him the warmth of their bodies intermingled and she was aware of a great restfulness and content  say saxon he began abruptly its no use my holdin it in any longer its ben in my mouth all day ever since lunch whats the matter with you an me gettin married  she knew very quietly and very gladly that he meant it instinctively she was impelled to hold off to make him woo her to make herself more desirably valuable ere she yielded further her womans sensitiveness and pride were offended she had never dreamed of so forthright and bald a proposal from the man to whom she would give herself the simplicity and directness of billys proposal constituted almost a hurt on the other hand she wanted him so muchhow much she had not realized until now when he had so unexpectedly made himself accessible  well you gotta say something saxon hand it to me good or bad but anyway hand it to me an just take into consideration that i love you why i love you like the very devil saxon i must because im askin you to marry me an i never asked any girl that before  another silence fell and saxon found herself dwelling on the warmth tingling now under the laprobe when she realized whither her thoughts led she blushed guiltily in the darkness  how old are you billy she questioned with a suddenness and irrelevance as disconcerting as his first words had been  twentytwo he answered  i am twentyfour  as if i didnt know when you left the orphan asylum and how old you were how long you worked in the jute mills the cannery the paperbox factory the laundrymaybe you think i cant do addition i knew how old you was even to your birthday  that doesnt change the fact that im two years older  what of it if it counted for anything i wouldnt be lovin you would i your mother was dead right loves the big stuff its what counts dont you see i just love you an i gotta have you its natural i guess and ive always found with horses dogs and other folks that whats natural is right theres no gettin away from it saxon i gotta have you an im just hopin hard you gotta have me maybe my hands aint soft like bookkeepers an clerks but they can work for you an fight like sam hill for you and saxon they can love you  the old sex antagonism which she had always experienced with men seemed to have vanished she had no sense of being on the defensive this was no game it was what she had been looking for and dreaming about before billy she was defenseless and there was an allsatisfaction in the knowledge she could deny him nothing not even if he proved to be like the others and out of the greatness of the thought rose a greater thoughthe would not so prove himself  she did not speak instead in a glow of spirit and flesh she reached out to his left hand and gently tried to remove it from the rein he did not understand but when she persisted he shifted the rein to his right and let her have her will with the other hand her head bent over it and she kissed the teamster callouses  for the moment he was stunned  you mean it he stammered  for reply she kissed the hand again and murmured  i love your hands billy to me they are the most beautiful hands in the world and it would take hours of talking to tell you all they mean to me  whoa he called to the horses  he pulled them in to a standstill soothed them with his voice and made the reins fast around the whip then he turned to her with arms around her and lips to lips  oh billy ill make you a good wife she sobbed when the kiss was broken  he kissed her wet eyes and found her lips again  now you know what i was thinkin and why i was sweatin when we was eatin lunch just seemed i couldnt hold in much longer from tellin you why you know you looked good to me from the first moment i spotted you  and i think i loved you from that first day too billy and i was so proud of you all that day you were so kind and gentle and so strong and the way the men all respected you and the girls all wanted you and the way you fought those three irishmen when i was behind the picnic table i couldnt love or marry a man i wasnt proud of and im so proud of you so proud  not half as much as i am right now of myself he answered for having won you its too good to be true maybe the alarm clockll go off and wake me up in a couple of minutes well anyway if it does im goin to make the best of them two minutes first watch out i dont eat you im that hungry for you  he smothered her in an embrace holding her so tightly to him that it almost hurt after what was to her an agelong period of bliss his arms relaxed and he seemed to make an effort to draw himself together   an the clock aint gone off yet he whispered against her cheek and its a dark night an theres fruitvale right ahead an if there aint king and prince standin still in the middle of the road i never thought the timed come when i wouldnt want to take the ribbons on a fine pair of horses but this is that time i just cant let go of you and ive gotta some time tonight it hurts worsen poison but here goes  he restored her to herself tucked the disarranged robe about her and chirruped to the impatient team  half an hour later he called whoa  i know im awake now but i dont know but maybe i dreamed all the rest and i just want to make sure  and again be made the reins fast and took her in his arms    chapter xii  the days flew by for saxon she worked on steadily at the laundry even doing more overtime than usual and all her free waking hours were devoted to preparations for the great change and to billy he had proved himself gods own impetuous lover by insisting on getting married the next day after the proposal and then by resolutely refusing to compromise on more than a weeks delay  why wait he demanded were not gettin any younger so far as i can notice an think of all we lose every day we wait  in the end he gave in to a month which was well for in two weeks he was transferred with half a dozen other drivers to work from the big stables of corberly and morrison in west oakland househunting in the other end of town ceased and on pine street between fifth and fourth and in immediate proximity to the great southern pacific railroad yards billy and saxon rented a neat cottage of four small rooms for ten dollars a month  dogcheap is what i call it when i think of the small rooms ive ben soaked for was billys judgment look at the one i got now not as big as the smallest here an me payin six dollars a month for it  but its furnished saxon reminded him you see that makes a difference  but billy didnt see  i aint much of a scholar saxon but i know simple arithmetic ive soaked my watch when i was hard up and i can calculate interest how much do you figure it will cost to furnish the house carpets on the floor linoleum on the kitchen and all  we can do it nicely for three hundred dollars she answered ive been thinking it over and im sure we can do it for that  three hundred he muttered wrinkling his brows with concentration three hundred say at six per centthatd be six cents on the dollar sixty cents on ten dollars six dollars on the hundred on three hundred eighteen dollars sayim a bear at multiplyin by ten now divide eighteen by twelve thatd be a dollar an a half a month interest he stopped satisfied that he had proved his contention then his face quickened with a fresh thought hold on that aint all thatd be the interest on the furniture for four rooms divide by four whats a dollar an a half divided by four  four into fifteen three times and three to carry saxon recited glibly four into thirty is seven twentyeight two to carry and twofourths is onehalf there you are  gee youre the real bear at figures he hesitated i didnt follow you how much did you say it was  thirtyseven and a half cents  ah ha now well see how much ive ben gouged for my one room ten dollars a month for four rooms is two an a half for one add thirtyseven an a half cents interest on furniture an that makes two dollars an eightyseven an a half cents subtract from six dollars  three dollars and twelve and a half cents she supplied quickly  there we are three dollars an twelve an a half cents im jiggered out of on the room im rentin say bein married is like savin money aint it  but furniture wears out billy  by golly i never thought of that it ought to be figured too anyway weve got a snap here and next saturday afternoon youve gotta get off from the laundry so as we can go an buy our furniture i saw salingers last night i givem fifty down and the rest installment plan ten dollars a month in twentyfive months the furnitures ourn an remember saxon you wanta buy everything you want no matter how much it costs no scrimpin on whats for you an me get me  she nodded with no betrayal on her face of the myriad secret economies that filled her mind a hint of moisture glistened in her eyes  youre so good to me billy she murmured as she came to him and was met inside his arms  so youve gone an done it mary commented one morning in the laundry they had not been at work ten minutes ere her eye had glimpsed the topaz ring on the third finger of saxons left hand whos the lucky one charley long or billy roberts  billy was the answer  huh takin a young boy to raise eh  saxon showed that the stab had gone home and mary was all contrition  cant you take a josh im glad to death at the news billys a awful good man and im glad to see you get him there aint many like him knockin round an they aint to be had for the askin an youre both lucky you was just made for each other an youll make him a better wife than any girl i know when is it to be  going home from the laundry a few days later saxon encountered charley long he blocked the sidewalk and compelled speech with her  so youre runnin with a prizefighter he sneered a blind man can see your finish  for the first time she was unafraid of this bigbodied blackbrowed men with the hairymatted hands and fingers she held up her left hand  see that its something with all your strength that you could never put on my finger billy roberts put it on inside a week he got your number charley long and at the same time he got me  skiddoo for you long retorted twentythrees your number  hes not like you saxon went on hes a man every bit of him a fine clean man  long laughed hoarsely  hes got your goat all right  and yours she flashed back  i could tell you things about him saxon straight he aint no good if i was to tell you  youd better get out of my way she interrupted or ill tell him and you know what youll get you great big bully  long shuffled uneasily then reluctantly stepped aside  youre a caution he said half admiringly  sos billy roberts she laughed and continued on her way after half a dozen steps she stopped say she called  the big blacksmith turned toward her with eagerness  about a block back she said i saw a man with hip disease you might go and beat him up  of one extravagance saxon was guilty in the course of the brief engagement period a full days wages she spent in the purchase of half a dozen cabinet photographs of herself billy had insisted that life was unendurable could he not look upon her semblance the last thing when he went to bed at night and the first thing when he got up in the morning in return his photographs one conventional and one in the stripped fighting costume of the ring ornamented her looking glass it was while gazing at the latter that she was reminded of her wonderful mothers tales of the ancient saxons and seaforagers of the english coasts from the chest of drawers that had crossed the plains she drew forth another of her several precious heirlooma scrapbook of her mothers in which was pasted much of the fugitive newspaper verse of pioneer california days also there were copies of paintings and old wood engravings from the magazines of a generation and more before  saxon ran the pages with familiar fingers and stopped at the picture she was seeking between bold headlands of rock and under a gray cloudblown sky a dozen boats long and lean and dark beaked like monstrous birds were landing on a foamwhitened beach of sand the men in the boats half naked hugemuscled and fairhaired wore winged helmets in their hands were swords and spears and they were leaping waistdeep into the seawash and wading ashore opposed to them contesting the landing were skinclad savages unlike indians however who clustered on the beach or waded into the water to their knees the first blows were being struck and here and there the bodies of the dead and wounded rolled in the surf one fairhaired invader lay across the gunwale of a boat the manner of his death told by the arrow that transfixed his breast in the air leaping past him into the water sword in hand was billy there was no mistaking it the striking blondness the face the eyes the mouth were the same the very expression on the face was what had been on billys the day of the picnic when he faced the three wild irishmen  somewhere out of the ruck of those warring races had emerged billys ancestors and hers was her afterthought as she closed the book and put it back in the drawer and some of those ancestors had made this ancient and battered chest of drawers which had crossed the salt ocean and the plains and been pierced by a bullet in the fight with the indians at little meadow almost it seemed she could visualize the women who had kept their pretties and their family homespun in its drawersthe women of those wandering generations who were grandmothers and greater great grandmothers of her own mother well she sighed it was a good stock to be born of a hardworking hardfighting stock she fell to wondering what her life would have been like had she been born a chinese woman or an italian woman like those she saw headshawled or bareheaded squat ungainly and swarthy who carried great loads of driftwood on their heads up from the beach then she laughed at her foolishness remembered billy and the fourroomed cottage on pine street and went to bed with her mind filled for the hundredth time with the details of the furniture    chapter xiii  our cattle were all played out saxon was saying and winter was so near that we couldnt dare try to cross the great american desert so our train stopped in salt lake city that winter the mormons hadnt got bad yet and they were good to us  you talk as though you were there bert commented  my mother was saxon answered proudly she was nine years old that winter  they were seated around the table in the kitchen of the little pine street cottage making a cold lunch of sandwiches tamales and bottled beer it being sunday the four were free from work and they had come early to work harder than on any week day washing walls and windows scrubbing floors laying carpets and linoleum hanging curtains setting up the stove putting the kitchen utensils and dishes away and placing the furniture  go on with the story saxon mary begged im just dyin to hear and bert you just shut up and listen  well that winter was when del hancock showed up he was kentucky born but hed been in the west for years he was a scout like kit carson and he knew him well manys a time kit carson and he slept under the same blankets they were together to california and oregon with general fremont well del hancock was passing on his way through salt lake going i dont know where to raise a company of rocky mountain trappers to go after beaver some new place he knew about ha was a handsome man he wore his hair long like in pictures and had a silk sash around his waist hed learned to wear in california from the spanish and two revolvers in his belt any woman d fall in love with him first sight well he saw sadie who was my mothers oldest sister and i guess she looked good to him for he stopped right there in salt lake and didnt go a step he was a great indian fighter too and i heard my aunt villa say when i was a little girl that he had the blackest brightest eyes and that the way he looked was like an eagle hed fought duels too the way they did in those days and he wasnt afraid of anything  sadie was a beauty and she flirted with him and drove him crazy maybe she wasnt sure of her own mind i dont know but i do know that she didnt give in as easy as i did to billy finally he couldnt stand it any more ha rode up that night on horseback wild as could be sadie he said if you dont promise to marry me tomorrow ill shoot myself tonight right back of the corral and hed have done it too and sadie knew it and said she would didnt they make love fast in those days  oh i dont know mary sniffed a week after you first laid eyes on billy you was engaged did billy say he was going to shoot himself back of the laundry if you turned him down  i didnt give him a chance saxon confessed anyway del hancock and aunt sadie got married next day and they were very happy afterward only she died and after that he was killed with general custer and all the rest by the indians he was an old man by then but i guess he got his share of indians before they got him men like him always died fighting and they took their dead with them i used to know al stanley when i was a little girl he was a gambler but he was game a railroad man shot him in the back when he was sitting at a table that shot killed him too he died in about two seconds but before he died hed pulled his gun and put three bullets into the man that killed him  i dont like fightin mary protested it makes me nervous bert gives me the willies the way hes always lookin for trouble there aint no sense in it  and i wouldnt give a snap of my fingers for a man without fighting spirit saxon answered why we wouldnt be here today if it wasnt for the fighting spirit of our people before us  youve got the real goods of a fighter in billy bert assured her a yard long and a yard wide and genuine a number one longfleeced wool billys a mohegan with a scalplock thats what he is and when he gets his mad up its a case of get out from under or something will fall on youhard  just like that mary added  billy who had taken no part in the conversation got up glanced into the bedroom off the kitchen went into the parlor and the bedroom off the parlor then returned and stood gazing with puzzled brows into the kitchen bedroom  whats eatin you old man bert queried you look as though youd lost something or was markin a threeway ticket what you got on your chest cough it up  why im just thinkin where in sam hills the bed an stuff for the back bedroom  there isnt any saxon explained we didnt order any  then ill see about it tomorrow  what dye want another bed for asked bert aint one bed enough for the two of you  you shut up bert mary cried dont get raw  whoa mary bert grinned back up youre in the wrong stall as usual  we dont need that room saxon was saying to billy and so i didnt plan any furniture that money went to buy better carpets and a better stove  billy came over to her lifted her from the chair and seated himself with her on his knees  thats right little girl im glad you did the best for us every time and tomorrow night i want you to run up with me to salingers an pick out a good bedroom set an carpet for that room and it must be good nothin snide  it will cost fifty dollars she objected  thats right he nodded make it cost fifty dollars and not a cent less were goin to have the best and whats the good of an empty room itd make the house look cheap why i go around now seein this little nest just as it grows an softens day by day from the day we paid the cash money down an nailed the keys why almost every moment im drivin the horses all day long i just keep on seein this nest and when were married ill go on seein it and i want to see it complete if that roomd he barefloored an empty id see nothin but it and its bare floor all day long id be cheated the housed be a lie look at them curtains you put up in it saxon thats to make believe to the neighbors that its furnished saxon them curtains are lyin about that room makin a noise for every one to hear that that rooms furnished nitsky for us im goin to see that them curtains tell the truth  you might rent it bert suggested youre close to the railroad yards and its only two blocks to a restaurant  not on your life i aint marryin saxon to take in lodgers if i cant take care of her dye know what ill do go down to long wharf say here goes nothin an jump into the bay with a stone tied to my neck aint i right saxon  it was contrary to her prudent judgment but it fanned her pride she threw her arms around her lovers neck and said ere she kissed him  youre the boss billy what you say goes and always will go  listen to that bert gibed to mary thats the stuff saxons onto her job  i guess well talk things over together first before ever i do anything billy was saying to saxon  listen to that mary triumphed you bet the man that marries mell have to talk things over first  billys only givin her hot air bert plagued they all do it before theyre married  mary sniffed contemptuously  ill bet saxon leads him around by the nose and im goin to say loud an strong that ill lead the man around by the nose that marries me  not if you love him saxon interposed  all the more reason mary pursued  bert assumed an expression and attitude of mournful dejection  now you see why me an mary dont get married he said im some big indian myself an ill be everlastingly jiggerooed if i put up for a wigwam i cant be boss of  and im no squaw mary retaliated an i wouldnt marry a big buck indian if all the rest of the men in the world was dead  well this big buck indian aint asked you yet  he knows what hed get if he did  and after that maybe hell think twice before he does ask you  saxon intent on diverting the conversation into pleasanter channels clapped her hands as if with sudden recollection  oh i forgot i want to show you something from her purse she drew a slender ring of plain gold and passed it around my mothers wedding ring ive worn it around my neck always like a locket i cried for it so in the orphan asylum that the matron gave it back for me to wear and now just to think after next tuesday ill be wearing it on my finger look billy see the engraving on the inside  c to d 1879 he read  carlton to daisycarlton was my fathers first name and now billy youve got to get it engraved for you and me  mary was all eagerness and delight  oh its fine she cried w to s 1907  billy considered a moment  no that wouldnt be right because im not giving it to saxon  ill tell you what saxon said w and s  nope billy shook his head s and w because you come first with me  if i come first with you you come first with us billy dear i insist on w and s  you see mary said to bert having her own way and leading him by the nose already  saxon acknowledged the sting  anyway you want billy she surrendered his arms tightened about her  well talk it over first i guess    chapter xiv  sarah was conservative worse she had crystallized at the end of her lovetime with the coming of her first child after that she was as set in her ways as plaster in a mold her mold was the prejudices and notions of her girlhood and the house she lived in so habitual was she that any change in the customary round assumed the proportions of a revolution tom had gone through many of these revolutions three of them when he moved house then his stamina broke and he never moved house again  so it was that saxon had held back the announcement of her approaching marriage until it was unavoidable she expected a scene and she got it  a prizefighter a hoodlum a plugugly sarah sneered after she had exhausted herself of all calamitous forecasts of her own future and the future of her children in the absence of saxons weekly four dollars and a half i dont know what your motherd thought if she lived to see the day when you took up with a tough like bill roberts bill why your mother was too refined to associate with a man that was called bill and all i can say is you can say goodbye to silk stockings and your three pair of shoes it wont be long before youll think yourself lucky to go sloppin around in congress gaiters and cotton stockins two pair for a quarter  oh im not afraid of billy not being able to keep me in all kinds of shoes saxon retorted with a proud toss of her head  you dont know what youre talkin about sarah paused to laugh in mirthless discordance watch for the babies to come they come faster than wages raise these days  but were not going to have any babies that is at first not until after the furniture is all paid for anyway  wise in your generation eh in my days girls were more modest than to know anything about disgraceful subjects  as babies saxon queried with a touch of gentle malice  yes as babies  the first i knew that babies were disgraceful why sarah you with your five how disgraceful you have been billy and i have decided not to be half as disgraceful were only going to have twoa boy and a girl  tom chuckled but held the peace by hiding his face in his coffee cup sarah though checked by this flank attack was herself an old hand in the art so temporary was the setback that she scarcely paused ere hurling her assault from a new angle  an marryin so quick all of a sudden eh if that aint suspicious nothin is i dont know what young womens comin to they aint decent i tell you they aint decent thats what comes of sunday dancin an all the rest young women nowadays are like a lot of animals such fast an looseness i never saw  saxon was white with anger but while sarah wandered on in her diatribe tom managed to wink privily and prodigiously at his sister and to implore her to help in keeping the peace  its all right kid sister he comforted saxon when they were alone theres no use talkin to sarah bill roberts is a good boy i know a lot about him it does you proud to get him for a husband youre bound to be happy with him his voice sank and his face seemed suddenly to be very old and tired as he went on anxiously take warning from sarah dont nag whatever you do dont nag dont give him a perpetualmotion line of chin kind of let him talk once in a while men have some horse sense though sarah dont know it why sarah actually loves me though she dont make a noise like it the thing for you is to love your husband and by thunder to make a noise of lovin him too and then you can kid him into doing most anything you want let him have his way once in a while and hell let you have yourn but you just go on lovin him and leanin on his judgementhes no fooland youll be all hunkydory im scared from goin wrong what of sarah but id sooner be loved into not going wrong  oh ill do it tom saxon nodded smiling through the tears his sympathy had brought into her eyes and on top of it im going to do something else im going to make billy love me and just keep on loving me and then i wont have to kid him into doing some of the things i want hell do them because he loves me you see  you got the right idea saxon stick with it an youll win out  later when she had put on her hat to start for the laundry she found tom waiting for her at the corner  an saxon he said hastily and haltingly you wont take anything ive said you know about sarah as bein in any way disloyal to her shes a good woman an faithful an her life aint so easy by a long shot id bite out my tongue before id say anything against her i guess all folks have their troubles its hell to be poor aint it  youve been awful good to me tom i can never forget it and i know sarah means right she does do her best  i wont be able to give you a wedding present her brother ventured apologetically sarah wont hear of it says we didnt get none from my folks when we got married but i got something for you just the same a surprise youd never guess it  saxon waited  when you told me you was goin to get married i just happened to think of it an i wrote to brother george askin him for it for you an by thunder he sent it by express i didnt tell you because i didnt know but maybe hed sold it he did sell the silver spurs he needed the money i guess but the other i had it sent to the shop so as not to bother sarah an i sneaked it in last night an hid it in the woodshed  oh it is something of my fathers what is it oh what is it  his army sword  the one he wore on his roan war horse oh tom you couldnt give me a better present lets go back now i want to see it we can slip in the back way sarahs washing in the kitchen and she wont begin hanging out for an hour  i spoke to sarah about lettin you take the old chest of drawers that was your mothers tom whispered as they stole along the narrow alley between the houses only she got on her high horse said that daisy was as much my mother as yourn even if we did have different fathers and that the chest had always belonged in daisys family and not captain kits an that it was mine an what was mine she had some sayso about  its all right saxon reassured him she sold it to me last night she was waiting up for me when i got home with fire in her eye  yep she was on the warpath all day after i mentioned it how much did you give her for it  six dollars  robberyit aint worth it tom groaned its all cracked at one end and as old as the hills  id have given ten dollars for it id have given most anything for it tom it was mothers you know i remember it in her room when she was still alive  in the woodshed tom resurrected the hidden treasure and took off the wrapping paper appeared a rusty steelscabbarded saber of the heavy type carried by cavalry officers in civil war days it was attached to a motheaten sash of thickwoven crimson silk from which hung heavy silk tassels saxon almost seized it from her brother in her eagerness she drew forth the blade and pressed her lips to the steel  it was her last day at the laundry she was to quit work that evening for good and the next afternoon at five she and billy were to go before a justice of the peace and be married bert and mary were to be the witnesses and after that the four were to go to a private room in barnums restaurant for the wedding supper that over bert and mary would proceed to a dance at myrtle hall while billy and saxon would take the eighth street car to seventh and pine honeymoons are infrequent in the working class the next morning billy must be at the stable at his regular hour to drive his team out  all the women in the fancy starch room knew it was saxons last day many exulted for her and not a few were envious of her in that she had won a husband and to freedom from the suffocating slavery of the ironing board much of bantering she endured such was the fate of every girl who married out of the fancy starch room but saxon was too happy to be hurt by the teasing a great deal of which was gross but all of which was goodnatured  in the steam that arose from under her iron and on the surfaces of the dainty lawns and muslins that flew under her hands she kept visioning herself in the pine street cottage and steadily she hummed under her breath her paraphrase of the latest popular song  and when i work and when i work ill always work for billy  by three in the afternoon the strain of the pieceworkers in the humid heated room grew tense elderly women gasped and sighed the color went out of the cheeks of the young women their faces became drawn and dark circles formed under their eyes but all held on with weary unabated speed the tireless vigilant forewoman kept a sharp lookout for incipient hysteria and once led a narrowchested stoopshouldered young thing out of the place in time to prevent a collapse  saxon was startled by the wildest scream of terror she had ever heard the tense thread of human resolution snapped wills and nerves broke down and a hundred women suspended their irons or dropped them it was mary who had screamed so terribly and saxon saw a strange black animal flapping great clawlike wings and nestling on marys shoulder with the scream mary crouched down and the strange creature darting into the air fluttered full into the startled face of a woman at the next board this woman promptly screamed and fainted into the air again the flying thing darted hither and thither while the shrieking shrinking women threw up their arms tried to run away along the aisles or cowered under their ironing boards  its only a bat the forewoman shouted she was furious aint you ever seen a bat it wont eat you  but they were ghetto people and were not to be quieted some woman who could not see the cause of the uproar out of her overwrought apprehension raised the cry of fire and precipitated the panic rush for the doors all of them were screaming the stupid soulsickening high note of terror drowning the forewomans voice saxon had been merely startled at first but the screaming panic broke her grip on herself and swept her away though she did not scream she fled with the rest when this horde of crazed women debouched on the next department those who worked there joined in the stampede to escape from they knew not what danger in ten minutes the laundry was deserted save for a few men wandering about with hand grenades in futile search for the cause of the disturbance  the forewoman was stout but indomitable swept along half the length of an aisle by the terrorstricken women she had broken her way back through the rout and quickly caught the lightblinded visitant in a clothes basket  maybe i dont know what god looks like but take it from me ive seen a tintype of the devil mary gurgled emotionally fluttering back and forth between laughter and tears  but saxon was angry with herself for she had been as frightened as the rest in that wild flight for outofdoors  were a lot of fools she said it was only a bat ive heard about them they live in the country they wouldnt hurt a fly they cant see in the daytime that was what was the matter with this one it was only a bat  huh you cant string me mary replied it was the devil she sobbed a moment and then laughed hysterically again did you see mrs bergstrom faint and it only touched her in the face why it was on my shoulder and touching my bare neck like the hand of a corpse and i didnt faint she laughed again i guess maybe i was too scared to faint  come on back saxon urged weve lost half an hour  not me im goin home after that if they fire me i couldnt iron for sour apples now im that shaky  one woman had broken a leg another an arm and a number nursed milder bruises and bruises no bullying nor entreating of the forewoman could persuade the women to return to work they were too upset and nervous and only here and there could one be found brave enough to reenter the building for the hats and lunch baskets of the others saxon was one of the handful that returned and worked till six oclock    chapter xv  why bertyoure squiffed mary cried reproachfully  the four were at the table in the private room at barnums the wedding supper simple enough but seemingly too expensive to saxon had been eaten bert in his hand a glass of california red wine which the management supplied for fifty cents a bottle was on his feet endeavoring a speech his face was flushed his black eyes were feverishly bright  youve ben drinkin before you met me mary continued i can

gloom over this merry gatherin far be it  he was so evidently seeking a way out of his predicament that mary tossed her head triumphantly this acted as a spur to his reeling wits  let me tell you why

need a buryin association to bury em i just guess yes that was the compliment to your good taste in skirts i was tryin to come across with when mary butted in  his glittering eyes rested for a moment

blinking his eyes across at the wedded couple while tears trickled unheeded down his cheeks marys hand went out soothingly to his completing his breakdown  by god i got a right to cry he sobbed im losin my best friend aint i itll never be the same again never when i think of the fun an scrapes an good times bill an me has had together i could darn near hate you saxon sittin there with your hand in his  cheer up bert she laughed gently look at whose hand you are holding  aw its only one of his cryin jags mary said with a harshness that her free hand belied as it caressed his hair with soothing strokes buck up bert everythings all right and now its up to bill to say something after your dandy spiel  bert recovered himself quickly with another glass of wine  kick in bill he cried its your turn now  im no hotair artist billy grumbled whatll i say saxon they aint no use tellin em how happy we are they know that  tell them were always going to be happy she said and thank them for all their good wishes and we both wish them the same and were always going to be together like old times the four of us and tell them theyre invited down to 507 pine street next sunday for sunday dinnerand mary if you want to come saturday night you can sleep in the spare bedroom  youve toldm yourself bettern i could billy clapped his hands you did yourself proud an i guess they aint much to add to it but just the same im goin to pass them a hot one  he stood up his hand on his glass his clear blue eyes under the dark brows and framed by the dark lashes seemed a deeper blue and accentuated the blondness of hair and skin the smooth cheeks were rosynot with wine for it was only his second glassbut with health and joy saxon looking up at him thrilled with pride in him he was so welldressed so strong so handsome so cleanlookingher manboy and she was aware of pride in herself in her womans desirableness that had won for her so wonderful a lover  well bert an mary here you are at saxons and my wedding supper were just goin to take all your good wishes to heart we wish you the same back and when we say it we mean more than you think we mean saxon an i believe in tit for tat so were wishin for the day when the table is turned clear around an were sittin as guests at your weddin supper and then when you come to sunday dinner you can both stop saturday night in the spare bedroom i guess i was wised up when i furnished it eh  i never thought it of you billy mary exclaimed youre every hit as raw as bert but just the same  there was a rush of moisture to her eyes her voice faltered and broke she smiled through her tears at them then turned to look at bert who put his arm around her and gathered her on to his knees  when they left the restaurant the four walked to eighth and broadway where they stopped beside the electric car bert and billy were awkward and silent oppressed by a strange aloofness but mary embraced saxon with fond anxiousness  its all right dear mary whispered dont be scared its all right think of all the other women in the world  the conductor clanged the gong and the two couples separated in a sudden hubbub of farewell  oh you mohegan bert called after as the car got under way oh you minnehaha  remember what i said was marys parting to saxon   the car stopped at seventh and pine the terminus of the line it was only a little over two blocks to the cottage on the front steps billy took the key from his pocket  funny isnt it he said as the key turned in the lock you an me just you an me  while he lighted the lamp in the parlor saxon was taking off her hat he went into the bedroom and lighted the lamp there then turned back and stood in the doorway saxon still unaccountably fumbling with her hatpins stole a glance at him he held out his arms  now he said  she came to him and in his arms he could feel her trembling     book ii    chapter i  the first evening after the marriage night saxon met billy at the door as he came up the front steps after their embrace and as they crossed the parlor hand in hand toward the kitchen he filled his lungs through his nostrils with audible satisfaction  my but this house smells good saxon it aint the coffeei can smell that too its the whole house it smells well it just smells good to me thats all  he washed and dried himself at the sink while she heated the frying pan on the front hole of the stove with the lid off as he wiped his hands he watched her keenly and cried out with approbation as she dropped the steak in the fryin pan  whered you learn to cook steak on a dry hot pan its the only way but darn few women seem to know about it  as she took the cover off a second frying pan and stirred the savory contents with a kitchen knife he came behind her passed his arms under her armpits with downdrooping hands upon her breasts and bent his head over her shoulder till cheek touched cheek  umumummm fried potatoes with onions like mother used to make me for them dont they smell good though umummmm  the pressure of his hands relaxed and his cheek slid caressingly past hers as he started to release her then his hands closed down again she felt his lips on her hair and heard his advertised inhalation of delight  umummmm dont you smell goodyourself though i never understood what they meant when they said a girl was sweet i know now and youre the sweetest i ever knew  his joy was boundless when he returned from combing his hair in the bedroom and sat down at the small table opposite her he paused with knife and fork in hand  say bein married is a whole lot more than its cracked up to be by most married folks honest to god saxon we can show em a few we can give em cards and spades an little casino an win out on big casino and the aces ive got but one kick comin  the instant apprehension in her eyes provoked a chuckle from him  an that is that we didnt get married quick enough just think ive lost a whole week of this  her eyes shone with gratitude and happiness and in her heart she solemnly pledged herself that never in all their married life would it be otherwise  supper finished she cleared the table and began washing the dishes at the sink when he evinced the intention of wiping them she caught him by the lapels of the coat and backed him into a chair  youll sit right there if you know whats good for you now be good and mind what i say also you will smoke a cigaretteno youre not going to watch me theres the morning paper beside you and if you dont hurry to read it ill be through these dishes before youve started  as he smoked and read she continually glanced across at him from her work one thing more she thoughtslippers and then the picture of comfort and content would be complete  several minutes later billy put the paper aside with a sigh  its no use he complained i cant read  whats the matter she teased eyes weak  nope theyre sore and theres only one thing to do em any good an thats lookin at you  all right then baby billy ill be through in a jiffy  when she had washed the dish towel and scalded out the sink she took off her kitchen apron came to him and kissed first one eye and then the other  how are they now cured  they feel some better already  she repeated the treatment  and now  still better  and now  almost well  after he had adjudged them well he ouched and informed her that there was still some hurt in the right eye  in the course of treating it she cried out as in pain billy was all alarm  what is it what hurt you  my eyes theyre hurting like sixty  and billy became physician for a while and she the patient when the cure was accomplished she led him into the parlor where by the open window they succeeded in occupying the same morris chair it was the most expensive comfort in the house it had cost seven dollars and a half and though it was grander than anything she had dreamed of possessing the extravagance of it had worried her in a halfguilty way all day  the salt chill of the air that is the blessing of all the bay cities after the sun goes down crept in about them they heard the switch engines puffing in the railroad yards and the rumbling thunder of the seventh street local slowing down in its run from the mole to stop at west oakland station from the street came the noise of children playing in the summer night and from the steps of the house next door the low voices of gossiping housewives  can you beat it billy murmured when i think of that sixdollar furnished room of mine it makes me sick to think what i was missin all the time but theres one satisfaction if id changed it sooner i wouldnt ahad you you see i didnt know you existed only until a couple of weeks ago  his hand crept along her bare forearm and up and partly under the elbowsleeve  your skins so cool he said it aint cold its cool it feels good to the hand  pretty soon youll be calling me your coldstorage baby she laughed  and your voice is cool he went on it gives me the feeling just as your hand does when you rest it on my forehead its funny i cant explain it but your voice just goes all through me cool and fine its like a wind of coolnessjust right its like the first of the seabreeze settin in in the afternoon after a scorchin hot morning an sometimes when you talk low it sounds round and sweet like the cello in the macdonough theater orchestra and it never goes high up or sharp or squeaky or scratchy like some womens voices when theyre mad or fresh or excited till they remind me of a bum phonograph record why your voice it just goes through me till im all tremblinglike with the everlastin cool of it its its straight delicious i guess angels in heaven if they is any must have voices like that  after a few minutes in which so inexpressible was her happiness that she could only pass her hand through his hair and cling to him he broke out again  ill tell you what you remind me of did you ever see a thoroughbred mare all shinin in the sun with hair like satin an skin so thin an tender that the least touch of the whip leaves a markall fine nerves an delicate an sensitive thatll kill the toughest bronco when it comes to endurance an that can strain a tendon in a flash or catch deathofcold without a blanket for a night i wanta tell you they aint many beautifuler sights in this world an theyre that finestrung an sensitive an delicate you gotta handle em rightside up glass with care well thats what you remind me of and im goin to make it my job to see you get handled an gentled in the same way youre as different from other women as that kind of a mare is from scrub workhorse mares youre a thoroughbred youre cleancut an spirited an your lines  say dye know youve got some figure well you have talk about annette kellerman you can give her cards and spades shes australian an youre american only your figure aint youre different youre niftyi dont know how to explain it other women aint built like you you belong in some other country youre frenchy thats what youre built like a french woman an more than thatthe way you walk move stand up or sit down or dont do anything  and he who had never been out of california or for that matter had never slept a night away from his birthtown of oakland was right in his judgment she was a flower of anglosaxon stock a rarity in the exceptional smallness and fineness of hand and foot and bone and grace of flesh and carriagesome throwback across the face of time to the foraying normanfrench that had intermingled with the sturdy saxon breed  and in the way you carry your clothes they belong to you they seem just as much part of you as the cool of your voice and skin theyre always all right an couldnt be better an you know a fellow kind of likes to be seen taggin around with a woman like you that wears her clothes like a dream an hear the other fellows say whos bills new skirt shes a peach aint she wouldnt i like to win her though and all that sort of talk  and saxon her cheek pressed to his knew that she was paid in full for all her midnight sewings and the torturing hours of drowsy stitching when her head nodded with the weariness of the days toil while she recreated for herself filched ideas from the dainty garments that had steamed under her passing iron  say saxon i got a new name for you youre my tonic kid thats what you are the tonic kid  and youll never get tired of me she queried  tired why we was made for each other  isnt it wonderful our meeting billy we might never have met it was just by accident that we did  we was born lucky he proclaimed thats a cinch  maybe it was more than luck she ventured  sure it just had to be it was fate nothing could akept us apart  they sat on in a silence that was quick with unuttered love till she felt him slowly draw her more closely and his lips come near to her ear as they whispered what do you say we go to bed   many evenings they spent like this varied with an occasional dance with trips to the orpheum and to bells theater or to the moving picture shows or to the friday night band concerts in city hall park often on sunday she prepared a lunch and he drove her out into the hills behind prince and king whom billys employer was still glad to have him exercise  each morning saxon was called by the alarm clock the first morning he had insisted upon getting up with her and building the fire in the kitchen stove she gave in the first morning but after that she laid the fire in the evening so that all that was required was the touching of a match to it and in bed she compelled him to remain for a last little doze ere she called him for breakfast for the first several weeks she prepared his lunch for him then for a week he came down to dinner after that he was compelled to take his lunch with him it depended on how far distant the teaming was done  youre not starting right with a man mary cautioned you wait on him hand and foot youll spoil him if you dont watch out its him that ought to be waitin on you  hes the breadwinner saxon replied he works harder than i and ive got more time than i know what to do withtime to burn besides i want to wait on him because i love to and because well anyway i want to    chapter ii  despite the fastidiousness of her housekeeping saxon once she had systematized it found time and to spare on her hands especially during the periods in which her husband carried his lunch and there was no midday meal to prepare she had a number of hours each day to herself trained for years to the routine of factory and laundry work she could not abide this unaccustomed idleness she could not bear to sit and do nothing while she could not pay calls on her girlhood friends for they still worked in factory and laundry nor was she acquainted with the wives of the neighborhood save for one strange old woman who lived in the house next door and with whom saxon had exchanged snatches of conversation over the backyard division fence  one timeconsuming diversion of which saxon took advantage was free and unlimited baths in the orphan asylum and in sarahs house she had been used to but one bath a week as she grew to womanhood she had attempted more frequent baths but the effort proved disastrous arousing first sarahs derision and next her wrath sarah had crystallized in the era of the weekly saturday night bath and any increase in this cleansing function was regarded by her as putting on airs and as an insinuation against her own cleanliness also it was an extravagant misuse of fuel and occasioned extra towels in the family wash but now in billys house with her own stove her own tub and towels and soap and no one to say her nay saxon was guilty of a daily orgy true it was only a common washtub that she placed on the kitchen floor and filled by hand but it was a luxury that had taken her twentyfour years to achieve it was from the strange woman next door that saxon received a hint dropped in casual conversation of what proved the culminating joy of bathing a simple thinga few drops of druggists ammonia in the water but saxon had never heard of it before  she was destined to learn much from the strange woman the acquaintance had begun one day when saxon in the back yard was hanging out a couple of corset covers and several pieces of her finest undergarments the woman leaning on the rail of her back porch had caught her eye and nodded as it seemed to saxon half to her and half to the underlinen on the line  youre newly married arent you the woman asked im mrs higgins i prefer my first name which is mercedes  and im mrs roberts saxon replied thrilling to the newness of the designation on her tongue my first name is saxon  strange name for a yankee woman the other commented  oh but im not yankee saxon exclaimed im californian  la la laughed mercedes higgins i forgot i was in america in other lands all americans are called yankees it is true that you are newly married  saxon nodded with a happy sigh mercedes sighed too  oh you happy soft beautiful young thing i could envy you to hatredyou with all the manworld ripe to be twisted about your pretty little fingers and you dont realize your fortune no one does until its too late  saxon was puzzled and disturbed though she answered readily  oh but i do know how lucky i am i have the finest man in the world  mercedes higgins sighed again and changed the subject she nodded her head at the garments  i see you like pretty things it is good judgment for a young woman theyre the bait for menhalf the weapons in the battle they win men and they hold men she broke off to demand almost fiercely and you you would keep your husbandalways alwaysif you can  i intend to i will make him love me always and always  saxon ceased troubled and surprised that she should be so intimate with a stranger  tis a queer thing this love of men mercedes said and a failing of all women is it to believe they know men like books and with breaking hearts die they do most women out of their ignorance of men and still foolishly believing they know all about them oh la la the little fools and so you say little newmarried woman that you will make your man love you always and always and so they all say it knowing men and the queerness of mens love the way they think they do easier it is to win the capital prize in the little louisiana but the little newmarried women never know it until too late but youyou have begun well stay by your pretties and your looks twas so you won your man tis so youll hold him but that is not all some time i will talk with you and tell what few women trouble to know what few women ever come to knowsaxontis a strong handsome name for a woman but you dont look it oh ive watched you french you are with a frenchiness beyond dispute tell mr roberts i congratulate him on his good taste  she paused her hand on the knob of her kitchen door  and come and see me some time you will never be sorry i can teach you much come in the afternoon my man is night watchman in the yards and sleeps of mornings hes sleeping now  saxon went into the house puzzling and pondering anything but ordinary was this lean darkskinned woman with the face withered as if scorched in great heats and the eyes large and black that flashed and flamed with advertisement of an unquenched inner conflagration old she wassaxon caught herself debating anywhere between fifty and seventy and her hair which had once been blackest black was streaked plentifully with gray especially noteworthy to saxon was her speech good english it was better than that to which saxon was accustomed yet the woman was not american on the other hand she had no perceptible accent rather were her words touched by a foreignness so elusive that saxon could not analyze nor place it  uh huh billy said when she had told him that evening of the days event so shes mrs higgins hes a watchman hes got only one arm old higgins an hera funny bunch the two of them the peoples scared of hersome of em the dagoes an some of the old irish dames thinks shes a witch wont have a thing to do with her bert was tellin me about it why saxon dye know some of em believe if she was to get mad at em or didnt like their mugs or anything that all shes got to do is look at em an theyll curl up their toes an croak one of the fellows that works at the stableyouve seen mhendersonhe lives around the corner on fifthhe says shes bughouse  oh i dont know saxon defended her new acquaintance she may be crazy but she says the same thing youre always saying she says my form is not american but french  then i take my hat off to her billy responded no wheels in her head if she says that take it from me shes a wise gazabo  and she speaks good english billy like a school teacher like what i guess my mother used to speak shes educated  she aint no fool or she wouldnt asized you up the way she did  she told me to congratulate you on your good taste in marrying me saxon laughed  she did eh then give her my love me for her because she knows a good thing when she sees it an she ought to be congratulating you on your good taste in me  it was on another day that mercedes higgins nodded half to saxon and half to the dainty womens things saxon was hanging on the line  ive been worrying over your washing little newwife was her greeting  oh but ive worked in the laundry for years saxon said quickly  mercedes sneered scornfully  steam laundry thats business and its stupid only common things should go to a steam laundry that is their punishment for being common but the pretties the dainties the flimsiesla la my dear their washing is an art it requires wisdom genius and discretion fine as the clothes are fine i will give you a recipe for homemade soap it will not harden the texture it will give whiteness and softness and life you can wear them long and fine white clothes are to be loved a long time oh fine washing is a refinement an art it is to be done as an artist paints a picture or writes a poem with love holily a true sacrament of beauty  i shall teach you better ways my dear better ways than you yankees know i shall teach you new pretties she nodded her head to saxons underlinen on the line i see you make little laces i know all lacesthe belgian the maltese the mechlinoh the many many loves of laces i shall teach you some of the simpler ones so that you can make them for yourself for your brave man you are to make love you always and always  on her first visit to mercedes higgins saxon received the recipe for homemade soap and her head was filled with a minutiae of instruction in the art of fine washing further she was fascinated and excited by all the newness and strangeness of the withered old woman who blew upon her the breath of wider lands and seas beyond the horizon  you are spanish saxon ventured  no and yes and neither and more my father was irish my mother peruvianspanish tis after her i took in color and looks in other ways after my father the blueeyed celt with the fairy song on his tongue and the restless feet that stole the rest of him away to farwandering and the feet of him that he lent me have led me away on as wide far roads as ever his led him  saxon remembered her school geography and with her minds eye she saw a certain outline map of a continent with jiggly wavering parallel lines that denoted coast  oh she cried then you are south american  mercedes shrugged her shoulders  i had to be born somewhere it was a great ranch my mothers you could put all oakland in one of its smallest pastures  mercedes higgins sighed cheerfully and for the time was lost in retrospection saxon was curious to hear more about this woman who must have lived much as the spanishcalifornians had lived in the old days  you received a good education she said tentatively your english is perfect  ah the english came afterward and not in school but as it goes yes a good education in all things but the most importantmen that too came afterward and little my mother dreamedshe was a grand lady what you call a cattlequeenlittle she dreamed my fine education was to fit me in the end for a night watchmans wife she laughed genuinely at the grotesqueness of the idea night watchman laborers why we had hundreds yes thousands that toiled for us the peonsthey are like what you call slaves almost and the cowboys who could ride two hundred miles between side and side of the ranch and in the big house servants beyond remembering or counting la la in my mothers house were many servants  mercedes higgins was voluble as a greek and wandered on in reminiscence  but our servants were lazy and dirty the chinese are the servants par excellence so are the japanese when you find a good one but not so good as the chinese the japanese maidservants are pretty and merry but you never know the moment theyll leave you the hindoos are not strong but very obedient they look upon sahibs and memsahibs as gods i was a memsahibwhich means woman i once had a russian cook who always spat in the soup for luck it was very funny but we put up with it it was the custom  how you must have traveled to have such strange servants saxon encouraged  the old woman laughed corroboration  and the strangest of all down in the south seas black slaves little kinkyhaired cannibals with bones through their noses when they did not mind or when they stole they were tied up to a cocoanut palm behind the compound and lashed with whips of rhinoceros hide they were from an island of cannibals and headhunters and they never cried out it was their pride there was little vibi only twelve years oldhe waited on meand when his back was cut in shreds and i wept over him he would only laugh and say short time little bit i take m head belong big fella white marster that was bruce anstey the englishman who whipped him but little vibi never got the head he ran away and the bushmen cut off his own head and ate every bit of him  saxon chilled and her face was grave but mercedes higgins rattled on  ah those were wild gay savage days would you believe it my dear in three years those englishmen of the plantation drank up oceans of champagne and scotch whisky and dropped thirty thousand pounds on the adventure not dollarspounds which means one hundred and fifty thousand dollars they were princes while it lasted it was splendid glorious it was mad mad i sold half my beautiful jewels in new zealand before i got started again bruce anstey blew out his brains at the end roger went mate on a trader with a black crew for eight pounds a month and jack gilbraithhe was the rarest of them all his people were wealthy and titled and he went home to england and sold cats meat sat around their big house till they gave him more money to start a rubber plantation in the east indies somewhere on sumatra i thinkor was it new guinea  and saxon back in her own kitchen and preparing supper for billy wondered what lusts and rapacities had led the old burntfaced woman from the big peruvian ranch through all the world to west oakland and barry higgins old barry was not the sort who would fling away his share of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars much less ever attain to such opulence besides she had mentioned the names of other men but not his  much more mercedes had talked in snatches and fragments there seemed no great country nor city of the old world or the new in which she had not been she had even been in klondike ten years before in a halfdozen flashing sentences picturing the furclad bemoccasined miners sowing the barroom floors with thousands of dollars worth of gold dust always so it seemed to saxon mrs higgins had been with men to whom money was as water    chapter iii  saxon brooding over her problem of retaining billys love of never staling the freshness of their feeling for each other and of never descending from the heights which at present they were treading felt herself impelled toward mrs higgins she knew surely she must know had she not hinted knowledge beyond ordinary womens knowledge  several weeks went by during which saxon was often with her but mrs higgins talked of all other matters taught saxon the making of certain simple laces and instructed her in the arts of washing and of marketing and then one afternoon saxon found mrs higgins more voluble than usual with words cleanuttered that rippled and tripped in their haste to escape her eyes were flaming so flamed her face her words were flames there was a smell of liquor in the air and saxon knew that the old woman had been drinking nervous and frightened at the same time fascinated saxon hemstitched a linen handkerchief intended for billy and listened to mercedes wild flow of speech  listen my dear i shall tell you about the world of men do not be stupid like all your people who think me foolish and a witch with the evil eye ha ha when i think of silly maggie donahue pulling the shawl across her babys face when we pass each other on the sidewalk a witch i have been tis true but my witchery was with men oh i am wise very wise my dear i shall tell you of womens ways with men and of mens ways with women the best of them and the worst of them of the brute that is in all men of the queerness of them that breaks the hearts of stupid women who do not understand and all women are stupid i am not stupid la la listen  i am an old woman and like a woman ill not tell you how old i am yet can i hold men yet would i hold men toothless and a hundred my nose touching my chin not the young men they were mine in my young days but the old men as befits my years and well for me the power is mine in all this world i am without kin or cash only have i wisdom and memoriesmemories that are ashes but royal ashes jeweled ashes old women such as i starve and shiver or accept the paupers dole and the paupers shroud not i i hold my man true tis only barry higginsold barry heavy an ox but a male man my dear and queer as all men are queer tis true he has one arm she shrugged her shoulders a compensation he cannot beat me and old bones are tender when the round flesh thins to strings  but when i think of my wild young lovers princes mad with the madness of youth i have lived it is enough i regret nothing and with old barry i have my surety of a bite to eat and a place by the fire and why because i know men and shall never lose my cunning to hold them tis bitter sweet the knowledge of them more sweet than bittermen and men and men not stupid dolts nor fat bourgeois swine of business men but men of temperament of flame and fire madmen maybe but a lawless royal race of madmen  little wifewoman you must learn variety there lies the magic tis the golden key tis the toy that amuses without it in the wife the man is a turk with it he is her slave and faithful a wife must be many wives if you would have your husbands love you must be all women to him you must be ever new with the dew of newness ever sparkling a flower that never blooms to the fulness that fades you must be a garden of flowers ever new ever fresh ever different and in your garden the man must never pluck the last of your posies  listen little wifewoman in the garden of love is a snake it is the commonplace stamp on its head or it will destroy the garden remember the name commonplace never be too intimate men only seem gross women are more gross than menno do not argue little newwife you are an infant woman women are less delicate than men do i not know of their own husbands they will relate the most intimate lovesecrets to other women men never do this of their wives explain it there is only one way in all things of love women are less delicate it is their mistake it is the father and the mother of the commonplace and it is the commonplace like a loathsome slug that beslimes and destroys love  be delicate little wifewoman never be without your veil without many veils veil yourself in a thousand veils all shimmering and glittering with costly textures and precious jewels never let the last veil be drawn against the morrow array yourself with more veils ever more veils veils without end yet the many veils must not seem many each veil must seem the only one between you and your hungry lover who will have nothing less than all of you each time he must seem to get all to tear aside the last veil that hides you he must think so it must not be so then there will be no satiety for on the morrow he will find another last veil that has escaped him  remember each veil must seem the last and only one always you must seem to abandon all to his arms always you must reserve more that on the morrow and on all the morrows you may abandon of such is variety surprise so that your mans pursuit will be everlasting so that his eyes will look to you for newness and not to other women it was the freshness and the newness of your beauty and you the mystery of you that won your man when a man has plucked and smelled all the sweetness of a flower he looks for other flowers it is his queerness you must ever remain a flower almost plucked yet never plucked stored with vats of sweet unbroached though ever broached  stupid women and all are stupid think the first winning of the man the final victory then they settle down and grow fat and state and dead and heartbroken alas they are so stupid but you little infantwoman with your first victory you must make your lovelife an unending chain of victories each day you must win your man again and when you have won the last victory when you can find no more to win then ends love finis is written and your man wanders in strange gardens remember love must be kept insatiable it must have an appetite knifeedged and never satisfied you must feed your lover well ah very well most well give give yet send him away hungry to come back to you for more  mrs higgins stood up suddenly and crossed out of the room saxon had not failed to note the litheness and grace in that lean and withered body she watched for mrs higgins return and knew that the litheness and grace had not been imagined  scarcely have i told you the first letter in loves alphabet said mercedes higgins as she reseated herself  in her hands was a tiny instrument beautifully grained and richly brown which resembled a guitar save that it bore four strings she swept them back and forth with rhythmic forefinger and lifted a voice thin and mellow in a fashion of melody that was strange and in a foreign tongue warmvoweled allvoweled and loveexciting softly throbbing voice and strings arose on sensuous crests of song died away to whisperings and caresses drifted through lovedusks and twilights or swelled again to lovecries barbarically imperious in which were woven plaintive calls and madnesses of invitation and promise it went through saxon until she was as this instrument swept with passional strains it seemed to her a dream and almost was she dizzy when mercedes higgins ceased  if your man had clasped the last of you and if all of you were known to him as an old story yet did you sing that one song as i have sung it yet would his arms again go out to you and his eyes grow warm with the old mad lights do you see do you understand little wifewoman  saxon could only nod her lips too dry for speech  the golden koa the king of woods mercedes was crooning over the instrument the ukulelethat is what the hawaiians call it which means my dear the jumping flea they are goldenfleshed the hawalians a race of lovers all in the warm cool of the tropic night where the trade winds blow  again she struck the strings she sang in another language which saxon deemed must be french it was a gaylydevilish lilt tripping and tickling her large eyes at times grew larger and wilder and again narrowed in enticement and wickedness when she ended she looked to saxon for a verdict  i dont like that one so well saxon said  mercedes shrugged her shoulders  they all have their worth little infantwoman with so much to learn there are times when men may be won with wine there are times when men may be won with the wine of song so queer they are la la so many ways so many ways there are your pretties my dear your dainties they are magic nets no fisherman upon the sea ever tangled fish more successfully than we women with our flimsies you are on the right path i have seen men enmeshed by a corset cover no prettier no daintier than these of yours i have seen on the line  i have called the washing of fine linen an art but it is not for itself alone the greatest of the arts is the conquering of men love is the sum of all the arts as it is the reason for their existence listen in all times and ages have been women great wise women they did not need to be beautiful greater then all womans beauty was their wisdom princes end potentates bowed down before them nations battled over them empires crashed because of them religions were founded on them aphrodite astarte the worships of the nightlisten infantwoman of the great women who conquered worlds of men  and thereafter saxon listened in a maze to what almost seemed a wild farrago save that the strange meaningless phrases were fraught with dim mysterious significance she caught glimmerings of profounds inexpressible and unthinkable that hinted connotations lawless and terrible the womans speech was a lava rush scorching and searing and saxons cheeks and forehead and neck burned with a blush that continuously increased she trembled with fear suffered qualms of nausea thought sometimes that she would faint so madly reeled her brain yet she could not tear herself away sad sat on and on her sewing forgotten on her lap staring with inward sight upon a nightmare vision beyond all imagining at last when it seemed she could endure no more and while she was wetting her dry lips to cry out in protest mercedes ceased  and here endeth the first lesson she said quite calmly then laughed with a laughter that was tantalizing and tormenting what is the matter you are not shocked  i am frightened saxon quavered huskily with a halfsob of nervousness you frighten me i am very foolish and i know so little that i had never dreamed that  mercedes nodded her head comprehendingly  it is indeed to be frightened at she said it is solemn it is terrible it is magnificent    chapter iv  saxon had been cleareyed all her days though her field of vision had been restricted cleareyed from her childhood days with the saloonkeeper cady and cadys goodnatured but unmoral spouse she had observed and later generalized much upon sex she knew the postnuptial problem of retaining a husbands love as few wives of any class knew it just as she knew the prenuptial problem of selecting a husband as few girls of the working class knew it  she had of herself developed an eminently rational philosophy of love instinctively and consciously too she had made toward delicacy and shunned the perils of the habitual and commonplace thoroughly aware she was that as she cheapened herself so did she cheapen love never in the weeks of their married life had billy found her dowdy or harshly irritable or lethargic and she had deliberately permeated her house with her personal atmosphere of coolness and freshness and equableness nor had she been ignorant of such assets as surprise and charm her imagination had not been asleep and she had been born with wisdom in billy she had won a prize and she knew it she appreciated his lovers ardor and was proud his openhanded liberality his desire for everything of the best his own personal cleanliness and care of himself she recognized as far beyond the average he was never coarse he met delicacy with delicacy though it was obvious to her that the initiative in all such matters lay with her and must lie with her always he was largely unconscious of what he did and why but she knew in all full clarity of judgment and he was such a prize among men  despite her clear sight of her problem of keeping billy a lover and despite the considerable knowledge and experience arrayed before her mental vision mercedes higgins had spread before her a vastly wider panorama the old woman had verified her own conclusions given her new ideas clinched old ones and even savagely emphasized the tragic importance of the whole problem much saxon remembered of that mad preachment much she guessed and felt and much had been beyond her experience and understanding but the metaphors of the veils and the flowers and the rules of giving to abandonment with always more to abandon she grasped thoroughly and she was enabled to formulate a bigger and stronger lovephilosophy in the light of the revelation she reexamined the married lives of all she had ever known and with sharp definiteness as never before she saw where and why so many of them had failed  with renewed ardor saxon devoted herself to her household to her pretties and to her charms she marketed with a keener desire for the best though never ignoring the need for economy from the womens pages of the sunday supplements and from the womens magazines in the free reading room two blocks away she gleaned many ideas for the preservation of her looks in a systematic way she exercised the various parts of her body and a certain period of time each day she employed in facial exercises and massage for the purpose of retaining the roundness and freshness and firmness and color billy did not know these intimacies of the toilette were not for him the results only were his she drew books from the carnegie library and studied physiology and hygiene and learned a myriad of things about herself and the ways of womans health that she had never been taught by sarah the women of the orphan asylum nor by mrs cady  after long debate she subscribed to a womans magazine the patterns and lessons of which she decided were the best suited to her taste and purse the other womans magazines she had access to in the free reading room and more than one pattern of lace and embroidery she copied by means of tracing paper before the lingerie windows of the uptown shops she often stood and studied nor was she above taking advantage when small purchases were made of looking over the goods at the handembroidered underwear counters once she even considered taking up with handpainted china but gave over the idea when she learned its expensiveness  she slowly replaced all her simple maiden underlinen with garments which while still simple were wrought with beautiful french embroidery tucks and drawnwork she crocheted fine edgings on the inexpensive knitted underwear she wore in winter she made little corset covers and chemises of fine but fairly inexpensive lawns and with simple flowered designs and perfect laundering her nightgowns were always sweetly fresh and dainty in some publication she ran across a brief printed note to the effect that french women were just beginning to wear fascinating beruffled caps at the breakfast table it meant nothing to her that in her case she must first prepare the breakfast promptly appeared in the house a yard of dotted swiss muslin and saxon was deep in experimenting on patterns for herself and in sorting her bits of laces for suitable trimmings the resultant dainty creation won mercedes higgins enthusiastic approval  saxon made for herself simple house slips of pretty gingham with neat low collars turned back from her fresh round throat she crocheted yards of laces for her underwear and made battenberg in abundance for her table and for the bureau a great achievement that aroused billys applause was an afghan for the bed she even ventured a rag carpet which the womens magazines informed her had newly returned into fashion as a matter of course she hemstitched the best table linen and bed linen they could afford  as the happy months went by she was never idle nor was billy forgotten when the cold weather came on she knitted him wristlets which he always religiously wore from the house and pocketed immediately thereafter the two sweaters she made for him however received a better fate as did the slippers which she insisted on his slipping into on the evenings they remained at home  the hard practical wisdom of mercedes higgins proved of immense help for saxon strove with a fervor almost religious to have everything of the best and at the same time to be saving here she faced the financial and economic problem of keeping house in a society where the cost of living rose faster than the wages of industry and here the old woman taught her the science of marketing so thoroughly that she made a dollar of billys go half as far again as the wives of the neighborhood made the dollars of their men go  invariably on saturday night billy poured his total wages into her lap he never asked for an accounting of what she did with it though he continually reiterated that he had never fed so well in his life and always the wages still untouched in her lap she had him take out what he estimated he would need for spending money for the week to come not only did she bid him take plenty but she insisted on his taking any amount extra that he might desire at any time through the week and further she insisted he should not tell her what it was for  youve always had money in your pocket she reminded him and theres no reason marriage should change that if it did id wish id never married you oh i know about men when they get together first one treats and then another and it takes money now if you cant treat just as freely as the rest of them why i know you so well that i know youd stay away from them and that wouldnt be right to you i mean i want you to be together with men its good for a man  and billy buried her in his arms and swore she was the greatest little bit of woman that ever came down the pike  why he jubilated not only do i feed better and live more comfortable and hold up my end with the fellows but im actually saving moneyor you are for me here i am with furniture being paid for regular every month and a little woman im mad over and on top of it money in the bank how much is it now  sixtytwo dollars she told him not so bad for a rainy day you might get sick or hurt or something happen  it was in midwinter when billy with quite a deal of obvious reluctance broached a money matter to saxon his old friend billy murphy was laid up with la grippe and one of his children playing in the street had been seriously injured by a passing wagon billy murphy still feeble after two weeks in bed had asked billy for the loan of fifty dollars  its perfectly safe billy concluded to saxon ive known him since we was kids at the durant school together hes straight as a die  thats got nothing to do with it saxon chided if you were single youd have lent it to him immediately wouldnt you  billy nodded  then its no different because youre married its your money billy  not by a damn sight he cried it aint mine its ourn and i wouldnt think of lettin anybody have it without seein you first  i hope you didnt tell him that she said with quick concern  nope billy laughed i knew if i did youd be maddern a hatter i just told him id try an figure it out after all i was sure youd stand for it if you had it  oh billy she murmured her voice rich and low with love maybe you dont know it but thats one of the sweetest things youve said since we got married  the more saxon saw of mercedes higgins the less did she understand her that the old woman was a closefisted miser saxon soon learned and this trait she found hard to reconcile with her tales of squandering on the other hand saxon was bewildered by mercedes extravagance in personal matters her underlinen handmade of course was very costly the table she set for barry was good but the table for herself was vastly better yet both tables were set on the same table while barry contented himself with solid round steak mercedes ate tenderloin a huge tough muttonchop on barrys plate would be balanced by tiny french chops on mercedes plate tea was brewed in separate pots so was coffee while barry gulped twentyfive cent tea from a large and heavy mug mercedes sipped threedollar tea from a tiny cup of belleek rosetinted fragile as all eggshell in the same manner his twentyfive cent coffee was diluted with milk her eighty cent turkish with cream  tis good enough for the old man she told saxon he knows no better and it would be a wicked sin to waste it on him  little traffickings began between the two women after mercedes had freely taught saxon the loosewristed facility of playing accompaniments on the ukulele she proposed an exchange her time was past she said for such frivolities and she offered the instrument for the breakfast cap of which saxon had made so good a success  its worth a few dollars mercedes said it cost me twenty though that was years ago yet it is well worth the value of the cap  but wouldnt the cap be frivolous too saxon queried though herself well pleased with the bargain  tis not for my graying hair mercedes frankly disclaimed i shall sell it for the money much that i do when the rheumatism is not maddening my fingers i sell la la my dear tis not old barrys fifty a month thatll satisfy all my expensive tastes tis i that make up the difference and old age needs money as never youth needs it some day you will learn for yourself  i am well satisfied with the trade saxon said and i shall make me another cap when i can lay aside enough for the material  make several mercedes advised ill sell them for you keeping of course a small commission for my services i can give you six dollars apiece for them we will consult about them the profit will more than provide material for your own    chapter v  four eventful things happened in the course of the winter bert and mary got married and rented a cottage in the neighborhood three blocks away billys wages were cut along with the wages of all the teamsters in oakland billy took up shaving with a safety razor and finally saxon was proven a false prophet and sarah a true one  saxon made up her mind beyond any doubt ere she confided the news to billy at first while still suspecting she had felt a frightened sinking of the heart and fear of the unknown and unexperienced then had come economic fear as she contemplated the increased expense entailed but by the time she had made surety doubly sure all was swept away before a wave of passionate gladness hers and billys the phrase was continually in her mind and each recurrent thought of it brought an actual physical pleasurepang to her heart  the night she told the news to billy he withheld his own news of the wagecut and joined with her in welcoming the little one  whatll we do go to the theater to celebrate he asked relaxing the pressure of his embrace so that she might speak or suppose we stay in just you and me and and the three of us  stay in was her verdict i just want you to hold me and hold me and hold me  thats what i wanted too only i wasnt sure after bein in the house all day maybe youd want to go out  there was frost in the air and billy brought the morris chair in by the kitchen stove she lay cuddled in his arms her head on his shoulder his cheek against her hair  we didnt make no mistake in our lightning marriage with only a weeks courtin he reflected aloud why saxon weve been courtin ever since just the same and now my god saxon its too wonderful to be true think of it ourn the three of us the little rascal i bet hes goin to be a boy an wont i learn m to put up his fists an take care of himself an swimmin too if he dont know how to swim by the time hes six  and if hes a girl  shes goin to be a boy billy retorted joining in the playful misuse of pronouns  and both laughed and kissed and sighed with content im goin to turn pincher now he announced after quite an interval of meditation no more drinks with the boys its me for the water wagon and im goin to ease down on smokes huh dont see why i cant roll my own cigarettes theyre ten times cheapern tailormades an i can grow a beard the amount of money the barbers get out of a fellow in a year would keep a baby  just you let your beard grow mister roberts and ill get a divorce saxon threatened youre just too handsome and strong with a smooth face i love your face too much to have it covered upoh you dear you dear billy i never knew what happiness was until i came to live with you  nor me neither  and its always going to be so  you can just bet he assured her  i thought i was going to be happy married she went on but i never dreamed it would be like this she turned her head on his shoulder and kissed his cheek billy it isnt happiness its heaven  and billy resolutely kept undivulged the cut in wages not until two weeks later when it went into effect and he poured the diminished sum into her lap did he break it to her the next day bert and mary already a month married had sunday dinner with them and the matter came up for discussion bert was particularly pessimistic and muttered dark hints of an impending strike in the railroad shops  if youd all shut your traps itd be all right mary criticized these union agitators get the railroad sore they give me the cramp the way they butt in an stir up trouble if i was boss id cut the wages of any man that listened to them  yet you belonged to the laundry workers union saxon rebuked gently  because i had to or i wouldnt agot work an much good it ever done me  but look at billy bert argued the teamsters aint ben sayin a word not a peep an everything lovely and then bang right in the neck a ten per cent cut oh hell what chance have we got we lose theres nothin left for us in this country weve made and our fathers an mothers before us were all shot to pieces we can see our finishwe the old stock the children of the white people that broke away from england an licked the tar outa her that freed the slaves an fought the indians an made the west any gink with half an eye can see it comin  but what are we going to do about it saxon questioned anxiously  fight thats all the countrys in the hands of a gang of robbers look at the southern pacific it runs california  aw rats bert billy interrupted youre takin through your lid no railroad can ran the government of california  youre a bonehead bert sneered and some day when its too late you an all the other boneheadsll realize the fact rotten i tell you it stinks why there aint a man who wants to go to state legislature but has to make a trip to san francisco an go into the s p offices an take his hat off an humbly ask permission why the governors of california has been railroad governors since before you and i was born huh you cant tell me were finished were licked to a frazzle but itd do my heart good to help string up some of the dirty thieves before i passed out dye know what we arewe old white stock that fought in the wars an broke the land an made all this ill tell you were the last of the mohegans  he scares me to death hes so violent mary said with unconcealed hostility if he dont quit shootin off his mouth hell get fired from the shops and then whatll we do he dont consider me but i can tell you one thing all right all right ill not go back to the laundry she held her right hand up and spoke with the solemnity of an oath not sos you can see it never again for yours truly  oh i know what youre drivin at bert said with asperity an all i can tell you is livin or dead in a job or out no matter what happens to me if you will lead that way you will an theres nothin else to it  i guess i kept straight before i met you she came back with a toss of the head and i kept straight after i met you which is going some if anybody should ask you  hot words were on berts tongue but saxon intervened and brought about peace she was concerned over the outcome of their marriage both were highstrung both were quick and irritable and their continual clashes did not augur well for their future  the safety razor was a great achievement for saxon privily she conferred with a clerk she knew in pierces hardware store and made the purchase on sunday morning after breakfast when billy was starting to go to the barber shop she led him into the bedroom whisked a towel aside and revealed the razor box shaving mug soap brush and lather all ready billy recoiled then came back to make curious investigation he gazed pityingly at the safety razor  huh call that a mans tool  itll do the work she said it does it for thousands of men every day  but billy shook his head and backed away  you shave three times a week she urged thats fortyfive cents call it half a dollar and there are fiftytwo weeks in the year twentysix dollars a year just for shaving come on dear and try it lots of men swear by it  he shook his head mutinously and the cloudy deeps of his eyes grew more cloudy she loved that sullen handsomeness that made him look so boyish and laughing and kissing him she forced him into a chair got off his coat and unbuttoned shirt and undershirt and turned them in  threatening him with if you open your mouth to kick ill shove it in she coated his face with lather  wait a minute she checked him as he reached desperately for the razor ive been watching the barbers from the sidewalk this is what they do after the lather is on  and thereupon she proceeded to rub the lather in with her fingers  there she said when she had coated his face a second time youre ready to begin only remember im not always going to do this for you im just breaking you in you see  with great outward show of rebellion half genuine half facetious he made several tentative scrapes with the razor he winced violently and violently exclaimed  holy jumping jehosaphat  he examined his face in the glass and a streak of blood showed in the midst of the lather  cutby a safety razor by god sure men swear by it cant blame em cut by a safety  but wait a second saxon pleaded they have to be regulated the clerk told me see those little screws there thats it turn them around  again billy applied the blade to his face after a couple of scrapes he looked at himself closely in the mirror grinned and went on shaving with swiftness and dexterity he scraped his face clean of lather saxon clapped her hands  fine billy approved great here give me your hand see what a good job it made  he started to rub her hand against his cheek saxon jerked away with a little cry of disappointment then examined him closely  it hasnt shaved at all she said  its a fake thats what it is it cuts the hide but not the hair me for the barber  but saxon was persistent  you havent given it a fair trial yet it was regulated too much let me try my hand at it there thats it betwixt and between now lather again and try it  this time the unmistakable sandpapery sound of hairsevering could be heard  how is it she fluttered anxiously  it gets theouchhair billy grunted frowning and making faces but itgeesayouchpulls like sam hill  stay with it she encouraged dont give up the ship big injun with a scalplock remember what bert says and be the last of the mohegans  at the end of fifteen minutes he rinsed his face and dried it sighing with relief  its a shave in a fashion saxon but i cant say im stuck on it it takes out the nerve im as weak as a cat  he groaned with sudden discovery of fresh misfortune  whats the matter now she asked  the back of my neckhow can i shave the back of my neck ill have to pay a barber to do it  saxons consternation was tragic but it only lasted a moment she took the brush in her hand  sit down billy  whatyou he demanded indignantly  yes me if any barber is good enough to shave your neck and then i am too  billy moaned and groaned in the abjectness of humility and surrender and let her have her way  there and a good job she informed him when she had finished as easy as falling off a log and besides it means twentysix dollars a year and youll buy the crib the baby buggy the pinning blankets and lots and lots of things with it now sit still a minute longer  she rinsed and dried the back of his neck and dusted it with talcum powder  youre as sweet as a clean little baby billy boy  the unexpected and lingering impact of her lips on the back of his neck made him writhe with mingled feelings not all unpleasant  two days later though vowing in the intervening time to have nothing further to do with the instrument of the devil he permitted saxon to assist him to a second shave this time it went easier  it aint so bad he admitted im gettin the hang of it its all in the regulating you can shave as close as you want an no more close than you want barbers cant do that every once an awhile they get my face sore  the third shave was an unqualified success and the culminating bliss was reached when saxon presented him with a bottle of witch hazel after that he began active proselyting he could not wait a visit from bert but carried the paraphernalia to the latters house to demonstrate  weve ben boobs all these years bert runnin the chances of barbers itch an everything look at this eh see her take hold smooth as silk just as easy there six minutes by the clock can you beat it when i get my hand in i can do it in three it works in the dark it works under water you couldnt cut yourself if you tried and it saves twentysix dollars a year saxon figured it out and shes a wonder i tell you    chapter vi  the trafficking between saxon and mercedes increased the latter commanded a ready market for all the fine work saxon could supply while saxon was eager and happy in the work the expected babe and the cut in billys wages had caused her to regard the economic phase of existence more seriously than ever too little money was being laid away in the bank and her conscience pricked her as she considered how much she was laying out on the pretty necessaries for the household and herself also for the first time in her life she was spending anothers earnings since a young girl she had been used to spending her own and now thanks to mercedes she was doing it again and out of her profits assaying more expensive and delightful adventures in lingerie  mercedes suggested and saxon carried out and even bettered the dainty things of thread and texture she made ruffled chemises of sheer linen with her own fine edgings and french embroidery on breast and shoulders linen handmade combination undersuits and nightgowns fairy and cobwebby embroidered trimmed with irish lace on mercedes instigation she executed an ambitious and wonderful breakfast cap for which the old woman returned her twelve dollars after deducting commission  she was happy and busy every waking moment nor was preparation for the little one neglected the only ready made garments she bought were three fine little knit shirts as for the rest every bit was made by her own handsfeatherstitched pinning blankets a crocheted jacket and cap knitted mittens embroidered bonnets slim little princess slips of sensible length underskirts on absurd lilliputian yokes silkembroidered white flannel petticoats stockings and crocheted boots seeming to burgeon before her eyes with wriggly pink toes and plump little calves and last but not least many deliciously soft squares of birdseye linen a little later as a crowning masterpiece she was guilty of a dress coat of white silk embroidered and into all the tiny garments with every stitch she sewed love yet this love so unceasingly sewn she knew when she came to consider and marvel was more of billy than of the nebulous ungraspable new bit of life that eluded her fondest attempts at visioning  huh was billys comment as he went over the mites wardrobe and came back to center on the little knit shirts they look more like a real kid than the whole kit an caboodle why i can see him in them regular manshirts  saxon with a sudden rush of happy unshed tears held one of the little shirts up to his lips he kissed it solemnly his eyes resting on saxons  thats some for the boy he said but a whole lot for you  but saxons moneyearning was doomed to cease ignominiously and tragically one day to take advantage of a department store bargain sale she crossed the bay to san francisco passing along sutter street her eye was attracted by a display in the small window of a small shop at first she could not believe it yet there in the honored place of the window was the wonderful breakfast cap for which she had received twelve dollars from mercedes it was marked twentyeight dollars saxon went in and interviewed the shopkeeper an emaciated shrewdeyed and middleaged woman of foreign extraction  oh i dont want to buy anything saxon said i make nice things like you have here and i wanted to know what you pay for themfor that breakfast cap in the window for instance  the woman darted a keen glance to saxons left hand noted the innumerable tiny punctures in the ends of the first and second fingers then appraised her clothing and her face  can you do work like that  saxon nodded  i paid twenty dollars to the woman that made that saxon repressed an almost spasmodic gasp and thought coolly for a space mercedes had given her twelve then mercedes had pocketed eight while she saxon had furnished the material and labor  would you please show me other handmade things nightgowns chemises and such things and tell me the prices you pay  can you do such work  yes  and will you sell to me  certainly saxon answered that is why i am here  we add only a small amount when we sell the woman went on you see light and rent and such things as well as a profit or else we could not be here  its only fair saxon agreed  amongst the beautiful stuff saxon went over she found a nightgown and a combination undersuit of her own manufacture for the former she had received eight dollars from mercedes it was marked eighteen and the woman had paid fourteen for the latter saxon received six it was marked fifteen and the woman had paid eleven  thank you saxon said as she drew on her gloves i should like to bring you some of my work at those prices  and i shall be glad to buy it if it is up to the mark the woman looked at her severely mind you it must be as good as this and if it is i often get special orders and ill give you a chance at them  mercedes was unblushingly candid when saxon reproached her  you told me you took only a commission was saxons accusation  so i did and so i have  but i did all the work and bought all the materials yet you actually cleared more out of it than i did you got the lions share  and why shouldnt i my dear i was the middleman its the way of the world tis the middlemen that get the lions share  it seems to me most unfair saxon reflected more in sadness than anger  that is your quarrel with the world not with me mercedes rejoined sharply then immediately softened with one of her quick changes we mustnt quarrel my dear i like you so much la la it is nothing to you who are young and strong with a man young and strong listen i am an old woman and old barry can do little for me he is on his last legs his kidneys are most gone remember tis i must bury him and i do him honor for beside me hell have his last long steep a stupid dull old man heavy an ox tis true but a good old fool with no trace of evil in him the plot is bought and paid forthe final installment was made up in part out of my commissions from you then there are the funeral expenses it must be done nicely i have still much to save and barry may turn up his toes any day  saxon sniffed the air carefully and knew the old woman had been drinking again  come my dear let me show you leading saxon to a large sea chest in the bedroom mercedes lifted the lid a faint perfume as of rosepetals floated up behold my burial trousseau thus i shall wed the dust  saxons amazement increased as article by article the old woman displayed the airiest the daintiest the most delicious and most complete of bridal outfits mercedes held up an ivory fan  in venice twas given me my dearsee this comb turtle shell bruce anstey made it for me the week before he drank his last bottle and scattered his brave mad brains with a colts 44this scarf la la a liberty scarf  and all that will be buried with you saxon mused oh the extravagance of it  mercedes laughed  why not i shall die as i have lived it is my pleasure i go to the dust as a bride no cold and narrow bed for me i would it were a coach covered with the soft things of the east and pillows pillows without end  it would buy you twenty funerals and twenty plots saxon protested shocked by this blasphemy of conventional death it is downright wicked  twill be as i have lived mercedes said complacently and its a fine bride old barryll have to come and lie beside him she closed the lid and sighed though i wish it were bruce anstey or any of the pick of my young men to lie with me in the great dark and to crumble with me to the dust that is the real death  she gazed at saxon with eyes heated by alcohol and at the same time cool with the coolness of content  in the old days the great of earth were buried with their live slaves with them i but take my flimsies my dear  then you arent afraid of death in the least  mercedes shook her head emphatically  death is brave and good and kind i do not fear death tis of men i am afraid when i am dead so i prepare they shall not have me when i am dead  saxon was puzzled  they would not want you then she said  many are wanted was the answer do you know what becomes of the aged poor who have no money for burial they are not buried let me tell you we stood before great doors he was a queer man a professor who ought to have been a pirate a man who lectured in class rooms when he ought to have been storming walled cities or robbing banks he was slender like don juan his hands were strong as steel so was his spirit and he was mad a bit mad as all my young men have been come mercedes he said we will inspect our brethren and become humble and glad that we are not as theyas yet not yet and afterward tonight we will dine with a more devilish taste and we will drink to them in golden wine that will be the more golden for having seen them come mercedes  he thrust the great doors open and by the hand led me in it was a sad company twentyfour that lay on marble slabs or sat half erect and propped while many young men bright of eye bright little knives in their hands glanced curiously at me from their work  they were dead saxon interrupted to gasp  they were the pauper dead my dear come mercedes said he there is more to show you that will make us glad we are alive and he took me down down to the vats the salt vats my dear i was not afraid but it was in my mind then as i looked how it would be with me when i was dead and there they were so many lumps of pork and the order came a woman an old woman and the man who worked there fished in the vats the first was a man he drew to see again he fished and stirred again a man he was impatient and grumbled at his luck and then up through the brine he drew a woman and by the face of her she was old and he was satisfied  it is not true saxon cried out  i have seen my dear i know and i tell you fear not the wrath of god when you are dead fear only the salt vats and as i stood and looked and as he who led me there looked at me and smiled and questioned and bedeviled me with those mad black tiredscholars eyes of his i knew that that was no way for my dear clay dear it is my clay to me dear it has been to others la la the salt vat is no place for my kissed lips and lovelavished body mercedes lifted the lid of the chest and gazed fondly at her burial pretties so i have made my bed so i shall lie in it some old philosopher said we know we must die we do not believe it but the old do believe i believe  my dear remember the salt vats and do not be angry with me because my commissions have been heavy to escape the vats i would stop at nothing steal the widows mite the orphans crust and pennies from a dead mans eyes  do you believe in god saxon asked abruptly holding herself together despite cold horror  mercedes dropped the lid and shrugged her shoulders  who knows i shall rest well  and punishment saxon probed remembering the unthinkable tale of the others life  impossible my dear as some old poet said gods a good fellow some time i shall talk to you about god never be afraid of him be afraid only of the salt vats and the things men may do with your pretty flesh after you are dead    chapter vii  billy quarreled with good fortune he suspected he was too prosperous on the wages he received what with the accumulating savings account the paying of the monthly furniture installment and the house rent the spending money in pocket and the good fare he was eating he was puzzled as to how saxon managed to pay for the goods used in her fancy work several times he had suggested his inability to see how she did it and been baffled each time by saxons mysterious laugh  i cant see how you do it on the money he was contending one evening  he opened his mouth to speak further then closed it and for five minutes thought with knitted brows  say he said whats become of that frilly breakfast cap you was workin on so hard i aint never seen you wear it and it was sure too big for the kid  saxon hesitated with pursed lips and teasing eyes with her untruthfulness had always been a difficult matter to billy it was impossible she could see the clouddrift in his eyes deepening and his face hardening in the way she knew so well when he was vexed  say saxon you aint you aint sellin your work  and thereat she related everything not omitting mercedes higgins part in the transaction nor mercedes higgins remarkable burial trousseau but billy was not to be led aside by the latter in terms anything but uncertain he told saxon that she was not to work for money  but i have so much spare time billy dear she pleaded  he shook his head  nothing doing i wont listen to it i married you and ill take care of you nobody can say bill roberts wife has to work and i dont want to think it myself besides it aint necessary  but billy she began again  nope thats one thing i wont stand for saxon not that i dont like fancy work i do i like it like hell every bit you make but i like it on you go ahead and make all you want of it for yourself an ill put up for the goods why im just whistlin an happy all day long thinkin of the boy an seein you at home here workin away on all them nice things because i know how happy you are adoin it but honest to god saxon itd all be spoiled if i knew you was doin it to sell you see bill roberts wife dont have to work thats my bragto myself mind you an besides it aint right  youre a dear she whispered happy despite her disappointment  i want you to have all you want he continued an youre goin to get it as long as i got two hands stickin on the ends of my arms i guess i know how good the things are you weargood to me i mean too im dry behind the ears an maybe ive learned a few things i oughtnt to before i knew you but i know what im talkin about and i want to say that outside the clothes down underneath an the clothes down underneath the outside ones i never saw a woman like you oh  he threw up his hands as if despairing of ability to express what he thought and felt then essayed a further attempt  its not a matter of bein only clean though thats a whole lot lots of women are clean it aint that its something more an different its well its the look of it so white an pretty an tasty it gets on the imagination its something i cant get out of my thoughts of you i want to tell you lots of men cant strip to advantage an lots of women too but youwell youre a wonder thats all and you cant get too many of them nice things to suit me and you cant get them too nice  for that matter saxon you can just blow yourself theres lots of easy money layin around im in great condition billy murphy pulled down seventyfive round iron dollars only last week for puttin away the pride of north beach thats what ha paid us the fifty back out of  but this time it was saxon who rebelled  theres carl hansen billy argued the second sharkey the alfalfa sportin writers are callin him an he calls himself champion of the united states navy well i got his number hes just a big stiff ive seen m fight an i can pass him the sleep medicine just as easy the secretary of the sportin life club offered to match me an a hundred iron dollars in it for the winner and itll all be yours to blow in any way you want what dye say  if i cant work for money you cant fight was saxons ultimatum immediately withdrawn but you and i dont drive bargains even if youd let me work for money i wouldnt let you fight ive never forgotten what you told me about how prizefighters lose their silk well youre not going to lose yours its half my silk you know and if you wont fight i wont workthere and more ill never do anything you dont want me to billy  same here billy agreed though just the same id like most to death to have just one go at that squarehead hansen he smiled with pleasure at the thought say lets forget it all now an you sing me harvest days on that dinky whatyoumaycallit  when she had complied accompanying herself on the ukulele she suggested his weird cowboys lament in some inexplicable way of love she had come to like her husbands one song because he sang it she liked its inanity and monotonousness and most of all it seemed to her she loved his hopeless and adorable flatting of every note she could even sing with him flatting as accurately and deliciously as he nor did she undeceive him in his sublime faith  i guess bert an the rest have joshed me all the time he said  you and i get along together with it fine she equivocated for in such matters she did not deem the untruth a wrong  spring was on when the strike came in the railroad shops the sunday before it was called saxon and billy had dinner at berts house saxons brother came though he had found it impossible to bring sarah who refused to budge from her household rut bert was blackly pessimistic and they found him singing with sardonic glee  nobody loves a milyunaire nobody likes his looks nobodyll share his slightest care he classes with thugs and crooks thriftiness has become a crime so spend everything you earn were living now in a funny time when money is made to burn  mary went about the dinner preparation flaunting unmistakable signals of rebellion and saxon rolling up her sleeves and tying on an apron washed the breakfast dishes bert fetched a pitcher of steaming beer from the corner saloon and the three men smoked and talked about the coming strike  it oughta come years ago was berts dictum it cant come any too quick now to suit me but its too late were beaten thumbs donn heres where the last of the mohegans gets theirs in the neck kerwhop  oh i dont know tom who had been smoking his pipe gravely began to counsel organized labors gettin stronger every day why i can remember when there wasnt any unions in california look at us nowwages an hours an everything  you talk like an organizer bert sneered shovin the bull con on the boneheads but we know different organized wages wont buy as much now as unorganized wages used to buy theyve got us whipsawed look at frisco the labor leaders doin

right tom concurred nobodys denyin it the trouble is labor aint quite got its eyes open it ought to play politics but the politics ought to be the right kind  socialism eh bert caught him up with scorn wouldnt they sell us out just as the ruefs and schmidts have  get men that are honest billy said thats the whole trouble not that i stand for socialism i dont all our folks was a long time in america an i for one wont stand for a lot of fat germans an greasy russian jews tellin me how to run my country when they cant speak english yet  your country bert cried why you bonehead you aint got a country thats a fairy story the grafters shove at you every time they want to rob you some more  but dont vote for the grafters billy contended if we selected honest men wed get honest treatment  i wish youd come to some of our meetings billy tom said wistfully if you would youd get your eyes open an vote the socialist ticket next election  not on your life billy declined when you catch me in a socialist meetingll be when they can talk like white men  bert was humming  were living now in a funny time when money is made to burn  mary was too angry with her husband because of the impending strike and his incendiary utterances to hold conversation with saxon and the latter bepuzzled listened to the conflicting opinions of the men  where are we at she asked them with a merriness that concealed her anxiety at heart  we aint at bert snarled were gone  but meat and oil have gone up again she chafed and billys wages have been cut and the shop mens were cut last year something must be done  the only thing to do is fight like hell bert answered fight an go down fightin thats all were licked anyhow but we can have a last run for our money  thats no way to talk tom rebuked  the time for talkin s past old cock the time for fightin s come  a hell of a chance youd have against regular troops and machine guns billy retorted  oh not that way theres such things as greasy sticks that go up with a loud noise and leave holes theres such things as emery powder  oh ho mary burst out upon him arms akimbo so thats what it means thats what the emery in your vest pocket meant  her husband ignored her tom smoked with a troubled air billy was hurt it showed plainly in his face  you aint ben doin that bert he asked his manner showing his expectancy of his friends denial  sure thing if you wont to know id seem all in hell if i could before i go  hes a bloodyminded anarchist mary complained men like him killed mckinley and garfield anan an all the rest hell be hung youll see mark my words im glad theres no children in sight thats all  its hot air billy comforted her  hes just teasing you saxon soothed he always was a josher  but mary shook her head  i know i hear him talkin in his sleep he swears and curses something awful an grits his teeth listen to him now  bert his handsome face bitter and devilmaycare had tilted his chair back against the wall and was singing  nobody loves a milyunaire nobody likes his looks nobodyll share his slightest care he classes with thugs and crooks  tom was saying something about reasonableness and justice and bert ceased from singing to catch him up  justice eh another pipedream ill show you where the working class gets justice you remember forbesj alliston forbeswrecked the alta california trust company an salted down two cold

and kissed her with the sympathy that women alone feel for each other under the shadow of maternity  now you sit down dear you mustnt tire yourself and its a long way to go yet ill get your sewing for you and you can listen to the men talk but dont listen to bert hes crazy  saxon sewed and listened and berts face grew bleak and bitter as he contemplated the baby clothes in her lap  there you go he blurted out bringin kids into the world when you aint got any guarantee you can feed em  you must ahad a souse last night tom grinned  bert shook his head  aw whats the use of gettin grouched billy cheered its a pretty good country  it was a pretty good country bert replied when we was all mohegans but not now were jiggerooed were hornswoggled were backed to a standstill were doublecrossed to a fareyouwell my folks fought for this country so did yourn all of you we freed the niggers killed the indians an starved an froze an sweat an fought this land looked good to us we cleared it an broke it an made the roads an built the cities and there was plenty for everybody and we went on fightin for it i had two uncles killed at gettysburg all of us was mixed up in that war listen to saxon talk any time what her folks went through to get out here an get ranches an horses an cattle an everything and they got em all our folks got em marys too  and if theyd ben smart theyd aheld on to them she interpolated  sure thing bert continued thats the very point were the losers weve ben robbed we couldnt mark cards deal from the bottom an ring in cold decks like the others were the white folks that failed you see times changed and there was two kinds of us the lions and the plugs the plugs only worked the lions only gobbled they gobbled the farms the mines the factories an now theyve gobbled the government were the white folks an the children of white folks that was too busy being good to be smart were the white folks that lost out were the ones thats ben skinned dye get me  youd make a good soapboxer tom commended if only youd get the kinks straightened out in your reasoning  it sounds all right bert billy said only it aint any man can get rich today  or be president of the united states bert snapped sure thingif hes got it in him just the same i aint heard you makin a noise like a millionaire or a president why you aint got it in you youre a bonehead a plug thats why skiddoo for you skiddoo for all of us  at the table while they ate tom talked of the joys of farmlife he had known as a boy and as a young man and confided that it was his dream to go and take up government land somewhere as his people had done before him unfortunately as he explained sarah was set so that the dream must remain a dream  its all in the game billy sighed its played to rules some one has to get knocked out i suppose  a little later while bert was off on a fresh diatribe billy became aware that he was making comparisons this house was not like his house here was no satisfying atmosphere things seemed to run with a jar he recollected that when they arrived the breakfast dishes had not yet been washed with a mans general obliviousness of household affairs he had not noted details yet it had been borne in on him all morning in a myriad ways that mary was not the housekeeper saxon was he glanced proudly across at her and felt the spur of an impulse to leave his seat go around and embrace her she was a wife he remembered her dainty undergarmenting and on the instant into his brain leaped the image of her so appareled only to be shattered by bert  hey bill you seem to think ive got a grouch sure thing i have you aint had my experiences youve always done teamin an pulled down easy money prizefightin you aint known hard times you aint ben through strikes you aint had to take care of an old mother an swallow dirt on her account it wasnt until after she died that i could rip loose an take or leave as i felt like it  take that time i tackled the niles electric an see what a workplug gets handed out to him the head cheese sizes me up pumps me a lot of questions an gives me an application blank i make it out payin a dollar to a doctor they sent me to for a health certificate then i got to go to a picture garage an get my mug taken for the niles electric rogues gallery and i cough up another dollar for the mug the head squirt takes the blank the health certificate and the mug an fires more questions did i belong to a labor unionme of course i toldm the truth i guess nit i needed the job the grocery wouldnt give me any more tick and there was my mother  huh thinks i heres where im a real carman back platform for me where i can pick up the fancy skirts nitsky two dollars please memy two dollars all for a pewter badge then there was the uniformnineteen fifty and get it anywhere else for fifteen only that was to be paid out of my first month and then five dollars in change in my pocket my own money that was the rulei borrowed that five from tom donovan the policeman then what they worked me for two weeks without pay breakin me in  did you pick up any fancy skirts saxon queried teasingly  bert shook his head glumly  i only worked a month then we organized and they busted our union highern a kite  and you boobs in the shops will be busted the same way if you go out on strike mary informed him  thats what ive ben tellin you all along bert replied we aint got a chance to win  then why go out was saxons question  he looked at her with lackluster eyes for a moment then answered  why did my two uncles get killed at gettysburg    chapter viii  saxon went about her housework greatly troubled she no longer devoted herself to the making of pretties the materials cost money and she did not dare berts thrust had sunk home it remained in her quivering consciousness like a shaft of steel that ever turned and rankled she and billy were responsible for this coming young life could they be sure after all that they could adequately feed and clothe it and prepare it for its way in the world where was the guaranty she remembered dimly the blight of hard times in the past and the plaints of fathers and mothers in those days returned to her with a new significance almost could she understand sarahs chronic complaining  hard times were already in the neighborhood where lived the families of the shopmen who had gone out on strike among the small storekeepers saxon in the course of the daily marketing could sense the air of despondency light and geniality seemed to have vanished gloom pervaded everywhere the mothers of the children that played in the streets showed the gloom plainly in their faces when they gossiped in the evenings over front gates and on door stoops their voices were subdued and less of laughter rang out  mary donahue who had taken three pints from the milkman now took one pint there were no more family trips to the moving picture shows scrapmeat was harder to get from the butcher nora delaney in the third house no longer bought fresh fish for friday salted codfish not of the best quality was now on her table the sturdy children that ran out upon the street between meals with huge slices of bread and butter and sugar now came out with no sugar and with thinner slices spread more thinly with butter the very custom was dying out and some children already had desisted from piecing between meals  everywhere was manifest a pinching and scraping a tightning and shortening down of expenditure and everywhere was more irritation women became angered with one another and with the children more quickly than of yore and saxon knew that bert and mary bickered incessantly  if shed only realize ive got troubles of my own bert complained to saxon  she looked at him closely and felt fear for him in a vague numb way his black eyes seemed to burn with a continuous madness the brown face was leaner the skin drawn tightly across the cheekbones a slight twist had come to the mouth which seemed frozen into bitterness the very carriage of his body and the way he wore his hat advertised a recklessness more intense than had been his in the past  sometimes in the long afternoons sitting by the window with idle hands she caught herself reconstructing in her vision that folkmigration of her people across the plains and mountains and deserts to the sunset land by the western sea and often she found herself dreaming of the arcadian days of her people when they had not lived in cities nor been vexed with labor unions and employers associations she would remember the old peoples tales of selfsufficingness when they shot or raised their own meat grew their own vegetables were their own blacksmiths and carpenters made their own shoesyes and spun the cloth of the clothes they wore and something of the wistfulness in toms face she could see as she recollected it when he talked of his dream of taking up government land  a farmers life must be fine she thought why was it that people had to live in cities why had times changed if there had been enough in the old days why was there not enough now why was it necessary for men to quarrel and jangle and strike and fight all about the matter of getting work why wasnt there work for allonly that morning and she shuddered with the recollection she had seen two scabs on their way to work beaten up by the strikers by men she knew by sight and some by name who lived in the neighhorhood it had happened directly across the street it had been cruel terriblea dozen men on two the children had begun it by throwing rocks at the scabs and cursing them in ways children should not know policemen had run upon the scene with drawn revolvers and the strikers had retreated into the houses and through the narrow alleys between the houses one of the scabs unconscious had been carried away in an ambulance the other assisted by special railroad police had been taken away to the shops at him mary donahue standing on her front stoop her child in her arms had hurled such vile abuse that it had brought the blush of shame to saxons cheeks on the stoop of the house on the other side saxon had noted mercedes in the height of the beating up looking on with a queer smile she had seemed very eager to witness her nostrils dilated and swelling like the beat of pulses as she watched it had struck saxon at the time that the old woman was quite unalarmed and only curious to see  to mercedes who was so wise in love saxon went for explanation of what was the matter with the world but the old womans wisdom in affairs industrial and economic was cryptic and unpalatable  la la my dear it is so simple most men are born stupid they are the slaves a few are born clever they are the masters god made men so i suppose  then how about god and that terrible beating across the street this morning  im afraid he was not interested mercedes smiled i doubt he even knows that it happened  i was frightened to death saxon declared i was made sick by it and yet youi saw youyou looked on as cool as you please as if it was a show  it was a show my dear  oh how could you  la la i have seen men killed it is nothing strange all men die the stupid ones die like oxen they know not why it is quite funny to see they strike each other with fists and clubs and break each others heads it is gross they are like a lot of animals they are like dogs wrangling over bones jobs are bones you know now if they fought for women or ideas or bars of gold or fabulous diamonds it would be splendid but no they are only hungry and fight over scraps for their stomach  oh if i could only understand saxon murmured her hands tightly clasped in anguish of incomprehension and vital need to know  there is nothing to understand it is clear as print there have always been the stupid and the clever the slave and the master the peasant and the prince there always will be  but why  why is a peasant a peasant my dear because he is a peasant why is a flea a flea  saxon tossed her head fretfully  oh but my dear i have answered the philosophies of the world can give no better answer why do you like your man for a husband rather than any other man because you like him that way that is all why do you like because you like why does fire burn and frost bite why are there clever men and stupid men masters and slaves employers and workingmen why is black black answer that and you answer everything  but it is not right that men should go hungry and without work when they want to work if only they can get a square deal saxon protested  oh but it is right just as it is right that stone wont burn like wood that sea sand isnt sugar that thorns prick that water is wet that smoke rises that things fall down and not up  but such doctrine of reality made no impression on saxon frankly she could not comprehend it seemed like so much nonsense  then we have no liberty and independence she cried passionately one man is not as good as another my child has not the right to live that a rich mothers child has  certainly not mercedes answered  yet all my people fought for these things saxon urged remembering her school history and the sword of her father  democracythe dream of the stupid peoples oh la la my dear democracy is a lie an enchantment to keep the work brutes content just as religion used to keep them content when they groaned in their misery and toil they were persuaded to keep on in their misery and toil by pretty tales of a land beyond the skies where they would live famously and fat while the clever ones roasted in everlasting fire ah how the clever ones must have chuckled and when that lie wore out and democracy was dreamed the clever ones saw to it that it should be in truth a dream nothing but a dream the world belongs to the great and clever  but you are of the working people saxon charged  the old woman drew herself up and almost was angry  i of the working people my dear because i had misfortune with moneys invested because i am old and can no longer win the brave young men because i have outlived the men of my youth and there is no one to go to because i live here in the ghetto with barry higgins and prepare to diewhy my dear i was born with the masters and have trod all my days on the necks of the stupid i have drunk rare wines and sat at feasts that would have supported this neighborhood for a lifetime dick golden and iit was dickies money but i could have had it dick golden and i dropped four hundred thousand francs in a weeks play at monte carlo he was a jew but he was a spender in india i have worn jewels that could have saved the lives of ten thousand families dying before my eyes  you saw them die and did nothing saxon asked aghast  i kept my jewelsla la and was robbed of them by a brute of a russian officer within the year  and you let them die saxon reiterated  they were cheap spawn they fester and multiply like maggots they meant nothingnothing my dear nothing no more than your work people mean here whose crowning stupidity is their continuing to beget more stupid spawn for the slavery of the masters  so it was that while saxon could get little glimmering of common sense from others from the terrible old woman she got none at all nor could saxon bring herself to believe much of what she considered mercedes romancing as the weeks passed the strike in the railroad shops grew bitter and deadly billy shook his head and confessed his inability to make head or tail of the troubles that were looming on the labor horizon  i dont get the hang of it he told saxon its a mixup its like a roughhouse with the lights out look at us teamsters here we are the talk just starting of going out on sympathetic strike for the millworkers theyve ben out a week most of their places is filled an if us teamsters keep on haulin the millwork the strikes lost  yet you didnt consider striking for yourselves when your wages were cut saxon said with a frown  oh we wasnt in position then but now the frisco teamsters and the whole frisco water front confederation is liable to back us up anyway were just talkin about it thats all but if we do go out well try to get back that ten per cent cut  its rotten politics he said another time everybodys rotten if wed only wise up and agree to pick out honest men  but if you and bert and tom cant agree how do you expect all the rest to agree saxon asked  it gets me he admitted its enough to give a guy the willies thinkin about it and yet its plain as the nose on your face get honest men for politics an the whole things straightened out honest mend make honest laws an then honest mend get their dues but bert wants to smash things an tom smokes his pipe and dreams pipe dreams about by an by when everybody votes the way he thinks but this by an by aint the point we want things now tom says we cant get them now an bert says we aint never goin to get them what can a fellow do when everybodys of different minds look at the socialists themselves theyre always disagreeing splittin up an firin each other out of the party the whole things bughouse thats what an i almost get dippy myself thinkin about it the point i cant get out of my mind is that we want things now  he broke off abruptly and stared at saxon  what is it he asked his voice husky with anxiety you aint sick or or anything  one hand she had pressed to her heart but the startle and fright in her eyes was changing into a pleased intentness while on her mouth was a little mysterious smile she seemed oblivious to her husband as if listening to some message from afar and not for his ears then wonder and joy transfused her face and she looked at billy and her hand went out to his  its life she whispered i felt life i am so glad so glad  the next evening when billy came home from work saxon caused him to know and undertake more of the responsibilities of fatherhood  ive been thinking it over billy she began and im such a healthy strong woman that it wont have to be very expensive theres martha skeltonshes a good midwife  but billy shook his head  nothin doin in that line saxon youre goin to have doc hentley hes bill murphys doc an bill swears by him hes an old cuss but hes a wooz  she confined maggie donahue saxon argued and look at her and her baby  well she wont confine younot so as you can notice it  but the doctor will charge twenty dollars saxon pursued and make me get a nurse because i havent any womenfolk to come in but martha skelton would do everything and it would be so much cheaper  but billy gathered her tenderly in his arms and laid down the law  listen to me little wife the roberts family aint on the cheap never forget that youve gotta have the baby thats your business an its enough for you my business is to get the money an take care of you an the best aint none too good for you why i wouldnt run the chance of the teeniest accident happenin to you for a million dollars its you that counts an dollars is dirt maybe you think i like that kid some i do why i cant get him outa my head im thinkin aboutm all day long if i get fired itll be his fault im clean dotty over him but just the same saxon honest to god before id have anything happen to you break your little finger even id see him dead an buried first thatll give you something of an idea what you mean to me  why saxon i had the idea that when folks got married they just settled down and after a while their business was to get along with each other maybe its the way it is with other people but it aint that way with you an me i love you more n more every day right now i love you moren when i began talkin to you five minutes ago an you wont have to get a nurse doc hentleyll come every day an maryll come in an do the housework an take care of you an all that just as youll do for her if she ever needs it  as the days and weeks pussed saxon was possessed by a conscious feeling of proud motherhood in her swelling breasts so essentially a normal woman was she that motherhood was a satisfying and passionate happiness it was true that she had her moments of apprehension but they were so momentary and faint that they tended if anything to give zest to her happiness  only one thing troubled her and that was the puzzling and perilous situation of labor which no one seemed to understand her self least of all  theyre always talking about how much more is made by machinery than by the old ways she told her brother tom then with all the machinery weve got now why dont we get more  now youre talkin he answered it wouldnt take you long to understand socialism  but saxon had a mind to the immediate need of things  tom how long have you been a socialist  eight years  and you havent got anything by it  but we will in time  at that rate youll be dead first she challenged  tom sighed  im afraid so things move so slow  again he sighed she noted the weary patient look in his face the bent shoulders the laborgnarled hands and it all seemed to symbolize the futility of his social creed    chapter ix  it began quietly as the fateful unexpected so often begins children of all ages and sizes were playing in the street and saxon by the open front window was watching them and dreaming day dreams of her child soon to be the sunshine mellowed peacefully down and a light wind from the bay cooled the air and gave to it a tang of salt one of the children pointed up pine street toward seventh all the children ceased playing and stared and pointed they formed into groups the larger boys of from ten to twelve by themselves the older girls anxiously clutching the small children by the hands or gathering them into their arms  saxon could not see the cause of all this but she could guess when she saw the larger boys rush to the gutter pick up stones and sneak into the alleys between the houses smaller boys tried to imitate them the girls dragging the tots by the arms banged gates and clattered up the front steps of the small houses the doors slammed behind them and the street was deserted though here and there front shades were drawn aside so that anxiousfaced women might peer forth saxon heard the uptown train puffing and snorting as it pulled out from center street then from the direction of seventh came a hoarse throaty manroar still she could see nothing and she remembered mercedes higgins words they are like dogs wrangling over bones jobs are bones you know  the roar came closer and saxon leaning out saw a dozen scabs conveyed by as many special police and pinkertons coming down the sidewalk on her side of the street they came compactly as if with discipline while behind disorderly yelling confusedly stooping to pick up rocks were seventyfive or a hundred of the striking shopmen saxon discovered herself trembling with apprehension knew that she must not and controlled herself she was helped in this by the conduct of mercedes higgins the old woman came out of her front door dragging a chair on which she coolly seated herself on the tiny stoop at the top of the steps  in the hands of the special police were clubs the pinkertons carried no visible weapons the strikers urging on from behind seemed content with yelling their rage and threats and it remained for the children to precipitate the conflict from across the street between the olsen and the isham houses came a shower of stones most of these fell short though one struck a scab on the head the man was no more than twenty feet away from saxon he reeled toward her front picket fence drawing a revolver with one hand he brushed the blood from his eyes and with the other he discharged the revolver into the isham house a pinkerton seized his arm to prevent a second shot and dragged him along at the same instant a wilder roar went up from the strikers while a volley of stones came from between saxons house and maggie donahues the scabs and their protectors made a stand drawing revolvers from their hard determined facesfighting men by professionsaxon could augur nothing but bloodshed and death an elderly man evidently the leader lifted a soft felt hat and mopped the perspiration from the bald top of his head he was a large man very rotund of belly and helpless looking his gray beard was stained with streaks of tobacco juice and he was smoking a cigar he was stoopshouldered and saxon noted the dandruff on the collar of his coat  one of the men pointed into the street and several of his companions laughed the cause of it was the little olsen boy barely four years old escaped somehow from his mother and toddling toward his economic enemies in his right he bore a rock so heavy that he could scarcely lift it with this he feebly threatened them his rosy little face was convulsed with rage and he was screaming over and over dam scabs dam scabs dam scabs the laughter with which they greeted him only increased his fury he toddled closer and with a mighty exertion threw the rock it fell a scant six feet beyond his hand  this much saxon saw and also mrs olsen rushing into the street for her child a rattling of revolvershots from the strikers drew saxons attention to the men beneath her one of them cursed sharply and examined the biceps of his left arm which hung limply by his side down the hand she saw the blood beginning to drip she knew she ought not remain and watch but the memory of her fighting forefathers was with her while she possessed no more than normal human fearif anything less she forgot her child in the eruption of battle that had broken upon her quiet street and she forgot the strikers and everything else in amazement at what had happened to the roundbellied cigarsmoking leader in some strange way she knew not how his head had become wedged at the neck between the tops of the pickets of her fence his body hung down outside the knees not quite touching the ground his hat had fallen off and the sun was making an astounding high light on his bald spot the cigar too was gone she saw he was looking at her one hand between the pickets seemed waving at her and almost he seemed to wink at her jocosely though she knew it to be the contortion of deadly pain  possibly a second or at most two seconds she gazed at this when she was aroused by berts voice he was running along the sidewalk in front of her house and behind him charged several more strikers while he shouted come on you mohegans we got em nailed to the cross  in his left hand he carried a pickhandle in his right a revolver already empty for he clicked the cylinder vainly around as he ran with an abrupt stop dropping the pickhandle he whirled half about facing saxons gate he was sinking down when he straightened himself to throw the revolver into the face of a scab who was jumping toward him then he began swaying at the same time sagging at the knees and waist slowly with infinite effort he caught a gate picket in his right hand and still slowly as if lowering himself sank down while past him leaped the crowd of strikers he had led  it was battle without quartera massacre the scabs and their protectors surrounded backed against saxons fence fought like cornered rats but could not withstand the rush of a hundred men clubs and pickhandles were swinging revolvers were exploding and cobblestones were flung with crushing effect at arms distance saxon saw young frank davis a friend of berts and a father of several months standing press the muzzle of his revolver against a scabs stomach and fire there were curses and snarls of rage wild cries of terror and pain mercedes was right these things were not men they were beasts fighting over bones destroying one another for bones  jobs are bones jobs are bones the phrase was an incessant iteration in saxons brain much as she might have wished it she was powerless now to withdraw from the window it was as if she were paralyzed her brain no longer worked she sat numb staring incapable of anything save seeing the rapid horror before her eyes that flashed along like a moving picture film gone mad she saw pinkertons special police and strikers go down one scab terribly wounded on his knees and begging for mercy was kicked in the face as he sprawled backward another striker standing over him fired a revolver into his chest quickly and deliberately again and again until the weapon was empty another scab backed over the pickets by a hand clutching his throat had his face pulped by a revolver butt again and again continually the revolver rose and fell and saxon knew the man who wielded itchester johnson she had met him at dances and danced with him in the days before she was married he had always been kind and good natured she remembered the friday night after a city hall band concert when he had taken her and two other girls to tonys tamale grotto on thirteenth street and after that they had all gone to pabsts cafe and drunk a glass of beer before they went home it was impossible that this could be the same chester johnson and as she looked she saw the roundbellied leader still wedged by the neck between the pickets draw a revolver with his free hand and squinting horribly sidewise press the muzzle against chesters side she tried to scream a warning she did scream and chester looked up and saw her at that moment the revolver went off and he collapsed prone upon the body of the scab and the bodies of three men hung on her picket fence  anything could happen now quite without surprise she saw the strikers leaping the fence trampling her few little geraniums and pansies into the earth as they fled between mercedes house and hers up pine street from the railroad yards was coming a rush of railroad police and pinkertons firing as they ran while down pine street gongs clanging horses at a gallop came three patrol wagons packed with police the strikers were in a trap the only way out was between the houses and over the back yard fences the jam in the narrow alley prevented them all from escaping a dozen were cornered in the angle between the front of her house and the steps and as they had done so were they done by no effort was made to arrest they were clubbed down and shot down to the last man by the guardians of the peace who were infuriated by what had been wreaked on their brethren  it was all over and saxon moving as in a dream clutching the banister tightly came down the front steps the roundbellied leader still leered at her and fluttered one hand though two big policemen were just bending to extricate him the gate was off its hinges which seemed strange for she had been watching all the time and had not seen it happen  berts eyes were closed his lips were bloodflecked and there was a gurgling in his throat as if he were trying to say something as she stooped above him with her handkerchief brushing the blood from his cheek where some one had stepped on him his eyes opened the old defiant light was in them he did not know her the lips moved and faintly almost reminiscently he murmured the last of the mohegans the last of the mohegans then he groaned and the eyelids drooped down again he was not dead she knew that the chest still rose and fell and the gurgling still continued in his throat  she looked up mercedes stood beside her the old womans eyes were very bright her withered cheeks flushed  will you help me carry him into the house saxon asked  mercedes nodded turned to a sergeant of police and made the request to him the sergeant gave a swift glance at bert and his eyes were bitter and ferocious as he refused  to hell withm well care for our own  maybe you and i can do it saxon said  dont be a fool mercedes was beckoning to mrs olsen across the street you go into the house little mother that is to be this is bad for you well carry him in mrs olsen is coming and well get maggie donahue  saxon led the way into the back bedroom which billy had insisted on furnishing as she opened the door the carpet seemed to fly up into her face as with the force of a blow for she remembered bert had laid that carpet and as the women placed him on the bed she recalled that it was bert and she between them who had set the bed up one sunday morning  and then she felt very queer and was surprised to see mercedes regarding her with questioning searching eyes after that her queerness came on very fast and she descended into the hell of pain that is given to women alone to know she was supported halfcarried to the front bedroom many faces were about hermercedes mrs olsen maggie donahue it seemed she must ask mrs olsen if she had saved little emil from the street but mercedes cleared mrs olsen out to look after bert and maggie donahue went to answer a knock at the front door from the street came a loud hum of voices punctuated by shouts and commands and from time to time there was a clanging of the gongs of ambulances and patrol wagons then appeared the fat comfortable face of martha shelton and later dr hentley came once in a clear interval through the thin wall saxon heard the high opening notes of marys hysteria and another time she heard mary repeating over and over ill never go back to the laundry never never    chapter x  billy could never get over the shock during that period of saxons appearance morning after morning and evening after evening when he came home from work he would enter the room where she lay and fight a royal battle to hide his feelings and make a show of cheerfulness and geniality she looked so small lying there so small and shrunken and weary and yet so childlike in her smallness tenderly as he sat beside her he would take up her pale hand and stroke the slim transparent arm marveling at the smallness and delicacy of the bones  one of her first questions puzzling alike to billy and mary was  did they save little emil olsen  and when she told them how he had attacked singlehanded the whole twentyfour fighting men billys face glowed with appreciation  the little cuss he said thats the kind of a kid to be proud of  he halted awkwardly and his very evident fear that he had hurt her touched saxon she put her hand out to his  billy she began then waited till mary left the room  i never asked beforenot that it matters now but i waited for you to tell me was it  he shook his head  no it was a girl a perfect little girl only it was too soon  she pressed his hand and almost it was she that sympathized with him in his affliction  i never told you billyyou were so set on a boy but i planned just the same if it was a girl to call her daisy you remember that was my mothers name  he nodded his approbation  say saxon you know i did want a boy like the very dickens well i dont care now i think im set just as hard on a girl an well heres hopin the next will be called you wouldnt mind would you  what  if we called it the same name daisy  oh billy i was thinking the very same thing  then his face grew stern as he went on  only there aint goin to be a next i didnt know what havin children was like before you cant run any more risks like that  hear the big strong afraidman talk she jeered with a wan smile you dont know anything about it how can a man i am a healthy natural woman everything would have been all right this time if if all that fighting hadnt happened where did they bury bert  you knew  all the time and where is mercedes she hasnt been in for two days  old barrys sick shes with him  he did not tell her that the old night watchman was dying two thin walls and half a dozen feet away  saxons lips were trembling and she began to cry weakly clinging to billys hand with both of hers  ii cant help it she sobbed ill be all right in a minute our little girl billy think of it and i never saw her   she was still lying on her bed when one evening mary saw fit to break out in bitter thanksgiving that she had escaped and was destined to escape what saxon had gone through  aw what are you talkin about billy demanded youll get married some time again as sure as beans is beans  not to the best man living she proclaimed and there aint no call for it theres too many people in the world now else why are there two or three men for every job and besides havin children is too terrible  saxon with a look of patient wisdom in her face that became glorified as she spoke made answer  i ought to know what it means ive been through it and im still in the thick of it and i want to say to you right now out of all the pain and the ache and the sorrow that it is the most beautiful wonderful thing in the world   as saxons strength came back to her and when doctor hentley had privily assured billy that she was sound as a dollar she herself took up the matter of the industrial tragedy that had taken place before her door the militia had been called out immediately billy informed her and was encamped then at the foot of pine street on the waste ground next to the railroad yards as for the strikers fifteen of them were in jail a house to house search had been made in the neighborhood by the police and in this way nearly the whole fifteen all wounded had been captured it would go hard with them billy foreboded gloomily the newspapers were demanding blood for blood and all the ministers in oakland had preached fierce sermons against the strikers the railroad had filled every place and it was well known that the striking shopmen not only would never get their old jobs back but were blacklisted in every railroad in the united states already they were beginning to scatter a number had gone to panama and four were talking of going to ecuador to work in the shops of the railroad that ran over the andes to quito  with anxiety keenly concealed she tried to feel out billys opinion on what had happened  that shows what berts violent methods come to she said  he shook his head slowly and gravely  theyll hang chester johnson anyway he answered indirectly you know him you told me you used to dance with him he was caught redhanded lyin on the body of a scab he beat to death old jelly bellys got three bullet holes in him but he aint goin to die and hes got chesters number theyll hangm on jelly bellys evidence it was all in the papers jelly belly shot him too ahangin by the neck on our pickets  saxon shuddered jelly belly must be the man with the bald spot and the tobaccostained whiskers  yes she said i saw it all it seemed he must have hung there for hours  it was all over from first to last in five minutes  it seemed ages and ages  i guess thats the way it seemed to jelly belly stuck on the pickets billy smiled grimly but hes a hard one to kill hes been shot an cut up a dozen different times but they say now hell be crippled for lifehave to go around on crutches or in a wheelchair thatll stop him from doin any more dirty work for the railroad he was one of their top gunfightersalways up to his ears in the thick of any fightin that was goin on he never was leery of anything on two feet ill say that much form  where does he live saxon inquired  up on adeline near tenthfine neighborhood an fine twostoried house he must pay thirty dollars a month rent i guess the railroad paid him pretty well  then he must be married  yep i never seen his wife but hes got one son jack a passenger engineer i used to know him he was a nifty boxer though he never went into the ring an hes got another son thats teacher in the high school his names paul were about the same age he was great at baseball i knew him when we was kids he pitched me out three times handrunnin once when the durant played the cole school  saxon sat back in the morris chair resting and thinking the problem was growing more complicated than ever this elderly roundbellied and baldheaded gunfighter too had a wife and family and there was frank davis married barely a year and with a baby boy perhaps the scab he shot in the stomach had a wife and children all seemed to be acquainted members of a very large family and yet because of their particular families they battered and killed each other she had seen chester johnson kill a scab and now they were going to hang chester johnson who had married kittie brady out of the cannery and she and kittie brady had worked together years before in the paper box factory  vainly saxon waked for billy to say something that would show he did not countenance the killing of the scabs  it was wrong she ventured finally  they killed bert he countered an a lot of others an frank davis did you know he was dead had his whole lower jaw shot awaydied in the ambulance before they could get him to the receiving hospital there was never so much killin at one time in oakland before  but it was their fault she contended they began it it was murder  billy did not reply but she heard him mutter hoarsely she knew he said god damn them but when she asked what he made no answer his eyes were deep with troubled clouds while the mouth had hardened and all his face was bleak  to her it was a heartstab was he too like the rest would he kill other men who had families like bert and frank davis and chester johnson had killed was he too a wild beast a dog that would snarl over a bone  she sighed life was a strange puzzle perhaps mercedes higgins was right in her cruel statement of the terms of existence  what of it billy laughed harshly as if in answer to her unuttered questions its dog eat dog i guess and its always ben that way take that scrap outside there they killed each other just like the north an south did in the civil war  but workingmen cant win that way billy you say yourself that it spoiled their chance of winning  i suppose not he admitted reluctantly but what other chance theyve got to win i dont see look at us well be up against it next  not the teamsters she cried  he nodded gloomily  the bosses are cuttin loose all along the line for a high old time say theyre goin to beat us to our knees till we come crawlin back abeggin for our jobs theyve bucked up real high an mighty what of all that killin the other day havin the troops out is half the fight along with havin the preachers an the papers an the public behind em theyre shootin off their mouths already about what theyre goin to do theyre sure gunning for trouble first theyre goin to hang chester johnson an as many more of the fifteen as they can they say that flat the tribune an the enquirer an the times keep sayin it over an over every day theyre all unionhustin to beat the band no more closed shop to hell with organized labor why the dirty little intelligencer come out this morning an said that every union official in oakland ought to be run outa town or stretched up fine eh you bet its fine  look at us it aint a case any more of sympathetic strike for the millworkers we got our own troubles theyve fired our four best menthe ones that was always on the conference committees did it without cause theyre lookin for trouble as i told you an theyll get it too if they dont watch out we got our tip from the frisco water front confederation with them backin us well go some  you mean youll strike saxon asked  he bent his head  but isnt that what they want you to dofrom the way theyre acting  whats the difference billy shrugged his shoulders then continued its better to strike than to get fired we beat em to it thats all an we catch em before theyre ready dont we know what theyre doin theyre collectin gradincamp drivers an muleskinners all up an down the state they got forty of em feedin em in a hotel in stockton right now an ready to rush em in on us an hundreds more like em so this saturdays the last wages ill likely bring home for some time  saxon closed her eyes and thought quietly for five minutes it was not her way to take things excitedly the coolness of poise that billy so admired never deserted her in time of emergency she realized that she herself was no more than a mote caught up in this tangled nonunderstandable conflict of many motes  well have to draw from our savings to pay for this months rent she said brightly  billys face fell  we aint got as much in the bank as you think he confessed bert had to be buried you know an i coughed up what the others couldnt raise  how much was it  forty dollars i was goin to stand off the butcher an the rest for a while they knew i was good pay but they put it to me straight theyd been carryin the shopmen right along an was up against it themselves an now with that strike smashed theyre pretty much smashed themselves so i took it all out of the bank i knew you wouldnt mind you dont do you  she smiled bravely and bravely overcame the sinking feeling at her heart  it was the only right thing to do billy i would have done it if you were lying sick and bert would have done it for you an me if it had been the other way around  his face was glowing  gee saxon a fellow can always count on you youre like my right hand thats why i say no more babies if i lose you im crippled for life  weve got to economize she mused nodding her appreciation how much is in bank  just about thirty dollars you see i had to pay martha skelton an for the a few other little things an the union took time by the neck and levied a four dollar emergency assessment on every member just to be ready if the strike was pulled off but doc hentley can wait he said as much hes the goods if anybody should ask you howd you likem  i liked him but i dont know about doctors hes the first i ever hadexcept when i was vaccinated once and then the city did that  looks like the street car men are goin out too dan fallons come to town came all the way from new york tried to sneak in on the quiet but the fellows knew when he left new york an kept track of him all the way acrost they have to hes johnnyonthespot whenever street car men are licked into shape hes won lots of street car strikes for the bosses keeps an army of strike breakers an ships them all over the country on special trains wherever theyre needed oaklands never seen labor troubles like shes got and is goin to get all hells goin to break loose from the looks of it  watch out for yourself then billy i dont want to lose you either  aw thats all right i can take care of myself an besides it aint as though we was licked we got a good chance  but youll lose if there is any killing  yep we gotta keep an eye out against that  no violence  no gunfighting or dynamite he assented but a heap of scabsll get their heads broke that has to be  but you wont do any of that billy  not so as any slob can testify before a court to havin seen me then with a quick shift he changed the subject old barry higgins is dead i didnt want to tell you till you was outa bed buriedm a week ago an the old womans movin to frisco she told me shed be in to say goodbye she stuck by you pretty well them first couple of days an she showed martha shelton a few that made her hair curl she got marthas goat from the jump    chapter xi  with billy on strike and away doing picket duty and with the departure of mercedes and the death of bert saxon was left much to herself in a loneliness that even in one as healthyminded as she could not fail to produce morbidness mary too had left having spoken vaguely of taking a job at housework in piedmont  billy could help saxon little in her trouble he dimly sansed her suffering without comprehending the scope and intensity of it he was too manpractical and by his very sex too remote from the intimate tragedy that was hers he was an outsider at the best a friendly onlooker who saw little to her the baby had been quick and real it was still quick and real that was her trouble by no deliberate effort of will could she fill the aching void of its absence its reality became at times an hallucination somewhere it still was and she must find it she would catch herself on occasion listening with strained ears for the cry she had never heard yet which in fancy she had heard a thousand times in the happy months before the end twice she left her bed in her sleep and went searchingeach time coming to herself beside her mothers chest of drawers in which were the tiny garments to herself at such moments she would say i had a baby once and she would say it aloud as she watched the children playing in the street  one day on the eighth street cars a young mother sat beside her a crowing infant in her arms and saxon said to her  i had a baby once it died  the mother looked at her startled halfdrew the baby tighter in her arms jealously or as if in fear then she softened as she said  you poor thing  yes saxon nodded it died  tears welled into her eyes and the telling of her grief seemed to have brought relief but all the day she suffered from an almost overwhelming desire to recite her sorrow to the worldto the paying teller at the bank to the elderly floorwalker in salingers to the blind woman guided by a little boy who played on the concertinato every one save the policeman the police were new and terrible creatures to her now she had seen them kill the strikers as mercilessly as the strikers had killed the scabs and unlike the strikers the police were professional killers they were not fighting for jobs they did it as a business they could have taken prisoners that day in the angle of her front steps and the house but they had not unconsciously whenever approaching one she edged across the sidewalk so as to get as far as possible away from him she did not reason it out but deeper than consciousness was the feeling that they were typical of something inimical to her and hers  at eighth and broadway waiting for her car to return home the policeman on the corner recognized her and greeted her she turned white to the lips and her heart fluttered painfully it was only ned hermanmann fatter bronderfaced jollier looking than ever he had sat across the aisle from her for three terms at school he and she had been monitors together of the composition books for one term the day the powder works blew up at pinole breaking every window in the school he and she had not joined in the panic rush for outofdoors both had remained in the room and the irate principal had exhibited them from room to room to the cowardly classes and then rewarded them with a months holiday from school and after that ned hermanmann had become a policeman and married lena highland and saxon had heard they had five children  but in spite of all that he was now a policeman and billy was now a striker might not ned hermanmann some day club and shoot billy just as those other policemen clubbed and shot the strikers by her front steps  whats the matter saxon he asked sick  she nodded and choked unable to speak and started to move toward her car which was coming to a stop  ill help you he offered  she shrank away from his hand  no im all right she gasped hurriedly im not going to take it ive forgotten something  she turned away dizzily up broadway to ninth two blocks along ninth she turned down clay and back to eighth street where she waited for another car   as the summer months dragged along the industrial situation in oakland grew steadily worse capital everywhere seemed to have selected this city for the battle with organized labor so many men in oakland were out on strike or were locked out or were unable to work because of the dependence of their trades on the other tiedup trades that odd jobs at common labor were hard to obtain billy occasionally got a days work to do but did not earn enough to make both ends meet despite the small strike wages received at first and despite the rigid economy he and saxon practiced  the table she set had scarcely anything in common with that of their first married year not alone was every item of cheaper quality but many items had disappeared meat and the poorest was very seldom on the table cows milk had given place to condensed milk and even the sparing use of the latter had ceased a roll of butter when they had it lasted half a dozen times as long as formerly where billy had been used to drinking three cups of coffee for breakfast he now drank one saxon boiled this coffee an atrocious length of time and she paid twenty cents a pound for it  the blight of hard times was on all the neighborhood the families not involved in one strike were touched by some other strike or by the cessation of work in some dependent trade many single young men who were lodgers had drifted away thus increasing the house rent of the families which had sheltered them  gott said the butcher to saxon we working class all suffer together my wife she cannot get her teeth fixed now pretty soon i go smash broke maybe  once when billy was preparing to pawn his watch saxon suggested his borrowing the money from billy murphy  i was plannin that billy answered only i cant now i didnt tell you what happened tuesday night at the sporting life club you remember that squarehead champion of the united states navy bill was matched with him an it was sure easy money bill had m goin south by the end of the sixth round an at the seventh went in to finish m and thenjust his luck for his trades idle nowhe snaps his right forearm of course the squarehead comes back at m on the jump an its good night for bill gee us mohegans are gettin our bad luck handed to us in chunks these days  dont saxon cried shuddering involuntarily  what billy asked with open mouth of surprise  dont say that word again bert was always saying it  oh mohegans all right i wont you aint superstitions are you  no but just the same theres too much truth in the word for me to like it sometimes it seems as though he was right times have changed theyve changed even since i was a little girl we crossed the plains and opened up this country and now were losing even the chance to work for a living in it and its not my fault its not your fault weve got to live well or bad just by luck it seems theres no other way to explain it  it beats me billy concurred look at the way i worked last year never missed a day id want to never miss a day this year an here i havent done a tap for weeks an weeks an weeks say who runs this country anyway  saxon had stopped the morning paper but frequently maggie donahues boy who served a tribune route tossed an extra on her steps from its editorials saxon gleaned that organized labor was trying to run the country and that it was making a mess of it it was all the fault of domineering laborso ran the editorials column by column day by day and saxon was convinced yet remained unconvinced the social puzzle of living was too intricate  the teamsters strike backed financially by the teamsters of san francisco and by the allied unions of the san francisco water front confederation promised to be longdrawn whether or not it was successful the oakland harnesswashers and stablemen with few exceptions had gone out with the teamsters the teaming firms were not halffilling their contracts but the employers association was helping them in fact half the employers associations of the pacific coast were helping the oakland employers association  saxon was behind a months rent which when it is considered that rent was paid in advance was equivalent to two months likewise she was two months behind in the installments on the furniture yet she was not pressed very hard by salingers the furniture dealers  were givin you all the rope we can said their collector my orders is to make you dig up every cent i can and at the same time not to be too hard salingers are trying to do the right thing but theyre up against it too youve no idea how many accounts like yours theyre carrying along sooner or later theyll have to call a halt or get it in the neck themselves and in the meantime just see if you cant scrape up five dollars by next weekjust to cheer them along you know  one of the stablemen who had not gone out henderson by name worked at billys stables despite the urging of the bosses to eat and sleep in the stable like the other men henderson had persisted in coming home each morning to his little house around the corner from saxons on fifth street several times she had seen him swinging along defiantly his dinner pail in his hand while the neighborhood boys dogged his heels at a safe distance and informed him in yapping chorus that he was a scab and no good but one evening on his way to work in a spirit of bravado he went into the piledrivers home the saloon at seventh and pine there it was his mortal mischance to encounter otto frank a striker who drove from the same stable not many minutes later an ambulance was hurrying henderson to the receiving hospital with a fractured skull while a patrol wagon was no less swiftly carrying otto frank to the city prison  maggie donahue it was eyes shining with gladness who told saxon of the happening  served him right too the dirty scab maggie concluded  but his poor wife was saxons cry shes not strong and then the children shell never be able to take care of them if her husband dies  an serve her right the damned slut  saxon was both shocked and hurt by the irishwomans brutality but maggie was implacable  tis all she or any woman deserves thatll put up an live with a scab what about her children letm starve an her man atakin the food out of other childrens mouths  mrs olsens attitude was different beyond passive sentimental pity for hendersons wife and children she gave them no thought her chief concern being for otto frank and otto franks wife and childrenherself and mrs frank being full sisters  if he dies they will hang otto she said and then what will poor hilda do she has varicose veins in both legs and she never can stand on her feet all day an work for wages and me i cannot help aint carl out of work too  billy had still another point of view  it will give the strike a black eye especially if henderson croaks he worried when he came home theyll hang frank on record time besides well have to put up a defense an lawyers charge like sam hill theyll eat a hole in our treasury you could drive every team in oakland through an if frank hadnt ben screwed up with whisky hed never adone it hes the mildest goodnaturedest man sober you ever seen  twice that evening billy left the house to find out if henderson was dead yet in the morning the papers gave little hope and the evening papers published his death otto frank lay in jail without bail the tribune demanded a quick trial and summary execution calling on the prospective jury manfully to do its duty and dwelling at length on the moral effect that would be so produced upon the lawless working class it went further emphasizing the salutary effect machine guns would have on the mob that had taken the fair city of oakland by the throat  and all such occurrences struck at saxon personally practically alone in the world save for billy it was her life and his and their mutual lovelife that was menaced from the moment he left the house to the moment of his return she knew no peace of mind rough work was afoot of which he told her nothing and she knew he was playing his part in it on more than one occasion she noticed freshbroken skin on his knuckles at such times he was remarkably taciturn and would sit in brooding silence or go almost immediately to bed she was afraid to have this habit of reticence grow on him and bravely she bid for his confidence she climbed into his lap and inside his arms one of her arms around his neck and with the free hand she caressed his hair back from the forehead and smoothed out the moody brows  now listen to me billy boy she began lightly you havent been playing fair and i wont have it no she pressed his lips shut with her fingers im doing the talking now and because you havent been doing your share of the talking for some time you remember we agreed at the start to always talk things over i was the first to break this when i sold my fancy work to mrs higgins without speaking to you about it and i was very sorry i am still sorry and ive never done it since now its your turn youre not talking things over with me you are doing things you dont tell me about  billy youre dearer to me than anything else in the world you know that were sharing each others lives only just now theres something youre not sharing every time your knuckles are sore theres something you dont share if you cant trust me you cant trust anybody and besides i love you so that no matter what you do ill go on loving you just the same  billy gazed at her with fond incredulity  dont be a pincher she teased remember i stand for whatever you do  and you wont buck against me he queried  how can i im not your boss billy i wouldnt boss you for anything in the world and if youd let me boss you i wouldnt love you half as much  he digested this slowly and finally nodded  an you wont be mad  with you youve never seen me mad yet now come on and be generous and tell me how you hurt your knuckles its fresh today anybody can see that  all right ill tell you how it happened he stopped and giggled with genuine boyish glee at some recollection its like this you wont be mad now we gotta do these sort of things to hold our own well heres the show a regular movin picture except for file talkin heres a big rube comin along hayseed

skyrockets an hell firejust like that it dont take long when youre scientific an trained to tandem work of course its hard on the knuckles but say saxon if youd seen that rube before an after youd thought he was a lightnin change artist laugh youd abusted  billy halted to give vent to his own mirth saxon forced herself to join with him but down in her heart was horror mercedes was right the stupid workers wrangled and snarled over jobs the clever masters rode in automobiles and did not wrangle and snarl they hired other stupid ones to do the wrangling and snarling for them it was men like bert and frank davis like chester johnson and otto frank like jelly belly and the pinkertons like henderson and all the rest of the scabs who were beaten up shot clubbed or hanged ah the clever ones were very clever nothing happened to them they only rode in their automobiles  you big stiffs the rube snivels as he crawls to his feet at the end billy was continuing you think you still want that job i ask he shakes his head then i readm the riot act theys only one thing for you to do old hoss an thats beat it dye get me beat it back to the farm for you an if you come monkeyin around town again well be real mad at you we was only foolin this time but next time we catch you your own mother wont know you when we get done with you  ansayyou oughta seenm beat it i bet hes goin yet ah when he gets back to milpitas or sleepy hollow or wherever he hangs out an tells how the boys does things in oakland its dollars to doughnuts they wont be a rube in his district thatd come to town to drive if they offered ten dollars an hour  it was awful saxon said then laughed wellsimulated appreciation  but that was nothin billy went on a bunch of the boys caught another one this morning they didnt do a thing to him my goodness gracious no in lessn two minutes he was the worst wreck they ever hauled to the receivin hospital the evenin papers gave the score nose broken three bad scalp wounds front teeth out a broken collarbone an two broken ribs gee he certainly got all that was comin to him but thats nothin dye want to know what the frisco teamsters did in the big strike before the earthquake they took every scab they caught an broke both his arms with a crowbar that was so he couldnt drive you see say the hospitals was filled with em an the teamsters won that strike too  but is it necessary billy to be so terrible i know theyre scabs and that theyre taking the bread out of the strikers childrens mouths to put in their own childrens mouths and that it isnt fair and all that but just the same is it necessary to be so terrible  sure thing billy answered confidently we just gotta throw the fear of god into themwhen we can do it without bein caught  and if youre caught  then the union hires the lawyers to defend us though that aint much good now for the judges are pretty hostyle an the papers keep hammerin away at them to give stiffer an stiffer sentences just the same before this strikes over therell be a whole lot of guys awishin theyd never gone scabbin  very cautiously in the next half hour saxon tried to feel out her husbands attitude to find if he doubted the rightness of the violence he and his brother teamsters committed but billys ethical sanction was rockbedded and profound it never entered his head that he was not absolutely right it was the game caught in its tangled meshes he could see no other way to play it than the way all men played it he did not stand for dynamite and murder however but then the unions did not stand for such quite naive was his explanation that dynamite and murder did not pay that such actions always brought down the condemnation of the public and broke the strikes but the healthy beating up of a scab he contendedthe throwing of the fear of god into a scab as he expressed itwas the only right and proper thing to do  our folks never had to do such things saxon said finally they never had strikes nor scabs in those times  you bet they didnt billy agreed them was the good old days id liked to alived then he drew a long breath and sighed but them times will never come again  would you have liked living in the country saxon asked  sure thing  theres lots of men living in the country now she suggested  just the same i notice them ahikin to town to get our jobs was his reply    chapter xii  a gleam of light came when billy got a job driving a grading team for the contractors of the big bridge then building at niles before he went he made certain that it was a union job and a union job it was for two days when the concrete workers threw down their tools the contractors evidently prepared for such happening immediately filled the places of the concrete men with nonunion italians whereupon the carpenters structural ironworkers and teamsters walked out and billy lacking train fare spent the rest of the day in walking home  i couldnt work as a scab he concluded his tale  no saxon said you couldnt work as a scab  but she wondered why it was that when men wanted to work and there was work to do yet they were unable to work because their unions said no why were there unions and if unions had to be why were not all workingmen in them then there would be no scabs and billy could work every day also she wondered where she was to get a sack of flour for she had long since ceased the extravagance of bakers bread and so many other of the neighborhood women had done this that the little welsh baker had closed up shop and gone away taking his wife and two little daughters with him look where she would everybody was being hurt by the industrial strife  one afternoon came a caller at her door and that evening came billy with dubious news he had been approached that day all he had to do he told saxon was to say the word and he could go into the stable as foreman at one hundred dollars a month  the nearness of such a sum the possibility of it was almost stunning to saxon sitting at a supper which consisted of boiled potatoes warmedover beans and a small dry onion which they were eating raw there was neither bread coffee nor butter the onion billy had pulled from his pocket having picked it up in the street one hundred dollars a month she moistened her lips and fought for control  what made them offer it to you she questioned  thats easy was his answer they got a dozen reasons the guy the boss has had exercisin prince and king is a dub king has gone lame in the shoulders then theyre guessin pretty strong that im the party thats put a lot of their scabs outa commission macklins ben their foreman for years an yearswhy i was in knee pants when he was foreman well hes sick an all in they gotta have somebody to take his place then too ive been with em a long time an on top of that im the man for the job they know i know horses from the ground up hell its all im good for except sluggin  think of it billy she breathed a hundred dollars a month a hundred dollars a month  an throw the fellows down he said  it was not a question nor was it a statement it was anything saxon chose to make of it they looked at each other she waited for him to speak but he continued merely to look it came to her that she was facing one of the decisive moments of her life and she gripped herself to face it in all coolness nor would billy proffer her the slightest help whatever his own judgment might be he masked it with an expressionless face his eyes betrayed nothing he looked and waited  you you cant do that billy she said finally you cant throw the fellows down  his hand shot out to hers and his face was a sudden radiant dawn  put her there he cried their hands meeting and clasping youre the truest true blue wife a man ever had if all the other fellows wives was like you we could win any strike we tackled  what would you have done if you werent married billy  seen em in hell first  than it doesnt make any difference being married ive got to stand by you in everything you stand for id be a nice wife if i didnt  she remembered her caller of the afternoon and knew the moment was too propitious to let pass  there was a man here this afternoon billy he wanted a room i told him id speak to you he said he would pay six dollars a month for the back bedroom that would pay half a months installment on the furniture and buy a sack of flour and were all out of flour  billys old hostility to the idea was instantly uppermost and saxon watched him anxiously  some scab in the shops i suppose  no hes firing on the freight run to san jose harmon he said his name was james harmon theyve just transferred him from the truckee division hell sleep days mostly he said and thats why he wanted a quiet house without children in it  in the end with much misgiving and only after saxon had insistently pointed out how little work it entailed on her billy consented though he continued to protest as an afterthought  but i dont want you makin beds for any man it aint right saxon i oughta take care of you  and you would she flashed back at him if youd take the foremanship only you cant it wouldnt be right and if im to stand by you its only fair to let me do what i can  james harmon proved even less a bother than saxon had anticipated for a fireman he was scrupulously clean always washing up in the roundhouse before he came home he used the key to the kitchen door coming and going by the back steps to saxon he barely said howdoyoudo or good day and sleeping in the day time and working at night he was in the house a week before billy laid eyes on him  billy had taken to coming home later and later and to going out after supper by himself he did not offer to tell saxon where he went nor did she ask for that matter it required little shrewdness on her part to guess the fumes of whisky were on his lips at such times his slow deliberate ways were even slower even more deliberate liquor did not affect his legs he walked as soberly as any man there was no hesitancy no faltering in his muscular movements the whisky went to his brain making his eyes heavylidded and the cloudiness of them more cloudy not that he was flighty nor quick nor irritable on the contrary the liquor imparted to his mental processes a deep gravity and brooding solemnity he talked little but that little was ominous and oracular at such times there was no appeal from his judgment no discussion he knew as god knew and when he chose to speak a harsh thought it was tenfold harsher than ordinarily because it seemed to proceed out of such profundity of cogitation because it was as prodigiously deliberate in its incubation as it was in its enunciation  it was not a nice side he was showing to saxon it was almost as if a stranger had come to live with her despite herself she found herself beginning to shrink from him and little could she comfort herself with the thought that it was not his real self for she remembered his gentleness and considerateness all his finenesses of the past then he had made a continual effort to avoid trouble and fighting now he enjoyed it exulted in it went looking for it all this showed in his face no longer was he the smiling pleasantfaced boy he smiled infrequently now his face was a mans face the lips the eyes the lines were harsh as his thoughts were harsh  he was rarely unkind to saxon but on the other hand he was rarely kind his attitude toward her was growing negative he was disinterested despite the fight for the union she was enduring with him putting up with him shoulder to shoulder she occupied but little space in his mind when he acted toward her gently she could see that it was merely mechanical just as she was well aware that the endearing terms he used the endearing caresses he gave were only habitual the spontaneity and warmth had gone out often when he was not in liquor flashes of the old billy came back but even such flashes dwindled in frequency he was growing preoccupied moody hard times and the bitter stresses of industrial conflict strained him especially was this apparent in his sleep when he suffered paroxysms of lawless dreams groaning and muttering clenching his fists grinding his teeth twisting with muscular tensions his face writhing with passions and violences his throat guttering with terrible curses that rasped and aborted on his lips and saxon lying beside him afraid of this visitor to her bed whom she did not know remembered what mary had told her of bert he too had cursed and clenched his fists in his nights fought out the battles of his days  one thing however saxon saw clearly by no deliberate act of billys was he becoming this other and unlovely billy were there no strike no snarling and wrangling over jobs there would be only the old billy she had loved in all absoluteness this sleeping terror in him would have lain asleep it was something that was being awakened in him an image incarnate of outward conditions as cruel as ugly as maleficent as were those outward conditions but if the strike continued then she feared with reason would this other and grisly self of billy strengthen to fuller and more forbidding stature and this she knew would mean the wreck of their lovelife such a billy she could not love in its nature such a billy was not lovable nor capable of love and then at the thought of offspring she shuddered it was too terrible and at such moments of contemplation from her soul the inevitable plaint of the human went up why why why  billy too had his unanswerable queries  why wont the building trades come out he demanded wrathfuly of the obscurity that veiled the ways of living and the world but no obrien wont stand for a strike and he has the building trades council under his thumb but why dont they chuck him and come out anyway wed win hands down all along the line but no obriens got their goat an him up to his dirty neck in politics an graft an damn the federation of labor if all the railroad boys had come out wouldnt the shop men have won instead of bein licked to a frazzle lord i aint had a smoke of decent tobacco or a cup of decent coffee in a coons age ive forgotten what a square meal tastes like i weighed myself yesterday fifteen pounds lighter than when the strike begun if it keeps on much more i can fight middleweight an this is what i get after payin dues into the union for years and years i cant get a square meal an my wife has to make other mens beds it makes my tired ache some day ill get real huffy an chuck that lodger out  but its not his fault billy saxon protested  who said it was billy snapped roughly cant i kick in general if i want to just the same it makes me sick whats the good of organized labor if it dont stand together for two cents id chuck the whole thing up an go over to the employers only i wouldnt god damn them if they think they can beat us down to our knees let em go ahead an try it thats all but it gets me just the same the whole worlds clean dippy they aint no sense in anything whats the good of supportin a union that cant win a strike whats the good of knockin the blocks off of scabs when they keep acomin thick as ever the whole things bughouse an i guess i am too  such an outburst on billys part was so unusual that it was the only time saxon knew it to occur always he was sullen and dogged and unwhipped while whisky only served to set the maggots of certitude crawling in his brain  one night billy did not get home till after twelve saxons anxiety was increased by the fact that police fighting and head breaking had been reported to have occurred when billy came his appearance verified the report his coatsleeves were half torn off the windsor tie had disappeared from under his soft turneddown collar and every button had been ripped off the front of the shirt when he took his hat off saxon was frightened by a lump on his head the size of an apple  dye know who did that that dutch slob hermanmann with a riot club an ill getm for it some day good an plenty an theres another fellow i got staked out thatll be my meat when this strikes over an things is settled down blanchards his name roy blanchard  not of blanchard perkins and company saxon asked busy washing billys hurt and making her usual fight to keep him calm  yep except hes the son of the old man whats he do that aint done a tap of work in all his life except to blow the old mans money he goes strikebreakin grandstand play thats what i call it gets his name in the papers an makes all the skirts he runs with fluster up an say my some bear that roy blanchard some bear some bearthe gazabo hell be bearmeat for me some day i never itched so hard to lick a man in my life  andoh i guess ill pass that dutch cop up he got his already somebody broke his head with a lump of coal the size of a water bucket that was when the wagons was turnin into franklin just off eighth by the old galindo hotel they was hard fightin there an some guy in the hotel lams that coal down from the second story window  they was fightin every block of the waybricks cobblestones an policeclubs to beat the band they dont dast call out the troops an they was afraid to shoot why we tore holes through the police force an the ambulances and patrol wagons worked overtime but say we got the procession blocked at fourteenth and broadway right under the nose of the city hall rushed the rear end cut out the horses of five wagons an handed them college guys a few lovepats in passin all that saved em from hospital was the police reserves just the same we had em jammed an hour there you oughta seen the street cars blocked toobroadway fourteenth san pablo as far as you could see  but what did blanchard do saxon called him back  he led the procession an he drove my team all the teams was from my stable he rounded up a lot of them college fellowsfraternity guys theyre calledyaps that live off their fathers money they come to the stable in big tourin cars an drove out the wagons with half the police of oakland to help them say it was sure some day the sky rained cobblestones an you oughta heard the clubs on our headsrattattattat rattattattat an say the chief of police in a police auto sittin up like god almightyjust before we got to peralta street they was a block an the police chargin an an old woman right from her front gate lammed the chief of police full in the face with a dead cat phew you could hear it arrest that woman he yells with his handkerchief out but the boys beat the cops to her an got her away some day i guess yes the receivin hospital went outa commission on the jump an the overflow was spilled into st marys hospital an fabiola an i dont know where else eight of our men was pulled an a dozen of the frisco teamsters thats come over to help theyre holy terrors them frisco teamsters it seemed half the workingmen of oakland was helpin us an they must be an army of them in jail our lawyersll have to take their cases too  but take it from me its the last well see of roy blanchard an yaps of his kidney buttin into our affairs i guess we showed em some football you know that brick buildin theyre puttin up on bay street thats where we loaded up first an say you couldnt see the wagonseats for bricks when they started from the stables blanchard drove the first wagon an he was knocked clean off the seat once but he stayed with it  he must have been brave saxon commented  brave billy flared with the police an the army an navy behind him i suppose youll be takin their part next brave atakin the food outa the mouths of our women an children didnt curley joness little kid die last night mothers milk not nourishin thats what it was because she didnt have the right stuff to eat an i know an you know a dozen old aunts an sisterinlaws an such thats had to hike to the poorhouse because their folks couldnt take care of em in these times  in the morning paper saxon read the exciting account of the futile attempt to break the teamsters strike roy blanchard was hailed a hero and held up as a model of wealthy citizenship and to save herself she could not help glowing with appreciation of his courage there was something fine in his going out to face the snarling pack a brigadier general of the regular army was quoted as lamenting the fact that the troops had not been called out to take the mob by the throat and shake law and order into it this is the time for a little healthful bloodletting was the conclusion of his remarks after deploring the pacific methods of the police for not until the mob has been thoroughly beaten and cowed will tranquil industrial conditions obtain  that evening saxon and billy went up town returning home and finding nothing to eat he had taken her on one arm his overcoat on the other the overcoat he had pawned at uncle sams and he and saxon had eaten drearily at a japanese restaurant which in some miraculous way managed to set a semisatisfying meal for ten cents after eating they started on their way to spend an additional five cents each on a moving picture show  at the central bank building two striking teamsters accosted billy and took him away with them saxon waited on the corner and when he returned three quarters of an hour later she knew he had been drinking  half a block on passing the forum cafe he stopped suddenly a limousine stood at the curb and into it a young man was helping several wonderfully gowned women a chauffeur sat in the drivers sent billy touched the young man on the arm he was as broadshouldered as billy and slightly taller blueeyed strongfeatured in saxons opinion he was undeniably handsome  just a word sport billy said in a low slow voice  the young man glanced quickly at billy and saxon and asked impatiently  well what is it  youre blanchard billy began i seen you yesterday lead out that bunch of teams  didnt i do it all right blanchard asked gaily with a flash of glance to saxon and back again  sure but that aint what i want to talk about  who are you the other demanded with sudden suspicion  a striker it just happens you drove my team thats all no dont move for a gun as blanchard half reached toward his hip pocket i aint startin anythin here but i just want to tell you something  be quick then  blanchard lifted one foot to step into the machine  sure billy went on without any diminution of his exasperating slowness what i want to tell you is that im after you not now when the strikes on but some time later im goin to get you an give you the beatin of your life  blanchard looked billy over with new interest and measuring eyes that sparkled with appreciation  you are a husky yourself he said but do you think you can do it  sure youre my meat  all right then my friend look me up after the strike is settled and ill give you a chance at me  remember billy added i got you staked out  blanchard nodded smiled genially to both of them raised his hat to saxon and stepped into the machine    chapter xiii  from now on to saxon life seemed bereft of its last reason and rhyme it had become senseless nightmarish anything irrational was possible there was nothing stable in the anarchic flux of affairs that swept her on she knew not to what catastrophic end had billy been dependable all would still have been well with him to cling to she would have faced everything fearlessly but he had been whirled away from her in the prevailing madness so radical was the change in him that he seemed almost an intruder in the house spiritually he was such an intruder another man looked out of his eyesa man whose thoughts were of violence and hatred a man to whom there was no good in anything and who had become an ardent protagonist of the evil that was rampant and universal this man no longer condemned bert himself muttering vaguely of dynamite end sabotage and revolution  saxon strove to maintain that sweetness and coolness of flesh and spirit that billy had praised in the old days once only she lost control he had been in a particularly ugly mood and a final harshness and unfairness cut her to the quick  who are you speaking to she flamed out at him  he was speechless and abashed and could only stare at her face which was white with anger  dont you ever speak to me like that again billy she commanded  aw cant you put up with a piece of bad temper he muttered half apologetically yet half defiantly god knows i got enough to make me cranky  after he left the house she flung herself on the bed and cried heartbrokenly for she who knew so thoroughly the humility of love was a proud woman only the proud can be truly humble as only the strong may know the fullness of gentleness but what was the use she demanded of being proud and game when the only person in the world who mattered to her lost his own pride and gameness and fairness and gave her the worse share of their mutual trouble  and now as she had faced alone the deeper organic hurt of the loss of her baby she faced alone another and in a way an even greater personal trouble perhaps she loved billy none the less but her love was changing into something less proud less confident less trusting it was becoming shot through with pitywith the pity that is parent to contempt her own loyalty was threatening to weaken and she shuddered and shrank from the contempt she could see creeping in  she struggled to steel herself to face the situation forgiveness stole into her heart and she knew relief until the thought came that in the truest highest love forgiveness should have no place and again she cried and continued her battle after all one thing was incontestable this billy wes not the billy she had loved this billy was another man a sick man and no more to be held responsible than a feverpatient in the ravings of delirium she must be billys nurse without pride without contempt with nothing to forgive besides he was really bearing the brunt of the fight was in the thick of it dizzy with the striking of blows and the blows he received if fault there was it lay elsewhere somewhere in the tangled scheme of things that made men snarl over jobs like dogs over bones  so saxon arose and buckled on her armor again for the hardest fight of all in the worlds arenathe womans fight she ejected from her thought all doubting and distrust she forgave nothing for there was nothing requiring forgiveness she pledged herself to an absoluteness of belief that her love and billys was unsullied unperturbedsevere as it had always been as it would be when it came back again after the world settled down once more to rational ways  that night when he came home she proposed as an emergency measure that she should resume her needlework and help keep the pot boiling until the strike was over but billy would hear nothing of it  its all right he assured her repeatedly they aint no call for you to work im goin to get some money before the week is out an ill turn it over to you an saturday night well go to the showa real show no movin pictures harveys nigger minstrels is comin to town well go saturday night ill have the money before that as sure as beans is beans  friday evening he did not come home to supper which saxon regretted for maggie donahue had returned a pan of potatoes and two quarts of flour borrowed the week before and it was a hearty meal that awaited him saxon kept the stove going till nine oclock when despite her reluctance she went to bed her preference would have been to wait up but she did not dare knowing full well what the effect would be on him did he come home in liquor  the clock had just struck one when she heard the click of the gate slowly heavily ominously she heard him come up the steps and fumble with his key at the door he entered the bedroom and she heard him sigh as he sat down she remained quiet for she had learned the hypersensitiveness induced by drink and was fastidiously careful not to hurt him even with the knowledge that she had lain awake for him it was not easy her hands were clenched till the nails dented the palms and her body was rigid in her passionate effort for control never had he come home as bad as this  saxon he called thickly saxon  she stired and yawned  what is it she asked  wont you strike a light my fingers is all thumbs  without looking at him she complied but so violent was the nervous trembling of her hands that the glass chimney tinkled against the globe and the match went out  i aint drunk saxon he said in the darkness a hint of amusement in his thick voice ive only had two or three jolts  of that sort  on her second attempt with the lamp she succeeded when she turned to look at him she screamed with fright though she had heard his voice and knew him to be billy for the instant she did not recognize him his face was a face she had never known swollen bruised discolored every feature had been beaten out of all semblance of familiarity one eye was entirely closed the other showed through a narrow slit of bloodcongested flesh one ear seemed to have lost most of its skin the whole face was a swollen pulp his right jaw in particular was twice the size of the left no wonder his speech had been thick was her thought as she regarded the fearfully cut and swollen lips that still bled she was sickened by the sight and her heart went out to him in a great wave of tenderness she wanted to put her arms around him and cuddle and soothe him but her practical judgment bade otherwise  you poor poor boy she cried tell me what you want me to do first i dont know about such things  if you could help me get my clothes off he suggested meekly and thickly i got em on before i stiffened up  and then hot waterthat will be good she said as she began gently drawing his coat sleeve over a puffed and helpless hand  i told you they was all thumbs he grimaced holding up his hand and squinting at it with the fraction of sight remaining to him  you sit and wait she said till i start the fire and get the hot water going i wont be a minute then ill finish getting your clothes off  from the kitchen she could hear him mumbling to himself and when she returned he was repeating over and over  we needed the money saxon we needed the money  drunken he was not she could see that and from his babbling she knew he was partly delirious  he was a surprise box he wandered on while she proceeded to undress him and bit by bit she was able to piece together what had happened he was an unknown from chicago they sprang him on me the secretary of the acme club warned me id have my hands full an id awon if id been in condition but fifteen pounds off without trainin aint condition then id been drinkin pretty regular an i didnt have my wind  but saxon stripping his undershirt no longer heard him as with his face she could not recognize his splendidly muscled back the white sheath of silken skin was torn and bloody the lacerations occurred oftenest in horizontal lines though there were perpendicular lines as well  how did you get all that she asked  the ropes i was up against em more times than i like to remember gee he certainly gave me mine but i fooled m he couldnt put me out i lasted the twenty rounds an i wanta tell you hes got some marks to remember me by if he aint got a couple of knuckles broke in the left hand im a geezerhere feel my head here swollen eh sure thing he hit that more times than hes wishin he had right now but oh what a lacin what a lacin i never had anything like it before the chicago terror they call m i take my hat off to m hes some bear but i could amade m take the count if id ben in condition an had my windoh ouch watch out its like a boil  fumbling at his waistband saxons hand had come in contact with a brightly inflamed surface larger than a soup plate  thats from the kidney blows billy explained he was a regular devil at it most every clench like clock work down hed chop one on me it got so sore i was wincin until i got groggy an didnt know much of anything it aint a knockout blow you know but its awful wearin in a long fight it takes the starch out of you  when his knees were bared saxon could see the skin across the kneecaps was broken and gone  the skin aint made to stand a heavy fellow like me on the knees he volunteered an the rosin in the canvas cuts like sam hill  the tears were in saxons eyes and she could have cried over the manhandled body of her beautiful sick boy  as she carried his pants across the room to hang them up a jingle of money came from them he called her back and from the pocket drew forth a handful of silver  we needed the money we needed the money he kept muttering as he vainly tried to count the coins and saxon knew that his mind was wandering again  it cut her to the heart for she could not but remember the harsh thoughts that had threatened her loyalty during the week past after all billy the splendid physical man was only a boy her boy and he had faced and endured all this terrible punishment for her for the house and the furniture that were their house and furniture he said so now when he scarcely knew what he said he said we needed the money she was not so absent from his thoughts as she had fancied here down to the naked tieribs of his soul when he was half unconscious the thought of her persisted was uppermost we needed the money we  the tears were trickling down her checks as she bent over him and it seemed she had never loved him so much as now  here you count he said abandoning the effort and handing the money to her  how much do you make it  nineteen dollars and thirtyfive cents  thats right the losers end twenty dollars i had some drinks an treated a couple of the boys an then there was carfare if id awon id agot a hundred thats what i fought for itd aput us on easy street for a while you take it an keep it its better n nothin  in bed he could not sleep because of his pain and hour by hour she worked over him renewing the hot compresses over his bruises soothing the lacerations with witch hazel and cold cream and the tenderest of finger tips and all the while with broken intervals of groaning he babbled on living over the fight seeking relief in telling her his trouble voicing regret at loss of the money and crying out the hurt to his pride far worse than the sum of his physical hurts was his hurt pride  he couldnt put me out anyway he had full swing at me in the times when i was too much in to get my hands up the crowd was crazy i showed em some stamina they was times when he only rocked me for id evaporated plenty of his steam for him in the openin rounds i dont know how many times he dropped me things was gettin too dreamy  sometimes toward the end i could see three of him in the ring at once an i wouldnt know which to hit an which to duck  but i fooled m when i couldnt see or feel an when my knees was shakin an my head goin like a merrygoround id fall safe into clenches just the same i bet the referees arms is tired from draggin us apart  but what a lacin what a lacin say saxon where are you oh there eh i guess i was dreamin but say let this be a lesson to you i broke my word an went fightin an see what i got look at me an take warnin so you wont make the same mistake an go to makin an sellin fancy work again  but i fooled emeverybody at the beginnin the bettin was even by the sixth round the wise gazabos was offerin two to one against me i was licked from the first drop outa the boxanybody could see that but he couldnt put me down for the count by the tenth round they was offerin even that i wouldnt last the round at the eleventh they was offerin i wouldnt last the fifteenth an i lasted the whole twenty but some punishment i want to tell you some punishment  why they was four rounds i was in dreamland all the time only i kept on my feet an fought or took the count to eight an got up an stalled an covered an whanged away i dont know what i done except i must adone like that because i wasnt there i dont know a thing from the thirteenth when he sent me to the mat on my head till the eighteenth  where was i oh yes i opened my eyes or one eye because i had only one that would open an there i was in my corner with the towels goin an ammonia in my nose an bill murphy with a chunk of ice at the back of my neck an there across the ring i could see the chicago terror an i had to do some thinkin to remember i was fightin him it was like id been away somewhere an just got back what rounds this comin i ask bill the eighteenth says he the hell i says whats come of all the other rounds the last i was fightin in was the thirteenth youre a wonder says bill youve ben out four rounds only nobody knows it except me ive ben tryin to get you to quit all the time just then the gong sounds an i can see the terror startin for me quit says bill makin a move to throw in the towel not on your life i says drop it bill but he went on wantin me to quit by that time the terror had come across to my corner an was standin with his hands down lookin at me the referee was lookin too an the house was that quiet lookin you could hear a pin drop an my head was gettin some clearer but not much  you cant win bill says  watch me says i an with that i make a rush for the terror catchin him unexpected im that groggy i cant stand but i just keep agoin wallopin the terror clear across the ring to his corner where he slips an falls an i fall on top of m say that crowd goes crazy  where was imy heads still goin round i guess its buzzin like a swarm of bees  youd just fallen on top of him in his corner saxon prompted  oh yes well no sooner are we on our feetan i cant standi rush m the same way back across to my corner an fall on m that was luck we got up an id afallen only i clenched an held myself up by him i got your goat i says to him an now im goin to eat you up  i hadnt his goat but i was playin to get a piece of it an i got it rushin m as soon as the referee drags us apart an fetchin m a lucky wallop in the stomach that steadied m an made him almighty careful too almighty careful he was afraid to chance a mix with me he thought i had more fight left in me than i had so you see i got that much of his goat anyway  an he couldnt get me he didnt get me an in the twentieth we stood in the middle of the ring an exchanged wallops even of course id made a fine showin for a licked man but he got the decision which was right but i fooled m he couldnt get me an i fooled the gazabos that was bettin he would on short order  at last as dawn came on billy slept he groaned and moaned his face twisting with pain his body vainly moving and tossing in quest of easement  so this was prizefighting saxon thought it was much worse than she had dreamed she had had no idea that such damage could be wrought with padded gloves he must never fight again street rioting was preferable she was wondering how much of his silk had been lost when he mumbled and opened his eyes  what is it she asked ere it came to her that his eyes were unseeing and that he was in delirium  saxon saxon he called  yes billy what is it  his hand fumbled over the bed where ordinarily it would have encountered her  again he called her and she cried her presence loudly in his ear he sighed with relief and muttered brokenly  i had to do it we needed the money  his eyes closed and he slept more soundly though his muttering continued she had heard of congestion of the brain and was frightened then she remembered his telling her of the ice billy murphy had held against his head  throwing a shawl over her head she ran to the pile drivers home on seventh street the barkeeper had just opened and was sweeping out from the refrigerator he gave her all the ice she wished to carry breaking it into convenient pieces for her back in the house she applied the ice to the base of billys brain placed hot irons to his feet and bathed his head with witch hazel made cold by resting on the ice  he slept in the darkened room until late afternoon when to saxons dismay he insisted on getting up  gotta make a showin he explained they aint goin to have the laugh on me  in torment he was helped by her to dress and in torment he went forth from the house so that his world should have ocular evidence that the beating he had received did not keep him in bed  it was another kind of pride different from a womans and saxon wondered if it were the less admirable for that    chapter xiv  in the days that followed billys swellings went down and the bruises passed away with surprising rapidity the quick healing of the lacerations attested the healthiness of his blood only remained the black eyes unduly conspicuous on a face as blond as his the discoloration was stubborn persisting half a month in which time happened divers events of importance  otto franks trial had been expeditious found guilty by a jury notable for the business and professional men on it the death sentence was passed upon him and he was removed to san quentin for execution  the case of chester johnson and the fourteen others had taken longer but within the same week it too was finished chester johnson was sentenced to be hanged two got life three twenty years only two were acquitted the remaining seven received terms of from two to ten years  the effect on saxon was to throw her into deep depression billy was made gloomy but his fighting spirit was not subdued  always some men killed in battle he said thats to be expected but the way of sentencin em gets me all found guilty was responsible for the killin or none was responsible if all was then they should get the same sentence they oughta hang like chester johnson or else he oughtnt to hang id just like to know how the judge makes up his mind it must be like markin china lottery tickets he plays hunches he looks at a guy an waits for a spot or a number to come into his head how else could he give johnny black four years an cal hutchins twenty years he played the hunches as they came into his head an it might just as easy ben the other way around an cal hutchins got four years an johnny black twenty  i know both them boys they hung out with the tenth an kirkham gang mostly though sometimes they ran with my gang we used to go swimmin after school down to sandy beach on the marsh an in the transit slip where they said the water was sixty feet deep only it wasnt an once on a thursday we dug a lot of clams together an played hookey friday to peddle them an we used to go out on the rock wall an catch pogies an rock cod one daythe day of the eclipsecal caught a perch half as big as a door i never seen such a fish an now hes got to wear the stripes for twenty years lucky he wasnt married if he dont get the consumption hell be an old man when he comes out cals mother wouldnt let m go swimmin an whenever she suspected she always licked his hair with her tongue if it tasted salty he got a beltin but he was onto himself comin home hed jump somebodys front fence an hold his head under a faucet  i used to dance with chester johnson saxon said and i knew his wife kittie brady long and long ago she had next place at the table to me in the paperbox factory shes gone to san francisco to her married sisters shes going to have a baby too she was awfully pretty and there was always a string of fellows after her  the effect of the conviction and severe sentences was a bad one on the union men instead of being disheartening it intensified the bitterness billys repentance for having fought and the sweetness and affection which had flashed up in the days of saxons nursing of him were blotted out at home he scowled and brooded while his talk took on the tone of berts in the last days ere that mohegan died also billy stayed away from home longer hours and was again steadily drinking  saxon wellnigh abandoned hope almost was she steeled to the inevitable tragedy which her morbid fancy painted in a thousand guises oftenest it was of billy being brought home on a stretcher sometimes it was a call to the telephone in the corner grocery and the curt information by a strange voice that her husband was lying in the receiving hospital or the morgue and when the mysterious horsepoisoning cases occurred and when the residence of one of the teaming magnates was half destroyed by dynamite she saw billy in prison or wearing stripes or mounting to the scaffold at san quentin while at the same time she could see the little cottage on pine street besieged by newspaper reporters and photographers  yet her lively imagination failed altogether to anticipate the real catastrophe harmon the fireman lodger passing through the kitchen on his way out to work had paused to tell saxon about the previous days trainwreck in the alviso marshes and of how the engineer imprisoned under the overturned engine and unhurt being drowned by the rising tide had begged to be shot billy came in at the end of the narrative and from the somber light in his heavylidded eyes saxon knew he had been drinking he glowered at harmon and without greeting to him or saxon leaned his shoulder against the wall  harmon felt the awkwardness of the situation and did his best to appear oblivious  i was just telling your wife he began but was savagely interrupted  i dont care what you was tellin her but i got something to tell you mister man my wifes made up your bed too many times to suit me  billy saxon cried her face scarlet with resentment and hurt and shame  billy ignored her harmon was saying  i dont understand  well i dont like your mug billy informed him youre standin on your foot get off of it get out beat it dye understand that  i dont know whats got into him saxon gasped hurriedly to the fireman hes not himself oh i am so ashamed so ashamed  billy turned on her  you shut your mouth an keep outa this  but billy she remonstrated  an get outa here you go into the other room  here now harmon broke in this is a fine way to treat a fellow  ive given you too much rope as it is was billys answer  ive paid my rent regularly havent i  an i oughta knock your block off for you dont see any reason i shouldnt for that matter  if you do anything like that billy saxon began  you here still well if you wont go into the other room ill see that you do  his hand clutched her arm for one instant she resisted his strength and in that instant the flesh crushed under his fingers she realized the fullness of his strength  in the front room she could only lie back in the morris chair sobbing and listen to what occurred in the kitchen ill stay to the end of the week the fireman was saying ive paid in advance  dont make no mistake came billys voice so slow that it was almost a drawl yet quivering with rage you cant get out too quick if you wanta stay healthyyou an your traps with you im likely to start something any moment  oh i know youre a slugger the firemans voice began  then came the unmistakable impact of a blow the crash of glass a scuffle on the back porch and finally the heavy bumps of a body down the steps she heard billy reenter the kitchen move about and knew he was sweeping up the broken glass of the kitchen door then he washed himself at the sink whistling while he dried his face and hands and walked into the front room she did not look at him she was too sick and sad he paused irresolutely seeming to make up his mind  im goin up town he stated theys a meeting of the union if i dont come back itll be because that geezers sworn out a warrant  he opened the front door and paused she knew he was looking at her then the door closed and she heard him go down the steps  saxon was stunned she did not think she did not know what to think the whole thing was incomprehensible incredible she lay back in the chair her eyes closed her mind almost a blank crushed by a leaden feeling that the end had come to everything  the voices of children playing in the street aroused her night had fallen she groped her way to a lamp and lighted it in the kitchen she stared lips trembling at the pitiful half prepared meal the fire had gone out the water had boiled away from the potatoes when she lifted the lid a burnt smell arose methodically she scraped and cleaned the pot put things in order and peeled and sliced the potatoes for next days frying and just as methodically she went to bed her lack of nervousness her placidity was abnormal so abnormal that she closed her eyes and was almost immediately asleep nor did she awaken till the sunshine was streaming into the room  it was the first night she and billy had slept apart she was amazed that she had not lain awake worrying about him she lay with eyes wide open scarcely thinking until pain in her arm attracted her attention it was where billy had gripped her on examination she found the bruised flesh fearfully black and blue she was astonished not by the spiritual fact that such bruise had been administered by the one she loved most in the world but by the sheer physical fact that an instants pressure had inflicted so much damage the strength of a man was a terrible thing quite impersonally she found herself wondering if charley long were as strong as billy  it was not until she dressed and built the fire that she began to think about more immediate things billy had not returned then he was arrested what was she to doleave him in jail go away and start life afresh of course it was impossible to go on living with a man who had behaved as he had but then came another thought was it impossible after all he was her husband for better or worsethe phrase reiterated itself a monotonous accompaniment to her thoughts at the back of her consciousness to leave him was to surrender she carried the matter before the tribunal of her mothers memory no daisy would never have surrendered daisy was a fighter then she saxon must fight besidesand she acknowledged itreadily though in a cold dead waybesides billy was better than most husbands better than any other husband she had heard of she concluded as she remembered many of his earlier nicenesses and finenesses and especially his eternal chant nothing is too good for us the robertses aint on the cheap  at eleven oclock she had a caller it was bud strothers billys mate on strike duty billy he told her had refused bail refused a lawyer had asked to be tried by the court had pleaded guilty and had received a sentence of sixty dollars or thirty days also he had refused to let the boys pay his fine  hes clean looney strothers summed up wont listen to reason says hell serve the time out hes been tankin up too regular i guess his wheels are buzzin here he give me this note for you any time you want anything send for me the boysll all stand by bills wife you belong to us you know how are you off for money  proudly she disclaimed any need for money and not until her visitor departed did she read billys note  dear saxonbud strothers is going to give you this dont worry about me i am going to take my medicine i deserve ityou know that i guess i am gone bughouse just the same i am sorry for what i done dont come to see me i dont want you to if you need money the union will give you some the business agent is all right i will be out in a month now saxon you know i love you and just say to yourself that you forgive me this time and you wont never have to do it again                                    billy  bud strothers was followed by maggie donahue and mrs olsen who paid neighborly calls of cheer and were tactful in their offers of help and in studiously avoiding more reference than was necessary to billys predicament  in the afternoon james harmon arrived he limped slightly and saxon divined that he was doing his best to minimize that evidence of hurt she tried to apologize to him but he would not listen  i dont blame you mrs roberts he said i know it wasnt your doing but your husband wasnt just himself i guess he was fightin mad on general principles and it was just my luck to get in the way that was all  but just the same  the fireman shook his head  i know all about it i used to punish the drink myself and i done some funny things in them days and im sorry i swore that warrant out and testified but i was hot in the collar im cooled down now an im sorry i done it  youre awfully good and kind she said and then began hesitantly on what was bothering her you you cant stay now with him away you know  yes that wouldnt do would it ill tell you ill pack up right now and skin out and then before six oclock ill send a wagon for my things heres the key to the kitchen door  much as he demurred she compelled him to receive back the unexpired portion of his rent he shook her hand heartily at leaving and tried to get her to promise to call upon him for a loan any time she might be in need  its all right he assured her im married and got two boys one of thems got his lungs touched and shes with em down in arizona campin out the railroad helped with passes  and as he went down the steps she wondered that so kind a man should be in so madly cruel a world  the donahue boy threw in a spare evening paper and saxon found half a column devoted to billy it was not nice the fact that he had stood up in the police court with his eyes blacked from some other fray was noted he was described as a bully a hoodlum a roughneck a professional slugger whose presence in the ranks was a disgrace to organized labor the assault he had pleaded guilty of was atrocious and unprovoked and if he were a fair sample of a striking teamster the only wise thing for oakland to do was to break up the union and drive every member from the city and finally the paper complained at the mildness of the sentence it should have been six months at least the judge was quoted as expressing regret that he had been unable to impose a six months sentence this inability being due to the condition of the jails already crowded beyond capacity by the many eases of assault committed in the course of the various strikes  that night in bed saxon experienced her first loneliness her brain seemed in a whirl and her sleep was broken by vain gropings for the form of billy she imagined at her side at last she lighted the lamp and lay staring at the ceiling wideeyed conning over and over the details of the disaster that had overwhelmed her she could forgive and she could not forgive the blow to her lovelife had been too savage too brutal her pride was too lacerated to permit her wholly to return in memory to the other billy whom she loved wine in wit out she repeated to herself but the phrase could not absolve the man who had slept by her side and to whom she had consecrated herself she wept in the loneliness of the alltoospacious bed strove to forget billys incomprehensible cruelty even pillowed her cheek with numb fondness against the bruise of her arm but still resentment burned within her a steady flame of protest against billy and all that billy had done her throat was parched a dull ache never ceased in her breast and she was oppressed by a feeling of goneness why whyand from the puzzle of the world came no solution  in the morning she received a visit from sarahthe second in all the period of her marriage and she could easily guess her sisterinlaws ghoulish errand no exertion was required for the assertion of all of saxons pride she refused to be in the slightest on the defensive there was nothing to defend nothing to explain everything was all right and it was nobodys business anyway this attitude but served to vex sarah  i warned you and you cant say i didnt her diatribe ran i always knew he was no good a jailbird a hoodlum a slugger my heart sunk into my boots when i heard you was runnin with a prizefighter i told you so at the time but no you wouldnt listen you with your highfalutin notions an more pairs of shoes than any decent woman should have you knew bettern me an i said then to tom i said its all up with saxon now them was my very words them that touches pitch is defiled if youd only amarried charley long then the family wouldnt aben disgraced an this is only the beginnin mark me only the beginnin where itll end god knows hell kill somebody yet that plugugly of yourn an be hanged for it you wait an see thats all an then youll remember my words as you make your bed so you will lay in it  best bed i ever had saxon commented  so you can say so you can say sarah snorted  i wouldnt trade it for a queens bed saxon added  a jailbirds bed sarah rejoined witheringly  oh its the style saxon retorted airily everybodys getting a taste of jail wasnt tom arrested at some street meeting of the socialists everybody goes to jail these days  the barb had struck home  but tom was acquitted sarah hastened to proclaim  just the same he lay in jail all night without bail  this was unanswerable and sarah executed her favorite tactic of attack in flank  a nice comedown for you i must say that was raised straight an right acuttin up didoes with a lodger  who says so saxon blazed with an indignation quickly mastered  oh a blind man can read between the lines a lodger a young married woman with no self respect an a prizefighter for a husbandwhat else would they fight about  just like any family quarrel wasnt it saxon smiled placidly  sarah was shocked into momentary speechlessness  and i want you to understand it saxon continued it makes a woman proud to have men fight over her i am proud do you hear i am proud i want you to tell them so i want you to tell all your neighbors tell everybody i am no cow men like me men fight for me men go to jail for me what is a woman in the world for if it isnt to have men like her now go sarah go at once and tell everybody what youve read between the lines tell them billy is a jailbird and that i am a bad woman whom all men desire shout it out and good luck to you and get out of my house and never put your feet in it again you are too decent a woman to come here you might lose your reputation and think of your children now get out go  not until sarah had taken an amazed and horrified departure did saxon fling herself on the bed in a convulsion of tears she had been ashamed before merely of billys inhospitality and surliness and unfairness but she could see now the light in which others looked on the affair it had not entered saxons head she was confident that it had not entered billys she knew his attitude from the first always he had opposed taking a lodger because of his proud faith that his wife should not work only hard times had compelled his consent and now that she looked back almost had she inveigled him into consenting  but all this did not alter the viewpoint the neighborhood must hold that every one who had ever known her must hold and for this too billy was responsible it was more terrible than all the other things he had been guilty of put together she could never look any one in the face again maggie donahue and mrs olsen had been very kind but of what must they have been thinking all the time they talked with her and what must they have said to each other what was everybody sayingover front gates and back fencesthe men standing on the corners or talking in saloons  later exhausted by her grief when the tears no longer fell she grew more impersonal and dwelt on the disasters that had befallen so many women since the strike troubles beganotto franks wife hendersons widow pretty kittie brady mary all the womenfolk of the other workmen who were now wearing the stripes in san quentin her world was crashing about her ears no one was exempt not only had she not escaped but hers was the worst disgrace of all desperately she tried to hug the delusion that she was asleep that it was all a nightmare and that soon the alarm would go off and she would get up and cook billys breakfast so that he could go to work  she did not leave the bed that day nor did she sleep her brain whirled on and on now dwelling at insistent length upon her misfortunes now pursuing the most fantastic ramifications of what she considered her disgrace and again going back to her childhood and wandering through endless trivial detail she worked at all the tasks she had ever done performing in fancy the myriads of mechanical movements peculiar to each occupationshaping and pasting in the paper box factory ironing in the laundry weaving in the jute mill peeling fruit in the cannery and countless boxes of scalded tomatoes she attended all her dances and all her picnics over again went through her school days recalling the face and name and seat of every schoolmate endured the gray bleakness of the years in the orphan asylum revisioned every memory of her mother every tale and relived all her life with billy but everand here the torment layshe was drawn back from these farwanderings to her present trouble with its parch in the throat its ache in the breast and its gnawing vacant goneness    chapter xv  all that night saxon lay unsleeping without taking off her clothes and when she arose in the morning and washed her face and dressed her hair she was aware of a strange numbness of a feeling of constriction about her head as if it were bound by a heavy band of iron it seemed like a dull pressure upon her brain it was the beginning of an illness that she did not know as illness all she knew was that she felt queer it was not fever it was not cold her bodily health was as it should be and when she thought about it she put her condition down to nervesnerves according to her ideas and the ideas of her class being unconnected with disease  she had a strange feeling of loss of self of being a stranger to herself and the world in which she moved seemed a vague and shrouded world it lacked sharpness of definition its customary vividness was gone she had lapses of memory and was continually finding herself doing unplanned things thus to her astonishment she came to in the back yard hanging up the weeks wash she had no recollection of having done it yet it had been done precisely as it should have been done she had boiled the sheets and pillowslips and the table linen billys woolens had been washed in warm water only with the homemade soap the recipe of which mercedes had given her on investigation she found she had eaten a mutton chop for breakfast this meant that she had been to the butcher shop yet she had no memory of having gone curiously she went into the bedroom the bed was made up and everything in order  at twilight she came upon herself in the front room seated by the window crying in an ecstasy of joy at first she did not know what this joy was then it came to her that it was because she had lost her baby a blessing a blessing she was chanting aloud wringing her hands but with joy she knew it was with joy that she wrung her hands  the days came and went she had little notion of time sometimes centuries agone it seemed to her it was since billy had gone to jail at other times it was no more than the night before but through it all two ideas persisted she must not go to see billy in jail it was a blessing she had lost her baby  once bud strothers came to see her she sat in the front room and talked with him noting with fascination that there were fringes to the heels of his trousers another day the business agent of the union called she told him as she had told bud strothers that everything was all right that she needed nothing that she could get along comfortably until billy came out  a fear began to haunt her when he came out no it must not be there must not be another baby it might live no no a thousand times no it must not be she would run away first she would never see billy again anything but that anything but that  this fear persisted in her nightmareridden sleep it became an accomplished fact so that she would awake trembling in a cold sweat crying out her sleep had become wretched sometimes she was convinced that she did not sleep at all and she knew that she had insomnia and remembered that it was of insomnia her mother had died  she came to herself one day sitting in doctor hentleys office he was looking at her in a puzzled way  got plenty to eat he was asking  she nodded  any serious trouble  she shook her head  everythings all right doctor except  yes yes he encouraged  and then she knew why she had come simply explicitly she told him he shook his head slowly  it cant be done little woman he said  oh but it can she cried i know it can  i dont mean that he answered i mean i cant tell you i dare not it is against the law there is a doctor in leavenworth prison right now for that  in vain she pleaded with him he instanced his own wife and children whose existence forbade his imperiling  besides there is no likelihood now he told her  but there will be there is sure to be she urged  but he could only shake his head sadly  why do you want to know he questioned finally  saxon poured her heart out to him she told of her first year of happiness with billy of the hard times caused by the labor troubles of the change in billy so that there was no lovelife left of her own deep horror not if it died she concluded she could go through that again but if it should live billy would soon be out of jail and then the danger would begin it was only a few words she would never tell any one wild horses could not drag it out of her  but doctor hentley continued to shake his head i cant tell you little woman its a shame but i cant take the risk my hands are tied our laws are all wrong i have to consider those who are dear to me  it was when she got up to go that he faltered come here he said sit closer  he prepared to whisper in her ear then with a sudden excess of caution crossed the room swiftly opened the door and looked out when he sat down again he drew his chair so close to hers that the arms touched and when he whispered his beard tickled her ear  no no he shut her off when she tried to voice her gratitude i have told you nothing you were here to consult me about your general health you are run down out of condition  as he talked he moved her toward the door when he opened it a patient for the dentist in the adjoining office was standing in the hall doctor hentley lifted his voice  what you need is that tonic i prescribed remember that and dont pamper your appetite when it comes back eat strong nourishing food and beefsteak plenty of beefsteak and dont cook it to a cinder good day  at times the silent cottage became unendurable and saxon would throw a shawl about her head and walk out the oakland mole or cross the railroad yards and the marshes to sandy beach where billy had said he used to swim also by going out the transit slip by climbing down the piles on a precarious ladder of iron spikes and by crossing a boom of logs she won access to the rock wall that extended far out into the bay and that served as a barrier between the mudflats and the tidescoured channel of oakland estuary here the fresh sea breezes blew and oakland sank down to a smudge of smoke behind her while across the bay she could see the smudge that represented san francisco ocean steamships passed up and down the estuary and loftymasted ships towed by redstacked tugs  she gazed at the sailors on the ships wondered on what far voyages and to what far lands they went wondered what freedoms were theirs or were they girt in by as remorseless and cruel a world as the dwellers in oakland were were they as unfair as unjust as brutal in their dealings with their fellows as were the city dwellers it did not seem so and sometimes she wished herself on board outbound going anywhere she cared not where so long as it was away from the world to which she had given her best and which had trampled her in return  she did not know always when she left the house nor where her feet took her once she came to herself in a strange part of oakland the street was wide and lined with rows of shade trees velvet lawns broken only by cement sidewalks ran down to the gutters the houses stood apart and were large in her vocabulary they were mansions what had shocked her to consciousness of herself was a young man in the drivers seat of a touring car standing at the curb he was looking at her curiously and she recognized him as roy blanchard whom in front of the forum billy had threatened to whip beside the car bareheaded stood another young man he too she remembered he it was at the sunday picnic where she first met billy who had thrust his cane between the legs of the flying footracer and precipitated the freeforall fight like blanchard he was looking at her curiously and she became aware that she had been talking to herself the babble of her lips still beat in her ears she blushed a rising tide of shame heating her face and quickened her pace blanchard sprang out of the car and came to her with lifted hat is anything the matter he asked  she shook her head and though she had stopped she evinced her desire to go on  i know you he said studying her face you were with the striker who promised me a licking  he is my husband she said  oh good for him he regarded her pleasantly and frankly but about yourself isnt there anything i can do for you something is the matter  no im all right she answered i have been sick she lied for she never dreamed of connecting her queerness with sickness  you look tired he pressed her i can take you in the machine and run you anywhere you want it wont be any trouble ive plenty of time  saxon shook her head  if if you would tell me where i can catch the eighth street cars i dont often come to this part of town  he told her where to find an electric car and what transfers to make and she was surprised at the distance she had wandered  thank you she said and good bye  sure i cant do anything now  sure  well good bye he smiled good humoredly and tell that husband of yours to keep in good condition im likely to make him need it all when he tangles up with me  oh but you cant fight with him she warned you mustnt you havent got a show  good for you he admired thats the way for a woman to stand up for her man now the average woman would be so afraid he was going to get licked  but im not afraid for him its for you hes a terrible fighter you wouldnt have any chance it would be like like  like taking candy from a baby blanchard finished for her  yes she nodded thats just what he would call it and whenever he tells you you are standing on your foot watch out for him now i must go good bye and thank you again  she went on down the sidewalk his cheery good bye ringing in her ears he was kindshe admitted it honestly yet he was one of the clever ones one of the masters who according to billy were responsible for all the cruelty to labor for the hardships of the women for the punishment of the labor men who were wearing stripes in san quentin or were in the death cells awaiting the scaffold yet he was kind sweet natured clean good she could read his character in his face but how could this be if he were responsible for so much evil she shook her head wearily there was no explanation no understanding of this world which destroyed little babes and bruised womens breasts  as for her having strayed into that neighborhood of fine residences she was unsurprised it was in line with her queerness she did so many things without knowing that she did them but she must be careful it was better to wander on the marshes and the rock wall  especially she liked the rock wall there was a freedom about it a wide spaciousness that she found herself instinctively trying to breathe holding her arms out to embrace and make part of herself it was a more natural world a more rational world she could understand itunderstand the green crabs with whitebleached claws that scuttled before her and which she could see pasturing on greenweeded rocks when the tide was low here hopelessly manmade as the great wall was nothing seemed artificial there were no men here no laws nor conflicts of men the tide flowed and ebbed the sun rose and set regularly each afternoon the brave west wind came romping in through the golden gate darkening the water cresting tiny wavelets making the sailboats fly everything ran with frictionless order everything was free firewood lay about for the taking no man sold it by the sack small boys fished with poles from the rocks with no one to drive them away for trespass catching fish as billy had caught fish as cal hutchins had caught fish billy had told her of the great perch cal hutchins caught on the day of the eclipse when he had little dreamed the heart of his manhood would be spent in convicts garb  and here was food food that was free she watched the small boys on a day when she had eaten nothing and emulated them gathering mussels from the rocks at low water cooking them by placing them among the coals of a fire she built on top of the wall they tasted particularly good she learned to knock the small oysters from the rocks and once she found a string of freshcaught fish some small boy had forgotten to take home with him  here drifted evidences of mans sinister handiworkfrom a distance from the cities one flood tide she found the water covered with muskmelons they bobbed and bumped along up the estuary in countless thousands where they stranded against the rocks she was able to get them but each and every melonand she patiently tried scores of themhad been spoiled by a sharp gash that let in the salt water she could not understand she asked an old portuguese woman gathering driftwood  they do it the people who have too much the old woman explained straightening her laborstiffened back with such an effort that almost saxon could hear it creak the old womans black eyes flashed angrily and her wrinkled lips drawn tightly across toothless gums wry with bitterness the people that have too much it is to keep up the price they throw them overboard in san francisco  but why dont they give them away to the poor people saxon asked  they must keep up the price  but the poor people cannot buy them anyway saxon objected it would not hurt the price  the old woman shrugged her shoulders  i do not know it is their way they chop each melon so that the poor people cannot fish them out and eat anyway they do the same with the oranges with the apples ah the fishermen there is a trust when the boats catch too much fish the trust throws them overboard from fisherman wharf boatloads and boatloads and boatloads of the beautiful fish and the beautiful good fish sink and are gone and no one gets them yet they are dead and only good to eat fish are very good to eat  and saxon could not understand a world that did such thingsa world in which some men possessed so much food that they threw it away paying men for their labor of spoiling it before they threw it away and in the same world so many people who did not have enough food whose babies died because their mothers milk was not nourishing whose young men fought and killed one another for the chance to work whose old men and women went to the poorhouse because there was no food for them in the little shacks they wept at leaving she wondered if all the world were that way and remembered mercedes tales yes all the world was that way had not mercedes seen ten thousand families starve to death in that far away india when as she had said her own jewels that she wore would have fed and saved them all it was the poorhouse and the salt vats for the stupid jewels and automobiles for the clever ones  she was one of the stupid she must be the evidence all pointed that way yet saxon refused to accept it she was not stupid her mother had not been stupid nor had the pioneer stock before her still it must be so here she sat nothing to eat at home her lovehusband changed to a brute beast and lying in jail her arms and heart empty of the babe that would have been there if only the stupid ones had not made a shambles of her front yard in their wrangling over jobs  she sat there racking her brain the smudge of oakland at her back staring across the bay at the smudge of ban francisco yet the sun was good the wind was good as was the keen salt air in her nostrils the blue sky flecked with clouds was good all the natural world was right and sensible and beneficent it was the manworld that was wrong and mad and horrible why were the stupid stupid was it a law of god no it could not be god had made the wind and air and sun the manworld was made by man and a rotten job it was yet and she remembered it well the teaching in the orphan asylum god had made everything her mother too had believed this had believed in this god things could not be different it was ordained  for a time saxon sat crushed helpless then smoldered protest revolt vainly she asked why god had it in for her what had she done to deserve such fate she briefly reviewed her life in quest of deadly sins committed and found them not she had obeyed her mother obeyed cady the saloonkeeper and cadys wife obeyed the matron and the other women in the orphan asylum obeyed tom when she came to live in his house and never run in the streets because he didnt wish her to at school she had always been honorably promoted and never had her deportment report varied from one hundred per cent she had worked from the day she left school to the day of her marriage she had been a good worker too the little jew who ran the paper box factory had almost wept when she quit it was the same at the cannery she was among the highline weavers when the jute mills closed down i and she had kept straight it was not as if she had been ugly or unattractive she had known her temptations and encountered her dangers the fellows had been crazy about her they had run after her fought over her in a way to turn most girls heads but she had kept straight and then had come billy her reward she had devoted herself to him to his house to all that would nourish his love and now she and billy were sinking down into this senseless vortex of misery and heartbreak of the manmade world  no god was not responsible she could have made a better world herselfa finer squarer world this being so then there was no god god could not make a botch the matron had been wrong her mother had been wrong then there was no immortality and bert wild and crazy bert falling at her front gate with his foolish deathcry was right one was a long time dead  looking thus at life shorn of its superrational sanctions saxon floundered into the morass of pessimism there was no justification for right conduct in the universe no square deal for her who had earned reward for the millions who worked like animals died like animals and were a long time and forever dead like the hosts of more learned thinkers before her she concluded that the universe was unmoral and without concern for men  and now she sat crushed in greater helplessness than when she had included god in the scheme of injustice as long as god was there was always chance for a miracle for some supernatural intervention some rewarding with ineffable bliss with god missing the world was a trap life was a trap she was like a linnet caught by small boys and imprisoned in a cage that was because the linnet was stupid but she rebelled she fluttered and beat her soul against the hard face of things as did the linnet against the bars of wire she was not stupid she did not belong in the trap she would fight her way out of the trap there must be such a way out when canal boys and railsplitters the lowliest of the stupid lowly as she had read in her school history could find their way out and become presidents of the nation and rule over even the clever ones in their automobiles then could she find her way out and win to the tiny reward she cravedbilly a little love a little happiness she would not mind that the universe was unmoral that there was no god no immortality she was willing to go into the black grave and remain in its blackness forever to go into the salt vats and let the young men cut her dead flesh to sausagemeat ifif only she could get her small meed of happiness first  how she would work for that happiness how she would appreciate it make the most of each least particle of it but how was she to do it where was the path she could not vision it her eyes showed her only the smudge of san francisco the smudge of oakland where men were breaking heads and killing one another where babies were dying born and unborn and where women were weeping with bruised breasts    chapter xvi  her vague unreal existence continued it seemed in some previous lifetime that billy had gone away that another lifetime would have to come before he returned she still suffered from insomnia long nights passed in succession during which she never closed her eyes at other times she slept through long stupors waking stunned and numbed scarcely able to open her heavy eyes to move her weary limbs the pressure of the iron band on her head never relaxed she was poorly nourished nor had she a cent of money she often went a whole day without eating once seventytwo hours elapsed without food passing her lips she dug clams in the marsh knocked the tiny oysters from the rocks and gathered mussels  and yet when bud strothers came to see how she was getting along she convinced him that all was well one evening after work tom came and forced two dollars upon her he was terribly worried he would like to help more but sarah was expecting another baby there had been slack times in his trade because of the strikes in the other trades he did not know what the country was coming to and it was all so simple all they had to do was see things in his way and vote the way he voted then everybody would get a square deal christ was a socialist he told her  christ died two thousand years ago saxon said  well tom queried not catching her implication  think she said think of all the men and women who died in those two thousand years and socialism has not come yet and in two thousand years more it may be as far away as ever tom your socialism never did you any good it is a dream  it wouldnt be if he began with a flash of resentment  if they believed as you do only they dont you dont succeed in making them  but we are increasing every year he argued  two thousand years is an awfully long time she said quietly  her brothers tired face saddened as he noted then he sighed  well saxon if its a dream it is a good dream  i dont want to dream was her reply i want things real i want them now  and before her fancy passed the countless generations of the stupid lowly the billys and saxons the berts and marys the toms and sarahs and to what end the salt vats and the grave mercedes was a hard and wicked woman but mercedes was right the stupid must always be under the heels of the clever ones only she saxon daughter of daisy who had written wonderful poems and of a soldierfather on a roan warhorse daughter of the strong generations who hall won half a world from wild nature and the savage indianno she was not stupid it was as if she suffered false imprisonment there was some mistake she would find the way out  with the two dollars she bought a sack of flour and half a sack of potatoes this relieved the monotony of her clams and mussels like the italian and portuguese women she gathered driftwood and carried it home though always she did it with shamed pride timing her arrival so that it would be after dark one day on the mudflat side of the rock wall an italian fishing boat hauled up on the sand dredged from the channel from the top of the wall saxon watched the men grouped about the charcoal brazier eating crusty italian bread and a stew of meat and vegetables washed down with long draughts of thin red wine she envied them their freedom that advertised itself in the heartiness of their meal in the tones of their chatter and laughter in the very boat itself that was not tied always to one place and that carried them wherever they willed afterward they dragged a seine across the mudflats and up on the sand selecting for themselves only the larger kinds of fish many thousands of small fish like sardines they left dying on the sand when they sailed away saxon got a sackful of the fish and was compelled to make two trips in order to carry them home where she salted them down in a wooden washtubs  her lapses of consciousness continued the strangest thing she did while in such condition was on sandy beach there she discovered herself one windy afternoon lying in a hole she had dug with sacks for blankets she had even roofed the hole in rough fashion by means of drift wood and marsh grass on top of the grass she had piled sand  another time she came to herself walking across the marshes a bundle of driftwood tied with balerope on her shoulder charley long was walking beside her she could see his face in the starlight she wondered dully how long he had been talking what he had said then she was curious to hear what he was saying she was not afraid despite his strength his wicked nature and the loneliness and darkness of the marsh  its a shame for a girl like you to have to do this he was saying apparently in repetition of what he had already urged come on an say the word saxon come on an say the word  saxon stopped and quietly faced him  listen charley long billys only doing thirty days and his time is almost up when he gets out your life wont be worth a pinch of salt if i tell him youve been bothering me now listen if you go right now away from here and stay away i wont tell him thats all ive got to say  the big blacksmith stood in scowling indecisions his face pathetic in its fierce yearning his hands making unconscious clutching contractions  why you little small thing he said desperately i could break you in one hand i couldwhy i could do anything i wanted i dont want to hurt you saxon you know that just say the word  ive said the only word im going to say  god he muttered in involuntary admiration you aint afraid you aint afraid  they faced each other for long silent minutes  why aint you afraid he demanded at last after peering into the surrounding darkness as if searching for her hidden allies  because i married a man saxon said briefly and now youd better go  when he had gone she shifted the load of wood to her other shoulder and started on in her breast a quiet thrill of pride in billy though behind prison bars still she leaned against his strength the mere naming of him was sufficient to drive away a brute like charley long  on the day that otto frank was hanged she remained indoors the evening papers published the account there had been no reprieve in sacramento was a railroad governor who might reprieve or even pardon bankwreckers and grafters but who dared not lift his finger for a workingman all this was the talk of the neighborhood it had been billys talk it had been berts talk  the next day saxon started out the rock wall and the specter of otto frank walked by her side and with him was a dimmer mistier specter that she recognized as billy was he too destined to tread his way to otto franks dark end surely so if the blood and strike continued he was a fighter he felt he was right in fighting it was easy to kill a man even if he did not intend it some time when he was slugging a scab the scab would fracture his skull on a stone curbing or a cement sidewalk and then billy would hang that was why otto frank hanged he had not intended to kill henderson it was only by accident that hendersons skull was fractured yet otto frank had been hanged for it just the same  she wrung her hands and wept loudly as she stumbled among the windy rocks the hours passed and she was lost to herself and her grief when she came to she found herself on the far end of the wall where it jutted into the bay between the oakland and alameda moles but she could see no wall it was the time of the full moon and the unusual high tide covered the rocks she was knee deep in the water and about her knees swam scores of big rock rats squeaking and fighting scrambling to climb upon her out of the flood she screamed with fright and horror and kicked at them some dived and swam away under water others circled about her warily at a distance and one big fellow laid his teeth into her shoe him she stepped on and crushed with her free foot by this time though still trembling she was able coolly to consider the situation she waded to a stout stick of driftwood a few feet away and with this quickly cleared a space about herself  a grinning small boy in a small brightpainted and halfdecked skiff sailed close in to the wall and let go his sheet to spill the wind want to get aboard he called  yes she answered there are thousands of big rats here im afraid of them  he nodded ran close in spilled the wind from his sail the boats way carrying it gently to her  shove out its bow he commanded thats right i dont want to break my centerboard an then jump aboard in the sternquickalongside of me  she obeyed stepping in lightly beside him he held the tiller up with his elbow pulled in on the sheet and as the sail filled the boat sprang away over the rippling water  you know boats the boy said approvingly  he was a slender almost frail lad of twelve or thirteen years though healthy enough with sunburned freckled face and large gray eyes that were clear and wistful  despite his possession of the pretty boat saxon was quick to sense that he was one of them a child of the people  first boat i was ever in except ferryboats saxon laughed  he looked at her keenly well you take to it like a duck to water is all i can say about it where dye want me to land you  anywhere  he opened his mouth to speak gave her another long look considered for a space then asked suddenly got plenty of time  she nodded  all day  again she nodded  sayill tell you im goin out on this ebb to goat island for rockcod an ill come in on the flood this evening i got plenty of lines an bait want to come along we can both fish and what you catch you can have  saxon hesitated the freedom and motion of the small boat appealed to her like the ships she had envied it was outbound  maybe youll drown me she parleyed  the boy threw back his head with pride  i guess ive been sailin many a long day by myself an i aint drowned yet  all right she consented though remember i dont know anything about boats  aw thats all rightnow im goin to go about when i say hard alee like that you duck your head so the boom dont hit you an shift over to the other side  he executed the maneuver saxon obeyed and found herself sitting beside him on the opposite side of the boat while the boat itself on the other tack was heading toward long wharf where the coal bunkers were she was aglow with admiration the more so because the mechanics of boatsailing was to her a complex and mysterious thing  where did you learn it all she inquired  taught myself just naturally taught myself i liked it you see an what a fellow likes hes likeliest to do this is my second boat my first didnt have a centerboard i bought it for two dollars an learned a lot though it never stopped leaking what d ye think i paid for this one its worth twentyfive dollars right now what d ye think i paid for it  i give up saxon said how much  six dollars think of it a boat like this of course i done a lot of work an the sail cost two dollars the oars one forty an the paint one seventyfive but just the same eleven dollars and fifteen cents is a real bargain it took me a long time saving for it though i carry papers morning and eveningtheres a boy taking my route for me this afternooni give m ten cents an all the extras he sells is his and id agot the boat sooner only i had to pay for my shorthand lessons my mother wants me to become a court reporter they get sometimes as much as twenty dollars a day gee but i dont want it its a shame to waste the money on the lessons  what do you want she asked partly from idleness and yet with genuine curiosity for she felt drawn to this boy in knee pants who was so confident and at the same time so wistful  what do i want he repeated after her  turning his head slowly he followed the skyline pausing especially when his eyes rested landward on the brown contra costa hills and seaward past alcatraz on the golden glate the wistfulness in his eyes was overwhelming and went to her heart  that he said sweeping the circle of the world with a wave of his arm  that she queried  he looked at her perplexed in that he had not made his meaning clear  dont you ever feel that way he asked bidding for sympathy with his dream dont you sometimes feel youd die if you didnt know whats beyond them hills an whats beyond the other hills behind them hills an the golden gate theres the pacific ocean beyond and china an japan an india an an all the coral islands you can go anywhere out through the golden gateto australia to africa to the seal islands to the north pole to cape horn why all them places are just waitin for me to come an see em ive lived in oakland all my life but im not going to live in oakland the rest of my life not by a long shot im goin to get away away  again as words failed to express the vastness of his desire the wave of his arm swept the circle of the world  saxon thrilled with him she too save for her earlier childhood had lived in oakland all her life and it had been a good place in which to live until now and now in all its nightmare horror it was a place to get away from as with her people the east had been a place to get away from and why not the world tugged at her and she felt in touch with the lads desire now that she thought of it her race had never been given to staying long in one place always it had been on the move she remembered back to her mothers tales and to the wood engraving in her scrapbook where her halfclad forebears sword in hand leaped from their lean beaked boats to do battle on the blooddrenched sands of england  did you ever hear about the anglosaxons she asked the boy  you bet his eyes glistened and he looked at her with new interest im an anglosaxon every inch of me look at the color of my eyes my skin im awful white where i aint sunburned an my hair was yellow when i was a baby my mother says itll be dark brown by the time im grown up worse luck just the same im anglosaxon i am of a fighting race we aint afraid of nothin this baythink im afraid of it he looked out over the water with flashing eye of scorn why ive crossed it when it was howlin an when the scow schooner sailors said i lied an that i didnt huh they were only squareheads why we licked their kind thousands of years ago we lick everything we go up against weve wandered all over the world licking the world on the sea on the land its all the same look at ivory nelson look at davy crockett look at paul jones look at clive an kitchener an fremont an kit carson an all of em  saxon nodded while he continued her own eyes shining and it came to her what a glory it would be to be the mother of a manchild like this her body ached with the fancied quickening of unborn life a good stock a good stock she thought to herself then she thought of herself and billy healthy shoots of that same stock yet condemned to childlessness because of the trap of the manmade world and the curse of being herded with the stupid ones  she came back to the boy  my father was a soldier in the civil war he was telling her a scout an a spy the rebels were going to hang him twice for a spy at the battle of wilsons creek he ran half a mile with his captain wounded on his back hes got a bullet in his leg right now just above the knee its been there all these years he let me feel it once he was a buffalo hunter and a trapper before the war he was sheriff of his county when he was twenty years old an after the war when he was marshal of silver city he cleaned out the bad men an gunfighters hes been in almost every state in the union he could wrestle any man at the railings in his day an he was bully of the raftsmen of the susquehanna when he was only a youngster his father killed a man in a standup fight with a blow of his fist when he was sixty years old an when he was seventyfour his second wife had twins an he died when he was plowing in the field with oxen when he was ninetynine years old he just unyoked the oxen an sat down under a tree an died there sitting up an my fathers just like him hes pretty old now but he aint afraid of nothing hes a regular anglosaxon you see hes a special policeman an he didnt do a thing to the strikers in some of the fightin he had his face all cut up with a rock but he broke his club short off over some hoodlums head  he paused breathlessly and looked at her  gee he said id hate to aben that hoodlum  my name is saxon she said  your name  my first name  gee he cried youre lucky now if mine had been only erlingyou know erling the boldor wolf or swen or jarl  what is it she asked  only john he admitted sadly but i dont let em call one john everybodys got to call me jack ive scrapped with a dozen fellows that tried to call me john or johnniewouldnt that make you sickjohnnie  they were now off the coal bunkers of long wharf and the boy put the skiff about heading toward san francisco they were well out in the open bay the west wind had strengthened and was whitecapping the strong ebb tide the boat drove merrily along when splashes of spray flew aboard wetting them saxon laughed and the boy surveyed her with approval they passed a ferryboat and the passengers on the upper deck crowded to one side to watch them in the swell of the steamers wake the skiff shipped quarterfull of water saxon picked up an empty can and looked at the boy  thats right he said go ahead an bale out and when she had finished well fetch goat island next tack right there off the torpedo station is where we fish in fifty feet of water an the tide runnin to beat the band youre wringing wet aint you gee youre like your name youre a saxon all right are you married  saxon nodded and the boy frowned  whatd you want to do that for now you cant wander over the world like im going to youre tied down youre anchored for keeps  its pretty good to be married though she smiled  sure everybody gets married but thats no reason to be in a rush about it why couldnt you wait a while like me im goin to get married too but not until im an old man an have been everywheres  under the lee of goat island saxon obediently sitting still he took in the sail and when the boat had drifted to a position to suit him he dropped a tiny anchor he got out the fish lines and showed saxon how to bait her hooks with salted minnows then they dropped the lines to bottom where they vibrated in the swift tide and waited for bites  theyll bite pretty soon he encouraged ive never failed but twice to catch a mess here what dye say we eat while were waiting  vainly she protested she was not hungry he shared his lunch with her with a boys rigid equity even to the half of a hardboiled egg and the half of a big red apple  still the rockcod did not bite from under the sternsheets he drew out a clothbound book  free library he vouchsafed as he began to read with one hand holding the place while with the other he waited for the tug on the fishline that would announce rockcod  saxon read the title it was afloat in the forest  listen to this he said after a few minutes and he read several pages descriptive of a great flooded tropical forest being navigated by boys on a raft  think of that he concluded thats the amazon river in flood time in south america and the worlds full of places like thateverywhere most likely except oakland oaklands just a place to start from i guess now thats adventure i want to tell you just think of the luck of them boys all the same some day im going to go over the andes to the headwaters of the amazon all through the rubber country an canoe down the amazon thousands of miles to its mouth where its that wide you cant see one bank from the other an where you can scoop up perfectly fresh water out of the ocean a hundred miles from land  but saxon was not listening one pregnant sentence had caught her fancy oakland just a place to start from she had never viewed the city in that light she had accepted it as a place to live in as an end in itself but a place to start from why not why not like any railroad station or ferry depot certainly as things were going oakland was not a place to stop in the boy was right it was a place to start from but to go where here she was halted and she was driven from the train of thought by a strong pull and a series of jerks on the line she began to haul in hand under hand rapidly and deftly the boy encouraging her until hooks sinker and a big gasping rockcod tumbled into the bottom of the boat the fish was free of the hook and she baited afresh and dropped the line over the boy marked his place and closed the book  theyll be biting soon as fast as we can haul em in he said  but the rush of fish did not come immediately  did you ever read captain mayne reid he asked or captain marryatt or ballantyne  she shook her head  and you an anglosaxon he cried derisively why theres stacks of em in the free library i have two cards my mothers an mine an i draw em out all the time after school before i have to carry my papers i stick the books inside my shirt in front under the suspenders that holds em one time deliverin papers at second an markettheres an awful tough gang of kids hang out therei got into a fight with the leader he hauled off to knock my wind out an he landed square on a book you ought to seen his face an then i landed on him an then his whole gang was goin to jump on me only a couple of ironmolders stepped in an saw fair play i gave em the books to hold  who won saxon asked  nobody the boy confessed reluctantly i think i was lickin him but the molders called it a draw because the policeman on the beat stopped us when wed only teen fightin half an hour but you ought to seen the crowd i bet there was five hundred  he broke off abruptly and began hauling in his line saxon too was hauling in and in the next couple of hours they caught twenty pounds of fish between them  that night long after dark the little halfdecked skiff sailed up the oakland estuary the wind was fair but light and the boat moved slowly towing a long pile which the boy had picked up adrift and announced as worth three dollars anywhere for the wood that was in it the tide flooded smoothly under the full moon and saxon recognized the points they passedthe transit slip sandy beach the shipyards the nail works market street wharf the boy took the skiff in to a dilapidated boatwharf at the foot of castro street where the scow schooners laden with sand and gravel lay hauled to the shore in a long row he insisted upon an equal division of the fish because saxon had helped catch them though he explained at length the ethics of flotsam to show her that the pile was wholly his  at seventh and poplar they separated saxon walking on alone to pine street with her load of fish tired though she was from the long day she had a strange feeling of wellbeing and after cleaning the fish she fell asleep wondering when good times came again if she could persuade billy to get a boat and go out with her on sundays as she had gone out that day    chapter vii  she slept all night without stirring without dreaming and awoke naturally and for the first time in weeks refreshed she felt her old self as if some depressing weight had been lifted or a shadow had been swept away from between her and the sun her head was clear the seeming iron band that had pressed it so hard was gone she was cheerful she even caught herself humming aloud as she divided the fish into messes for mrs olsen maggie donahue and herself she enjoyed her gossip with each of them and returning home plunged joyfully into the task of putting the neglected house in order she sang as she worked and ever as she sang the magic words of the boy danced and sparkled among the notes oakland is just a place to start from  everything was clear as print her and billys problem was as simple as an arithmetic problem at school to carpet a room so many feet long so many feet wide to paper a room so many feet high so many feet around she had been sick in her head she had had strange lapses she had been irresponsible very well all this had been because of her troublestroubles in which she had had no hand in the making billys case was hers precisely he had behaved strangely because he had been irresponsible and all their troubles were the troubles of the trap oakland was the trap oakland was a good place to start from  she reviewed the events of her married life the strikes and the hard times had caused everything if it had not been for the strike of the shopmen and the fight in her front yard she would not have lost her baby if billy had not been made desperate by the idleness and the hopeless fight of the teamsters he would not have taken to drinking if they had not been hard up they would not have taken a lodger and billy would not be in jail  her mind was made up the city was no place for her and billy no place for love nor for babies the way out was simple they would leave oakland it was the stupid that remained and bowed their heads to fate but she and billy were not stupid they would not bow their heads they would go forth and face fatewhere she did not know but that would come the world was large beyond the encircling hills out through the golden gate somewhere they would find what they desired the boy had been wrong in one thing she was not tied to oakland even if she was married the world was free to her and billy as it had been free to the wandering generations before them it was only the stupid who had been left behind everywhere in the races wandering the strong had gone on well she and billy were strong they would go on over the brown contra costa hills or out through the golden gate  the day before billys release saxon completed her meager preparations to receive him she was without money and except for her resolve not to offend billy in that way again she would have borrowed ferry fare from maggie donahue and journeyed to san francisco to sell some of her personal pretties as it was with bread and potatoes and salted sardines in the house she went out at the afternoon low tide and dug clams for a chowder also she gathered a load of driftwood and it was nine in the evening when she emerged from the marsh on her shoulder a bundle of wood and a shorthandled spade in her free hand the pail of clams she sought the darker side of the street at the corner and hurried across the zone of electric light to avoid detection by the neighbors but a woman came toward her looked sharply and stopped in front of her it was mary  my god saxon she exclaimed is it as bad as this  saxon looked at her old friend curiously with a swift glance that sketched all the tragedy mary was thinner though there was more color in her cheekscolor of which saxon had her doubts marys bright eyes were handsomer largertoo large too feverish bright too restless she was well dressedtoo well dressed and she was suffering from nerves she turned her head apprehensively to glance into the darkness behind her  my god saxon breathed and you she shut her lips then began anew come along to the house she said  if youre ashamed to be seen with me mary blurted with one of her old quick angers  no no saxon disclaimed its the driftwood and the clams i dont want the neighbors to know come along  no i cant saxon id like to but i cant ive got to catch the next train to frisco ive ben waitin around i knocked at your back door but the house was dark billys still in aint he  yes he gets out tomorrow  i read about it in the papers mary went on hurriedly looking behind her i was in stockton when it happened she turned upon saxon almost savagely you dont blame me do you i just couldnt go back to work after bein married i was sick of work played out i guess an no good anyway but if you only knew how i hated the laundry even before i got married its a dirty world you dont dream saxon honest to god you could never guess a hundredth part of its dirtiness oh i wish i was dead i wish i was dead an out of it all listenno i cant now theres the down train puffin at adeline ill have to run for it can i come  aw get a move on cant you a mans voice interrupted  behind her the speaker had partly emerged from the darkness no workingman saxon could see thatlower in the world scale despite his good clothes than any workingman  im comin if youll only wait a second mary placated  and by her answer and its accents saxon knew that mary was afraid of this man who prowled on the rim of light  mary turned to her  i got to beat it good bye she said fumbling in the palm of her glove  she caught saxons free hand and saxon felt a small hot coin pressed into it she tried to resist to force it back  no no mary pleaded for old times you can do as much for me some day ill see you again good bye  suddenly sobbing she threw her arms around saxons waist crushing the feathers of her hat against the load of wood as she pressed her face against saxons breast then she tore herself away to arms length passionate queering and stood gazing at saxon  aw get a hustle get a hustle came from the darkness the peremptory voice of the man  oh saxon mary sobbed and was gone  in the house the lamp lighted saxon looked at the coin it was a fivedollar pieceto her a fortune then she thought of mary and of the man of whom she was afraid saxon registered another black mark against oakland mary was one more destroyed they lived only five years on the average saxon had heard somewhere she looked at the coin and tossed it into the kitchen sink when she cleaned the clams she heard the coin tinkle down the vent pipe  it was the thought of billy next morning that led saxon to go under the sink unscrew the cap to the catchtrap and rescue the fivedollar piece prisoners were not well fed she had been told and the thought of placing clams and dry bread before billy after thirty days of prison fare was too appalling for her to contemplate she knew how he liked to spread his butter on thick how he liked thick rare steak fried on a dry hot pan and how he liked coffee that was coffee and plenty of it  not until after nine oclock did billy arrive and she was dressed in her prettiest house gingham to meet him she peeped on him as he came slowly up the front steps and she would have run out to him except for a group of neighborhood children who were staring from across the street the door opened before him as his hand reached for the knob and inside he closed it by backing against it for his arms were filled with saxon no he had not had breakfast nor did he want any now that he had her he had only stopped for a shave he had stood the barber off and he had walked all the way from the city hall because of lack of the nickel carfare but hed like a bath most mighty well and a change of clothes she mustnt come near him until he was clean  when all this was accomplished he sat in the kitchen and watched her cook noting the driftwood she put in the stove and asking about it while she moved about she told how she had gathered the wood how she had managed to live and not be beholden to the union and by the time they were seated at the table she was telling him about her meeting with mary the night before she did not mention the five dollars  billy stopped chewing the first mouthful of steak his expression frightened her he spat the meat out on his plate  you got the money to buy the meat from her he accused slowly you had no money no more tick with the butcher yet heres meat am i right  saxon could only bend her head  the terrifying ageless look had come into his face the bleak and passionless glaze into his eyes which she had first seen on the day at weasel park when he had fought with the three irishmen  what else did you buy he demandednot roughly not angrily but with the fearful coldness of a rage that words could not express  to her surprise she had grown calm what did it matter it was merely what one must expect living in oaklandsomething to be left behind when oakland was a thing behind a place started from  the coffee she answered and the butter  he emptied his plate of meat and her plate into the frying pan likewise the roll of butter and the slice on the table and on top he poured the contents of the coffee canister all this he carried into the back yard and dumped in the garbage can the coffee pot he emptied into the sink how much of the money you got left he next wanted to know  saxon had already gone to her purse and taken it out  three dollars and eighty cents she counted handing it to him i paid fortyfive cents for the steak  he ran his eye over the money counted it and went to the front door she heard the door open and close and knew that the silver had been flung into the street when he came back to the kitchen saxon was already serving him fried potatoes on a clean plate  nothins too good for the robertses he said but by god that sort of truck is too high for my stomach its so high it stinks  he glanced at the fried potatoes the fresh slice of dry bread and the glass of water she was placing by his plate  its all right she smiled as he hesitated theres nothing left thats tainted  he shot a swift glance at her face as if for sarcasm then sighed and sat down almost immediately he was up again and holding out his arms to her  im goin to eat in a minute but i want to talk to you first he said sitting down and holding her closely besides that water aint like coffee gettin cold wont spoil it none now listen youre the only one i got in this world you wasnt afraid of me an what i just done an im glad of that now well forget all about mary i got charity enough im just as sorry for her as you id do anything for her id wash her feet for her like christ did id let her eat at my table an sleep under my roof but all that aint no reason i should touch anything shes earned now forget her its you an me saxon only you an me an to hell with the rest of the world nothing else counts you wont never have to be afraid of me again whisky an i dont mix very well so im goin to cut whisky out ive been clean off my nut an i aint treated you altogether right but thats all past it wont never happen again im goin to start out fresh  now take this thing i oughtnt to acted so hasty but i did i oughta talked it over but i didnt my damned temper got the best of me an you know i got one if a fellow can keep his temper in boxin why he can keep it in bein married too only this got me too suddenlike its something i cant stomach that i never could stomach an you wouldnt want me to any moren id want you to stomach something you just couldnt  she sat up straight on his knees and looked at him afire with an idea  you mean that billy  sure i do  then ill tell you something i cant stomach any more ill die if i have to  well he questioned after a searching pause  its up to you she said  then fire away  you dont know what youre letting yourself in for she warned maybe youd better back out before its too late  he shook his head stubbornly  what you dont want to stomach you aint goin to stomach let her go  first she commenced no more slugging of scabs  his mouth opened but he checked the involuntary protest  and second no more oakland  i dont get that last  no more oakland no more living in oakland ill die if i have to its pull up stakes and get out  he digested this slowly  where he asked finally  anywhere everywhere smoke a cigarette and think it over  he shook his head and studied her  you mean that he asked at length  i do i want to chuck oakland just as hard as you wanted to chuck the beefsteak the coffee and the butter  she could see him brace himself she could feel him brace his very body ere he answered  all right then if thats what you want well quit oakland well quit it cold god damn it anyway it never done nothin for me an i guess im husky enough to scratch for us both anywheres an now thats settled just tell me what you got it in for oakland for  and she told him all she had thought out marshaled all the facts in her indictment of oakland omitting nothing not even her last visit to doctor hentleys office nor billys drinking he but drew her closer and proclaimed his resolves anew the time passed the fried potatoes grew cold and the stove went out  when a pause came billy stood up still holding her he glanced at the fried potatoes  stone cold he said then turned to her come on put on your prettiest were goin up town for something to eat an to celebrate i guess we got a celebration comin seein as were going to pull up stakes an pull our freight from the old burg an we wont have to walk i can borrow a dime from the barber an i got enough junk to hock for a blowout  his junk proved to be several gold medals won in his amateur days at boxing tournaments once up town and in the pawnshop uncle sam seemed thoroughly versed in the value of the medals and billy jingled a handful of silver in his pocket as they walked out  he was as hilarious as a boy and she joined in his good spirits when he stopped at a corner cigar store to buy a sack of bull durham he changed his mind and bought imperials  oh im a regular devil he laughed nothings too good todaynot even tailormade smokes an no chop houses nor jap joints for you an me its barnums  they strolled to the restaurant at seventh and broadway where they had had their wedding supper  lets make believed were not married saxon suggested  sure he agreed an take a private room so as the waiterll have to knock on the door each time he comes in  saxon demurred at that  it will be too expensive billy youll have to tip him for the knocking well take the regular dining room  order anything you want billy said largely when they were seated heres family porterhouse a dollar an a half what dye say  and hashbrowned she abetted and coffee extra special and some oysters firsti want to compare them with the rock oysters  billy nodded and looked up from the bill of fare  heres mussels bordelay try an order of them too an see if they beat your rock wall ones  why not saxon cried her eyes dancing the world is ours were just travelers through this town  yep thats the stuff billy muttered absently he was looking at the theater column he lifted his eyes from the paper matinee at bells we can get reserved seats for a quarterdoggone the luck anyway  his exclamation was so aggrieved and violent that it brought alarm into her eyes  if id only thought he regretted we could agone to the forum for grub thats the swell joint where fellows like roy blanchard hangs out blowin the money we sweat for them  they bought reserved tickets at bells theater but it was too early for the performance and they went down broadway and into the electric theater to while away the time on a moving picture show a cowboy film was run off and a french comic then came a rural drama situated somewhere in the middle west it began with a farm yard scene the sun blazed down on a corner of a barn and on a rail fence where the ground lay in the mottled shade of large trees overhead there were chickens ducks and turkeys scratching waddling moving about a big sow followed by a rolypoly litter of seven little ones marched majestically through the chickens rooting them out of the way the hens in turn took it out on the little porkers pecking them when they strayed too far from their mother and over the top rail a horse looked drowsily on ever and anon at mathematically precise intervals switching a lazy tail that flashed high lights in the sunshine  its a warm day and there are fliescant you just feel it saxon whispered  sure an that horses tail its the most natural ever gee i bet he knows the trick of clampin it down over the reins i wouldnt wonder if his name was iron tail  a dog ran upon the scene the mother pig turned tail and with short ludicrous jumps followed by her progeny and pursued by the dog fled out of the film a young girl came on a sunbonnet hanging down her back her apron caught up in front and filled with grain which she threw to the buttering fowls pigeons flew down from the top of the film and joined in the scrambling feast the dog returned wading scarcely noticed among the feathered creatures to wag his tail and laugh up at the girl and behind the horse nodded over the rail and switched on a young man entered his errand immediately known to an audience educated in moving pictures but saxon had no eyes for the lovemaking the pleading forcefulness the shy reluctance of man and maid ever her gaze wandered back to the chickens to the mottled shade under the trees to the warm wall of the barn to the sleepy horse with its ever recurrent whisk of tail  she drew closer to billy and her hand passed around his arm sought his hand  oh billy she sighed id just die of happiness in a place like that and when the film was ended we got lots of time for bells lets stay and see that one over again  they sat through a repetition of the performance and when the farm yard scene appeared the longer saxon looked at it the more it affected her and this time she took in further details she saw fields beyond rolling hills in the background and a cloudflecked sky she identified some of the chickens especially an obstreperous old hen who resented the thrust of the sows muzzle particularly pecked at the little pigs and laid about her with a vengeance when the grain fell saxon looked back across the fields to the hills and sky breathing the spaciousness of it the freedom the content tears welled into her eyes and she wept silently happily  i know a trick thatd fix that old horse if he ever clamped his tail down on me billy whispered  now i know where were going when we leave oakland she informed him  where  there  he looked at her and followed her gaze to the screen oh he said and cogitated an why shouldnt we he added  oh billy will you  her lips trembled in her eagerness and her whisper broke and was almost inaudible sure he said it was his day of royal largess  what you want is yourn an ill scratch my fingers off for it an ive always had a hankerin for the country myself say ive known horses like that to sell for half the price an i can sure cure em of the habit    chapter xviii  it was early evening when they got off the car at seventh and pine on their way home from bells theater billy and saxon did their little marketing together then separated at the corner saxon to go on to the house and prepare supper billy to go and see the boysthe teamsters who had fought on in the strike during his month of retirement  take care of yourself billy she called as he started off  sure he answered turning his face to her over his shoulder  her heart leaped at the smile it was his old unsullied lovesmile which she wanted always to see on his facefor which armed with her own wisdom and the wisdom of mercedes she would wage the utmost womans war to possess a thought of this flashed brightly through her brain and it was with a proud little smile that she remembered all her pretty equipment stored at home in the bureau and the chest of drawers  threequarters of an hour later supper ready all but the putting on of the lamb chops at the sound of his step saxon waited she heard the gate click but instead of his step she heard a curious and confused scraping of many steps she flew to open the door billy stood there but a different billy from the one she had parted from so short a time before a small boy beside him held his hat his face had been freshwashed or rather drenched for his shirt and shoulders were wet his pale hair lay damp and plastered against his forehead and was darkened by oozing blood both arms hung limply by his side but his face was composed and he even grinned  its all right he reassured saxon the jokes on me somewhat damaged but still in the ring he stepped gingerly across the threshold come on in you fellows were all mutts together  he was followed in by the boy with his hat by bud strothers and another teamster she knew and by two strangers the latter were big hardfeatured sheepishfaced men who stared at saxon as if afraid of her  its all right saxon billy began but was interrupted by bud  first thing is to get him on the bed an cut his clothes off him both arms is broke and here are the ginks that done it  he indicated the two strangers who shuffled their feet with embarrassment and looked more sheepish than ever  billy sat down on the bed and while saxon held the lamp bud and the strangers proceeded to cut coat shirt and undershirt from him  he wouldnt go to the receivin hospital bud said to saxon  not on your life billy concurred i had em send for doc hentley hell be here any minute them two arms is all i got theyve done pretty well by me an i gotta do the same by themno medical students alearnin their trade on me  but how did it happens saxon demanded looking from billy to the two strangers puzzled by the amity that so evidently existed among them all  oh theyre all right billy dashed in they done it through mistake theyre frisco teamsters an they come over to help usa lot of em  the two teamsters seemed to cheer up at this and nodded their heads  yes missus one of them rumbled hoarsely its all a mistake an well the jokes on us  the drinks anyway billy grinned  not only was saxon not excited but she was scarcely perturbed what had happened was only to be expected  it was in line with all that oakland had already done to her and hers and besides billy was not dangerously hurt broken arms and a sore head would heal she brought chairs and seated everybody  now tell me what happened she begged im all at sea what of you two burleys breaking my husbands arms then seeing him home and holding a lovefest with him  an you got a right bud strothers assured her you see it happened this way  you shut up bud billy broke it you didnt see anything of it  saxon looked to the san francisco teamsters  wed come over to lend a hand seein as the oakland boys was gettin some the short end of it one spoke up an weve sure learned some scabs theres better trades than drivin team well me an jackson here was nosin around to see what we can see when your husband comes moseyin along when he  hold on jackson interrupted get it straight as you go along we reckon we know the boys by sight but your husband we aint never seen around him bein  as you might say put away for a while the first teamster took up the tale so when we sees what we thinks is a scab dodgin away from us an takin the shortcut through the alley  the alley back of campbells grocery billy elucidated  yep back of the grocery the first teamster went on why were sure hes one of them squarehead scabs hired through murray an ready makin a sneak to get into the stables over the back fences  we caught one there billy an me bud interpolated  so we dont waste any time jackson said addressing himself to saxon weve done it before an we know how to do em up brown an tie em with baby ribbon so we catch your husband right in the alley  i was lookin for bud said billy the boys told me id find him somewhere around the other end of the alley an the first thing i know jackson here asks me for a match  an right theres where i get in my fine work resumed the first teamster  what asked saxon  that the man pointed to the wound in billys scalp i laid m out he went down like a steer an got up on his knees dippy agabblin about somebody standin on their foot he didnt know where he was at you see clean groggy an then we done it  the man paused the tale told  broke both his arms with the crowbar bud supplemented  thats when i come to myself when the bones broke billy corroborated an there was the two of em givin me the haha thatll last you some time jackson was sayin an anson says id like to see you drive horses with them arms an then jackson says lets give m something for luck an with that he fetched me a wallop on the jaw  no corrected anson that wallop was mine  well it sent me into dreamland over again billy sighed an when i come to here was bud an anson an jackson dousin me at a water trough an then we dodged a reporter an all come home together  bud strothers held up his fist and indicated freshly abraded skin  the reporterguy just insisted on samplin it he said then to billy thats why i cut around ninth an caught up with you down on sixth  a few minutes later doctor hentley arrived and drove the men from the rooms they waited till he had finished to assure themselves of billys well being and then departed in the kitchen doctor hentley washed his hands and gave saxon final instructions as he dried himself he sniffed the air and looked toward the stove where a pot was simmering  clams he said where did you buy them  i didnt buy them replied saxon i dug them myself  not in the marsh he asked with quickened interest  yes  throw them away throw them out theyre death and corruption typhoidive got three cases now all traced to the clams and the marsh  when he had gone saxon obeyed still another mark against oakland she reflectedoakland the mantrap that poisoned those it could not starve  if it wouldnt drive a man to drink billy groaned when saxon returned to him did you ever dream such luck look at all my fights in the ring an never a broken bone an here snap snap just like that two arms smashed  oh it might be worse saxon smiled cheerfully  id like to know how it might have been your neck  an a good job i tell you saxon you gotta show me anything worse  i can she said confidently  well  well wouldnt it be worse if you intended staying on in oakland where it might happen again  i can see myself becomin a farmer an plowin with a pair of pipestems like these he persisted  doctor hentley says theyll be stronger at the break than ever before and you know yourself thats true of cleanbroken bones now you close your eyes and go to sleep youre all done up and you need to keep your brain quiet and stop thinking  he closed his eyes obediently she slipped a cool hand under the nape of his neck and let it rest  that feels good he murmured youre so cool saxon your hand and you all of you bein with you is like comin out into the cool night after dancin in a hot room  after several minutes of quiet he began to giggle  what is it she asked  oh nothin i was just thinkinthinking of them mutts doin me upme thats done up more scabs than i can remember  next morning billy awoke with his blues dissipated from the kitchen saxon heard him painfully wrestling strange vocal acrobatics  i got a new song you never heard he told her when she came in with a cup of coffee i only remember the chorus though its the old man talkin to some hobo of a hired man that wants to marry his daughter mamie that billy murphy used to run with before he got married used to sing it its a kind of a sobby song it used to always give mamie the weeps heres the way the chorus goesan remember its the old man spielin  and with great solemnity and excruciating batting billy sang  o treat my daughter kindily an say youll do no harm an when i die ill will to you my little house an farmmy horse my plow my sheep my cow an all them little chickens in the gaarden  its them little chickens in the garden that gets me he explained thats how i remembered itfrom the chickens in the movin pictures yesterday an some day well have little chickens in the garden wont we old girl  and a daughter too saxon amplified  an ill be the old geezer sayin them same words to the hired man billy carried the fancy along it dont take long to raise a daughter if you aint in a hurry  saxon took her longneglected ukulele from its case and strummed it into tune  and ive a song you never heard billy toms always singing it hes crazy about taking up government land and going farming only sarah wont think of it he sings it something like this  well have a little farm a pig a horse a cow and you will drive the wagon and i will drive the plow  only in this case i guess its me thatll do the plowin billy approved say saxon sing harvest days thats a farmers song too  after that she feared the coffee was growing cold and compelled billy to take it in the helplessness of two broken arms he had to be fed like a baby and as she fed him they talked  ill tell you one thing billy said between mouthfuls once we get settled down in the country youll have that horse youve been wishin for all your life an itll be all your own to ride drive sell or do anything you want with  and again he ruminated one thing thatll come handy in the country is that i know horses thats a big start i can always get a job at thatif it aint at union wages an the other things about farmin i can learn fast enoughsay dye remember that day you first told me about wantin a horse to ride all your life  saxon remembered and it was only by a severe struggle that she was able to keep the tears from welling into her eyes she seemed bursting with happiness and she was remembering many thingsall the warm promise of life with billy that had been hers in the days before hard times and now the promise was renewed again since its fulfillment had not come to them they were going away to fulfill it for themselves and make the moving pictures come true  impelled by a halffeigned fear she stole away into the kitchen bedroom where bert had died to study her face in the bureau mirror no she decided she was little changed she was still equipped for the battlefield of love beautiful she was not she knew that but had not mercedes said that the great women of history who had won men had not been beautiful and yet saxon insisted as she gazed at her reflection she was anything but unlovely she studied her wide gray eyes that were so very gray that were always alive with light and vivacities where in the surface and depths always swam thoughts unuttered thoughts that sank down and dissolved to give place to other thoughts the brows were excellentshe realized that slenderly penciled a little darker than her light brown hair they just fitted her irregular nose that was feminine but not weak that if anything was piquant and that picturesquely might be declared impudent  she could see that her face was slightly thin that the red of her lips was not quite so red and that she had lost some of her quick coloring but all that would come back again her mouth was not of the rosebud type she saw in the magazines she paid particular attention to it a pleasant mouth it was a mouth to be joyous with a mouth for laughter and to make laughter in others she deliberately experimented with it smiled till the corners dented deeper and she knew that when she smiled her smile was provocative of smiles she laughed with her eyes alonea trick of hers she threw back her head and laughed with eyes and mouth together between her spread lips showing the even rows of strong white teeth  and she remembered billys praise of her teeth the night at germanic hall after he had told charley long he was standing on his foot not big and not little dinky babys teeth either billy had said  just right and they fit you also he had said that to look at them made him hungry and that they were good enough to eat  she recollected all the compliments he had ever paid her beyond all treasures these were treasures to herthe love phrases praises and admirations he had said her skin was coolsoft as velvet too and smooth as silk she rolled up her sleeve to the shoulder brushed her cheek with the white skin for a test with deep scrutiny examined the fineness of its texture and he had told her that she was sweet that he hadnt known what it meant when they said a girl was sweet not until he had known her and he had told her that her voice was cool that it gave him the feeling her hand did when it rested on his forehead her voice went all through him he had said cool and fine like a wind of coolness and he had likened it to the first of the sea breeze setting in the afternoon after a scorching hot morning and also when she talked low that it was round and sweet like the cello in the macdonough theater orchestra  he had called her his tonic kid he had called her a thoroughbred cleancut and spirited all fine nerves and delicate and sensitive he had liked the way she carried her clothes she carried them like a dream had been his way of putting it they were part of her just as much as the cool of her voice and skin and the scent of her hair  and her figure she got upon a chair and tilted the mirror so that she could see herself from hips to feet she drew her skirt back and up the slender ankle was just as slender the calf had lost none of its delicately mature swell she studied her hips her waist her bosom her neck the poise of her head and sighed contentedly billy must be right and he had said that she was built like a french woman and that in the matter of lines and form she could give annette kellerman cards and spades  he had said so many things now that she recalled them all at one time her lips the sunday he proposed he had said i like to watch your lips talking its funny but every move they make looks like a tickly kiss and afterward that same day you looked good to me from the first moment i spotted you he had praised her housekeeping he had said he fed better lived more comfortably held up his end with the fellows and saved money and she remembered that day when he had crushed her in his arms and declared she was the greatest little bit of a woman that had ever come down the pike  she ran her eyes over all herself in the mirror again gathered herself together into a whole compact and good to look upondelicious she knew yes she would do magnificent as billy was in his man way in her own way she was a match for him yes she had done well by billy she deserved muchall he could give her the best he could give her but she made no blunder of egotism frankly valuing herself she as frankly valued him when he was himself his real self not harassed by trouble not pinched by the trap not maddened by drink her manboy and lover he was well worth all she gave him or could give him  saxon gave herself a farewell look no she was not dead any more than was billys love dead than was her love dead all that was needed was the proper soil and their love would grow and blossom and they were turning their backs upon oakland to go and seek that proper soil  oh billy she called through the partition still standing on the chair one hand tipping the mirror forward and back so that she was able to run her eyes from the reflection of her ankles and calves to her face warm with color and roguishly alive  yes she heard him answer  im loving myself she called back  whats the game came his puzzled query what are you so stuck on yourself for  because you love me she answered i love every bit of me billy because because well because you love every bit of me    chapter xix  between feeding and caring for billy doing the housework making plans and selling her store of pretty needlework the days flew happily for saxon billys consent to sell her pretties had been hard to get but at last she succeeded in coaxing it out of him  its only the ones i havent used she urged and i can always make more when we get settled somewhere  what she did not sell along with the household linen and hers and billys spare clothing she arranged to store with tom  go ahead billy said this is your picnic what you say goes youre robinson crusoe an im your man friday make up your mind yet which way youre goin to travel  saxon shook her head  or how  she held up one foot and then the other encased in stout walking shoes which she had begun that morning to break in about the house shanks mare eh  its the way our people came into the west she said proudly  itll be regular trampin though he argued an i never heard of a woman tramp  then heres one why billy theres no shame in tramping my mother tramped most of the way across the plains and most everybody elses mother tramped across in those days i dont care what people will think i guess our race has been on the tramp since the beginning of creation just like well be looking for a piece of land that looked good to settle down on  after a few days when his scalp was sufficiently healed and the boneknitting was nicely in process billy was able to be up and about he was still quite helpless however with both his arms in splints  doctor hentley not only agreed but himself suggested that his bill should wait against better times for settlement of government land in response to saxons eager questioning he knew nothing except that he had a hazy idea that the days of government land were over  tom on the contrary was confident that there was plenty of government hand he talked of honey lake of shasta county and of humboldt  but you cant tackle it at this time of year with winter comin on he advised saxon the thing for you to do is head south for warmer weathersay along the coast it dont snow down there i tell you what you do go down by san jose and salinas an come out on the coast at monterey south of that youll find government land mixed up with forest reserves and mexican rancheros its pretty wild without any roads to speak of all they do is handle cattle but theres some fine redwood canyons with good patches of farming ground that run right down to the ocean i was talkin last year with a fellow thats been all through there an id agone like you an billy only sarah wouldnt hear of it theres gold down there too quite a bunch is in there prospectin an two or three good mines have opened but thats farther along and in a ways from the coast you might take a look  saxon shook her head were not looking for gold but for chickens and a place to grow vegetables our folks had all the chance for gold in the early days and what have they got to show for it  i guess youre right tom conceded they always played too big a game an missed the thousand little chances right under their nose look at your pa ive heard him tell of selling three market street lots in san francisco for fifty dollars each theyre worth five hundred thousand right now an look at uncle will he had ranches till the cows come home satisfied no he wanted to be a cattle king a regular miller and lux an when he died he was a night watchman in los angeles at forty dollars a month theres a spirit of the times an the spirit of the times has changed its all big business now an were the small potatoes why ive heard our folks talk of livin in the western reserve that was all around whats ohio now anybody could get a farm them days all they had to do was yoke their oxen an go after it an the pacific ocean thousands of miles to the west an all them thousands of miles an millions of farms just waitin to be took up a hundred an sixty acres shucks in the early days in oregon they talked six hundred an forty acres that was the spirit of them timesfree land an plenty of it but when we reached the pacific ocean them times was ended big business begun an big business means big business men an every big business man means thousands of little men without any business at all except to work for the big ones theyre the losers dont you see an if they dont like it they can lump it but it wont do them no good they cant yoke up their oxen an pull on theres no place to pull on chinas over there an in betweens a mighty lot of salt water thats no good for farmin purposes  thats all clear enough saxon commented  yes her brother went on we can all see it after its happened when its too late  but the big men were smarter saxon remarked  they were luckier tom contended some won but most lost an just as good men lost it was almost like a lot of boys scramblin on the sidewalk for a handful of small change not that some didnt have farseein but just take your pa for example he come of good down east stock thats got business instinct an can add to what its got now suppose your pa had developed a weak heart or got kidney disease or caught rheumatism so he couldnt go gallivantin an rainbow chasin an fightin an explorin all over the west why most likely hed a settled down in san franciscohed ahad toan held onto them three market street lots an bought more lots of course an gone into steamboat companies an stock gamblin an railroad buildin an comstocktunnelin  why hed abecome big business himself i know m he was the most energetic man i ever saw think quick as a wink as cool as an icicle an as wild as a comanche why hed acut a swath through the free an easy big business gamblers an pirates of them days just as he cut a swath through the hearts of the ladies when he went gallopin past on that big horse of his sword clatterin spurs jinglin his long hair flyin straight as an indian cleanbuilt an graceful as a blueeyed prince out of a fairy book an a mexican caballero all rolled into one just as he cut a swath through the johnny rebs in civil war days chargin with his men all the way through an back again an yellin like a wild indian for more cady that helped raise you told me about that cady rode with your pa  why if your pad only got laid up in san francisco he would aben one of the big men of the west an in that case right now youd be a rich young woman travelin in europe with a mansion on nob hill along with the floods and crockers an holdin majority stock most likely in the fairmount hotel an a few little concerns like it an why aint you because your pa wasnt smart no his mind was like a steel trap its because he was filled to burstin an spillin over with the spirit of the times because he was full of fire an vinegar an couldnt set down in one place thats all the difference between you an the young women right now in the flood and crocker families your father didnt catch rheumatism at the right time thats all  saxon sighed then smiled  just the same ive got them beaten she said the miss floods and miss crockers cant marry prizefighters and i did  tom looked at her taken aback for the moment with admiration slowly at first growing in his face  well all i got to say he enunciated solemnly is that billys so lucky he dont know how lucky he is   not until doctor hentley gave the word did the splints come off billys arms and saxon insisted upon an additional two weeks delay so that no risk would be run these two weeks would complete another months rent and the landlord had agreed to wait payment for the last two months until billy was on his feet again  salingers awaited the day set by saxon for taking back their furniture also they had returned to billy seventyfive dollars  the rest youve paid will be rent the collector told saxon and the furnitures second hand now too the deal will be a loss to salingers and they didnt have to do it either you know that so just remember theyve been pretty square with you and if you start over again dont forget them  out of this sum and out of what was realized from saxons pretties they were able to pay all their small bills and yet have a few dollars remaining in pocket  i hate owin things worse n poison billy said to saxon an now we dont owe a soul in this world except the landlord an doc hentley  and neither of them can afford to wait longer than they have to she said  and they wont billy answered quietly  she smiled her approval for she shared with billy his horror of debt just as both shared it with that early tide of pioneers with a puritan ethic which had settled the west  saxon timed her opportunity when billy was out of the house to pack the chest of drawers which had crossed the atlantic by sailing ship and the plains by ox team she kissed the bullet hole in it made in the fight at little meadow as she kissed her fathers sword the while she visioned him as she always did astride his roan warhorse with the old religious awe she pored over her mothers poems in the scrapbook and clasped her mothers red satin spanish girdle about her in a farewell embrace she unpacked the scrapbook in order to gaze a last time at the wood engraving of the vikings sword in hand leaping upon the english sands again she identified billy as one of the vikings and pondered for a space on the strange wanderings of the seed from which she sprang always had her race been landhungry and she took delight in believing she had bred true for had not she despite her life passed in a city found this same landhunger in her and was she not going forth to satisfy that hunger just as her people of old time had done as her father and mother before her she remembered her mothers tale of how the promised land looked to them as their battered wagons and weary oxen dropped down through the early winter snows of the sierras to the vast and flowering sunland of california in fancy herself a child of nine she looked down from the snowy heights as her mother must have looked down she recalled and repeated aloud one of her mothers stanzas  sweet as a windlutes airy strains your gentle muse has learned to sing and californias boundless plains prolong the soft notes echoing  she sighed happily and dried her eyes perhaps the hard times were past perhaps they had constituted her plains and she and billy had won safely across and were even then climbing the sierras ere they dropped down into the pleasant valley land  salingers wagon was at the house taking out the furniture the morning they left the landlord standing at the gate received the keys shook hands with them and wished them luck youre goin at it right he congratulated them sure an wasnt it under me roll of blankets i tramped into oakland meself forty year ago buy land like me when its cheap itll keep you from the poorhouse in your old age theres plenty of new towns springin up get in on the ground floor the work of your handsll keep you in food an under a roof an the lend ll make you well to do an you know me address when you can spare send me along that small bit of rent an good luck an dont mind what people think tis them that looks that finds  curious neighbors peeped from behind the blinds as billy and saxon strode up the street while the children gazed at them in gaping astonishment on billys back inside a painted canvas tarpaulin was slung the roll of bedding inside the roll were changes of underclothing and odds and ends of necessaries outside from the lashings depended a frying pan and cooking pail in his hand he carried the coffee pot saxon carried a small telescope basket protected by black oilcloth and across her back was the tiny ukulele case  we must look like holy frights billy grumbled shrinking from every gaze that was bent upon him  itd be all right if we were going camping saxon consoled only were not  but they dont know that she continued its only you know that and what you think theyre thinking isnt what theyre thinking at all most probably they think were going camping and the best of it is we are going camping we are we are  at this billy cheered up though he muttered his firm intention to knock the block off of any guy that got fresh he stole a glance at saxon her cheeks were red her eyes glowing  say he said suddenly i seen an opera once where fellows wandered over the country with guitars slung on their backs just like you with that strummystrum you made me think of them they was always singin songs  thats what i brought it along for saxon answered  and when we go down country roads well sing as we go along and well sing by the campfires too were going camping thats all taking a vacation and seeing the country so why shouldnt we have a good time why we dont even know where were going to sleep tonight or any night think of the fun  its a sporting proposition all right all right billy considered but just the same lets turn off an go around the block theres some fellows i know standin up there on the next corner an i dont want to knock their blocks off     book iii    chapter i  the car ran as far as haywards but at saxons suggestion they got off at san leandro  it doesnt matter where we start walking she said for start to walk somewhere we must and as were looking for land and finding out about land the quicker we begin to investigate the better besides we want to know all about all kinds of land close to the big cities as well as back in the mountains  geethis must be the porchugeeze headquarters was billys reiterated comment as they walked through san leandro  it looks as though theyd crowd our kind out saxon adjudged  some tall crowdin i guess billy grumbled it looks like the freeborn american aint got no room left in his own land  then its his own fault saxon said with vague asperity resenting conditions she was just beginning to grasp  oh i dont know about that i reckon the american could do what the porchugeeze do if he wanted to only he dont want to thank god he aint much given to livin like a pig often leavins  not in the country maybe saxon controverted but ive seen an awful lot of americans living like pigs in the cities  billy grunted unwilling assent i guess they quit the farms an go to the city for something better an get it in the neck  look at all the children saxon cried schools letting out and nearly all are portuguese billy not porchugeeze mercedes taught me the right way  they never wore glad rags like them in the old country billy sneered they had to come over here to get decent clothes and decent grub theyre as fat as butterballs  saxon nodded affirmation and a great light seemed suddenly to kindle in her understanding  thats the very point billy theyre doing itdoing it farming too strikes dont bother them  you dont call that dinky gardening farming he objected pointing to a piece of land barely the size of an acre which they were passing  oh your ideas are still big she laughed youre like uncle will who owned thousands of acres and wanted to own a million and who wound up as night watchman thats what was the trouble with all us americans everything large scale anything less than one hundred and sixty acres was small scale  just the same billy held stubbornly large scales a whole lot bettern small scale like all these dinky gardens  saxon sighed i dont know which is the dinkier she observed finally owning a few little acres and the team youre driving or not owning any acres and driving a team somebody else owns for wages  billy winced  go on robinson crusoe he growled good naturedly rub it in good an plenty an the worst of it is its correct a hell of a freeborn american ive been adrivin other folkses teams for a livin astrikin and asluggin scabs an not bein able to keep up with the installments for a few sticks of furniture just the same i was sorry for one thing i hated worse in sam hill to see that morris chair go backyou liked it so we did a lot of honeymoonin in that chair  they were well out of san leandro walking through a region of tiny holdingsfarmlets billy called them and saxon got out her ukulele to cheer him with a song  first it was treat my daughter kindily and then she swung into oldfashioned darky campmeeting hymns beginning with  oh de judgmen day am rollin roan rollin yes arollin i hear the trumpets awful soun rollin yes arollin  a big touring car dashing past threw a dusty pause in her singing and saxon delivered herself of her latest wisdom  now billy remember were not going to take up with the first piece of land we see weve got to go into this with our eyes open  an they aint open yet he agreed  and weve got to get them open tis them that looks that finds theres lots of time to learn things we dont care if it takes months and months were footloose a good start is better than a dozen bad ones weve got to talk and find out well talk with everybody we meet ask questions ask everybody its the only way to find out  i aint much of a hand at askin questions billy demurred  then ill ask she cried weve got to win out at this game and the way is to know look at all these portuguese where are all the americans they owned the land first after the mexicans what made the americans clear out how do the portuguese make it go dont you see weve got to ask millions of questions  she strummed a few chords and then her clear sweet voice rang out gaily  is gwine back to dixie is gwine back to dixie is gwine where de orange blossoms grow for i hear de chillun callin i see de sad tears fallinmy hearts turned back to dixie an i musgo  she broke off to exclaim oh what a lovely place see that arborjust covered with grapes  again and again she was attracted by the small places they passed now it was look at the flowers or my those vegetables or see theyve got a cow  menamericansdriving along in buggies or runabouts looked at saxon and billy curiously this saxon could brook far easier than could billy who would mutter and grumble deep in his throat  beside the road they came upon a lineman eating his lunch  stop and talk saxon whispered  aw whats the good hes a lineman whatd he know about farmin  you never can tell hes our kind go ahead billy you just speak to him he isnt working now anyway and hell be more likely to talk see that tree in there just inside the gate and the way the branches are grown together its a curiosity ask him about it thats a good way to get started  billy stopped when they were alongside  how do you do he said gruffly  the lineman a young fellow paused in the cracking of a hardboiled egg to stare up at the couple  how do you do he said  billy swung his pack from his shoulders to the ground and saxon rested her telescope basket  peddlin the young man asked too discreet to put his question directly to saxon yet dividing it between her and billy and cocking his eye at the covered basket  no she spoke up quickly were looking for land do you know of any around here  again he desisted from the egg studying them with sharp eyes as if to fathom their financial status  do you know what land sells for around here he asked  no saxon answered do you  i guess i ought to i was born here and land like this all around you runs at from two to three hundred to four an five hundred dollars an acre  whew billy whistled i guess we dont want none of it  but what makes it that high town lots saxon wanted to know  nope the porchugeeze make it that high i guess  i thought it was pretty good land that fetched a hundred an acre billy said  oh them times is past they used to give away land once an if you was good throw in all the cattle runnin on it  how about government land around here was billya next query  aint none an never was this was old mexican grants my grandfather bought sixteen hundred of the best acres around here for fifteen hundred dollarsfive hundred down an the balance in five years without interest but that was in the early days he come west in 48 tryin to find a country without chills an fever  he found it all right said billy  you bet he did an if him an father d held onto the land itd been better than a gold mine an i wouldnt be workin for a livin whats your business  teamster  ben in the strike in oakland  sure thing ive teamed there most of my life  here the two men wandered off into a discussion of union affairs and the strike situation but saxon refused to be balked and brought back the talk to the land  how was it the portuguese ran up the price of lend she asked  the young fellow broke away from union matters with an effort and for a moment regarded her with lack luster eyes until the question sank into his consciousness  because they worked the land overtime because they worked mornin noon an night all hands women an kids because they could get more out of twenty acres than we could out of a hundred an sixty look at old silvaantonio silva ive known him ever since i was a shaver he didnt have the price of a square meal when he hit this section and begun leasin land from my folks look at him nowworth two hundred an fifty thousan cold an i bet hes got credit for a million an theres no tellin what the rest of his family owns  and he made all that out of your folks land saxon demanded  the young man nodded his head with evident reluctance  then why didnt your folks do it she pursued  the lineman shrugged his shoulders  search me he said  but the money was in the land she persisted  blamed if it was came the retort tinged slightly with color we never saw it stickin out so as you could notice it the money was in the hands of the porchugeeze i guess they knew a few more n we did thats all  saxon showed such dissatisfaction with his explanation that he was stung to action he got up wrathfully come on an ill show you he said ill show you why im workin for wages when i might aben a millionaire if my folks hadnt been mutts thats what we old americans are mutts with a capital m  he led them inside the gate to the fruit tree that had first attracted saxons attention from the main crotch diverged the four main branches of the tree two feet above the crotch the branches were connected each to the ones on both sides by braces of living wood  you think it growed that way eh well it did but it was old silva that made it just the samecaught two sprouts when the tree was young an twisted em together pretty slick eh you bet that treell never blow down its a natural springy brace an beats iron braces stiff look along all the rows every trees that way see an thats just one trick of the porchugeeze they got a million like it  figure it out for yourself they dont need props when the crops heavy why when we had a heavy crop we used to use five props to a tree now take ten acres of trees thatd be some several thousan props which cost money an labor to put in an take out every year these here natural braces dont have to have a thing done theyre johnnyonthespot all the time why the porchugeeze has got us skinned a mile come on ill show you  billy with city notions of trespass betrayed perturbation at the freedom they were making of the little farm  oh its all right as long as you dont step on nothin the lineman reassured him besides my grandfather used to own this they know me forty years ago old silva come from the azores went sheepherdin in the mountains for a couple of years then blew in to san leandro these five acres was the first land he leased that was the beginnin then he began leasin by the hundreds of acres an by the hundredansixties an his sisters an his uncles an his aunts begun pourin in from the azorestheyre all related there you know an pretty soon san leandro was a regular porchugeeze settlement  an old silva wound up by buyin these five acres from grandfather pretty soonan father by that time was in the hole to the neckhe was buyin fathers land by the hundredansixties an all the rest of his relations was coin the same thing father was always gettin rich quick an he wound up by dyin in debt but old silva never overlooked a bet no matter how dinky an all the rest are just like him you see outside the fence there clear to the wheeltracks in the roadhorsebeans wed ascorned to do a picayune thing like that not silva why hes got a town house in san leandro now an he rides around in a fourthousandollar tourin car an just the same his front door yard grows onions clear to the sidewalk he clears three hundred a year on that patch alone i know ten acres of land he bought last yeara thousan an acre they askedm an he never batted an eye he knew it was worth it thats all he knew he could make it pay back in the hills there hes got a ranch of five hundred an eighty acres bought it dirt cheap too an i want to tell you i could travel around in a different tourin car every day in the week just outa the profits he makes on that ranch from the horses all the way from heavy draughts to fancy steppers  but howhowhow did he get it all saxon clamored  by bein wise to farmin why the whole blame family works they aint ashamed to roll up their sleeves an digsons an daughters an daughterinlaws old man old woman an the babies they have a sayin that a kid four years old that cant pasture one cow on the county road an keep it fat aint worth his salt why the silvas the whole tribe of em works a hundred acres in peas eighty in tomatoes thirty in asparagus ten in pieplant forty in cucumbers anoh stacks of other things  but how do they do it saxon continued to demand weve never been ashamed to work weve worked hard all our lives i can outwork any portuguese woman ever born and ive done it too in the jute mills there were lots of portuguese girls working at the looms all around me and i could outweave them every day and i did too it isnt a case of work what is it  the lineman looked at her in a troubled way  manys the time ive asked myself that same question were bettern these cheap emigrants id say to myself we was here first an owned the land i can lick any dago that ever hatched in the azores i got a better education then how in thunder do they put it all over us get our land an start accounts in the banks an the only answer i know is that we aint got the sabe we dont use our headpieces right somethings wrong with us anyway we wasnt wised up to farming we played at it show you thats what i brung you in forthe way old silva an all his tribe farms book at this place some cousin of his just out from the azores is makin a start on it an payin good rent to silva pretty soon hell be up to snuff an buyin land for himself from some perishin american farmer  look at thatthough you ought to see it in summer not an inch wasted where we got one thin crop they get four fat crops an look at the way they crowd itcurrants between the tree rows beans between the currant rows a row of beans close on each side of the trees an rows of beans along the ends of the tree rows why silva wouldnt sell these five acres for five hundred an acre cash down he gave grandfather fifty an acre for it on long time an here am i workin for the telephone company an putting in a telephone for old silvas cousin from the azores that cant speak american yet horsebeans along the roadsay when silva swung that trick he made more outa fattenin hogs with em than grandfather made with all his farmin grandfather stuck up his nose at horsebeans he died with it stuck up an with more mortgages on the land he had left than you could shake a stick at plantin tomatoes wrapped up in wrappin paperever heard of that father snorted when he first seen the porchugeeze doin it an he went on snortin just the same they got bumper crops an fathers housepatch of tomatoes was eaten by the black beetles we aint got the sabe or the knack or something or other just look at this piece of groundfour crops a year an every inch of soil workin over time why back in town there theres single acres that earns more than fifty of ours in the old days the porchugeeze is naturalborn farmers thats all an we dont know nothin about farmin an never did  saxon talked with the lineman following him about till one oclock when he looked at his watch said good bye and returned to his task of putting in a telephone for the latest immigrant from the azores  when in town saxon carried her oilclothwrapped telescope in her hand but it was so arranged with loops that once on the road she could thrust her arms through the loops and carry it on her back when she did this the tiny ukulele case was shifted so that it hung under her left arm  a mile on from the lineman they stopped where a small creek fringed with brush crossed the county road billy was for the cold lunch which was the last meal saxon had prepared in the pine street cottage but she was determined upon building a fire and boiling coffee not that she desired it for herself but that she was impressed with the idea that everything at the starting of their strange wandering must be as comfortable as possible for billys sake bent on inspiring him with enthusiasm equal to her own she declined to dampen what sparks he had caught by anything so uncheerful as a cold meal  now one thing we want to get out of our heads right at the start billy is that were in a hurry were not in a hurry and we dont care whether school keeps or not were out to have a good time a regular adventure like you read about in booksmy i wish that boy that took me fishing to goat island could see me now oakland was just a place to start from he said and well weve started havent we and right heres where we stop and boil coffee you get the fire going billy and ill get the water and the things ready to spread out  say billy remarked while they waited for the water to boil dye know what this reminds me of  saxon was certain she did know but she shook her head she wanted to hear him say it  why the second sunday i knew you when we drove out to moraga valley behind prince and king you spread the lunch that day  only it was a more scrumptious lunch she added with a happy smile  but i wonder why we didnt have coffee that day he went on  perhaps it would have been too much like housekeeping she laughed kind of what mary would call indelicate  or raw billy interpolated she was always springin that word  and yet look what became of her  thats the way with all of them billy growled somberly ive always noticed its the fastidious ladeda ones that turn out the rottenest theyre like some horses i know ashyin at the things theyre the least afraid of  saxon was silent oppressed by a sadness vague and remote which the mention of berts widow had served to bring on  i know something else that happened that day which youd never guess billy reminisced i bet you couldnt  i wonder saxon murmured and guessed it with her eyes  billys eyes answered and quite spontaneously he reached over caught her hand and pressed it caressingly to his cheek  its little but oh my he said addressing the imprisoned hand then he gazed at saxon and she warmed with his words were beginnin courtin all over again aint we  both ate heartily and billy was guilty of three cups of coffee  say this country air gives some appetite he mumbled as he sank his teeth into his fifth breadandmeat sandwich i could eat a horse an drown his head off in coffee afterward  saxons mind had reverted to all the young lineman had told her and she completed a sort of general resume of the information my she exclaimed but weve learned a lot  an weve sure learned one thing billy said an that is that this is no place for us with land a thousan an acre an only twenty dollars in our pockets  oh were not going to stop here she hastened to say  but just the same its the portuguese that gave it its price and they make things go on itsend their children to school and have them and as you said yourself theyre as fat as butterballs  an i take my hat off to them billy responded  but all the same id sooner have forty acres at a hundred an acre than four at a thousan an acre somehow you know id be scared stiff on four acresscared of fallin off you know  she was in full sympathy with him in her heart of hearts the forty acres tugged much the harder in her way allowing for the difference of a generation her desire for spaciousness was as strong as her uncle wills  well were not going to stop here she assured billy were going in not for forty acres but for a hundred and sixty acres free from the government  an i guess the government owes it to us for what our fathers an mothers done i tell you saxon when a woman walks across the plains like your mother done an a man an wife gets massacred by the indians like my grandfather an mother done the government does owe them something  well its up to us to collect  an well collect all right all right somewhere down in them redwood mountains south of monterey    chapter ii  it was a good afternoons tramp to niles passing through the town of haywards yet saxon and billy found time to diverge from the main county road and take the parallel roads through acres of intense cultivation where the land was farmed to the wheeltracks saxon looked with amazement at these small brownskinned immigrants who came to the soil with nothing and yet made the soil pay for itself to the tune of two hundred of five hundred and of a thousand dollars an acre  on every hand was activity women and children were in the fields as well as men the land was turned endlessly over and over they seemed never to let it rest and it rewarded them it must reward them or their children would not be able to go to school nor would so many of them be able to drive by in rattletrap secondhand buggies or in stout light wagons  look at their faces saxon said they are happy and contented they havent faces like the people in our neighborhood after the strikes began  oh sure they got a good thing billy agreed you can see it stickin out all over them but they neednt get chesty with me i can tell you that muchjust because theyve jiggerooed us out of our land an everything  but theyre not showing any signs of chestiness saxon demurred  no theyre not come to think of it all the same they aint so wise i bet i could tell em a few about horses  it was sunset when they entered the little town of niles billy who had been silent for the last half mile hesitantly ventured a suggestion  say i could put up for a room in the hotel just as well as not what d ye think  but saxon shook her head emphatically  how long do you think our twenty dollars will last at that rate besides the only way to begin is to begin at the beginning we didnt plan sleeping in hotels  all right he gave in im game i was just thinkin about you  then youd better think im game too she flashed forgivingly and now well have to see about getting things for supper  they bought a round steak potatoes onions and a dozen eating apples then went out from the town to the fringe of trees and brush that advertised a creek beside the trees on a sand bank they pitched camp plenty of dry wood lay about and billy whistled genially while he gathered and chopped saxon keen to follow his every mood was cheered by the atrocious discord on his lips she smiled to herself as she spread the blankets with the tarpaulin underneath for a table having first removed all twigs from the sand she had much to learn in the matter of cooking over a campfire and made fair progress discovering first of all that control of the fire meant far more than the size of it when the coffee was boiled she settled the grounds with a partcup of cold water and placed the pot on the edge of the coals where it would keep hot and yet not boil she fried potato dollars and onions in the same pan but separately and set them on top of the coffee pot in the tin plate she was to eat from covering it with billys inverted plate on the dry hot pan in the way that delighted billy she fried the steak this completed and while billy poured the coffee she served the steak putting the dollars and onions back into the frying pan for a moment to make them piping hot again  what more dye want than this billy challenged with deeptoned satisfaction in the pause after his final cup of coffee while he rolled a cigarette he lay on his side full length resting on his elbow the fire was burning brightly and saxons color was heightened by the flickering flames now our folks when they was on the move had to be afraid for indians and wild animals and all sorts of things an here we are as safe as bugs in a rug take this sand what better bed could you ask soft as feathers sayyou look good to me heap little squaw i bet you dont look an inch over sixteen right now mrs babeinthewoods  dont i she glowed with a flirt of the head sideward and a white flash of teeth if you werent smoking a cigarette id ask you if your mother knew youre out mr babeinthesandbank  say he began with transparently feigned seriousness i want to ask you something if you dont mind now of course i dont want to hurt your feelins or nothin but just the same theres something important id like to know  well what is it she inquired after a fruitless wait  well its just this saxon i like you like anything an all that but heres night come on an were a thousand miles from anywhere andwell what i wanta know is are we really an truly married you an me  really and truly she assured him why  oh nothing but id kind aforgotten an i was gettin embarrassed you know because if we wasnt seein the way i was brought up thisd be no place  that will do you she said severely and this is just the time and place for you to get in the firewood for morning while i wash up the dishes and put the kitchen in order  he started to obey but paused to throw his arm about her and draw her close neither spoke but when he went his way saxons breast was fluttering and a song of thanksgiving breathed on her lips  the night had come on dim with the light of faint stars but these had disappeared behind clouds that seemed to have arisen from nowhere it was the beginning of california indian summer the air was warm with just the first hint of evening chill and there was no wind  ive a feeling as if weve just started to live saxon said when billy his firewood collected joined her on the blankets before the fire ive learned more today than ten years in oakland she drew a long breath and braced her shoulders farmings a bigger subject than i thought  billy said nothing with steady eyes he was staring into the fire and she knew he was turning something over in his mind  what is it she asked when she saw he had reached a conclusion at the same time resting her hand on the back of his  just been framin up that ranch of ourn he answered its all well enough these dinky farmlets theyll do for foreigners but we americans just gotta have room i want to be able to look at a hilltop an know its my land and know its my land down the other side an up the next hilltop an know that over beyond that down alongside some creek my mares are most likely grazin an their little colts grazin with em or kickin up their heels you know theres money in raisin horsesespecially the big workhorses that run to eighteen hundred an two thousand pounds theyre payin for em in the cities every day in the year seven an eight hundred a pair matched geldings four years old good pasture an plenty of it in this kind of a climate is all they need along with some sort of shelter an a little hay in long spells of bad weather i never thought of it before but let me tell you that this ranch proposition is beginnin to look good to me  saxon was all excitement here was new information on the cherished subject and best of all billy was the authority still better he was taking an interest himself  therell be room for that and for everything on a quarter section she encouraged  sure thing around the house well have vegetables an fruit and chickens an everything just like the porchugeeze an plenty of room beside to walk around an range the horses  but wont the colts cost money billy  not much the cobblestones eat horses up fast thats where ill get my brood mares from the ones knocked out by the city i know that end of it they sell em at auction an theyre good for years an years only no good on the cobbles any more  there ensued a long pause in the dying fire both were busy visioning the farm to be  its pretty still aint it billy said rousing himself at last he gazed about him an black as a stack of black cats he shivered buttoned his coat and tossed several sticks on the fire just the same its the best kind of a climate in the world manys the time when i was a little kid ive heard my father brag about californias bein a blanket climate he went east once an staid a summer an a winter an got all he wanted never again for him  my mother said there never was such a land for climate how wonderful it must have seemed to them after crossing the deserts and mountains they called it the land of milk and honey the ground was so rich that all they needed to do was scratch it cady used to say  and wild game everywhere billy contributed mr roberts the one that adopted my father he drove cattle from the san josquin to the columbia river he had forty men helpin him an all they took along was powder an salt they lived off the game they shot  the hills were full of deer and my mother saw whole herds of elk around santa rosa some time well go there billy ive always wanted to  and when my father was a young man somewhere up north of sacramento in a creek called cache slough the tules was full of grizzliest he used to go in an shoot em an when they caught em in the open he an the mexicans used to ride up an rope themcatch them with lariats you know he said a horse that wasnt afraid of grizzlies fetched ten times as much as any other horse an panthersall the old folks called em painters an catamounts an varmints yes well go to santa rosa some time maybe we wont like that land down the coast an have to keep on hikin  by this time the fire had died down and saxon had finished brushing and braiding her hair their bedgoing preliminaries were simple and in a few minutes they were side by side under the blankets saxon closed her eyes but could not sleep on the contrary she had never been more wide awake she had never slept out of doors in her life and by no exertion of will could she overcome the strangeness of it in addition she was stiffened from the long trudge and the sand to her surprise was anything but soft an hour passed she tried to believe that billy was asleep but felt certain he was not the sharp crackle of a dying ember startled her she was confident that billy had moved slightly  billy she whispered are you awake  yep came his low answer an thinkin this sand is hardern a cement floor its one on me all right but whod athought it  both shifted their postures slightly but vain was the attempt to escape from the dull aching contact of the sand  an abrupt metallic whirring noise of some nearby cricket gave saxon another startle she endured the sound for some minutes until billy broke forth  say that gets my goat whatever it is  do you think its a rattlesnake she asked maintaining a calmness she did not feel  just what ive been thinkin  i saw two in the window of bowmans drug store an you know billy theyve got a hollow fang and when they stick it into you the poison runs down the hollow  brrrr billy shivered in fear that was not altogether mockery certain death everybody says unless youre a bosco remember him  he eats em alive he eats em alive bosco bosco saxon responded mimicking the cry of a sideshow barker just the same all boscos rattlers had the poisonsacs cut outa them they must ahad gee its funny i cant get asleep i wish that damned thingd close its trap i wonder if it is a rattlesnake  no it cant be saxon decided all the rattlesnakes are killed off long ago  then where did bosco get his billy demanded with unimpeachable logic an why dont you get to sleep  because its all new i guess was her reply you see i never camped out in my life  neither did i an until now i always thought it was a lark he changed his position on the maddening sand and sighed heavily but well get used to it in time i guess what other folks can do we can an a mighty lot of em has camped out its all right here we are free an independent no rent to pay our own bosses  he stopped abruptly from somewhere in the brush came an intermittent rustling when they tried to locate it it mysteriously ceased and when the first hint of drowsiness stole upon them the rustling as mysteriously recommenced  it sounds like something creeping up on us saxon suggested snuggling closer to billy  well it aint a wild indian at all events was the best he could offer in the way of comfort he yawned deliberately aw shucks whats there to be scared of think of what all the pioneers went through  several minutes later his shoulders began to shake and saxon knew he was giggling  i was just thinkin of a yarn my father used to tell about he explained it was about old susan kleghorn one of the oregon pioneer women walleyed susan they used to call her but she could shoot to beat the band once on the plains the wagon train she was in was attacked by indians they got all the wagons in a circle an all hands an the oxen inside an drove the indians off killin a lot of em they was too strong that way so whatd the indians do to draw em out into the open but take two white girls captured from some other train an begin to torture em they done it just out of gunshot but so everybody could see the idea was that the white men couldnt stand it an would rush out an then the indiansd have em where they wanted em  the white men couldnt do a thing if they rushed out to save the girls theyd be finished an then the indiansd rush the train it meant death to everybody but what does old susan do but get out an old longbarreled kentucky rifle she rams down about three times the regular load of powder takes aim at a big buck thats pretty busy at the torturin an bangs away it knocked her clean over backward an her shoulder was lame all the rest of the way to oregon but she dropped the big indian deado he never knew what struck m  but that wasnt the yarn i wanted to tell it seems old susan liked john barleycorn shed souse herself to the ears every chance she got an her sons an daughters an the old man had to be mighty careful not to leave any around where she could get hands on it  on what asked saxon  on john barleycornoh you aint on to that its the old fashioned name for whisky well one day all the folks was goin awaythat was over somewhere at a place called bodega where theyd settled after comin down from oregon an old susan claimed her rheumatics was hurtin her an so she couldnt go but the family was on there was a twogallon demijohn of whisky in the house they said all right but before they left they sent one of the grandsons to climb a big tree in the barnyard where he tied the demijohn sixty feet from the ground just the same when they come home that night they found susan on the kitchen floor dead to the world  and shed climbed the tree after all saxon hazarded when billy had shown no inclination of going on  not on your life he laughed jubilantly all shed done was to put a washtub on the ground square under the demijohn then she got out her old rifle an shot the demijohn to smithereens an all she had to do was lap the whisky outa the tub  again saxon was drowsing when the rustling sound was heard this time closer to her excited apprehension there was something stealthy about it and she imagined a beast of prey creeping upon them billy she whispered  yes im alistenin to it came his wide awake answer  mightnt that be a panther or maybe a wildcat  it cant be all the varmints was killed off long ago this is peaceable farmin country  a vagrant breeze sighed through the trees and made saxon shiver the mysterious cricketnoise ceased with suspicious abruptness then from the rustling noise ensued a dull but heavy thump that caused both saxon and billy to sit up in the blankets there were no further sounds and they lay down again though the very silence now seemed ominous  huh billy muttered with relief as though i dont know what it was it was a rabbit ive heard tame ones bang their hind feet down on the floor that way  in vain saxon tried to win sleep the sand grew harder with the passage of time her flesh and her bones ached from contact with it and though her reason flouted any possibility of wild dangers her fancy went on picturing them with unflagging zeal  a new sound commenced it was neither a rustling nor a rattling and it tokened some large body passing through the brush sometimes twigs crackled and broke and once they heard bushbranches press aside and spring back into place  if that other thing was a panther this is an elephant was billys uncheering opinion its got weight listen to that an its comin nearer  there were frequent stoppages then the sounds would begin again always louder always closer billy sat up in the blankets once more passing one arm around saxon who had also sat up  i aint slept a wink he complained there it goes again i wish i could see  it makes a noise big enough for a grizzly saxon chattered partly from nervousness partly from the chill of the night  it aint no grasshopper thats sure  billy started to leave the blankets but saxon caught his arm  what are you going to do  oh i aint scairt none he answered but honest to god this is gettin on my nerves if i dont find what that thing is itll give me the willies im just goin to reconnoiter i wont go close  so intensely dark was the night that the moment billy crawled beyond the reach of her hand he was lost to sight she sat and waited the sound had ceased though she could follow billys progress by the cracking of dry twigs and limbs after a few moments he returned and crawled under the blankets  i scared it away i guess its got better ears an when it heard me comin it skinned out most likely i did my dangdest too not to make a soundo lord there it goes again  they sat up saxon nudged billy  there she warned in the faintest of whispers i can hear it breathing it almost made a snort  a dead branch cracked loudly and so near at hand that both of them jumped shamelessly  i aint goin to stand any more of its foolin billy declared wrathfully itll be on top of us if i dont  what are you going to do she queried anxiously  yell the top of my head off ill get a fall outa whatever it is  he drew a deep breath and emitted a wild yell  the result far exceeded any expectation he could have entertained and saxons heart leaped up in sheer panic on the instant the darkness erupted into terrible sound and movement there were trashings of underbrush and lunges and plunges of heavy bodies in different directions fortunately for their ease of mind all these sounds receded and died away  an what dye think of that billy broke the silence  gee all the fight fans used to say i was scairt of nothin just the same im glad they aint seein me tonight  he groaned ive got all i want of that blamed sand im goin to get up and start the fire  this was easy under the ashes were live embers which quickly ignited the wood he threw on a few stars were peeping out in the misty zenith he looked up at them deliberated and started to move away  where are you going now saxon called  oh ive got an idea he replied noncommittally and walked boldly away beyond the circle of the firelight  saxon sat with the blankets drawn closely under her chin and admired his courage he had not even taken the hatchet and he was going in the direction in which the disturbance had died away  ten minutes later he came back chuckling  the sonsofguns they got my goat all right ill be scairt of my own shadow nextwhat was they huh you couldnt guess in a thousand years a bunch of halfgrown calves an they was worse scairt than us  he smoked a cigarette by the fire then rejoined saxon under the blankets  a hell of a farmer ill make he chafed when a lot of little calves can scare the stuffin outa me i bet your father or mine wouldnt abatted an eye the stock has gone to seed thats what it has  no it hasnt saxon defended the stock is all right were just as able as our folks ever were and were healthier on top of it weve been brought up different thats all weve lived in cities all our lives we know the city sounds and thugs but we dont know the country ones our training has been unnatural thats the whole thing in a nutshell now were going in for natural training give us a little time and well sleep as sound out of doors as ever your father or mine did  but not on sand billy groaned  we wont try thats one thing for good and all weve learned the very first time and now hush up and go to sleep  their fears had vanished but the sand receiving now their undivided attention multiplied its unyieldingness billy dozed off first and roosters were crowing somewhere in the distance when saxons eyes closed but they could not escape the sand and their sleep was fitful  at the first gray of dawn billy crawled out and built a roaring fire saxon drew up to it shiveringly they were holloweyed and weary saxon began to laugh billy joined sulkily then brightened up as his eyes chanced upon the coffee pot which he immediately put on to boil    chapter iii  it is forty miles from oakland to san jose and saxon and billy accomplished it in three easy days no more obliging and angrily garrulous linemen were encountered and few were the opportunities for conversation with chance wayfarers numbers of tramps carrying rolls of blankets were met traveling both north and south on the county road and from talks with them saxon quickly learned that they knew little or nothing about farming they were mostly old men feeble or besotted and all they knew was workwhere jobs might be good where jobs had been good but the places they mentioned were always a long way off one thing she did glean from them and that was that the district she and billy were passing through was smallfarmer country in which labor was rarely hired and that when it was it generally was portuguese  the farmers themselves were unfriendly they drove by billy and saxon often with empty wagons but never invited them to ride when chance offered and saxon did ask questions they looked her over curiously or suspiciously and gave ambiguous and facetious answers  they aint americans damn them billy fretted why in the old days everybody was friendly to everybody  but saxon remembered her last talk with her brother  its the spirit of the times billy the spirit has changed besides these people are too near wait till we get farther away from the cities then well find them more friendly  a measly lot these ones are he sneered  maybe theyve a right to be she laughed for all you know more than one of the scabs youve slugged were sons of theirs  if i could only hope so billy said fervently but i dont care if i owned ten thousand acres any man hikin with his blankets might be just as good a man as me an maybe better for all id know id give m the benefit of the doubt anyway  billy asked for work at first indiscriminately later only at the larger farms the unvarying reply was that there was no work a few said there would be plowing after the first rains here and there in a small way dry plowing was going on but in the main the farmers were waiting  but do you know how to plow saxon asked billy  no but i guess it aint much of a trick to turn besides next man i see plowing im goin to get a lesson from  in the midafternoon of the second day his opportunity came he climbed on top of the fence of a small field and watched an old man plow round and round it  aw shucks just as easy as easy billy commented scornfully if an old codger like that can handle one plow i can handle two  go on and try it saxon urged  whats the good  cold feet she jeered but with a smiling face all you have to do is ask him all he can do is say no and what if he does you faced the chicago terror twenty rounds without flinching  aw but its different he demurred then dropped to the ground inside the fence two to one the old geezer turns me down  no he wont just tell him you want to learn and ask him if hell let you drive around a few times tell him it wont cost him anything  huh if he gets chesty ill take his blamed plow away from him  from the top of the fence but too far away to hear saxon watched the colloquy after several minutes the lines were transferred to billys neck the handles to his hands then the team started and the old man delivering a rapid fire of instructions walked alongside of billy when a few turns had been made the farmer crossed the plowed strip to saxon and joined her on the rail  hes plowed before a little mite aint he  saxon shook her head  never in his life but he knows how to drive horses  he showed he wasnt all greenhorn an he learns pretty quick here the farmer chuckled and cut himself a chew from a plug of tobacco i reckon he wont tire me out asettin here  the unplowed area grew smaller and smaller but billy evinced no intention of quitting and his audience on the fence was deep in conversation saxons questions flew fast and furious and she was not long in concluding that the old man bore a striking resemblance to the description the lineman had given of his father  billy persisted till the field was finished and the old man invited him and saxon to stop for the night there was a disused outbuilding where they would find a small cook stove he said and also he would give them fresh milk further if saxon wanted to test her desire for farming she could try her hand on the cow  the milking lesson did not prove as successful as billys plowing but when he had mocked sufficiently saxon challenged him to try and he failed as grievously as she saxon had eyes and questions for everything and it did not take her long to realize that she was looking upon the other side of the farming shield farm and farmer were oldfashioned there was no intensive cultivation there was too much land too little farmed everything was slipshod house and barn and outbuildings were fast falling into ruin the front yard was weedgrown there was no vegetable garden the small orchard was old sickly and neglected the trees were twisted spindling and overgrown with a gray moss the sons and daughters were away in the cities saxon found out one daughter had married a doctor the other was a teacher in the state normal school one son was a locomotive engineer the second was an architect and the third was a police court reporter in san francisco on occasion the father said they helped out the old folks  what do you think saxon asked billy as he smoked his aftersupper cigarette  his shoulders went up in a comprehensive shrug  huh thats easy the old geezers like his orchardcovered with moss its plain as the nose on your face after san leandro that he dont know the first thing an them horses itd be a charity to him an a savin of money for him to take em out an shoot em both you bet you dont see the porchugeeze with horses like them an it aint a case of bein proud or puttin on side to have good horses its brass tacks an business it pays thats the game old horses eat more in young ones to keep in condition an they cant do the same amount of work but you bet it costs just as much to shoe them an his is scrub on top of it every minute he has them horses hes losin money you oughta see the way they work an figure horses in the city  they slept soundly and after an early breakfast prepared to start  id like to give you a couple of days work the old man regretted at parting but i cant see it the ranch just about keeps me and the old woman now that the children are gone an then it dont always seems times have been bad for a long spell now aint never been the same since grover cleveland  early in the afternoon on the outskirts of san jose saxon called a halt  im going right in there and talk she declared unless they set the dogs on me thats the prettiest place yet isnt it  billy who was always visioning hills and spacious ranges for his horses mumbled unenthusiastic assent  and the vegetables look at them and the flowers growing along the borders that beats tomato plants in wrapping paper  dont see the sense of it billy objected wheres the money come in from flowers that take up the ground that good vegetables might be growin on  and thats what im going to find out she pointed to a woman stooped to the ground and working with a trowel in front of the tiny bungalow i dont know what shes like but at the worst she can only be mean see shes looking at us now drop your load alongside of mine and come on in  billy slung the blankets from his shoulder to the ground but elected to wait as saxon went up the narrow flowerbordered walk she noted two men at work among the vegetablesone an old chinese the other old and of some darkeyed foreign breed here were neatness efficiency and intensive cultivation with a vengeanceeven her untrained eye could see that the woman stood up and turned from her flowers and saxon saw that she was middleaged slender and simply but nicely dressed she wore glasses and saxons reading of her face was that it was kind but nervous looking  i dont want anything today she said before saxon could speak administering the rebuff with a pleasant smile  saxon groaned inwardly over the blackcovered telescope basket evidently the woman had seen her put it down  were not peddling she explained quickly  oh i am sorry for the mistake  this time the womans smile was even pleasanter and she waited for saxon to state her errand  nothing loath saxon took it at a plunge  were looking for land we want to be farmers you know and before we get the land we want to find out what kind of land we want and seeing your pretty place has just filled me up with questions you see we dont know anything about farming weve lived in the city all our life and now weve given it up and are going to live in the country and be happy  she paused the womans face seemed to grow quizzical though the pleasantness did not abate  but how do you know you will be happy in the country she asked  i dont know all i do know is that poor people cant be happy in the city where they have labor troubles all the time if they cant be happy in the country then theres no happiness anywhere and that doesnt seem fair does it  it is sound reasoning my dear as far as it goes but you must remember that there are many poor people in the country and many unhappy people  you look neither poor nor unhappy saxon challenged  you are a dear  saxon saw the pleased flush in the others face which lingered as she went on  but still i may be peculiarly qualified to live and succeed in the country as you say yourself youve spent your life in the city you dont know the first thing about the country it might even break your heart  saxons mind went back to the terrible months in the pine street cottage  i know already that the city will break my heart maybe the country will too but just the same its my only chance dont you see its that or nothing besides our folks before us were all of the country it seems the more natural way and better here i am which proves that way down inside i must want the country must as you call it be peculiarly qualified for the country or else i wouldnt be here  the other nodded approval and looked at her with growing interest  that young man she began  is my husband he was a teamster until the big strike came my name is roberts saxon roberts and my husband is william roberts  and i am mrs mortimer the other said with a bow of acknowledgment i am a widow and now if you will ask your husband in i shall try to answer some of your many questions tell him to put the bundles inside the gate  and now what are all the questions you are filled with  oh all kinds how does it pay how did you manage it all how much did the land cost did you build that beautiful house how much do you pay the men how did you learn all the different kinds of things and which grew best and which paid best what is the best way to sell them how do you sell them saxon paused and laughed oh i havent begun yet why do you have flowers on the borders everywhere i looked over the portuguese farms around san leandro but they never mixed flowers and vegetables  mrs mortimer held up her hand let me answer the last first it is the key to almost everything  but billy arrived and the explanation was deferred until after his introduction  the flowers caught your eyes didnt they my dear mrs mortimer resumed and brought you in through my gate and right up to me and thats the very reason they were planted with the vegetablesto catch eyes you cant imagine how many eyes they have caught nor how many owners of eyes they have lured inside my gate this is a good road and is a very popular short country drive for townsfolk oh no ive never had any luck with automobiles they cant see anything for dust but i began when nearly everybody still used carriages the townswomen would drive by my flowers and then my place would catch their eyes they would tell their drivers to stop andwell somehow i managed to be in the front within speaking distance usually i succeeded in inviting them in to see my flowers and vegetables of course everything was sweet clean pretty it all appealed and mrs mortimer shrugged her shoulders it is well known that the stomach sees through the eyes the thought of vegetables growing among flowers pleased their fancy they wanted my vegetables they must have them and they did at double the market price which they were only too glad to pay you see i became the fashion or a fad in a small way nobody lost the vegetables were certainly good as good as any on the market and often fresher and besides my customers killed two birds with one stone for they were pleased with themselves for philanthropic reasons not only did they obtain the finest and freshest possible vegetables but at the same time they were happy with the knowledge that they were helping a deserving widowwoman yes and it gave a certain tone to their establishments to be able to say they bought mrs mortimers vegetables but thats too big a side to go into in short my little place became a show placeanywhere to go for a drive or anything you know when time has to be killed and it became noised about who i was and who my husband had been what i had been some of the townsladies i had known personally in the old days they actually worked for my success and then too i used to serve tea my patrons became my guests for the time being i still serve it when they drive out to show me off to their friends so you see the flowers are one of the ways i succeeded  saxon was glowing with appreciation but mrs mortimer glancing at billy noted not entire approval his blue eyes were clouded  well out with it she encouraged what are you thinking  to saxons surprise he answered directly and to her double surprise his criticism was of a nature which had never entered her head  its just a trick billy expounded thats what i was gettin at  but a paying trick mrs mortimer interrupted her eyes dancing and vivacious behind the glasses  yes and no billy said stubbornly speaking in his slow deliberate fashion if every farmer was to mix flowers an vegetables then every farmer would get double the market price an then there wouldnt be any double market price everythingd be as it was before  you are opposing a theory to a fact mrs mortimer stated the fact is that all the farmers do not do it the fact is that i do receive double the price you cant get away from that  billy was unconvinced though unable to reply  just the same he muttered with a slow shake of the head i dont get the hang of it theres something wrong so far as were concernedmy wife an me i mean maybe ill get hold of it after a while  and in the meantime well look around mrs mortimer invited i want to show you everything and tell you how i make it go afterward well sit down and ill tell you about the beginning you see she bent her gaze on saxoni want you thoroughly to understand that you can succeed in the country if you go about it right i didnt know a thing about it when i began and i didnt have a fine big man like yours i was all alone but ill tell you about that   for the next hour among vegetables berrybushes and fruit trees saxon stored her brain with a huge mass of information to be digested at her leisure billy too was interested but he left the talking to saxon himself rarely asking a question at the rear of the bungalow where everything was as clean and orderly as the front they were shown through the chicken yard here in different runs were kept several hundred small and snowwhite hens  white leghorns said mrs mortimer you have no idea what they netted me this year i never keep a hen a moment past the prime of her laying period  just what i was tellin you saxon about horses billy broke in  and by the simplest method of hatching them at the right time which not one farmer in ten thousand ever dreams of doing i have them laying in the winter when most hens stop laying and when eggs are highest another thing i have my special customers they pay me ten cents a dozen more than the market price because my specialty is oneday eggs  here she chanced to glance at billy and guessed that he was still wrestling with his problem  same old thing she queried  he nodded same old thing if every farmer delivered dayold eggs there wouldnt be no ten cents higher n the top price theyd be no better off than they was before  but the eggs would be oneday eggs all the eggs would be oneday eggs you mustnt forget that mrs mortimer pointed out  but that dont butter no toast for my wife an me he objected an thats what ive been tryin to get the hang of an now i got it you talk about theory an fact ten cents higher than top price is a theory to saxon an me the fact is we aint got no eggs no chickens an no land for the chickens to run an lay eggs on  their hostess nodded sympathetically  an theres something else about this outfit of yourn that i dont get the hang of he pursued i cant just put my finger on it but its there all right  they were shown over the cattery the piggery the milkers and the kennelry as mrs mortimer called her live stock departments none was large all were moneymakers she assured them and rattled off her profits glibly she took their breaths away by the prices given and received for pedigreed persians pedigreed ohio improved chesters pedigreed scotch collies and pedigreed jerseys for the milk of the last she also had a special private market receiving five cents more a quart than was fetched by the best dairy milk billy was quick to point out the difference between the look of her orchard and the look of the orchard they had inspected the previous afternoon and mrs mortimer showed him scores of other differences many of which he was compelled to accept on faith  then she told them of another industry her homemade jams and jellies always contracted for in advance and at prices dizzyingly beyond the regular market they sat in comfortable rattan chairs on the veranda while she told the story of how she had drummed up the jam and jelly trade dealing only with the one best restaurant and one best club in san jose to the proprietor and the steward she had gone with her samples in long discussions beaten down their opposition overcome their reluctance and persuaded the proprietor in particular to make a special of her wares to boom them quietly with his patrons and above all to charge stiffly for dishes and courses in which they appeared  throughout the recital billys eyes were moody with dissatisfaction mrs mortimer saw and waited  and now begin at the beginning saxon begged  but mrs mortimer refused unless they agreed to stop for supper saxon frowned billys reluctance away and accepted for both of them  well then mrs mortimer took up her tale in the beginning i was a greenhorn city born and bred all i knew of the country was that it was a place to go to for vacations and i always went to springs and mountain and seaside resorts i had lived among books almost all my life i was head librarian of the doncaster library for years then i married mr mortimer he was a book man a professor in san miguel university he had a long sickness and when he died there was nothing left even his life insurance was eaten into before i could be free of creditors as for myself i was worn out on the verge of nervous prostration fit for nothing i had five thousand dollars left however and without going into the details i decided to go farming i found this place in a delightful climate close to san josethe end of the electric line is only a quarter of a mile onand i bought it i paid two thousand cash and gave a mortgage for two thousand it cost two hundred an acre you see  twenty acres saxon cried  wasnt that pretty small billy ventured  too large oceans too large i leased ten acres of it the first thing and its still leased after all this time even the ten id retained was much too large for a long long time its only now that im beginning to feel a tiny mite crowded  and ten acres has supported you an two hired men billy demanded amazed  mrs mortimer clapped her hands delightedly  listen i had been a librarian i knew my way among books first of all id read everything written on the subject and subscribed to some of the best farm magazines and papers and you ask if my ten acres have supported me and two hired men let me tell you i have four hired men the ten acres certainly must support them as it supports hannahshes a swedish widow who runs the house and who is a perfect trojan during the jam and jelly seasonand hannahs daughter who goes to school and lends a hand and my nephew whom i have taken to raise and educate also the ten acres have come pretty close to paying for the whole twenty as well as for this house and all the outbuildings and all the pedigreed stock  saxon remembered what the young lineman had said about the portuguese  the ten acres didnt do a bit of it she cried it was your head that did it all and you know it  and thats the point my dear it shows the right kind of person can succeed in the country remember the soil is generous but it must be treated generously and that is something the old style american farmer cant get into his head so it is head that counts even when his starving acres have convinced him of the need for fertilizing he cant see the difference between cheap fertilizer and good fertilizer  and thats something i want to know about saxon exclaimed and ill tell you all i know but first you must be very tired i noticed you were limping let me take you innever mind your bundles ill send chang for them  to saxon with her innate love of beauty and charm in all personal things the interior of the bungalow was a revelation never before had she been inside a middle class home and what she saw not only far exceeded anything she had imagined but was vastly different from her imaginings mrs mortimer noted her sparkling glances which took in everything and went out of her way to show saxon around doing it under the guise of gleeful boastings stating the costs of the different materials explaining how she had done things with her own hands such as staining the doors weathering the bookcases and putting together the big mission morris chair billy stepped gingerly behind and though it never entered his mind to ape to the manner born he succeeded in escaping conspicuous awkwardness even at the table where he and saxon had the unique experience of being waited on in a private house by a servant  if youd only come along next year mrs mortimer mourned then i should have had the spare room i had planned  thats all right billy spoke up thank you just the same but well catch the electric cars into san jose an get a room  mrs mortimer was still disturbed at her inability to put them up for the night and saxon changed the conversation by pleading to be told more  you remember i told you id paid only two thousand down on the land mrs mortimer complied that left me three thousand to experiment with of course all my friends and relatives prophesied failure and of course i made my mistakes plenty of them but i was saved from still more by the thorough study i had made and continued to make she indicated shelves of farm books and files of farm magazines that lined the walls and i continued to study i was resolved to be up to date and i sent for all the experiment station reports i went almost entirely on the basis that whatever the old type farmer did was wrong and do you know in doing that i was not so far wrong myself its almost unthinkable the stupidity of the oldfashioned farmers oh i consulted with them talked things over with them challenged their stereotyped ways demanded demonstration of their dogmatic and prejudiced beliefs and quite succeeded in convincing the last of them that i was a fool and doomed to come to grief  but you didnt you didnt  mrs mortimer smiled gratefully  sometimes even now im amazed that i didnt but i came of a hardheaded stock which had been away from the soil long enough to gain a new perspective when a thing satisfied my judgment i did it forthwith and downright no matter how extravagant it seemed take the old orchard worthless worse than worthless old calkins nearly died of heart disease when he saw the devastation i had wreaked upon it and look at it now there was an old rattletrap ruin where the bungalow now stands i put up with it but i immediately pulled down the cow barn the pigsties the chicken houses everythingmade a clean sweep they shook their heads and groaned when they saw such wanton waste by a widow struggling to make a living but worse was to come they were paralyzed when i told them the price of the three beautiful oicspigs you know chesterswhich i bought sixty dollars for the three and only just weaned then i hustled the nondescript chickens to market replacing them with the white leghorns the two scrub cows that came with the place i sold to the butcher for thirty dollars each paying two hundred and fifty for two blueblooded jersey heifers and coined money on the exchange while calkins and the rest went right on with their scrubs that couldnt give enough milk to pay for their board  billy nodded approval  remember what i told you about horses he reiterated to saxon and assisted by his hostess he gave a very creditable disquisition on horseflesh and its management from a business point of view  when he went out to smoke mrs mortimer led saxon into talking about herself and billy and betrayed not the slightest shock when she learned of his prizefighting and scabslugging proclivities  hes a splendid young man and good she assured saxon his face shows that and best of all he loves you and is proud of you you cant imagine how i have enjoyed watching the way he looks at you especially when you are talking he respects your judgment why he must for here he is with you on this pilgrimage which is wholly your idea mrs mortimer sighed you are very fortunate dear child very fortunate and you dont yet know what a mans brain is wait till he is quite fired with enthusiasm for your project you will be astounded by the way he takes hold you will have to exert yourself to keep up with him in the meantime you must lead remember he is city bred it will be a struggle to wean him from the only life hes known  oh but hes disgusted with the city too saxon began  but not as you are love is not the whole of man as it is of woman the city hurt you more than it hurt him it was you who lost the dear little babe his interest his connection was no more than casual and incidental compared with the depth and vividness of yours  mrs mortimer turned her head to billy who was just entering  have you got the hang of what was bothering you she asked  pretty close to it he answered taking the indicated big morris chair its this  one moment mrs mortimer checked him that is a beautiful big strong chair and so are you at any rate big and strong and your little wife is very wearyno no sit down its your strength she needs yes i insist open your arms  and to him she led saxon and into his arms placed her now sirand you look delicious the pair of youregister your objections to my way of earning a living  it aint your way billy repudiated quickly your ways all right its great what im trying to get at is that your way dont fit us we couldnt make a go of it your way why you had pullwelltodo acquaintances people that knew youd been a librarian an your husband a professor an you had here he floundered a moment seeking definiteness for the idea he still vaguely grasped well you had a way we couldnt have you were educated an ani dont know i guess you knew society ways an business ways we couldnt know  but my dear boy you could learn what was necessary she contended  billy shook his head  no you dont quite get me lets take it this way just suppose its me with jam an jelly awadin into that swell restaurant like you did to talk with the top guy why id be outa place the moment i stepped into his office worsen that id feel outa place thatd make me have a chip on my shoulder an lookin for trouble which is a poor way to do business then too id be thinkin he was thinkin i was a whole lot of a husky to be peddlin jam whatd happen id be chesty at the drop of the hat id be thinkin he was thinkin i was standin on my foot an id beat him to it in tellin him he was standin on his foot dont you see its because i was raised that way itd be take it or leave it with me an no jam sold  what you say is true mrs mortimer took up brightly but there is your wife just look at her shed make an impression on any business man hed be only too willing to listen to her  billy stiffened a forbidding expression springing into his eyes  what have i done now their hostess laughed  i aint got around yet to tradin on my wifes looks he rumbled gruffly  right you are the only trouble is that you both of you are fifty years behind the times youre old american how you ever got here in the thick of modern conditions is a miracle youre rip van winkles who ever heard in these degenerate times of a young man and woman of the city putting their blankets on their backs and starting out in search of land why its the old argonaut spirit youre as like as peas in a pod to those who yoked their oxen and held west to the lands beyond the sunset ill wager your fathers and mothers or grandfathers and grandmothers were that very stock  saxons eyes were glistening and billys were friendly once more both nodded their heads  im of the old stock myself mrs mortimer went on proudly my grandmother was one of the survivors of the donner party my grandfather jason whitney came around the horn and took part in the raising of the bear flag at sonoma he was at monterey when john marshall discovered gold in sutters millrace one of the streets in san francisco is named after him  i know it billy put in whitney street its near russian hill saxons mother walked across the plains  and billys grandfather and grandmother were massacred by the indians saxon contributed his father was a little baby boy and lived with the indians until captured by the whites he didnt even know his name and was adopted by a mr roberts  why you two dear children were almost like relatives mrs mortimer beamed its a breath of old times alas all forgotten in these flyaway days i am especially interested because ive catalogued and read everything covering those times you she indicated billy you are historical or at least your father is i remember about him the whole thing is in bancrofts history it was the modoc indians there were eighteen wagons your father was the only survivor a mere baby at the time with no knowledge of what happened he was adopted by the leader of the whites  thats right said billy it was the modocs his train must have ben bound for oregon it was all wiped out i wonder if you know anything about saxons mother she used to write poetry in the early days  was any of it printed  yes saxon answered in the old san jose papers  and do you know any of it  yes theres one beginning  sweet as the windlutes airy strains your gentle muse has learned to sing and californias boundless plains prolong the soft notes echoing  it sounds familiar mrs mortimer said pondering  and there was another i remember that began  ive stolen away from the crowd in the groves where the nude statues stand and the leaves point and shiver  and it run on like that i dont understand it all it was written to my father  a love poem mrs mortimer broke in i remember it wait a minute dadadah dadadah dadadah dadastands  in the spray of a fountain whose seedamethysts tremble lightly a moment on bosom and hands then drip in their basin from bosom and wrists  ive never forgotten the drip of the seedamethysts though i dont remember your mothers name  it was daisy saxon began  no dayelle mrs mortimer corrected with quickening recollection  oh but nobody called her that  but she signed it that way what is the rest  daisy wiley brown  mrs mortimer went to the bookshelves and quickly returned with a large soberlybound volume  its the story of the files she explained among other things all the good fugitive verse was gathered here from the old newspaper files her eyes running down the index suddenly stopped i was right dayelle wiley brown there it is ten of her poems too the vikings quest days of gold constancy the caballero graves at little meadow  we fought off the indians there saxon interrupted in her excitement and mother who was only a little girl went out and got water for the wounded and the indians wouldnt shoot at her everybody said it was a miracle she sprang out of billys arms reaching for the book and crying oh let me see it let me see it its all new to me i dont know these poems can i copy them ill learn them by heart just to think my mothers  mrs mortimers glasses required repolishing and for half an hour she and billy remained silent while saxon devoured her mothers lines at the end staring at the book which she had closed on her finger she could only repeat in wondering awe  and i never knew i never knew  but during that half hour mrs mortimers mind had not been idle a little later she broached her plan she believed in intensive dairying as well as intensive farming and intended as soon as the lease expired to establish a jersey dairy on the other ten acres this like everything she had done would be model and it meant that she would require more help billy and saxon were just the two by next summer she could have them installed in the cottage she intended building in the meantime she could arrange one way and another to get work for billy through the winter she would guarantee this work and she knew a small house they could rent just at the end of the carline under her supervision billy could take charge from the very beginning of the building in this way they would be earning money preparing themselves for independent farming life and have opportunity to look about them  but her persuasions were in vain in the end saxon succinctly epitomized their point of view  we cant stop at the first place even if it is as beautiful and kind as yours and as nice as this valley is we dont even know what we want weve got to go farther and see all kinds of places and all kinds of ways in order to find out were not in a hurry to make up our minds we want to make oh so very sure and besides she hesitated besides we dont like altogether flat land billy wants some hills in his and so do i  when they were ready to leave mrs mortimer offered to present saxon with the story of the files but saxon shook her head and got some money from billy  it says it costs two dollars she said will you buy me one and keep it till we get settled then ill write and you can send it to me  oh you americans mrs mortimer chided accepting the money but you must promise to write from time to time before youre settled  she saw them to the county road  you are brave young things she said at parting i only wish i were going with you my pack upon my back youre perfectly glorious the pair of you if ever i can do anything for you just let me know youre bound to succeed and i want a hand in it myself let me know how that government land turns out though i warn you i havent much faith in its feasibility its sure to be too far away from markets  she shook hands with billy saxon she caught into her arms and kissed  be brave she said with low earnestness in saxons ear youll win you are starting with the right ideas and you were right not to accept my proposition but remember it or better will always be open to you youre young yet both of you dont be in a hurry any time you stop anywhere for a while let me know and ill mail you heaps of agricultural reports and farm publications goodbye heaps and heaps and heaps of luck    chapter iv  bill sat motionless on the edge of the bed in their little room in san jose that night a musing expression in his eyes  well he remarked at last with a longdrawn breath all ive got to say is theres some pretty nice people in this world after all take mrs mortimer now shes the real goodsregular old american  a fine educated lady saxon agreed and not a bit ashamed to work at farming herself and she made it go too  on twenty acresno ten and paid for em an all improvements an supported herself four hired men a swede woman an daughter an her own nephew it gets me ten acres why my father never talked lessn one hundred an sixty acres even your brother tom still talks in quarter sectionsan she was only a woman too we was lucky in meetin her  wasnt it an adventure saxon cried thats what comes of traveling you never know whats going to happen next it jumped right out at us just when we were tired and wondering how much farther to san jose we werent expecting it at all and she didnt treat us as if we were tramping and that houseso clean and beautiful you could eat off the floor i never dreamed of anything so sweet and lovely as the inside of that house  it smelt good billy supplied  thats the very thing its what the womens pages call atmosphere i didnt know what they meant before that house has beautiful sweet atmosphere  like all your nice underthings said billy  and thats the next step after keeping your body sweet and clean and beautiful its to have your house sweet and clean and beautiful  but it cant be a rented one saxon youve got to own it landlords dont build houses like that just the same one thing stuck out plain that house was not expensive it wasnt the cost it was the way the wood was ordinary wood you can buy in any lumber yard why our house on pine street was made out of the same kind of wood but the way it was made was different i cant explain but you can see what im drivin at  saxon revisioning the little bungalow they had just left repeated absently thats itthe way  the next morning they were early afoot seeking through the suburbs of san jose the road to san juan and monterey saxons limp had increased beginning with a burst blister her heel was skinning rapidly billy remembered his fathers talks about care of the feet and stopped at a butcher shop to buy five cents worth of mutton tallow  thats the stuff he told saxon clean footgear and the feet well greased well put some on as soon as were clear of town an we might as well go easy for a couple of days now if i could get a little work so as you could rest up several days itd be just the thing i 11 keep my eye peeled  almost on the outskirts of town he left saxon on the county road and went up a long driveway to what appeared a large farm he came back beaming  its all hunkydory he called as he approached well just go down to that clump of trees by the creek an pitch camp i start work in the mornin two dollars a day an board myself itd been a dollar an a half if he furnished the board i told m i liked the other way best an that i had my camp with me the weathers fine an we can make out a few days till your foots in shape come on well pitch a regular decent camp  how did you get the job saxon asked as they cast about determining their campsite  wait till we get fixed an ill tell you all about it it was a dream a cinch  not until the bed was spread the fire built and a pot of beans boiling did billy throw down the last armful of wood and begin  in the first place bensons no oldfashioned geezer you wouldnt think he was a farmer to look at m hes up to date sharp as tacks talks an acts like a business man i could see that just by lookin at his place before i seen him he took about fifteen seconds to size me up  can you plow says he  sure thing i told m  know horses  i was hatched in a boxstall says i  an just thenyou remember that fourhorse load of machinery that come in after mejust then it drove up  how about four horses he asks casuallike  right to home i can drive m to a plow a sewin machine or a merrygoround  jump up an take them lines then he says quick an sharp not wastin seconds see that shed go round the barn to the right an back in for unloadin  an right here i wanta tell you it was some nifty drivin he was askin i could see by the tracks the wagonsd all ben goin around the barn to the left what he was askin was too close work for comforta double turn like an s between a corner of a paddock an around the corner of the barn to the last swing an to eat into the little room there was there was piles of manure just thrown outa the barn an not hauled away yet but i wasnt lettin on nothin the driver gave me the lines an i could see he was grinnin sure id make a mess of it i bet he couldnt adone it himself i never let on an away we went me not even knowin the horsesbut say if youd seen me throw them leaders clean to the top of the manure till the nigh horse was scrapin the side of the barn to make it an the off hind hub was cuttin the corner post of the paddock to miss by six inches it was the only way an them horses was sure beauts the leaders slacked back an darn near sat down on their singletrees when i threw the back into the wheelers an slammed on the brake an stopped on the very precise spot  youll do benson says that was good work  aw shucks i says indifferent as hell gimme something real hard  he smiles an understands  you done that well he says an im particular about who handles my horses the road aint no place for you you must be a good man gone wrong just the same you can plow with my horses startin in tomorrow mornin  which shows how wise he wasnt i hadnt showed i could plow  when saxon had served the beans and billy the coffee she stood still a moment and surveyed the spread meal on the blanketsthe canister of sugar the condensed milk tin the sliced corned beef the lettuce salad and sliced tomatoes the slices of fresh french bread and the steaming plates of beans and mugs of coffee  what a difference from last night saxon exclaimed clapping her hands its like an adventure out of a book oh that boy i went fishing with think of that beautiful table and that beautiful house last night and then look at this why we could have lived a thousand years on end in oakland and never met a woman like mrs mortimer nor dreamed a house like hers existed and billy just to think weve only just started  billy worked for three days and while insisting that he was doing very well he freely admitted that there was more in plowing than he had thought saxon experienced quiet satisfaction when she learned he was enjoying it  i never thought id like plowinmuch he observed but its fine its good for the legmuscles too they dont get exercise enough in teamin if ever i trained for another fight you bet id take a whack at plowin an you know the ground has a regular good smell to it aturnin over an turnin over gosh its good enough to eat that smell an it just goes on turnin up an over fresh an thick an good all day long an the horses are joedandies they know their business as well as a man thats one thing benson aint got a scrub horse on the place  the last day billy worked the sky clouded over the air grew damp a strong wind began to blow from the southeast and all the signs were present of the first winter rain billy came back in the evening with a small roll of old canvas he had borrowed which he proceeded to arrange over their bed on a framework so as to shed rain several times he complained about the little finger of his left hand it had been bothering him all day he told saxon for several days slightly in fact and it was as tender as a boilmost likely a splinter but he had been unable to locate it  he went ahead with storm preparations elevating the bed on old boards which he lugged from a disused barn falling to decay on the opposite bank of the creek upon the boards he heaped dry leaves for a mattress he concluded by reinforcing the canvas with additional guys of odd pieces of rope and bailingwire  when the first splashes of rain arrived saxon was delighted billy betrayed little interest his finger was hurting too much he said neither he nor saxon could make anything of it and both scoffed at the idea of a felon  it might be a runaround saxon hazarded  whats that  i dont know i remember mrs cady had one once but i was too small it was the little finger too she poulticed it i think and i remember she dressed it with some kind of salve it got awful bad and finished by her losing the nail after that it got well quick and a new nail grew out suppose i make a hot bread poultice for yours  billy declined being of the opinion that it would be better in the morning saxon was troubled and as she dozed off she knew that he was lying restlessly wide awake a few minutes afterward roused by a heavy blast of wind and rain on the canvas she heard billy softly groaning she raised herself on her elbow and with her free hand in the way she knew manipulating his forehead and the surfaces around his eyes soothed him off to sleep  again she slept and again she was aroused this time not by the storm but by billy she could not see but by feeling she ascertained his strange position he was outside the blankets and on his knees his forehead resting on the boards his shoulders writhing with suppressed anguish  shes pulsin to beat the band he said when she spoke its worsen a thousand toothaches but it aint nothin if only the canvas dont blow down think what our folks had to stand he gritted out between groans why my father was out in the mountains an the man with m got mauled by a grizzlyclean clawed to the bones all over an they was outa grub an had to travel two times outa three when my father put m on the horse hed faint away had to be tied on an that lasted five weeks an he pulled through then there was jack quigley he blowed off his whole right hand with the burstin of his shotgun an the huntin dog pup he had with m ate up three of the fingers an he was all alone in the marsh an  but saxon heard no more of the adventures of jack quigley a terrific blast of wind parted several of the guys collapsed the framework and for a moment buried them under the canvas the next moment canvas framework and trailing guys were whisked away into the darkness and saxon and billy were deluged with rain  only one thing to do he yelled in her ear gather up the things an get into that old barn  they accomplished this in the drenching darkness making two trips across the stepping stones of the shallow creek and soaking themselves to the knees the old barn leaked like a sieve but they managed to find a dry space on which to spread their anything but dry bedding billys pain was heartrending to saxon an hour was required to subdue him to a doze and only by continuously stroking his forehead could she keep him asleep shivering and miserable she accepted a night of wakefulness gladly with the knowledge that she kept him from knowing the worst of his pain  at the time when she had decided it must be past midnight there was an interruption from the open doorway came a flash of electric light like a tiny searchlight which quested about the barn and came to rest on her and billy from the source of light a harsh voice said  ah ha ive got you come out of that  billy sat up his eyes dazzled by the light the voice behind the light was approaching and reiterating its demand that they come out of that  whats up billy asked  me was the answer an wide awake you bet  the voice was now beside them scarcely a yard away yet they could see nothing on account of the light which was intermittent frequently going out for an instant as the operators thumb tired on the switch  come on get a move on the voice went on roll up your blankets an trot along i want you  who in hell are you billy demanded  im the constable come on  well what do you want  you of course the pair of you  what for  vagrancy now hustle i aint goin to loaf here all night  aw chase yourself billy advised i aint a vag im a workingman  maybe you are an maybe you aint said the constable but you can tell all that to judge neusbaumer in the mornin  why you you stinkin dirty cur you think youre goin to pull me billy began turn the light on yourself i want to see what kind of an ugly mug you got pull me eh pull me for two cents id get up there an beat you to a jelly you  no no billy saxon pleaded dont make trouble it would mean jail  thats right the constable approved listen to your woman  shes my wife an see you speak of her as such billy warned now get out if you know whats good for yourself  ive seen your kind before the constable retorted an ive got my little persuader with me take a squint  the shaft of light shifted and out of the darkness illuminated with ghastly brilliance they saw thrust a hand holding a revolver this hand seemed a thing apart selfexistent with no corporeal attachment and it appeared and disappeared like an apparition as the thumbpressure wavered on the switch one moment they were staring at the hand and revolver the next moment at impenetrable darkness and the next moment again at the hand and revolver  now i guess youll come the constable gloated  you got another guess comin billy began  but at that moment the light went out they heard a quick movement on the officers part and the thud of the lightstick on the ground both billy and the constable fumbled for it but billy found it and flashed it on the other they saw a graybearded man clad in streaming oilskins he was an old man and reminded saxon of the sort she had been used to see in grand army processions on decoration day  give me that stick he bullied  billy sneered a refusal  then ill put a hole through you by criminy  he leveled the revolver directly at billy whose thumb on the switch did not waver and they could see the gleaming bullettips in the chambers of the cylinder  why you whiskery old skunk you aint got the grit to shoot sour apples was billys answer i know your kindbrave as lions when it comes to pullin miserable brokenspirited bindle stiffs but as leery as a yellow dog when you face a man pull that trigger why you pusillanimous piece of dirt youd run with your tail between your legs if i said boo  suiting action to the word billy let out an explosive boo and saxon giggled involuntarily at the startle it caused in the constable  ill give you a last chance the latter grated through his teeth turn over that lightstick an come along peaceable or ill lay you out  saxon was frightened for billys sake and yet only half frightened she had a faith that the man dared not fire and she felt the old familiar thrills of admiration for billys courage she could not see his face but she knew in all certitude that it was bleak and passionless in the terrifying way she had seen it when he fought the three irishmen  you aint the first man i killed the constable threatened im an old soldier an i aint squeamish over blood  and you ought to be ashamed of yourself saxon broke in trying to shame and disgrace peaceable people whove done no wrong  youve done wrong sleepin here was his vindication this aint your property its agin the law an folks that go agin the law go to jail as the two of youll go ive sent many a tramp up for thirty days for sleepin in this very shack why its a regular trap for em i got a good glimpse of your faces an could see you was tough characters he turned on billy ive fooled enough with you are you goin to give in an come peaceable  im goin to tell you a couple of things old boss billy answered number one you aint goin to pull us number two were goin to sleep the night out here  gimme that lightstick the constable demanded peremptorily  gwan whiskers youre standin on your foot beat it pull your freight as for your torch youll find it outside in the mud  billy shifted the light until it illuminated the doorway and then threw the stick as he would pitch a baseball they were now in total darkness and they could hear the intruder gritting his teeth in rage  now start your shootin an see whatll happen to you billy advised menacingly  saxon felt for billys hand and squeezed it proudly the constable grumbled some threat  whats that billy demanded sharply aint you gone yet now listen to me whiskers ive put up with all your shenanigan im goin to now get out or ill throw you out an if you come monkeyin around here again youll get yours now get  so great was the roar of the storm that they could hear nothing billy rolled a cigarette when he lighted it they saw the barn was empty billy chuckled  say i was so mad i clean forgot my runaround its only just beginnin to tune up again  saxon made him lie down and receive her soothing ministrations  there is no use moving till morning she said then just as soon as its light well catch a car into san jose rent a room get a hot breakfast and go to a drug store for the proper stuff for poulticing or whatever treatments needed  but benson billy demurred  ill telephone him from town it will only cost five cents i saw he had a wire and you couldnt plow on account of the rain even if your finger was well besides well both be mending together my heel will be all right by the time it clears up and we can start traveling    chapter v  early on monday morning three days later saxon and billy took an electric car to the end of the line and started a second time for san juan puddles were standing in the road but the sun shone from a blue sky and everywhere on the ground was a faint hint of budding green at bensons saxon waited while billy went in to get his six dollars for the three days plowing  kicked like a steer because i was quittin he told her when he came back he wouldnt listen at first said hed put me to drivin in a few days an that there wasnt enough good fourhorse men to let one go easily  and what did you say  oh i just told m i had to be movin along an when he tried to argue i told m my wife was with me an she was blamed anxious to get along  but so are you billy  sure pete but just the same i wasnt as keen as you doggone it i was gettin to like that plowin ill never be scairt to ask for a job at it again ive got to where i savvy the burro an you bet i can plow against most of m right now  an hour afterward with a good three miles to their credit they edged to the side of the road at the sound of an automobile behind them but the machine did not pass benson was alone in it and he came to a stop alongside  where are you bound he inquired of billy with a quick measuring glance at saxon  montereyif youre goin that far billy answered with a chuckle  i can give you a lift as far as watsonville it would take you several days on shanks mare with those loads climb in he addressed saxon directly do you want to ride in front  saxon glanced to billy  go on he approved its fine in frontthis is my wife mr bensonmrs roberts  oh ho so youre the one that took your husband away from me benson accused good humoredly as he tucked the robe around her  saxon shouldered the responsibility and became absorbed in watching him start the car  id be a mighty poor farmer if i owned no more land than youd plowed before you came to me benson with a twinkling eye jerked over his shoulder to billy  id never had my hands on a plow but once before billy confessed but a fellow has to learn some time  at two dollars a day  if he can get some alfalfa artist to put up for it billy met him complacently  benson laughed heartily  youre a quick learner he complimented i could see that you and plows werent on speaking acquaintance but you took hold right there isnt one man in ten i could hire off the county road that could do as well as you were doing on the third day but your big asset is that you know horses it was half a joke when i told you to take the lines that morning youre a trained horseman and a born horseman as well  hes very gentle with horses saxon said  but theres more than that to it benson took her up your husbands got the way with him its hard to explain but thats what it isthe way its an instinct almost kindness is necessary but grip is more so your husband grips his horses take the test i gave him with the fourhorse load it was too complicated and severe kindness couldnt have done it it took grip i could see it the moment he started there wasnt any doubt in his mind there wasnt any doubt in the horses they got the feel of him they just knew the thing was going to be done and that it was up to them to do it they didnt have any fear but just the same they knew the boss was in the seat when he took hold of those lines he took hold of the horses he gripped them dont you see he picked them up and put them where he wanted them swung them up and down and right and left made them pull and slack and backand they knew everything was going to come out right oh horses may be stupid but theyre not altogether fools they know when the proper horseman has hold of them though how they know it so quickly is beyond me  benson paused half vexed at his volubility and gazed keenly at saxon to see if she had followed him what he saw in her face and eyes satisfied him and he added with a short laugh  horseflesh is a hobby of mine dont think otherwise because i am running a stink engine id rather be streaking along here behind a pair of faststeppers but id lose time on them and worse than that id be too anxious about them all the time as for this thing why it has no nerves no delicate joints nor tendons its a case of let her rip  the miles flew past and saxon was soon deep in talk with her host here again she discerned immediately was a type of the new farmer the knowledge she had picked up enabled her to talk to advantage and when benson talked she was amazed that she could understand so much in response to his direct querying she told him her and billys plans sketching the oakland life vaguely and dwelling on their future intentions  almost as in a dream when they passed the nurseries at morgan hill she learned they had come twenty miles and realized that it was a longer stretch than they had planned to walk that day and still the machine hummed on eating up the distance as ever it flashed into view  i wondered what so good a man as your husband was doing on the road benson told her  yes she smiled he said you said he must be a good man gone wrong  but you see i didnt know about you now i understand though i must say its extraordinary in these days for a young couple like you to pack your blankets in search of land and before i forget it i want to tell you one thing he turned to billy i am just telling your wife that theres an alltheyear job waiting for you on my ranch and theres a tight little cottage of three rooms the two of you can housekeep in dont forget  among other things saxon discovered that benson had gone through the college of agriculture at the university of californiaa branch of learning she had not known existed he gave her small hope in her search for government land  the only government land left he informed her is what is not good enough to take up for one reason or another if its good land down there where youre going then the market is inaccessible i know no railroads tap in there  wait till we strike pajaro valley he said when they had passed gilroy and were booming on toward sargents ill show you what can be done with the soiland not by cowcollege graduates but by uneducated foreigners that the high and mighty american has always sneered at ill show you its one of the most wonderful demonstrations in the state  at sargents he left them in the machine a few minutes while he transacted business  whew it beats hikin billy said the days young yet and when he drops us well be fresh for a few miles on our own just the same when we get settled an well off i guess ill stick by horses theyll always be good enough for me  a machines only good to get somewhere in a hurry saxon agreed of course if we got very very rich  say saxon billy broke in suddenly struck with an idea ive learned one thing i aint afraid any more of not gettin work in the country i was at first but i didnt tell you just the same i was dead leery when we pulled out on the san leandro pike an here already is two places openmrs mortimers an bensons an steady jobs too yep a man can get work in the country  ah saxon amended with a proud little smile you havent said it right any good man can get work in the country the big farmers dont hire men out of charity  sure they aint in it for their health he grinned  and they jump at you thats because you are a good man they can see it with half an eye why billy take all the working tramps weve met on the road already there wasnt one to compare with you i looked them over theyre all weakweak in their bodies weak in their heads weak both ways  yep they are a pretty measly bunch billy admitted modestly  its the wrong time of the year to see pajaro valley benson said when he again sat beside saxon and sargents was a thing of the past just the same its worth seeing any time think of ittwelve thousand acres of apples do you know what they call pajaro valley now new dalmatia were being squeezed out we yankees thought we were smart well the dalmatians came along and showed they were smarter they were miserable immigrantspoorer than jobs turkey first they worked at days labor in the fruit harvest next they began in a small way buying the apples on the trees the more money they made the bigger became their deals pretty soon they were renting the orchards on long leases and now they are beginning to buy the land it wont be long before they own the whole valley and the last american will be gone  oh our smart yankees why those first ragged slavs in their first little deals with us only made something like two and three thousand per cent profits and now theyre satisfied to make a hundred per cent its a calamity if their profits sink to twentyfive or fifty per cent  its like san leandro saxon said the original owners of the land are about all gone already its intensive cultivation she liked that phrase it isnt a case of having a lot of acres but of how much they can get out of one acre  yes and more than that benson answered nodding his head emphatically lots of them like luke scurich are in it on a large scale several of them are worth a quarter of a million already i know ten of them who will average one hundred and fifty thousand each they have a way with apples its almost a gift they know trees in much the same way your husband knows horses each tree is just as much an individual to them as a horse is to me they know each tree its whole history everything that ever happened to it its every idiosyncrasy they have their fingers on its pulse they can tell if its feeling as well today as it felt yesterday and if it isnt they know why and proceed to remedy matters for it they can look at a tree in bloom and tell how many boxes of apples it will pack and not only thattheyll know what the quality and grades of those apples are going to be why they know each individual apple and they pick it tenderly with love never hurting it and pack it and ship it tenderly and with love and when it arrives at market it isnt bruised nor rotten and it fetches top price  yes its more than intensive these adriatic slavs are longheaded in business not only can they grow apples but they can sell apples no market what does it matter make a market thats their way while our kind let the crops rot kneedeep under the trees look at peter mengol every year he goes to england and he takes a hundred carloads of yellow newton pippins with him why those dalmatians are showing pajaro apples on the south african market right now and coining money out of it hand over fist  what do they do with all the money saxon queried  buy the americans of pajaro valley out of course as they are already doing  and then she questioned  benson looked at her quickly  then theyll start buying the americans out of some other valley and the americans will spend the money and by the second generation start rotting in the cities as you and your husband would have rotted if you hadnt got out  saxon could not repress a shudderas mary had rotted she thought as bert and all the rest had rotted as tom and all the rest were rotting  oh its a great country benson was continuing but were not a great people kipling is right were crowded out and sitting on the stoop and the worst of it is theres no reason we shouldnt know better were teaching it in all our agricultural colleges experiment stations and demonstration trains but the people wont take hold and the immigrant who has learned in a hard school beats them out why after i graduated and before my father diedhe was of the old school and laughed at what he called my theoriesi traveled for a couple of years i wanted to see how the old countries farmed oh i saw  well soon enter the valley you bet i saw first thing in japan the terraced hillsides take a hill so steep you couldnt drive a horse up it no bother to them they terraced ita stone wall and good masonry six feet high a level terrace six feet wide up and up walls and terraces the same thing all the way straight into the air walls upon walls terraces upon terraces until ive seen tenfoot walls built to make threefoot terraces and twentyfoot walls for four or five feet of soil they could grow things on and that soil packed up the mountainsides in baskets on their backs  same thing everywhere i went in greece in ireland in dalmatiai went there too they went around and gathered every bit of soil they could find gleaned it and even stole it by the shovelful or handful and carried it up the mountains on their backs and built farmsbuilt them made them on the naked rock why in france ive seen hill peasants mining their streambeds for soil as our fathers mined the streams of california for gold only our golds gone and the peasants soil remains turning over and over doing something growing something all the time now i guess ill hush  my god billy muttered in awestricken tones our folks never done that no wonder they lost out  theres the valley now benson said look at those trees look at those hillsides thats new dalmatia look at it an apple paradise look at that soil look at the way its worked  it was not a large valley that saxon saw but everywhere across the flatlands and up the low rolling hills the industry of the dalmatians was evident as she looked she listened to benson  do you know what the old settlers did with this beautiful soil planted the flats in grain and pastured cattle on the hills and now twelve thousand acres of it are in apples its a regular show place for the eastern guests at del monte who run out here in their machines to see the trees in bloom or fruit take matteo lettunichhes one of the originals entered through castle garden and became a dishwasher when he laid eyes on this valley he knew it was his klondike today he leases seven hundred acres and owns a hundred and thirty of his ownthe finest orchard in the valley and he packs from forty to fifty thousand boxes of export apples from it every year and he wont let a soul but a dalmatian pick a single apple of all those apples one day in a banter i asked him what hed sell his hundred and thirty acres for he answered seriously he told me what it had netted him year by year and struck an average he told me to calculate the principal from that at six per cent i did it came to over three thousand dollars an acre  what are all the chinks doin in the valley billy asked growin apples too  benson shook his head  but thats another point where we americans lose out there isnt anything wasted in this valley not a core nor a paring and it isnt the americans who do the saving there are fiftyseven appleevaporating furnaces to say nothing of the apple canneries and cider and vinegar factories and mr john chinaman owns them they ship fifteen thousand barrels of cider and vinegar each year  it was our folks that made this country billy reflected fought for it opened it up did everything  but develop it benson caught him up we did our best to destroy it as we destroyed the soil of new england he waved his hand indicating some place beyond the hills salinas lies over that way if you went through there youd think you were in japan and more than one fat little fruit valley in california has been taken over by the japanese their method is somewhat different from the dalmatians first they drift in fruit picking at days wages they give better satisfaction than the american fruitpickers too and the yankee grower is glad to get them next as they get stronger they form in japanese unions and proceed to run the american labor out still the fruitgrowers are satisfied the next step is when the japs wont pick the american labor is gone the fruitgrower is helpless the crop perishes then in step the jap labor bosses theyre the masters already they contract for the crop the fruitgrowers are at their mercy you see pretty soon the japs are running the valley the fruitgrowers have become absentee landlords and are busy learning higher standards of living in the cities or making trips to europe remains only one more step the japs buy them out theyve got to sell for the japs control the labor market and could bankrupt them at will  but if this goes on what is left for us asked saxon  what is happening those of us who havent anything rot in the cities those of us who have land sell it and go to the cities some become larger capitalists some go into the professions the rest spend the money and start rotting when its gone and if it lasts their lifetime their children do the rotting for them  their long ride was soon over and at parting benson reminded billy of the steady job that awaited him any time he gave the word  i guess well take a peep at that government land first billy answered dont know what well settle down to but theres one thing sure we wont tackle  whats that  start in applegrowin at three thousan dollars an acre  billy and saxon their packs upon the backs trudged along a hundred yards he was the first to break silence  an i tell you another thing saxon well never be goin around smellin out an swipin bits of soil an carryin it up a hill in a basket the united states is big yet i dont care what benson or any of em says the united states aint played out theres millions of acres untouched an waitin an its up to us to find em  and ill tell you one thing saxon said were getting an education tom was raised on a ranch yet he doesnt know right now as much about farming conditions as we do and ill tell you another thing the more i think of it the more it seems we are going to be disappointed about that government land  aint no use believin what everybody tells you he protested  oh it isnt that its what i think i leave it to you if this land around here is worth three thousand an acre why is it that government land if its any good is waiting there only a short way off to be taken for the asking  billy pondered this for a quarter of a mile but could come to no conclusion at last he cleared his throat and remarked  well we can wait till we see it first cant we  all right saxon agreed well wait till we see it    chapter vi  they had taken the direct county road across the hills from monterey instead of the seventeen mile drive around by the coast so that carmel bay came upon them without any foreglimmerings of its beauty dropping down through the pungent pines they passed woodsembowered cottages quaint and rustic of artists and writers and went on across windblown rolling sandhills held to place by sturdy lupine and nodding with pale california poppies saxon screamed in sudden wonder of delight then caught her breath and gazed at the amazing peacockblue of a breaker shot through with golden sunlight overfalling in a milelong sweep and thundering into white ruin of foam on a crescent beach of sand scarcely less white  how long they stood and watched the stately procession of breakers rising from out the deep and windcapped sea to froth and thunder at their feet saxon did not know she was recalled to herself when billy laughing tried to remove the telescope basket from her shoulders  you kind of look as though you was goin to stop a while he said so we might as well get comfortable  i never dreamed it i never dreamed it she repeated with passionately clasped hands i i thought the surf at the cliff house was wonderful but it gave no idea of thisoh look look did you ever see such an unspeakable color and the sunlight flashing right through it oh oh oh  at last she was able to take her eyes from the surf and gaze at the seahorizon of deepest peacockblue and piled with cloudmasses at the curve of the beach south to the jagged point of rocks and at the rugged blue mountains seen across soft low hills landward up carmel valley  might as well sit down an take it easy billy indulged her this is too good to want to run away from all at once  saxon assented but began immediately to unlace her shoes  you aint agoin to billy asked in surprised delight then began unlacing his own  but before they were ready to run barefooted on the perilous fringe of creamwet sand where land and ocean met a new and wonderful thing attracted their attention down from the dark pines and across the sandhills ran a man naked save for narrow trunks he was smooth and rosyskinned cherubicfaced with a thatch of curly yellow hair but his body was hugely thewed as a hercules  geemust be sandow billy muttered low to saxon  but she was thinking of the engraving in her mothers scrapbook and of the vikings on the wet sands of england  the runner passed them a dozen feet away crossed the wet sand never parsing till the froth wash was to his knees while above him ten feet at least upreared a was of overtopping water huge and powerful as his body had seemed it was now white and fragile in the face of that imminent greathanded buffet of the sea saxon gasped with anxiety and she stole a look at billy to note that he was tense with watching  but the stranger sprang to meet the blow and just when it seemed he must be crushed he dived into the face of the breaker and disappeared the mighty mass of water fell in thunder on the beach but beyond appeared a yellow head one arm outreaching and a portion of a shoulder only a few strokes was he able to make are he was come pelted to dye through another breaker this was the battleto win seaward against the creep of the shoreward hastening sea each time he dived and was lost to view saxon caught her breath and clenched her hands sometimes after the passage of a breaker they enfold not find him and when they did he would be scores of feet away flung there like a chip by a smokebearded breaker often it seemed he must fail and be thrown upon the beach but at the end of half an hour he was beyond the outer edge of the surf and swimming strong no longer diving but topping the waves soon he was so far away that only at intervals could they find the speck of him that too vanished and saxon and billy looked at each other she with amazement at the swimmers valor billy with blue eyes flashing  some swimmer that boy some swimmer he praised nothing chickenhearted about himsay i only know tankswimmin an bayswimmin but now im goin to learn oceanswimmin if i could do that id be so proud you couldnt come within forty feet of me why saxon honest to god id sooner do what he done than own a thousan farms oh i can swim too im tellin you like a fishi swum one sunday from the narrow gauge pier to sessions basin an thats milesbut i never seen anything like that guy in the swimmin line an im not goin to leave this beach until he comes backall by his lonely out there in a mountain sea think of it hes got his nerve all right all right  saxon and billy ran barefooted up and down the beach pursuing each other with brandished snakes of seaweed and playing like children for an hour it was not until they were putting on their shoes that they sighted the yellow head bearing shoreward billy was at the edge of the surf to meet him emerging not whiteskinned as he had entered but red from the pounding he had received at the hands of the sea  youre a wonder and i just got to hand it to you billy greeted him in outspoken admiration  it was a big surf today the young man replied with a nod of acknowledgment  it dont happen that you are a fighter i never heard of billy queried striving to get some inkling of the identity of the physical prodigy  the other laughed and shook his head and billy could not guess that he was an excaptain of a varsity eleven and incidentally the father of a family and the author of many books he looked billy over with an eye trained in measuring freshmen aspirants for the gridiron  youre some body of a man he appreciated youd strip with the best of them am i right in guessing that you know your way about in the ring  billy nodded my names roberts  the swimmer scowled with a futile effort at recollection  billbill roberts billy supplemented  oh honot big bill roberts why i saw you fight before the earthquake in the mechanics pavilion it was a preliminary to eddie hanlon and some other fellow youre a twohanded fighter i remember that with an awful wallop but slow yes i remember you were slow that night but you got your man he put out a wet hand my names hazardjim hazard  an if youre the football coach that was a couple of years ago ive read about you in the papers am i right  they shook hands heartily and saxon was introduced she felt very small beside the two young giants and very proud withal that she belonged to the race that gave them birth she could only listen to them talk  id like to put on the gloves with you every day for half an hour hazard said you could teach me a lot are you going to stay around here  no were goin on down the coast lookin for land just the same i could teach you a few and theres one thing you could teach mesurf swimmin  ill swap lessons with you any time hazard offered he turned to saxon why dont you stop in carmel for a while it isnt so bad  its beautiful she acknowledged with a grateful smile but she turned and pointed to their packs on the edge of the lupine were on the tramp and lookin for government land  if youre looking down past the sur for it it will keep he laughed well ive got to run along and get some clothes on if you come back this way look me up anybody will tell you where i live so long  and as he had first arrived he departed crossing the sandhills on the run  billy followed him with admiring eyes  some boy some boy he murmured why saxon hes famous if ive seen his face in the papers once ive seen it a thousand times an he aint a bit stuck on himself just man to man sayim beginnin to have faith in the old stock again  they turned their backs on the beach and in the tiny main street bought meat vegetables and half a dozen eggs billy had to drag saxon away from the window of a fascinating shop where were iridescent pearls of abalone set and unset  abalones grow here all along the coast billy assured her an ill get you all you want low tides the time  my father had a set of cuffbuttons made of abalone shell she said they were set in pure soft gold i havent thought about them for years and i wonder who has them now  they turned south everywhere from among the pines peeped the quaint pretty houses of the artist folk and they were not prepared where the road dipped to carmel river for the building that met their eyes  i know what it is saxon almost whispered its an old spanish mission its the carmel mission of course thats the way the spaniards came up from mexico building missions as they came and converting the indians  until we chased them out spaniards an indians whole kit an caboodle billy observed with calm satisfaction  just the same its wonderful saxon mused gazing at the big halfruined adobe structure there is the mission dolores in san francisco but its smaller than this and not as old  hidden from the sea by low hillocks forsaken by human being and human habitation the church of sunbaked clay and straw and chalkrock stood hushed and breathless in the midst of the adobe ruins which once had housed its worshiping thousands the spirit of the place descended upon saxon and billy and they walked softly speaking in whispers almost afraid to go in through the open ports there was neither priest nor worshiper yet they found all the evidences of use by a congregation which billy judged must be small from the number of the benches inter they climbed the earthquakeracked belfry noting the handhewn timbers and in the gallery discovering the pure quality of their voices saxon trembling at her own temerity softly sang the opening bars of jesus lover of my soul delighted with the result she leaned over the railing gradually increasing her voice to its full strength as she sang  jesus lover of my soul let me to thy bosom fly while the nearer waters roll while the tempest still is nigh hide me o my saviour hide till the storm of life is past safe into the haven guide and receive my soul at last  billy leaned against the ancient wall and loved her with his eyes and when she had finished he murmured almost in a whisper  that was beautifuljust beautiful an you ought to aseen your face when you sang it was as beautiful as your voice aint it funnyi never think of religion except when i think of you  they camped in the willow bottom cooked dinner and spent the afternoon on the point of low rocks north of the mouth of the river they had not intended to spend the afternoon but found themselves too fascinated to turn away from the breakers bursting upon the rocks and from the many kinds of colorful sea life starfish crabs mussels sea anemones and once in a rockpool a small devilfish that chilled their blood when it cast the hooded net of its body around the small crabs they tossed to it as the tide grew lower they gathered a mess of musselshuge fellows five and six inches long and bearded like patriarchs then while billy wandered in a vain search for abalones saxon lay and dabbled in the crystalclear water of a roakpool dipping up handfuls of glistening jewelsground bits of shell and pebble of flashing rose and blue and green and violet billy came back and lay beside her lazying in the seacool sunshine and together they watched the sun sink into the horizon where the ocean was deepest peacockblue  she reached out her hand to billys and sighed with sheer repletion of content it seemed she had never lived such a wonderful day it was as if all old dreams were coming true such beauty of the world she had never guessed in her fondest imagining billy pressed her hand tenderly  what was you thinkin of he asked as they arose finally to go  oh i dont know billy perhaps that it was better one day like this than ten thousand years in oakland    chapter vii  they left carmel river and carmel valley behind and with a rising sun went south across the hills between the mountains and the sea the road was badly washed and gullied and showed little sign of travel  it peters out altogether farther down billy said from there on its only horse trails but i dont see much signs of timber an this soils none so good its only used for pastureno farmin to speak of  the hills were bare and grassy only the canyons were wooded while the higher and more distant hills were furry with chaparral once they saw a coyote slide into the brush and once billy wished for a gun when a large wildcat stared at them malignantly and declined to run until routed by a clod of earth that burst about its ears like shrapnel  several miles along saxon complained of thirst where the road dipped nearly at sea level to cross a small gulch billy looked for water the bed of the gulch was damp with hilldrip and he left her to rest while he sought a spring  say he hailed a few minutes afterward come on down you just gotta see this itll most take your breath away  saxon followed the faint path that led steeply down through the thicket midway along where a barbed wire fence was strung high across the mouth of the gulch and weighted down with big rocks she caught her first glimpse of the tiny beach only from the sea could one guess its existence so completely was it tucked away on three precipitous sides by the land and screened by the thicket furthermore the beach was the head of a narrow rock cove a quarter of a mile long up which pent way the sea roared and was subdued at the last to a gentle pulse of surf beyond the mouth many detached rocks meeting the full force of the breakers spouted foam and spray high in the air the knees of these rocks seen between the surges were black with mussels on their tops sprawled huge sealions tawnywet and roaring in the sun while overhead uttering shrill cries darted and wheeled a multitude of sea birds  the last of the descent from the barbed wire fence was a sliding fall of a dozen feet and saxon arrived on the soft dry sand in a sitting posture  oh i tell you its just great billy bubbled look at it for a camping spot in among the trees there is the prettiest spring you ever saw an look at all the good firewood an he gazed about and seaward with eyes that saw what no rush of words could compass  an an everything we could live here look at the mussels out there an i bet you we could catch fish what dye say we stop a few daysits vacation anywayan i could go back to carmel for hooks an lines  saxon keenly appraising his glowing face realized that he was indeed being won from the city  an there aint no wind here he was recommending not a breath an look how wild it is just as if we was a thousand miles from anywhere  the wind which had been fresh and raw across the bare hills gained no entrance to the cove and the beach was warm and balmy the air sweetly pungent with the thicket odors here and there in the midst of the thicket severe small oak trees and other small trees of which saxon did not know the names her enthusiasm now vied with billys and hand in hand they started to explore  heres where we can play real robinson crusoe billy cried as they crossed the hard sand from highwater mark to the edge of the water come on robinson lets stop over of course im your man friday an what you say goes  but what shall we do with man saturday she pointed in mock consternation to a fresh footprint in the sand he may be a savage cannibal you know  no chance its not a bare foot but a tennis shoe  but a savage could get a tennis shoe from a drowned or eaten sailor couldnt hey she contended  but sailors dont wear tennis shoes was billys prompt refutation  you know too much for man friday she chided but just the same if youll fetch the packs well make camp besides it mightnt have been a sailor that was eaten it might have been a passenger  by the end of an hour a snug camp was completed the blankets were spread a supply of firewood was chopped from the seasoned driftwood and over a fire the coffee pot had begun to sing saxon called to billy who was improvising a table from a wavewashed plank she pointed seaward on the far point of rocks naked except for swimming trunks stood a man he was gazing toward them and they could see his long mop of dark hair blown by the wind as he started to climb the rocks landward billy called saxons attention to the fact that the stranger wore tennis shoes in a few minutes he dropped down from the rock to the beach and walked up to them  gosh billy whispered to saxon hes lean enough but look at his muscles everybody down here seems to go in for physical culture  as the newcomer approached saxon glimpsed sufficient of his face to be reminded of the old pioneers and of a certain type of face seen frequently among the old soldiers young though he wasnot more than thirty she decidedthis man had the same long and narrow face with the high cheekbones high and slender forehead and nose high lean and almost beaked the lips were thin and sensitive but the eyes were different from any she had ever seen in pioneer or veteran or any man they were so dark a gray that they seemed brown and there were a farness and alertness of vision in them as of bright questing through profounds of space in a misty way saxon felt that she had seen him before  hello he greeted you ought to be comfortable here he threw down a partly filled sack mussels all i could get the tides not low enough yet  saxon heard billy muffle an ejaculation and saw painted on his face the extremest astonishment  well honest to god it does me proud to meet you he blurted out shake hands i always said if i laid eyes on you id shakesay  but billys feelings mastered him and beginning with a choking giggle he roared into helpless mirth  the stranger looked at him curiously across their clasped hands and glanced inquiringly to saxon  you gotta excuse me billy gurgled pumping the others hand up and down but i just gotta laugh why honest to god ive woke up nights an laughed an gone to sleep again dont you recognize m saxon hes the same identical dude say friend youre some punkins at a hundred yards dash aint you  and then in a sudden rush saxon placed him he it was who had stood with roy blanchard alongside the automobile on the day she had wandered sick and unwitting into strange neighborhoods nor had that day been the first time she had seen him  remember the bricklayers picnic at weasel park billy was asking an the foot race why id know that nose of yours anywhere among a million you was the guy that stuck your cane between timothy mcmanuss legs an started the grandest roughhouse weasel park or any other park ever seen  the visitor now commenced to laugh he stood on one leg as he laughed harder then stood on the other leg finally he sat down on a log of driftwood  and you were there he managed to gasp to billy at last you saw it you saw it he turned to saxon and you  she nodded  say billy began again as their laughter eased down what i wants know is whatd you wanta do it for say whatd you wants do it for ive been askin that to myself ever since  so have i was the answer  you didnt know timothy mcmanus did you  no id never seen him before and ive never seen him since  but whatd you wanta do it for billy persisted  the young man laughed then controlled himself  to save my life i dont know i have one friend a most intelligent chap that writes sober scientific books and hes always aching to throw an egg into an electric fan to see what will happen perhaps thats the way it was with me except that there was no aching when i saw those legs flying past i merely stuck my stick in between i didnt know i was going to do it i just did it timothy mcmanus was no more surprised than i was  did they catch you billy asked  do i look as if they did i was never so scared in my life timothy mcmanus himself couldnt have caught me that day but what happened afterward i heard they had a fearful roughhouse but i couldnt stop to see  it was not until a quarter of an hour had passed during which billy described the fight that introductions took place mark hall was their visitors name and he lived in a bungalow among the carmel pines  but how did you ever find your way to bierces cove he was curious to know nobody ever dreams of it from the road  so thats its name saxon said  its the name we gave it one of our crowd camped here one summer and we named it after him ill take a cup of that coffee if you dont mindthis to saxon and then ill show your husband around were pretty proud of this cove nobody ever comes here but ourselves  you didnt get all that muscle from bein chased by mcmanus billy observed over the coffee  massage under tension was the cryptic reply  yes billy said pondering vacantly do you eat it with a spoon  hall laughed  ill show you take any muscle you want tense it then manipulate it with your fingers so and so  an that done all that billy asked skeptically  all that the other scorned proudly for one muscle you see theres five tucked away but under command touch your finger to any part of me and see  billy complied touching the right breast  you know something about anatomy picking a muscleless spot scolded hall  billy grinned triumphantly then to his amazement saw a muscle grow up under his finger he prodded it and found it hard and honest  massage under tension hall exulted go onanywhere you want  and anywhere and everywhere billy touched muscles large and small rose up quivered and sank down till the whole body was a ripple of willed quick  never saw anything like it billy marveled at the end an ive seen some few good men stripped in my time why youre all living silk  massage under tension did it my friend the doctors gave me up my friends called me the sick rat and the mangy poet and all that then i quit the city came down to carmel and went in for the open airand massage under tension  jim hazard didnt get his muscles that way billy challenged  certainly not the lucky skunk he was born with them mines made thats the difference im a work of art hes a cave bear come along ill show you around now youd better get your clothes off keep on only your shoes and pants unless youve got a pair of trunks  my mother was a poet saxon said while billy was getting himself ready in the thicket she had noted halls reference to himself  he seemed incurious and she ventured further  some of it was printed  what was her name he asked idly  dayelle wiley brown she wrote the vikings quest days of gold constancy the caballero graves at little meadow and a lot more ten of them are in the story of the files  ive the book at home he remarked for the first time showing real interest she was a pioneer of coursebefore my time ill look her up when i get back to the house my people were pioneers they came by panama in the fifties from long island my father was a doctor but he went into business in san francisco and robbed his fellow men out of enough to keep me and the rest of a large family going ever sincesay where are you and your husband bound  when saxon had told him of their attempt to get away from oakland and of their quest for land he sympathized with the first and shook his head over the second  its beautiful down beyond the sur he told her ive been all over those redwood canyons and the place is alive with game the government land is there too but youd be foolish to settle its too remote and it isnt good farming land except in patches in the canyons i know a mexican there who is wild to sell his five hundred acres for fifteen hundred dollars three dollars an acre and what does that mean that it isnt worth more that it isnt worth so much because he can find no takers land you know is worth what they buy and sell it for  billy emerging from the thicket only in shoes and in pants rolled to the knees put an end to the conversation and saxon watched the two men physically so dissimilar climb the rocks and start out the south side of the cove at first her eyes followed them lazily but soon she grew interested and worried hall was leading billy up what seemed a perpendicular wall in order to gain the backbone of the rock billy went slowly displaying extreme caution but twice she saw him slip the weathereaten stone crumbling away in his hand and rattling beneath him into the cove when hall reached the top a hundred feet above the sea she saw him stand upright and sway easily on the knifeedge which she knew fell away as abruptly on the other side billy once on top contented himself with crouching on hands and knees the leader went on upright walking as easily as on a level floor billy abandoned the hands and knees position but crouched closely and often helped himself with his hands  the knifeedge backbone was deeply serrated and into one of the notches both men disappeared saxon could not keep down her anxiety and climbed out on the north side of the cove which was less rugged and far less difficult to travel even so the unaccustomed height the crumbling surface and the fierce buffets of the wind tried her nerve soon she was opposite the men they had leaped a narrow chasm and were scaling another tooth already billy was going more nimbly but his leader often paused and waited for him the way grew severer and several times the clefts they essayed extended down to the ocean level and spouted spray from the growling breakers that burst through at other times standing erect they would fall forward across deep and narrow clefts until their palms met the opposing side then clinging with their fingers their bodies would be drawn across and up  near the end hall and billy went out of sight over the south side of the backbone and when saxon saw them again they were rounding the extreme point of rock and coming back on the cove side here the way seemed barred a wide fissure with hopelessly vertical sides yawned skywards from a foamwhite vortex where the mad waters shot their level a dozen feet upward and dropped it as abruptly to the black depths of battered rock and writhing weed  clinging precariously the men descended their side till the spray was flying about them here they paused saxon could see hall pointing down across the fissure and imagined he was showing some curious thing to billy she was not prepared for what followed the surflevel sucked and sank away and across and down hall jumped to a narrow foothold where the wash had roared yards deep the moment before without pause as the returning sea rushed up he was around the sharp corner and clawing upward hand and foot to escape being caught billy was now left alone he could not even see hall much less be further advised by him and so tensely did saxon watch that the pain in her fingertips crushed to the rock by which she held warned her to relax billy waited his chance twice made tentative preparations to leap and sank back then leaped across and down to the momentarily exposed foothold doubled the corner and as he clawed up to join hall was washed to the waist but not torn away  saxon did not breathe easily till they rejoined her at the fire one glance at billy told her that he was exceedingly disgusted with himself  youll do for a beginner hall cried slapping him jovially on the bare shoulder that climb is a stunt of mine manys the brave lad thats started with me and broken down before we were half way out ive had a dozen balk at that big jump only the athletes make it  i aint ashamed of admittin i was scairt billy growled youre a regular goat an you sure got my goat half a dozen times but im mad now its mostly trainin an im goin to camp right here an train till i can challenge you to a race out an around an back to the beach  done said hall putting out his hand in ratification and some time when we get together in san francisco ill lead you up against biercethe one this cove is named after his favorite stunt when he isnt collecting rattlesnakes is to wait for a fortymileanhour breeze and then get up and walk on the parapet of a skyscraperon the lee side mind you so that if he blows off theres nothing to fetch him up but the street he sprang that on me once  did you do it billy asked eagerly  i wouldnt have if i hadnt been on id been practicing it secretly for a week and i got twenty dollars out of him on the bet  the tide was now low enough for mussel gathering and saxon accompanied the men out the north wall hall had several sacks to fill a rig was coming for him in the afternoon he explained to cart the mussels back to carmel when the sacks were full they ventured further among the rock crevices and were rewarded with three abalones among the shells of which saxon found one coveted blisterpearl hall initiated them into the mysteries of pounding and preparing the abalone meat for cooking  by this time it seemed to saxon that they had known him a long time it reminded her of the old times when bert had been with them singing his songs or ranting about the last of the mohicans  now listen im going to teach you something hall commanded a large round rock poised in his hand above the abalone meat you must never never pound abalone without singing this song nor must you sing this song at any other time it would be the rankest sacrilege abalone is the food of the gods its preparation is a religious function now listen and follow and remember that it is a very solemn occasion  the stone came down with a thump on the white meat and thereafter arose and fell in a sort of tomtom accompaniment to the poets song  oh some folks boast of quail on toast because they think its tony but im content to owe my rent and live on abalone  oh mission points a friendly joint where every crabs a crony and true and kind youll ever find the clinging abalone  he wanders free beside the sea where er the coast is stony he flaps his wings and madly singsthe plaintive abalone  some stick to biz some flirt with liz down on the sands of coney but we by hell stay in carmel and whang the abalone  he paused with his mouth open and stone upraised there was a rattle of wheels and a voice calling from above where the sacks of mussels had been carried he brought the stone down with a final thump and stood up  theres a thousand more verses like those he said sorry i hadnt time to teach you them he held out his hand palm downward and now children bless you you are now members of the clan of abalone eaters and i solemnly enjoin you never no matter what the circumstances pound abalone meat without chanting the sacred words i have revealed unto you  but we cant remember the words from only one hearing saxon expostulated  that shall be attended to next sunday the tribe of abalone eaters will descend upon you here in bierces cove and you will be able to see the rites the writers and writeresses down even to the iron man with the basilisk eyes vulgarly known as the king of the sacerdotal lizards  will jim hazard come billy called as hall disappeared into the thicket  he will certainly come is he not the cavebear potwalloper and gridironer the most fearsome and next to me the most exalted of all the abalone eaters  saxon and billy could only look at each other till they heard the wheels rattle away  well ill be doggoned billy let out hes some boy that nothing stuck up about him just like jim hazard comes along and makes himself at home youre as good as he is an hes as good as you an were all friends together just like that right off the bat  hes old stock too saxon said he told me while you were undressing his folks came by panama before the railroad was built and from what he said i guess hes got plenty of money  he sure dont act like it  and isnt he full of fun saxon cried  a regular josher an hima poet  oh i dont know billy ive heard that plenty of poets are odd  thats right come to think of it theres joaquin miller lives out in the hills back of fruitvale hes certainly odd its right near his place where i proposed to you just the same i thought poets wore whiskers and eyeglasses an never tripped up footracers at sunday picnics nor run around with as few clothes on as the law allows gatherin mussels an climbin like goats  that night under the blankets saxon lay awake looking at the stars pleasuring in the balmy thicketscents and listening to the dull rumble of the outer surf and the whispering ripples on the sheltered beach a few feet away billy stirred and she knew he was not yet asleep  glad you left oakland billy she snuggled  huh came his answer is a clam happy    chapter viii  every half tide billy raced out the south wall over the dangerous course he and hall had traveled and each trial found him doing it in faster time  wait till sunday he said to saxon ill give that poet a run for his money why they aint a place that bothers me now ive got the head confidence i run where i went on hands an knees i figured it out this way suppose you had a foot to fall on each side an it was soft hay theyd be nothing to stop you you wouldnt fall youd go like a streak then its just the same if its a mile down on each side that aint your concern your concern is to stay on top and go like a streak an dye know saxon when i went at it that way it never bothered me at all wait till he comes with his crowd sunday im ready for him  i wonder what the crowd will be like saxon speculated  like him of course birds of a feather flock together they wont be stuck up any of them youll see  hall had sent out fishlines and a swimming suit by a mexican cowboy bound south to his ranch and from the latter they learned much of the government land and how to get it the week flew by each day saxon sighed a farewell of happiness to the sun each morning they greeted its return with laughter of joy in that another happy day had begun they made no plans but fished gathered mussels and abalones and climbed among the rocks as the moment moved them the abalone meat they pounded religiously to a verse of doggerel improvised by saxon billy prospered saxon had never seen him at so keen a pitch of health as for herself she scarcely needed the little handmirror to know that never since she was a young girl had there been such color in her cheeks such spontaneity of vivacity  its the first time in my life i ever had real play billy said an you an me never played at all all the time we was married this beats bein any kind of a millionaire  no seven oclock whistle saxon exulted id lie abed in the mornings on purpose only everything is too good not to be up and now you just play at chopping some firewood and catching a nice big perch man friday if you expect to get any dinner  billy got up hatchet in hand from where he had been lying prone digging holes in the sand with his bare toes  but it aint goin to last he said with a deep sigh of regret the rainsll come any time now the good weathers hangin on something wonderful  on saturday morning returning from his run out the south wall he missed saxon after helloing for her without result he climbed to the road half a mile away he saw her astride an unsaddled unbridled horse that moved unwillingly at a slow walk across the pasture  lucky for you it was an old mare that had been used to ridinsee them saddle marks he grumbled when she at last drew to a halt beside him and allowed him to help her down  oh billy she sparkled i was never on a horse before it was glorious i felt so helpless too and so brave  im proud of you just the same he said in more grumbling tones than before taint every married womend tackle a strange horse that way especially if shed never ben on one an i aint forgot that youre goin to have a saddle animal all to yourself some daya regular joe dandy  the abalone eaters in two rigs and on a number of horses descended in force on bierces cove there were half a score of men and almost as many women all were young between the ages of twentyfive and forty and all seemed good friends most of them were married they arrived in a roar of good spirits tripping one another down the slippery trail and engulfing saxon and billy in a comradeship as artless and warm as the sunshine itself saxon was appropriated by the girlsshe could not realize them women and they made much of her praising her camping and traveling equipment and insisting on hearing some of her tale they were experienced campers themselves as she quickly discovered when she saw the pots and pans and clothesboilers for the mussels which they had brought  in the meantime billy and the men had undressed and scattered out after mussels and abalones the girls lighted on saxons ukulele and nothing would do but she must play and sing several of them had been to honolulu and knew the instrument confirming mercedes definition of ukulele as jumping flea also they knew hawaiian songs she had learned from mercedes and soon to her accompaniment all were singing aloha oe honolulu tomboy and sweet lei lehua saxon was genuinely shocked when some of them even the more matronly danced hulas on the sand  when the men returned burdened with sacks of shellfish mark hall as high priest commanded the due and solemn rite of the tribe at a wave of his hand the many poised stones came down in unison on the white meat and all voices were uplifted in the hymn to the abalone old verses all sang occasionally some one sang a fresh verse alone whereupon it was repeated in chorus billy betrayed saxon by begging her in an undertone to sing the verse she had made and her pretty voice was timidly raised in  we sit around and gaily pound and bear no acrimony because our object is a gob of sizzling abalone  great cried the poet who had winced at object she speaks the language of the tribe come on childrennow  and all chanted saxons lines then jim hazard had a new verse and one of the girls and the iron man with the basilisk eyes of greenishgray whom saxon recognized from halls description to her it seemed he had the face of a priest  oh some like ham and some like lamb and some like macaroni but bring me in a pail of gin and a tub of abalone  oh some drink rain and some champagne or brandy by the pony but i will try a little rye with a dash of abalone  some live on hope and some on dope and some on alimony but our tomcat he lives on fat and tender abalone  a blackhaired blackeyed man with the roguish face of a satyr who saxon learned was an artist who sold his paintings at five hundred apiece brought on himself universal execration and acclamation by singing  the more we take the more they make in deep sea matrimony race suicide cannot betide the fertile abalone  and so it went verses new and old verses without end all in glorification of the succulent shellfish of carmel saxons enjoyment was keen almost ecstatic and she had difficulty in convincing herself of the reality of it all it seemed like some fairy tale or book story come true again it seemed more like a stage and these the actors she and billy having blundered into the scene in some incomprehensible way much of wit she sensed which she did not understand much she did understand and she was aware that brains were playing as she had never seen brains play before the puritan streak in her training was astonished and shocked by some of the broadness but she refused to sit in judgment they seemed good these lighthearted young people they certainly were not rough or gross as were many of the crowds she had been with on sunday picnics none of the men got drunk although there were cocktails in vacuum bottles and red wine in a huge demijohn  what impressed saxon most was their excessive jollity their childlike joy and the childlike things they did this effect was heightened by the fact that they were novelists and painters poets and critics sculptors and musicians one man with a refined and delicate facea dramatic critic on a great san francisco daily she was toldintroduced a feat which all the men tried and failed at most ludicrously on the beach at regular intervals planks were placed as obstacles then the dramatic critic on all fours galloped along the sand for all the world like a horse and for all the world like a horse taking hurdles he jumped the planks to the end of the course  quoits had been brought along and for a while these were pitched with zest then jumping was started and game slid into game billy took part in everything but did not win first place as often as he had expected an english writer beat him a dozen feet at tossing the caber jim hazard beat him in putting the heavy rock mark hall outjumped him standing and running but at the standing high backjump billy did come first despite the handicap of his weight this victory was due to his splendid back and abdominal lifting muscles immediately after this however he was brought to grief by mark halls sister a strapping young amazon in crosssaddle riding costume who three times tumbled him ignominiously heels over head in a bout of indian wrestling  youre easy jeered the iron man whose name they had learned was pete bideaux i can put you down myself catchascatchcan  billy accepted the challenge and found in all truth that the other was rightly nicknamed in the training camps billy had sparred and clinched with giant champions like jim jeffries and jack johnson and met the weight of their strength but never had he encountered strength like this of the iron man do what he could billy was powerless and twice his shoulders were ground into the sand in defeat  youll get a chance back at him hazard whispered to billy off at one side ive brought the gloves along of course you had no chance with him at his own game hes wrestled in the music halls in london with hackenschmidt now you keep quiet and well lead up to it in a casual sort of way he doesnt know about you  soon the englishman who had tossed the caber was sparring with the dramatic critic hazard and hall boxed in fantastic burlesque then gloves in hand looked for the next appropriately matched couple the choice of bideaux and billy was obvious  hes liable to get nasty if hes hurt hazard warned billy as he tied on the gloves for him hes old american french and hes got a devil of a temper but just keep your head and tap himwhatever you do keep tapping him  easy sparring now no roughhouse bideaux just light tapping you know were admonitions variously addressed to the iron man  hold on a second he said to billy dropping his hands when i get rapped i do get a bit hot but dont mind me i cant help it you know its only for the moment and i dont mean it  saxon felt very nervous visions of billys bloody fights and all the scabs he had slugged rising in her brain but she had never seen her husband box and but few seconds were required to put her at ease the iron man had no chance billy was too completely the master guarding every blow himself continually and almost at will tapping the others face and body there was no weight in billys blows only a light and snappy tingle but their incessant iteration told on the iron mans temper in vain the onlookers warned him to go easy his face purpled with anger and his blows became savage but billy went on tap tap tap calmly gently imperturbably the iron man lost control and rushed and plunged delivering great swings and uppercuts of mankilling quality billy ducked sidestepped blocked stalled and escaped all damage in the clinches which were unavoidable he locked the iron mans arms and in the clinches the iron man invariably laughed and apologized only to lose his head with the first tap the instant they separated and be more infuriated than ever  and when it was over and billys identity had been divulged the iron man accepted the joke on himself with the best of humor it had been a splendid exhibition on billys part his mastery of the sport coupled with his selfcontrol had most favorably impressed the crowd and saxon very proud of her man boy could not but see the admiration all had for him  nor did she prove in any way a social failure when the tired and sweating players lay down in the dry sand to cool off she was persuaded into accompanying their nonsense songs with the ukulele nor was it long catching their spirit ere she was singing to them and teaching them quaint songs of early days which she had herself learned as a little girl from cadycady the saloonkeeper pioneer and axcavalryman who had been a bullwhacker on the salt intake trail in the days before the railroad  one song which became an immediate favorite was  oh times on bitter creek they never can be beat root hog or die is on every wagon sheet the sand within your throat the dust within your eye bend your back and stand itroot hog or die  after the dozen verses of root hog or die mark hall claimed to be especially infatuated with  obadier he dreampt a dream dreampt he was drivin a tenmule team but when he woke he heaved a sigh the leadmule kicked eowt the swingmules eye  it was mark hall who brought up the matter of billys challenge to race out the south wall of the cove though he referred to the test as lying somewhere in the future billy surprised him by saying he was ready at any time forthwith the crowd clamored for the race hall offered to bet on himself but there were no takers he offered two to one to jim hazard who shook his head and said he would accept three to one as a sporting proposition billy heard and gritted his teeth  ill take you for five dollars he said to hall but not at those odds ill back myself even  it isnt your money i want its hazards hall demurred though ill give either of you three to one  even or nothing billy held out obstinately  hall finally closed both betseven with billy and three to one with hazard  the path along the knifeedge was so narrow that it was impossible for runners to pass each other so it was arranged to time the men hall to go first and billy to follow after an interval of half a minute  hall toed the mark and at the word was off with the form of a sprinter saxons heart sank she knew billy had never crossed the stretch of sand at that speed billy darted forward thirty seconds later and reached the foot of the rock when hall was half way up when both were on top and racing from notch to notch the iron man announced that they had scaled the wall in the same time to a second  my money still looks good hazard remarked though i hope neither of them breaks a neck i wouldnt take that run that way for all the gold that would fill the cove  but youll take bigger chances swimming in a storm on carmel beach his wife chided  oh i dont know he retorted you havent so far to fall when swimming  billy and hall had disappeared and were making the circle around the end those on the beach were certain that the poet had gained in the dizzy spurts of flight along the knifeedge even hazard admitted it  what price for my money now he cried excitedly dancing up and down  hall had reappeared the great jump accomplished and was running shoreward but there was no gap billy was on his heels and on his heels he stayed in to shore down the wall and to the mark on the beach billy had won by half a minute  only by the watch he panted hall was over half a minute ahead of me out to the end im not slower than i thought but hes faster hes a wooz of a sprinter he could beat me ten times outa ten except for accident he was hung up at the jump by a big sea thats where i caught m i jumped right after m on the same sea then he set the pace home and all i had to do was take it  thats all right said hall you did better than beat me thats the first time in the history of bierces cove that two men made that jump on the same sea and all the risk was yours coming last  it was a fluke billy insisted  and at that point saxon settled the dispute of modesty and raised a general laugh by rippling chords on the ukulele and parodying an old hymn in negro minstrel fashion  de lawd move in er mischievous way his blunders to perform  in the afternoon jim hazard and hall dived into the breakers and swam to the outlying rocks routing the protesting sealions and taking possession of their surfbattered stronghold billy followed the swimmers with his eyes yearning after them so undisguisedly that mrs hazard said to him  why dont you stop in carmel this winter jim will teach you all he knows about the surf and hes wild to box with you he works long hours at his desk and he really needs exercise   not until sunset did the merry crowd carry their pots and pans and trove of mussels up to the road and depart saxon and billy watched them disappear on horses and behind horses over the top of the first hill and then descended hand in hand through the thicket to the camp billy threw himself on the sand and stretched out  i dont know when ive been so tired he yawned an theres one thing sure i never had such a day its worth livin twenty years for an then some  he reached out his hand to saxon who lay beside him  and oh i was so proud of you billy she said i never saw you box before i didnt know it was like that the iron man was at your mercy all the time and you kept it from being violent or terrible everybody could look on and enjoyand they did too  huh i want to say you was goin some yourself they just took to you why honest to god saxon in the singin you was the whole show along with the ukulele all the women liked you too an thats what counts  it was their first social triumph and the taste of it was sweet  mr hall said hed looked up the story of the files saxon recounted and he said mother was a true poet he said it was astonishing the fine stock that had crossed the plains he told me a lot about those times and the people i didnt know and hes read all about the fight at little meadow he says hes got it in a book at home and if we come back to carmel hell show it to me  he wants us to come back all right dye know what he said to me saxon t he gave me a letter to some guy thats down on the government landsome poet thats holdin down a quarter of a sectionso well be able to stop there whichll come in handy if the big rains catch us anoh thats what i was drivin at he said he had a little shack he lived in while the house was buildin the iron mans livin in it now but hes goin away to some catholic college to study to be a priest an hall said the shackd be ours as long as we wanted to use it an he said i could do what the iron man was doin to make a livin hall was kind of bashful when he was offerin me work said itd be only odd jobs but that wed make out i could helpm plant potatoes he said an he got half savage when he said i couldnt chop wood that was his job he said an you could see he was actually jealous over it  and mrs hall said just about the same to me billy carmel wouldnt be so bad to pass the rainy season in and then too you could go swimming with mr hazard  seems as if we could settle down wherever weve a mind to billy assented carmels the third place now thats offered well after this no man need be afraid of makin a go in the country  no good man saxon corrected  i guess youre right billy thought for a moment just the same a dub too has a better chance in the country than in the city  whod have ever thought that such fine people existed saxon pondered its just wonderful when you come to think of it  its only what youd expect from a rich poet thatd trip up a footracer at an irish picnic billy exposited  the only crowd such a guyd run with would be like himself or hed make a crowd that was i wouldnt wonder that hed make this crowd say hes got some sister if anybodyd ride up on a sealion an ask you shes got that indian wrestlin down pat an shes built for it an say aint his wife a beaut  a little longer they lay in the warm sand it was billy who broke the silence and what he said seemed to proceed out of profound meditation  say saxon dye know i dont care if i never see movie pictures again    chapter ix  saxon and billy were gone weeks on the trip south but in the end they came back to carmel they had stopped with hafler the poets in the marble house which he had built with his own hands this queer dwelling was all in one room built almost entirely of white marble hailer cooked as over a campfire in the huge marble fireplace which he used in all ways as a kitchen there were divers shelves of books and the massive furniture he had made from redwood as he had made the shakes for the roof a blanket stretched across a corner gave saxon privacy the poet was on the verge of departing for san francisco and new york but remained a day over with them to explain the country and run over the government land with billy saxon had wanted to go along that morning but hafler scornfully rejected her telling her that her legs were too short that night when the men returned billy was played out to exhaustion he frankly acknowledged that hafler had walked him into the ground and that his tongue had been hanging out from the first hour hafler estimated that they had covered fiftyfive miles  but such miles billy enlarged half the time up or down an most all the time without trails an such a pace he was dead right about your short legs saxon you wouldnt alasted the first mile an such country we aint seen anything like it yet  hafler left the next day to catch the train at monterey he gave them the freedom of the marble house and told them to stay the whole winter if they wanted billy elected to loaf around and rest up that day he was stiff and sore moreover he was stunned by the exhibition of walking prowess on the part of the poet  everybody can do something topnotch down in this country he marveled now take that hafler hes a bigger man than me an a heavier an weights against walkin too but not with him hes done eighty miles inside twentyfour hours he told me an once a hundred an seventy in three days why he made a show outa me i felt ashamed as a little kid  remember billy saxon soothed him every man to his own game and down here youre a topnotcher at your own game there isnt one youre not the master of with the gloves  i guess thats right he conceded but just the same it goes against the grain to be walked off my legs by a poetby a poet mind you  they spent days in going over the government land and in the end reluctantly decided against taking it up the redwood canyons and great cliffs of the santa lucia mountains fascinated saxon but she remembered what hafler had told her of the summer fogs which hid the sun sometimes for a week or two at a time and which lingered for months then too there was no access to market it was many miles to where the nearest wagon road began at posts and from there on past point sur to carmel it was a weary and perilous way billy with his teamster judgment admitted that for heavy hauling it was anything but a picnic there was the quarry of perfect marble on haflers quarter section he had said that it would be worth a fortune if near a railroad but as it was hed make them a present of it if they wanted it  billy visioned the grassy slopes pastured with his horses and cattle and found it hard to turn his back but he listened with a willing ear to saxons argument in favor of a farmhome like the one they had seen in the moving pictures in oakland yes he agreed what they wanted was an allaround farm and an allaround farm they would have if they hiked forty years to find it  but it must have redwoods on it saxon hastened to stipulate ive fallen in love with them and we can get along without fog and there must be good wagonroads and a railroad not more than a thousand miles away  heavy winter rains held them prisoners for two weeks in the marble house saxon browsed among haflers books though most of them were depressingly beyond her while billy hunted with haflers guns but he was a poor shot and a worse hunter his only success was with rabbits which he managed to kill on occasions when they stood still with the rifle he got nothing although he fired at half a dozen different deer and once at a huge catcreature with a long tail which he was certain was a mountain lion despite the way he grumbled at himself saxon could see the keen joy he was taking this belated arousal of the hunting instinct seemed to make almost another man of him he was out early and late compassing prodigious climbs and trampsonce reaching as far as the gold mines tom had spoken of and being away two days  talk about pluggin away at a job in the city an goin to movie pictures and sunday picnics for amusement he would burst out i cant see what was eatin me that i ever put up with such truck heres where i oughta ben all the time or some place like it  he was filled with this new mode of life and was continually recalling old hunting tales of his father and telling them to saxon  say i dont get stiffened any more after an allday tramp he exulted im broke in an some day if i meet up with that hafler ill challengem to a tramp thatll break his heart  foolish boy always wanting to play everybodys game and beat them at it saxon laughed delightedly  aw i guess youre right he growled hafler can always outwalk me hes made that way but some day just the same if i ever see m again ill invite m to put on the gloves  though i wont be mean enough to make m as sore as he made me  after they left posts on the way back to carmel the condition of the road proved the wisdom of their rejection of the government land they passed a ranchers wagon overturned a second wagon with a broken axle and the stage a hundred yards down the mountainside where it had fallen passengers horses road and all  i guess they just about quit tryin to use this road in the winter billy said its horsekillin an mankillin an i can just see m freightin that marble out over it i dont think  settling down at carmel was an easy matter the iron man had already departed to his catholic college and the shack turned out to be a threeroomed house comfortably furnished for housekeeping hall put billy to work on the potato patcha matter of three acres which the poet farmed erratically to the huge delight of his crowd he planted at all seasons and it was accepted by the community that what did not rot in the ground was evenly divided between the gophers and trespassing cows a plow was borrowed a team of horses hired and billy took hold also he built a fence around the patch and after that was set to staining the shingled roof of the bungalow hall climbed to the ridgepole to repeat his warning that billy must keep away from his woodpile one morning hall came over and watched billy chopping wood for saxon the poet looked on covetously as long as he could restrain himself  its plain you dont know how to use an axe he sneered here let me show you  he worked away for an hour all the while delivering an exposition on the art of chopping wood  here billy expostulated at last taking hold of the axe ill have to chop a cord of yours now in order to make this up to you  hall surrendered the axe reluctantly  dont let me catch you around my woodpile thats all he threatened my woodpile is my castle and youve got to understand that  from a financial standpoint saxon and billy were putting aside much money they paid no rent their simple living was cheap and billy had all the work he cared to accept the various members of the crowd seemed in a conspiracy to keep him busy it was all odd jobs but he preferred it so for it enabled him to suit his time to jim hazards each day they boxed and took a long swim through the surf when hazard finished his mornings writing he would whoop through the pines to billy who dropped whatever work he was doing after the swim they would take a fresh shower at hazards house rub each other down in training camp style and be ready for the noon meal in the afternoon hazard returned to his desk and billy to his outdoor work although still later they often met for a few miles run over the hills training was a matter of habit to both men hazard when he had finished with seven years of football knowing the dire death that awaits the bigmuscled athlete who ceases training abruptly had been compelled to keep it up not only was it a necessity but he had grown to like it billy also liked it for he took great delight in the silk of his body  often in the early morning gun in hand he was off with mark hall who taught him to shoot and hunt hall had dragged a shotgun around from the days when he wore knee pants and his keen observing eyes and knowledge of the habits of wild life were a revelation to billy this part of the country was too settled for large game but billy kept saxon supplied with squirrels and quail cottontails and jackrabbits snipe and wild ducks and they learned to eat roasted mallard and canvasback in the california style of sixteen minutes in a hot oven as he became expert with shotgun and rifle he began to regret the deer and the mountain lion he had missed down below the sur and to the requirements of the farm he and saxon sought he added plenty of game  but it was not all play in carmel that portion of the community which saxon and billy came to know the crowd was hardworking some worked regularly in the morning or late at night others worked spasmodically like the wild irish playwright who would shut himself up for a week at a time then emerge pale and drawn to play like a madman against the time of his next retirement the pale and youthful father of a family with the face of shelley who wrote vaudeville turns for a living and blank verse tragedies and sonnet cycles for the despair of managers and publishers hid himself in a concrete cell with threefoot walls so piped that by turning a lever the whole structure spouted water upon the impending intruder but in the main they respected each others worktime they drifted into one anothers houses as the spirit prompted but if they found a man at work they went their way this obtained to all except mark hall who did not have to work for a living and he climbed trees to get away from popularity and compose in peace  the crowd was unique in its democracy and solidarity it had little intercourse with the sober and conventional part of carmel this section constituted the aristocracy of art and letters and was sneered at as bourgeois in return it looked askance at the crowd with its rampant bohemianism the taboo extended to billy and saxon billy took up the attitude of the clan and sought no work from the other camp nor was work offered him  hall kept open house the big living room with its huge fireplace divans shelves and tables of books and magazines was the center of things here billy and saxon were expected to be and in truth found themselves to be as much at home as anybody here when wordy discussions on all subjects under the sun were not being waged billy played at cutthroat pedro horrible fives bridge and pinochle saxon a favorite of the young women sewed with them teaching them pretties and being taught in fair measure in return  it was billy before they had been in carmel a week who said shyly to saxon  say you cant guess how im missin all your nice things whats the matter with writin tom to express m down when we start trampin again well express m back  saxon wrote the letter and all that day her heart was singing her man was still her lover and there were in his eyes all the old lights which had been blotted out during the nightmare period of the strike  some pretty nifty skirts around here but youve got em all beat or im no judge he told her and again oh i love you to death anyway but if them things aint shipped down therell be a funeral  hall and his wife owned a pair of saddle horses which were kept at the livery stable and here billy naturally gravitated the stable operated the stage and carried the mails between carmel and monterey also it rented out carriages and mountain wagons that seated nine persons with carriages and wagons a driver was furnished the stable often found itself short a driver and billy was quickly called upon he became an extra man at the stable he received three dollars a day at such times and drove many parties around the seventeen mile drive up carmel valley and down the coast to the various points and beaches  but theyre a pretty uppish sort most of em he said to saxon referring to the persons he drove always mister roberts this an mister roberts thatall kinds of ceremony so as to make me not forget they consider themselves better n me you see i aint exactly a servant an yet i aint good enough for them im the driversomething half way between a hired man and a chauffeur huh when they eat they give me my lunch off to one side or afterward no family party like with hall an his kind an that crowd today why they just naturally didnt have no lunch for me at all after this always you make me up my own lunch i wont be be holdin to em for nothin the damned geezers an youd adied to seen one of em try to give me a tip i didnt say nothin i just looked at m like i didnt see m an turned away casuallike after a moment leavin him as embarrassed as hell  nevertheless billy enjoyed the driving never more so than when he held the reins not of four plodding workhorses but of four fast driving animals his foot on the powerful brake and swung around curves and along dizzy cliffrims to a frightened chorus of women passengers and when it came to horse judgment and treatment of sick and injured horses even the owner of the stable yielded place to billy  i could get a regular job there any time he boasted quietly to saxon why the countrys just sproutin with jobs for any soso sort of a fellow i bet anything right now if i said to the boss that id take sixty dollars an work regular hed jump for me hes hinted as muchand say are you onta the fact that yours truly has learnt a new trade well he has he could take a job stagedrivin anywheres they drive six on some of the stages up in lake county if we ever get there ill get thick with some driver just to get the reins of six in my hands an ill have you on the box beside me some goin that some goin  billy took little interest in the many discussions waged in halls big living room windchewin was his term for it to him it was so much good time wasted that might be employed at a game of pedro or going swimming or wrestling in the sand saxon on the contrary delighted in the logomachy though little enough she understood of it following mainly by feeling and once in a while catching a high light  but what she could never comprehend was the pessimism that so often cropped up the wild irish playwright had terrible spells of depression shelley who wrote vaudeville turns in the concrete cell was a chronic pessimist st john a young magazine writer was an anarchic disciple of nietzsche masson a painter held to a doctrine of eternal recurrence that was petrifying and hall usually so merry could outfoot them all when he once got started on the cosmic pathos of religion and the gibbering anthropomorphisms of those who loved not to die at such times saxon was oppressed by these sad children of art it was inconceivable that they of all people should be so forlorn  one night hall turned suddenly upon billy who had been following dimly and who only comprehended that to them everything in life was rotten and wrong  here you pagan you you stolid and fleshfettered ox you monstrosity of overweening and perennial health and joy what do you think of it hall demanded  oh ive had my troubles billy answered speaking in his wonted slow way ive had my hard times an fought a losin strike an soaked my watch an ben unable to pay my rent or buy grub an slugged scabs an ben slugged and ben thrown into jail for makin a fool of myself if i get you id be a whole lot better to be a swell hog fattenin for market an nothin worryin than to be a guy sick to his stomach from not savvyin how the world is made or from wonderin whats the good of anything  thats good that prize hog the poet laughed least irritation least efforta compromise of nirvana and life least irritation least effort the ideal existence a jellyfish floating in a tideless tepid twilight sea  but youre missin all the good things billy objected  name them came the challenge  billy was silent a moment to him life seemed a large and generous thing he felt as if his arms ached from inability to compass it all and he began haltingly at first to put his feeling into speech  if youd ever stood up in the ring an outgamed an outfought a man as good as yourself for twenty rounds youd get what im drivin at jim hazard an i get it when we swim out through the surf an laugh in the teeth of the biggest breakers that ever pounded the beach an when we come out from the shower rubbed down and dressed our skin an muscles like silk our bodies an brains all atinglin like silk   he paused and gave up from sheer inability to express ideas that were nebulous at best and that in reality were remembered sensations  silk of the body can you beat it he concluded lamely feeling that he had failed to make his point embarrassed by the circle of listeners  we know all that hall retorted the lies of the flesh afterward come rheumatism and diabetes the wine of life is heady but all too quickly it turns to  uric acid interpolated the wild irish playwright  theys plenty more of the good things billy took up with a sudden rush of words good things all the way up from juicy porterhouse and the kind of coffee mrs hall makes to he hesitated at what he was about to say then took it at a plunge to a woman you can love an that loves you just take a look at saxon there with the ukulele in her lap theres where i got the jellyfish in the dishwater an the prize hog skinned to death  a shout of applause and great handclapping went up from the girls and billy looked painfully uncomfortable  but suppose the silk goes out of your body till you creak like a rusty wheelbarrow hall pursued suppose just suppose saxon went away with another man what then  billy considered a space  then itd be me for the dishwater an the jellyfish i guess he straightened up in his chair and threw back his shoulders unconsciously as he ran a hand over his biceps and swelled it then he took another look at saxon but thank the lord i still got a wallop in both my arms an a wife to fill em with love  again the girls applauded and mrs hall cried  look at saxon she blushing what have you to say for yourself  that no woman could be happier she stammered and no queen as proud and that  she completed the thought by strumming on the ukulele and singing  de lawd move in or mischievous way his blunders to perform  i give you best hall grinned to billy  oh i dont know billy disclaimed modestly youve read so much i guess you know more about everything than i do  oh oh traitor taking it all back the girls cried variously  billy took heart of courage reassured them with a slow smile and said  just the same id sooner be myself than have book indigestion an as for saxon why one kiss of her lips is worth moren all the libraries in the world    chapter x  there be hills and valleys and rich land and streams of clear water good wagon roads and a railroad not too far away plenty of sunshine and cold enough at night to need blankets and not only pines but plenty of other kinds of trees with open spaces to pasture billys horses and cattle and deer and rabbits for him to shoot and lots and lots of redwood trees and and well and no fog saxon concluded the description of the farm she and billy sought  mark hall laughed delightedly  and nightingales roosting in all the trees he cried flowers that neither fail nor fade bees without stings honey dew every morning showers of manna betweenwhiles fountains of youth and quarries of philosophers stoneswhy i know the very place let me show you  she waited while he pored over roadmaps of the state failing in them he got out a big atlas and though all the countries of the world were in it he could not find what he was after  never mind he said come over tonight and ill be able to show you  that evening he led her out on the veranda to the telescope and she found herself looking through it at the full moon  somewhere up there in some valley youll find that farm he teased  mrs hall looked inquiringly at them as they returned inside  ive been showing her a valley in the moon where she expects to go farming he laughed  we started out prepared to go any distance saxon said and if its to the moon i expect we can make it  but my dear child you cant expect to find such a paradise on the earth hall continued for instance you cant have redwoods without fog they go together the redwoods grow only in the fog belt  saxon debated a while  well we could put up with a little fog she conceded almost anything to have redwoods i dont know what a quarry of philosophers stones is like but if its anything like mr haflers marble quarry and theres a railroad handy i guess we could manage to worry along and you dont have to go to the moon for honey dew they scrape it off of the leaves of the bushes up in nevada county i know that for a fact because my father told my mother about it and she told me  a little later in the evening the subject of farming having remained uppermost hall swept off into a diatribe against the gamblers paradise which was his epithet for the united states  when you think of the glorious chance he said a new country bounded by the oceans situated just right in latitude with the richest land and vastest natural resources of any country in the world settled by immigrants who had thrown off all the leading strings of the old world and were in the humor for democracy there was only one thing to stop them from perfecting the democracy they started and that thing was greediness  they started gobbling everything in sight like a lot of swine and while they gobbled democracy went to smash gobbling became gambling it was a nation of tin horns whenever a man lost his stake all he had to do was to chase the frontier west a few miles and get another stake they moved over the face of the land like so many locusts they destroyed everythingthe indians the soil the forests just as they destroyed the buffalo and the passenger pigeon their morality in business and politics was gambler morality their laws were gambling lawshow to play the game everybody played therefore hurrah for the game nobody objected because nobody was unable to play as i said the losers chased the frontier for fresh stakes the winner of today broke tomorrow on the day following might be riding his luck to royal flushes on fivecard draws  so they gobbled and gambled from the atlantic to the pacific until theyd swined a whole continent when theyd finished with the lands and forests and mines they turned back gambling for any little stakes theyd overlooked gambling for franchises and monopolies using politics to protect their crooked deals and brace games and democracy gone clean to smash  and then was the funniest time of all the losers couldnt get any more stakes while the winners went on gambling among themselves the losers could only stand around with their hands in their pockets and look on when they got hungry they went hat in hand and begged the successful gamblers for a job the losers went to work for the winners and theyve been working for them ever since and democracy sidetracked up salt creek you billy roberts have never had a hand in the game in your life thats because your people were among the alsorans  how about yourself billy asked i aint seen you holdin any hands  i dont have to i dont count i am a parasite  whats that  a flea a woodtick anything that gets something for nothing i batten on the mangy hides of the workingmen i dont have to gamble i dont have to work my father left me enough of his winningsoh dont preen yourself my boy your folks were just as bad as mine but yours lost and mine won and so you plow in my potato patch  i dont see it billy contended stoutly a man with gumption can win out today  on government land hall asked quickly  billy swallowed and acknowledged the stab  just the same he can win out he reiterated  surelyhe can win a job from some other fellow a young husky with a good head like yours can win jobs anywhere but think of the handicaps on the fellows who lose how many tramps have you met along the road who could get a job driving four horses for the carmel livery stabler and some of them were as husky as you when they were young and on top of it all youve got no shout coming its a mighty big comedown from gambling for a continent to gambling for a job  just the same billy recommenced  oh youve got it in your blood hall cut him off cavalierly and why not everybody in this country has been gambling for generations it was in the air when you were born youve breathed it all your life you who ve never had a white chip in the game still go on shouting for it and capping for it  but what are all of us losers to do saxon inquired  call in the police and stop the game hall recommended its crooked  saxon frowned  do what your forefathers didnt do he amplified go ahead and perfect democracy  she remembered a remark of mercedes a friend of mine says that democracy is an enchantment  it isin a gambling joint there are a million boys in our public schools right now swallowing the gump of canal boy to president and millions of worthy citizens who sleep sound every night in the belief that they have a say in running the country  you talk like my brother tom saxon said failing to comprehend if we all get into politics and work hard for something better maybe well get it after a thousand years or so but i want it now she clenched her hands passionately i cant wait i want it now  but that is just what ive been telling you my dear girl thats whats the trouble with all the losers they cant wait they want it nowa stack of chips and a fling at the game well they wont get it now thats whats the matter with you chasing a valley in the moon thats whats the matter with billy aching right now for a chance to win ten cents from me at pedro cussing windchewing under his breath  gee youd make a good soapboxer commented billy  and id be a soapboxer if i didnt have the spending of my fathers illgotten gains its none of my affair islet them rot theyd be just as bad if they were on top its all a messblind bats hungry swine and filthy buzzards  here mrs hall interferred  now mark you stop that or youll be getting the blues  he tossed his mop of hair and laughed with an effort  no i wont he denied im going to get ten cents from billy at a game of pedro he wont have a look in  saxon and billy flourished in the genial human atmosphere of carmel they appreciated in their own estimation saxon felt that she was something more than a laundry girl and the wife of a union teamster she was no longer pent in the narrow working class environment of a pine street neighborhood life had grown opulent they fared better physically materially and spiritually and all this was reflected in their features in the carriage of their bodies she knew billy had never been handsomer nor in more splendid bodily condition he swore he had a harem and that she was his second wifetwice as beautiful as the first one he had married and she demurely confessed to him that mrs hall and several others of the matrons had enthusiastically admired her form one day when in for a cold dip in carmel river they had got around her and called her venus and made her crouch and assume different poses  billy understood the venus reference for a marble one with broken arms stood in halls living room and the poet had told him the world worshiped it as the perfection of female form  i always said you had annette kellerman beat a mile billy said and so proud was his air of possession that saxon blushed and trembled and hid her hot face against his breast  the men in the crowd were open in their admiration of saxon in an aboveboard manner but she made no mistake she did not lose her head there was no chance of that for her love for billy beat more strongly than ever nor was she guilty of overappraisal she knew him for what he was and loved him with open eyes he had no book learning no art like the other men his grammar was bad she knew that just as she knew that he would never mend it yet she would not have exchanged him for any of the others not even for mark hall with the princely heart whom she loved much in the same way that she loved his wife  for that matter she found in billy a certain health and rightness a certain essential integrity which she prized more highly than all book learning and bank accounts it was by virtue of this health and rightness and integrity that he had beaten hall in argument the night the poet was on the pessimistic rampage billy had beaten him not with the weapons of learning but just by being himself and by speaking out the truth that was in him best of all he had not even known that he had beaten and had taken the applause as goodnatured banter but saxon knew though she could scarcely tell why and she would always remember how the wife of shelley had whispered to her afterward with shining eyes oh saxon you must be so happy  were saxon driven to speech to attempt to express what billy meant to her she would have done it with the simple word man always he was that to her always in glowing splendor that was his connotationman sometimes by herself she would all but weep with joy at recollection of his way of informing some truculent male that he was standing on his foot get off your foot youre standin on it it was billy it was magnificently billy and it was this billy who loved her she knew it she knew it by the pulse that only a woman knows how to gauge he loved her less wildly it was true but more fondly more maturely it was the love that lastedif only they did not go back to the city where the beautiful things of the spirit perished and the beast bared its fangs  in the early spring mark hall and his wife went to new york the two japanese servants of the bungalow were dismissed and saxon and billy were installed as caretakers jim hazard too departed on his yearly visit to paris and though billy missed him he continued his long swims out through the breakers halls two saddle horses had been left in his charge and saxon made herself a pretty crosssaddle riding costume of tawnybrown corduroy that matched the glints in her hair billy no longer worked at odd jobs as extra driver at the stable he earned more than they spent and in preference to cash he taught saxon to ride and was out and away with her over the country on allday trips a favorite ride was around by the coast to monterey where he taught her to swim in the big del monte tank they would come home in the evening across the hills also she took to following him on his early morning hunts and life seemed one long vacation  ill tell you one thing he said to saxon one day as they drew their horses to a halt and gazed down into carmel valley i aint never going to work steady for another man for wages as long as i live  work isnt everything she acknowledged  i should guess not why look here saxon whatd it mean if i worked teamin in oakland for a million dollars a day for a million years and just had to go on stayin there an livin the way we used to itd mean work all day three squares an movie pictures for recreation movin pictures huh were livin movie pictures these days id sooner have one year like what were havin here in carmel and then die than a thousan million years like on pine street  saxon had warned the halls by letter that she and billy intended starting on their search for the valley in the moon as soon as the first of summer arrived fortunately the poet was put to no inconvenience for bideaux the iron man with the basilisk eyes had abandoned his dreams of priesthood and decided to become an actor he arrived at carmel from the catholic college in time to take charge of the bungalow  much to saxons gratification the crowd was loth to see them depart the owner of the carmel stable offered to put billy in charge at ninety dollars a month also he received a similar offer from the stable in pacific grove  whither away the wild irish playwright hailed them on the station platform at monterey he was just returning from new york  to a valley in the moon saxon answered gaily  he regarded their businesslike packs  by george he cried ill do it by george let me come along then his face fell and ive signed the contract he groaned three acts say youre lucky and this time of year too    chapter xi  we hiked into monterey last winter but were ridin out now b gosh billy said as the train pulled out and they leaned back in their seats  they had decided against retracing their steps over the ground already traveled and took the train to san francisco they had been warned by mark hall of the enervation of the south and were bound north for their blanket climate their intention was to cross the bay to sausalito and wander up through the coast counties here hall had told them they would find the true home of the redwood but billy in the smoking car for a cigarette seated himself beside a man who was destined to deflect them from their course he was a keenfaced darkeyed man undoubtedly a jew and billy remembering saxons admonition always to ask questions watched his opportunity and started a conversation it took but a little while to learn that gunston was a commission merchant and to realize that the content of his talk was too valuable for saxon to lose promptly when he saw that the others cigar was finished billy invited him into the next car to meet saxon billy would have been incapable of such an act prior to his sojourn in carmel that much at least he had acquired of social facility  hes just teen tellin me about the potato kings and i wanted him to tell you billy explained to saxon after the introduction go on and tell her mr gunston about that fan tan sucker that made nineteen thousan last year in celery an asparagus  i was just telling your husband about the way the chinese make things go up the san joaquin river it would be worth your while to go up there and look around its the good season nowtoo early for mosquitoes you can get off the train at black diamond or antioch and travel around among the big farming islands on the steamers and launches the fares are cheap and youll find some of those big gasoline boats like the duchess and princess more like big steamboats  tell her about chow lam billy urged  the commission merchant leaned back and laughed  chow lam several years ago was a brokendown fan tan player he hadnt a cent and his health was going back on him he had worn out his back with twenty years work in the gold mines washing over the tailings of the early miners and whatever hed made hed lost at gambling also he was in debt three hundred dollars to the six companiesyou know theyre chinese affairs and remember this was only seven years agohealth breaking down three hundred in debt and no trade chow lam blew into stockton and got a job on the peat lands at days wages it was a chinese company down on middle river that farmed celery and asparagus this was when he got onto himself and took stock of himself a quarter of a century in the united states back not so strong as it used to was and not a penny laid by for his return to china he saw how the chinese in the company had done itsaved their wages and bought a share  he saved his wages for two years and bought one share in a thirtyshare company that was only five years ago they leased three hundred acres of peat land from a white man who preferred traveling in europe out of the profits of that one share in the first year he bought two shares in another company and in a year more out of the three shares he organized a company of his own one year of this with bad luck and he just broke even that brings it up to three years ago the following year bumper crops he netted four thousand the next year it wan five thousand and last year he cleaned up nineteen thousand dollars pretty good eh for old brokendown chow lam  my was all saxon could say  her eager interest however incited the commission merchant to go on  look at sing keethe potato king of stockton i know him well ive had more large deals with him and made less money than with any man i know he was only a coolie and he smuggled himself into the united states twenty years ago started at days wages then peddled vegetables in a couple of baskets slung on a stick and after that opened up a store in chinatown in san francisco but he had a head on him and he was soon onto the curves of the chinese farmers that dealt at his store the store couldnt make money fast enough to suit him he headed up the san joaquin didnt do much for a couple of years except keep his eyes peeled then he jumped in and leased twelve hundred acres at seven dollars an acre  my god billy said in an awestruck voice eight thousan four hundred dollars just for rent the first year i know five hundred acres i can buy for three dollars an acre  will it grow potatoes gunston asked  billy shook his head nor nothin else i guess  all three laughed heartily and the commission merchant resumed  that seven dollars was only for the land possibly you know what it costs to plow twelve hundred acres  billy nodded solemnly  and he got a hundred and sixty sacks to the acre that year gunston continued potatoes were selling at fifty cents my father was at the head of our concern at the time so i know for a fact and sing kee could have sold at fifty cents and made money but did he trust a chinaman to know the market they can skin the commission merchants at it sing kee held on when most everybody else had sold potatoes began to climb he laughed at our buyers when we offered him sixty cents seventy cents a dollar do you want to know what he finally did sell for one dollar and sixtyfive a sack suppose they actually cost him forty cents a hundred and sixty times twelve hundred let me see twelve times nought is nought and twelve times sixteen is a hundred and ninetytwo a hundred and ninetytwo thousand sacks at a dollar and a quarter net four into a hundred and ninetytwo is fortyeight plus is two hundred and fortythere you are two hundred and forty thousand dollars clear profit on that years deal  an him a chink billy mourned disconsolately he turned to saxon they ought to be some new country for us white folks to go to goshwere settin on the stoop all right all right  but of course that was unusual glunston hastened to qualify there was a failure of potatoes in other districts and a corner and in some strange way sing kee was dead on he never made profits like that again but he goes ahead steadily last year he had four thousand acres in potatoes a thousand in asparagus five hundred in celery and five hundred in beans and hes running six hundred acres in seeds no matter what happens to one or two crops he cant lose on all of them  ive seen twelve thousand acres of apple trees saxon said and id like to see four thousand acres in potatoes  and we will billy rejoined with great positiveness its us for the san joaquin we dont know whats in our country no wonder were out on the stoop  youll find lots of kings up there gunston related yep hong leethey call him big jim and ah pock and ah whang andthen theres shima the japanese potato king hes worth several millions lives like a prince  why dont americans succeed like that asked saxon  because they wont i guess theres nothing to stop them except themselves ill tell you one thing thoughgive me the chinese to deal with hes honest his word is as good as his bond if he says hell do a thing hell do it and anyway the white man doesnt know how to farm even the uptodate white farmer is content with one crop at a time and rotation of crops mr john chinaman goes him one better and grows two crops at one time on the same soil ive seen itradishes and carrots two crops sown at one time  which dont stand to reason billy objected theyd be only a half crop of each  another guess coming gunston jeered carrots have to be thinned when theyre so far along so do radishes but carrots grow slow radishes grow fast the slowgoing carrots serve the purpose of thinning the radishes and when the radishes are pulled ready for market that thins the carrots which come along later you cant beat the chink  dont see why a white man cant do what a chink can protested billy  that sounds all right gunston replied the only objection is that the white man doesnt the chink is busy all the time and he keeps the ground just as busy he has organization system who ever heard of white farmers keeping books the chink does no guess work with him he knows just where he stands to a cent on any crop at any moment and he knows the market he plays both ends how he does it is beyond me but he knows the market better than we commission merchants  then again hes patient but not stubborn suppose he does make a mistake and gets in a crop and then finds the market is wrong in such a situation the white man gets stubborn and hangs on like a bulldog but not the chink hes going to minimize the losses of that mistake that land has got to work and make money without a quiver or a regret the moment hes learned his error he puts his plows into that crop turns it under and plants something else he has the savve he can look at a sprout just poked up out of the ground and tell how its going to turn outwhether it will head up or wont head up or if its going to head up good medium or bad thats one end take the other end he controls his crop he forces it or holds it back with an eye on the market and when the market is just right theres his crop ready to deliver timed to the minute  the conversation with gunston lasted hours and the more he talked of the chinese and their farming ways the more saxon became aware of a growing dissatisfaction she did not question the facts the trouble was that they were not alluring somehow she could not find place for them in her valley of the moon it was not until the genial jew left the train that billy gave definite statement to what was vaguely bothering her  huh we aint chinks were white folks does a chink ever want to ride a horse hellbent for election an havin a good time of it did you ever see a chink go swimmin out through the breakers at carmelor boxin wrestlin runnin an jumpin for the sport of it did you ever see a chink take a shotgun on his arm tramp six miles an come back happy with one measly rabbit what does a chink do work his damned head off thats all hes good for to hell with work if thats the whole of the gamean ive done my share of work an i can work alongside of any of em but whats the good if theys one thing ive learned solid since you an me hit the road saxon it is that works the least part of life godif it was all of life i couldnt cut my throat quick enough to get away from it i want shotguns an rifles an a horse between my legs i dont want to be so tired all the time i cant love my wife who wants to be rich an clear two hundred an forty thousand on a potato deal look at rockefeller has to live on milk i want porterhouse and a stomach that

straightened out in my head its been worrying me for ever so long i was afraid there was something wrong with methat i wasnt made for the country after all all the time i didnt envy the san leandro portuguese i didnt want to be one nor a pajaro valley dalmatian nor even a mrs mortimer and you didnt either what we want is a valley of the moon with not too much work and all the fun we want and well just keep on looking until we find it and if we dont find it well go on having the fun just as we have ever since we left oakland and billy were never never going to work our damned heads off are we  not on your life billy growled in fierce affirmation  they walked into black diamond with their packs on their backs it was a scattered village of shabby little cottages with a main street that was a wallow of black mud from the last late spring rain the sidewalks bumped up and down in uneven steps and landings everything seemed unamerican the names on the strange dingy shops were unspeakably foreign the one dingy hotel was run by a greek greeks were everywhereswarthy men in seaboots and tamoshanters hatless women in bright colors hordes of sturdy children and all speaking in outlandish voices crying shrilly and vivaciously with the volubility of the mediterranean  huhthis aint the united states billy muttered down on the water front they found a fish cannery and an asparagus cannery in the height of the busy season where they looked in vain among the toilers for familiar american faces billy picked out the bookkeepers and foremen for americans all the rest were greeks italians and chinese  at the steamboat wharf they watched the brightpainted greek boats arriving discharging their loads of glorious salmon and departing new york cutoff as the slough was called curved to the west and north and flowed into a vast body of water which was the united sacramento and san joaquin rivers  beyond the steamboat wharf the fishing wharves dwindled to stages for the drying of nets and here away from the noise and clatter of the alien town saxon and billy took off their packs and rested the tall rustling tules grew out of the deep water close to the dilapidated boatlanding where they sat opposite the town lay a long flat island on which a row of ragged poplars leaned against the sky  just like in that dutch windmill picture mark hall has saxon said  billy pointed out the mouth of the slough and across the broad reach of water to a cluster of tiny white buildings behind which like a glimmering mirage rolled the low montezuma hills  those houses is collinsville he informed her the sacramento river comes in there and you go up it to rio vista an isleton and walnut grove and all those places mr gunston was tellin us about its all islands and sloughs connectin clear across an back to the san joaquin  isnt the sun good saxon yawned and how quiet it is here so short a distance away from those strange foreigners and to think in the cities right now men are beating and killing each other for jobs  now and again an overland passenger train rushed by in the distance echoing along the background of foothills of mt diablo which bulked twinpeaked greencrinkled against the sky then the slumbrous quiet would fall to be broken by the far call of a foreign tongue or by a gasoline fishing boat chugging in through the mouth of the slough  not a hundred feet away anchored close in the tules lay a beautiful white yacht despite its tininess it looked broad and comfortable smoke was rising forard from its stovepipe on its stern in gold letters they read roamer on top of the cabin basking in the sunshine lay a man and woman the latter with a pink scarf around her head the man was reading aloud from a book while she sewed beside them sprawled a fox terrier  gosh they dont have to stick around cities to be happy billy commented  a japanese came on deck from the cabin sat down forard and began picking a chicken the feathers floated away in a long line toward the mouth of the slough  oh look saxon pointed in her excitement hes fishing and the line is fast to his toe  the man had dropped the book facedownward on the cabin and reached for the line while the woman looked up from her sewing and the terrier began to bark in came the line hand under hand and at the end a big catfish when this was removed and the line rebaited and dropped overboard the man took a turn around his toe and went on reading  a japanese came down on the landingstage beside saxon and billy and hailed the yacht he carried parcels of meat and vegetables one coat pocket bulged with letters the other with morning papers in response to his hail the japanese on the yacht stood up with the partplucked chicken the man said something to him put aside the book got into the white skiff lying astern and rowed to the landing as he came alongside the stage he pulled in his oars caught hold and said good morning genially  why i know you saxon said impulsively to billys amazement you are   here she broke off in confusion  go on the man said smiling reassurance  you are jack hastings i m sure of it i used to see your photograph in the papers all the time you were war correspondent in the japaneserussian war youve written lots of books though ive never read them   right you are he ratified and whats your name  saxon introduced herself and billy and when she noted the writers observant eye on their packs she sketched the pilgrimage they were on the farm in the valley of the moon evidently caught his fancy and though the japanese and his parcels were safely in the skiff hastings still lingered when saxon spoke of carmel he seemed to know everybody in halls crowd and when he heard they were intending to go to rio vista his invitation was immediate  why were going that way ourselves inside an hour as soon as slack water comes he exclaimed its just the thing come on on board well be there by four this afternoon if theres any wind at all come on my wifes on board and mrs hall is one of her best chums weve been away to south americajust got back or youd have seen us in carmel hal wrote to us about the pair of you  it was the second time in her life that saxon had been in a small boat and the roamer was the first yacht she had ever been on board the writers wife whom he called clara welcomed them heartily and saxon lost no time in falling in love with her and in being fallen in love with in return so strikingly did they resemble each other that hastings was not many minutes in calling attention to it he made them stand side by side studied their eyes and mouths and ears compared their hands their hair their ankles and swore that his fondest dream was shatterednamely that when clara had been made the mold was broken  on claras suggestion that it might have been pretty much the same mold they compared histories both were of the pioneer stock claras mother like saxons had crossed the plains with oxteams and like saxons had wintered in salt intake cityin fact had with her sisters opened the first gentile school in that mormon stronghold and if saxons father had helped raise the bear flag rebellion at sonoma it was at sonoma that claras father had mustered in for the war of the rebellion and ridden as far east with his troop as salt lake city of which place he had been provost marshal when the mormon trouble flared up to complete it all clara fetched from the cabin an ukulele of boa wood that was the twin to saxons and together they sang honolulu tomboy  hastings decided to eat dinnerhe called the midday meal by its oldfashioned namebefore sailing and down below saxon was surprised and delighted by the measure of comfort in so tiny a cabin there was just room for billy to stand upright a centerboardcase divided the room in half longitudinally and to this was attached the hinged table from which they ate low bunks that ran the full cabin length upholstered in cheerful green served as seats a curtain easily attached by hooks between the centerboardcase and the roof at night screened mrs hastings sleeping quarters on the opposite side the two japanese bunked while forard under the deck was the galley so small was it that there was just room beside it for the cook who was compelled by the low deck to squat on his hands the other japanese who had brought the parcels on board waited on the table  they are looking for a ranch in the valley of the moon hastings concluded his explanation of the pilgrimage to clara  ohdont you know she cried but was silenced by her husband  hush he said peremptorily then turned to their guests listen theres something in that valley of the moon idea but i wont tell you what it is a secret now weve a ranch in sonoma valley about eight miles from the very town of sonoma where you two girls fathers took up soldiering and if you ever come to our ranch youll learn the secret oh believe me its connected with your valley of the moonisnt it mate  this last was the mutual name he and clara had for each other  she smiled and laughed and nodded her head  you might find our valley the very one you are looking for she said  but hastings shook his head at her to check further speech she turned to the fox terrier and made it speak for a piece of meat  her names peggy she told saxon we had two irish terriers down in the south seas brother and sister but they died we called them peggy and possum so shes named after the original peggy  billy was impressed by the ease with which the roamer was operated while they lingered at table at a word from hastings the two japanese had gone on deck billy could hear them throwing down the halyards casting off gaskets and heaving the anchor short on the tiny winch in several minutes one called down that everything was ready and all went on deck hoisting mainsail and jigger was a matter of minutes then the cook and cabinboy broke out anchor and while one hove it up the other hoisted the jib hastings at the wheel trimmed the sheet the roamer paid off filled her sails slightly heeling and slid across the smooth water and out the mouth of new york slough the japanese coiled the halyards and went below for their own dinner  the flood is just beginning to make said hastings pointing to a striped sparbuoy that was slightly tipping upstream on the edge of the channel  the tiny white houses of collinsville which they were nearing disappeared behind a low island though the montezuma hills with their long low restful lines slumbered on the horizon apparently as far away as ever  as the roamer passed the mouth of montezuma slough and entered the sacramento they came upon collinsville close at hand saxon clapped her hands  its like a lot of toy houses she said cut out of cardboard and those hilly fields are just painted up behind  they passed many arks and houseboats of fishermen moored among the tules and the women and children like the men in the boats were darkskinned blackeyed foreign as they proceeded up the river they began to encounter dredges at work biting out mouthfuls of the sandy river bottom and heaping it on top of the huge levees great mats of willow brush hundreds of yards in length were laid on top of the riverslope of the levees and held in place by steel cables and thousands of cubes of cement the willows soon sprouted hastings told them and by the time the mats were rotted away the sand was held in place by the roots of the trees  it must cost like sam hill billy observed  but the land is worth it hastings explained this island land is the most productive in the world this section of california is like holland you wouldnt think it but this water were sailing on is higher than the surface of the islands theyre like leaky boatscalking patching pumping night and day and all the time but it pays it pays  except for the dredgers the freshpiled sand the dense willow thickets and always mt diablo to the south nothing was to be seen occasionally a river steamboat passed and blue herons flew into the trees  it must be very lonely saxon remarked  hastings laughed and told her she would change her mind later much he related to them of the river lands and after a while he got on the subject of tenant farming saxon had started him by speaking of the landhungry anglosaxons  landhogs he snapped thats our record in this country as one old reuben told a professor of an agricultural experiment station they aint no sense in tryin to teach me farmin i know all about it aint i worked out three farms it was his kind that destroyed new england back there great sections are relapsing to wilderness in one state at least the deer have increased until they are a nuisance there are abandoned farms by the tens of thousands ive gone over the lists of themfarms in new york new jersey massachusetts connecticut offered for sale on easy payment the prices asked wouldnt pay for the improvements while the land of course is thrown in for nothing  and the same thing is going on in one way or another the same landrobbing and hogging over the rest of the countrydown in texas in missouri and kansas out here in california take tenant farming i know a ranch in my county where the land was worth a hundred and twentyfive an acre and it gave its return at that valuation when the old man died the son leased it to a portuguese and went to live in the city in five years the portuguese skimmed the cream and dried up the udder the second lease with another portuguese for three years gave onequarter the former return no third portuguese appeared to offer to lease it there wasnt anything left that ranch was worth fifty thousand when the old man died in the end the son got eleven thousand for it why ive seen land that paid twelve per cent that after the skimming of a fiveyears lease paid only one and a quarter per cent  its the same in our valley mrs hastings supplemented all the old farms are dropping into ruin take the ebell place mate her husband nodded emphatic indorsement when we used to know it it was a perfect paradise of a farm there were dams and lakes beautiful meadows lush hayfields red hills of grapelands hundreds of acres of good pasture heavenly groves of pines and oaks a stone winery stone barns groundsoh i couldnt describe it in hours when mrs bell died the family scattered and the leasing began its a ruin today the trees have been cut and sold for firewood theres only a little bit of the vineyard that isnt abandonedjust enough to make wine for the present italian lessees who are running a povertystricken milk ranch on the leavings of the soil i rode over it last year and cried the beautiful orchard is a horror the grounds have gone back to the wild just because they didnt keep the gutters cleaned out the rain trickled down and dryrotted the timbers and the big stone barn is caved in the same with part of the winerythe other part is used for stabling the cows and the housewords cant describe  its become a profession hastings went on the movers they lease clean out and gut a place in several years and then move on theyre not like the foreigners the chinese and japanese and the rest in the main theyre a lazy vagabond poorwhite sort who do nothing else but skin the soil and move skin the soil and move now take the portuguese and italians in our country they are different they arrive in the country without a penny and work for others of their countrymen until theyve learned the language and their way about now theyre not movers what they are after is land of their own which they will love and care for and conserve but in the meantime how to get it saving wages is slow there is a quicker way they lease in three years they can gut enough out of somebody elses land to set themselves up for life it is sacrilege a veritable rape of the land but what of it its the way of the united states  he turned suddenly on billy  look here roberts you and your wife are looking for your bit of land you want it bad now take my advice its cold hard advice become a tenant farmer lease some place where the old folks have died and the country isnt good enough for the sons and daughters then gut it wring the last dollar out of the soil repair nothing and in three years youll have your own place paid for then turn over a new leaf and love your soil nourish it every dollar you feed it will return you two lend have nothing scrub about the place if its a horse a cow a pig a chicken or a blackberry vine see that its thoroughbred  but its wicked saxon wrung out its wicked advice  we live in a wicked age hastings countered smiling grimly this wholesale landskinning is the national crime of the united states today nor would i give your husband such advice if i werent absolutely certain that the land he skins would be skinned by some portuguese or italian if he refused as fast as they arrive and settle down they send for their sisters and their cousins and their aunts if you were thirsty if a warehouse were burning and beautiful rhine wine were running to waste would you stay your hand from scooping a drink well the national warehouse is afire in many places and no end of the good things are running to waste help yourself if you dont the immigrants will  oh you dont know him mrs hastings hurried to explain he spends all his time on the ranch in conserving the soil there are over a thousand acres of woods alone and though he thins and forests like a surgeon he wont let a tree be chopped without his permission hes even planted a hundred thousand trees hes always draining and ditching to stop erosion and experimenting with pasture grasses and every little while he buys some exhausted adjoining ranch and starts building up the soil  wherefore i know what i m talking about hastings broke in and my advice holds i love the soil yet tomorrow things being as they are and if i were poor id gut five hundred acres in order to buy twentyfive for myself when you get into sonoma valley look me up and ill put you onto the whole game and both ends of it ill show you construction as well as destruction when you find a farm doomed to be gutted anyway why jump in and do it yourself  yes and he mortgaged himself to the eyes laughed mrs hastings to keep five hundred acres of woods out of the hands of the charcoal burners  ahead on the left bank of the sacramento just at the fading end of the montezuma hills rio vista appeared the roamer slipped through the smooth water past steamboat wharves landing stages and warehouses the two japanese went forard on deck at command of hastings the jib ran down and he shot the roomer into the wind losing way until he called let go the hook the anchor went down and the yacht swung to it so close to shore that the skiff lay under overhanging willows  farther up the river we tie to the bank mrs hastings said so that when you wake in the morning you find the branches of trees sticking down into the cabin  ooh saxon murmured pointing to a lump on her wrist look at that a mosquito  pretty early for them hastings said but later on theyre terrible ive seen them so thick i couldnt back the jib against them  saxon was not nautical enough to appreciate his hyperbole though billy grinned  there are no mosquitoes in the valley of the moon she said  no never said mrs hastings whose husband began immediately to regret the smallness of the cabin which prevented him from offering sleeping accommodations  an automobile bumped along on top of the levee and the young boys and girls in it cried oh you kid to saxon and billy and hastings who was rowing them ashore in the skiff hastings called oh you kid back to them and saxon pleasuring in the boyishness of his sunburned face was reminded of the boyishness of mark hall and his carmel crowd    chapter xii  crossing the sacramento on an oldfashioned ferry a short distance above rio vista saxon and billy entered the river country from the top of the levee she got her revelation beneath lower than the river stretched broad flat land far as the eye could see roads ran in every direction and she saw countless farmhouses of which she had never dreamed when sailing on the lonely river a few feet the other side of the willowy fringe  three weeks they spent among the rich farm islands which heaped up levees and pumped day and night to keep afloat it was a monotonous land with an unvarying richness of soil and with only one landmarkmt diablo ever to be seen sleeping in the midday azure limping its crinkled mass against the sunset sky or forming like a dream out of the silver dawn sometimes on foot often by launch they criescrossed and threaded the river region as far as the peat lands of the middle river down the san joaquin to antioch and up georgiana slough to walnut grove on the sacramento and it proved a foreign land the workers of the soil teemed by thousands yet saxon and billy knew what it was to go a whole day without finding any one who spoke english they encounteredsometimes in whole villageschinese japanese italians portuguese swiss hindus koreans norwegians danes french armenians slavs almost every nationality save american one american they found on the lower reaches of georgiana who eked an illicit existence by fishing with traps another american who spouted blood and destruction on all political subjects was an itinerant beefarmer at walnut grove bustling with life the few americans consisted of the storekeeper the saloonkeeper the butcher the keeper of the drawbridge and the ferryman yet two thriving towns were in walnut grove one chinese one japanese most of the land was owned by americans who lived away from it and were continually selling it to the foreigners  a riot or a merrymakingthey could not tell whichwas taking place in the japanese town as saxon and billy steamed out on the apache bound for sacramento  were settin on the stoop billy railed pretty soon theyll crowd us off of that  there wont be any stoop in the valley of the moon saxon cheered him  but he was inconsolable remarking bitterly  an they aint one of them damn foreigners that can handle four horses like me  but they can everlastingly farm he added  and saxon looking at his moody face was suddenly reminded of a lithograph she had seen in her childhood it was of a plains indian in paint and feathers astride his horse and gazing with wondering eye at a railroad train rushing along a freshmade track the indian had passed she remembered before the tide of new life that brought the railroad and were billy and his kind doomed to pass she pondered before this new tide of life amazingly industrious that was flooding in from asia and europe  at sacramento they stopped two weeks where billy drove team and earned the money to put them along on their travels also life in oakland and carmel close to the salt edge of the coast had spoiled them for the interior too warm was their verdict of sacramento and they followed the railroad west through a region of swampland to davisville here they were lured aside and to the north to pretty woodland where billy drove team for a fruit farm and where saxon wrung from him a reluctant consent for her to work a few days in the fruit harvest she made an important and mystifying secret of what she intended doing with her earnings and billy teased her about it until the matter passed from his mind nor did she tell him of a money order inclosed with a certain blue slip of paper in a letter to bud strothers  they began to suffer from the heat billy declared they had strayed out of the blanket climate  there are no redwoods here saxon said we must go west toward the coast it is there well find the valley of the moon  from woodland they swung west and south along the county roads to the fruit paradise of vacaville here billy picked fruit then drove team and here saxon received a letter and a tiny express package from bud strothers when billy came into camp from the days work she bade him stand still and shut his eyes for a few seconds she fumbled and did something to the breast of his cotton workshirt once he felt a slight prick as of a pin point and grunted while she laughed and bullied him to continue keeping his eyes shut  close your eyes and give me a kiss she sang and then ill show you what iss  she kissed him and when he looked down he saw pinned to his shirt the gold medals he had pawned the day they had gone to the moving picture show and received their inspiration to return to the land  you darned kid he exclaimed as he caught her to him so thats what you blew your fruit money in on an i never guessedcome here to you  and thereupon she suffered the pleasant mastery of his brawn and was hugged and wrestled with until the coffee pot boiled over and she darted from him to the rescue  i kinda always been a mite proud of em he confessed as he rolled his aftersupper cigarette they take me back to my kid days when i amateured it to beat the band i was some kid in them days believe muhbut say dye know theyd clean slipped my recollection oaklands a thousan years away from you an me an ten thousan miles  then this will bring you back to it saxon said opening buds letter and reading it aloud  bud had taken it for granted that billy knew the windup of the strike so he devoted himself to the details as to which men had got back their jobs and which had been blacklisted to his own amazement he had been taken back and was now driving billys horses still more amazing was the further information he had to impart the old foreman of the west oakland stables had died and since then two other foremen had done nothing but make messes of everything the point of all which was that the boss had spoken that day to bud regretting the disappearance of billy  dont make no mistake bud wrote the boss is onto all your curves i bet he knows every scab you slugged just the same he says to mestrothers if you aint at liberty to give me his address just write yourself and tell him for me to come a running ill give him a hundred and twentyfive a month to take hold the stables  saxon waited with wellconcealed anxiety when the letter was finished billy stretched out leaning on one elbow blew a meditative ring of smoke his cheap workshirt incongruously brilliant with the gold of the medals that flashed in the firelight was open in front showing the smooth skin and splendid swell of chest he glanced aroundat the blankets bowered in a green screen and waiting at the campfire and the blackened battered coffee pot at the wellworn hatchet half buried in a tree trunk and lastly at saxon his eyes embraced her then into them came a slow expression of inquiry but she offered no help  well he uttered finally all you gotta do is write bud strothers an tell m not on the bosss ugly tintypean while youre about it ill send m the money to get my watch out you work out the interest the overcoat can stay there an rot  but they did not prosper in the interior heat they lost weight the resilience went out of their minds and bodies as billy expressed it their silk was frazzled so they shouldered their packs and headed west across the wild mountains in the berryessa valley the shimmering heat waves made their eyes ache and their heads so that they traveled on in the early morning and late afternoon still west they headed over more mountains to beautiful napa valley the next valley beyond was sonoma where hastings had invited them to his ranch and here they would have gone had not billy chanced upon a newspaper item which told of the writers departure to cover some revolution that was breaking out somewhere in mexico  well see m later on billy said as they turned northwest through the vineyards and orchards of napa valley were like that millionaire bert used to sing about except its time that weve got to burn any direction is as good as any other only west is best  three times in the napa valley billy refused work past st helena saxon hailed with joy the unmistakable redwoods they could see growing up the small canyons that penetrated the western wall of the valley at calistoga at the end of the railroad they saw the sixhorse stages leaving for middletown and lower lake they debated their route that way led to lake county and not toward the coast so saxon and billy swung west through the mountains to the valley of the russian river coming out at healdsburg they lingered in the hopfields on the rich bottoms where billy scorned to pick hops alongside of indians japanese and chinese  i couldnt work alongside of em an hour before id be knockin their blocks off he explained besides this russian rivers some nifty lets pitch camp and go swimmin  so they idled their way north up the broad fertile valley so happy that they forgot that work was ever necessary while the valley of the moon was a golden dream remote but sure some day of realization at cloverdale billy fell into luck a combination of sickness and mischance found the stage stables short a driver each day the train disgorged passengers for the geysers and billy as if accustomed to it all his life took the reins of six horses and drove a full load over the mountains in stage time the second trip he had saxon beside him on the high boxseat by the end of two weeks the regular driver was back billy declined a stablejob took his wages and continued north  saxon had adopted a fox terrier puppy and named him possum after the dog mrs hastings had told them about so young was he that he quickly became footsore and she carried him until billy perched him on top of his pack and grumbled that possum was chewing his back hair to a frazzle  they passed through the painted vineyards of asti at the end of the grapepicking and entered ukiah drenched to the skin by the first winter rain  say billy said you remember the way the roamer just skated along well this summers done the same thinggone by on wheels an now its up to us to find some place to winter this ukiah looks like a pretty good burg well get a room tonight an dry out an tomorrow ill hustle around to the stables an if i locate anything we can rent a shack an have all winter to think about where well go next year    chapter xiii  the winter proved much less exciting than the one spent in carmel and keenly as saxon had appreciated the carmel folk she now appreciated them more keenly than ever in ukiah she formed nothing more than superficial acquaintances here people were more like those of the working class she had known in oakland or else they were merely wealthy and herded together in automobiles there was no democratic artistcolony that pursued fellowship disregardful of the caste of wealth  yet it was a more enjoyable winter than any she had spent in oakland billy had failed to get regular employment so she saw much of him and they lived a prosperous and happy handtomouth existence in the tiny cottage they rented as extra man at the biggest livery stable billys spare time was so great that he drifted into horsetrading it was hazardous and more than once he was broke but the table never wanted for the best of steak and coffee nor did they stint themselves for clothes  them blamed farmersi gotta pass it to em billy grinned one day when he had been particularly bested in a horse deal they wont tear under the wings the sons of guns in the summer they take in boarders an in the winter they make a good livin coin each other up at tradin horses an i just want to tell you saxon theyve sure shown me a few an i m gettin tough under the wings myself ill never tear again so as you can notice it which means one more trade learned for yours truly i can make a livin anywhere now tradin horses  often billy had saxon out on spare saddle horses from the stable and his horse deals took them on many trips into the surrounding country likewise she was with him when he was driving horses to sell on commission and in both their minds independently arose a new idea concerning their pilgrimage billy was the first to broach it  i run into an outfit the other day thats stored in town he said an its kept me thinkin ever since aint no use tryin to get you to guess it because you cant ill tell youthe swellest wagoncampin outfit anybody ever heard of first of all the wagons a peacherino strong as they make em it was made to order upon puget sound an it was tested out all the way down here no load an no road can strain it the guy had consumption that had it built a doctor an a cook traveled with m till he passed in his checks here in ukiah two years ago but sayif you could see it every kind of a contrivancea place for everythinga regular home on wheels now if we could get that an a couple of plugs we could travel like kings an laugh at the weather  oh billy its just what ive been dreamin all winter it would be ideal and well sometimes on the road i m sure you cant help forgetting what a nice little wife youve got and with a wagon i could have all kinds of pretty clothes along  billys blue eyes glowed a caress cloudy and warm as he said quietly  ive ben thinkin about that  and you can carry a rifle and shotgun and fishing poles and everything she rushed along and a good big axe mansize instead of that hatchet youre always complaining about and possum can lift up his legs and rest andbut suppose you cant buy it how much do they want  one hundred an fifty big bucks he answered but dirt cheap at that its givin it away i tell you that rig wasnt built for a cent less than four hundred an i know wagonwork in the dark now if i can put through that dicker with caswells six horsessay i just got onto that horsebuyer today if he buys em who dye think hell ship em to to the boss right to the west oakland stables i m goin to get you to write to him travelin as were goin to i can pick up bargains an if the bossll talk i can make the regular horsebuyers commissions hell have to trust me with a lot of money though which most likely he wont knowin all his scabs i beat up  if he could trust you to run his stable i guess he isnt afraid to let you handle his money saxon said  billy shrugged his shoulders in modest dubiousness  well anyway as i was sayin if i can sell caswells six horses why we can stand off this months bills an buy the wagon  but horses saxon queried anxiously  theyll come laterif i have to take a regular job for two or three months the only trouble with that d be that itd run us pretty well along into summer before we could pull out but come on down town an ill show you the outfit right now  saxon saw the wagon and was so infatuated with it that she lost a nights sleep from sheer insomnia of anticipation then caswells six horses were sold the months bills held over and the wagon became theirs one rainy morning two weeks later billy had scarcely left the house to be gone on an allday trip into the country after horses when he was back again  come on he called to saxon from the street get your things on an come along i want to show you something  he drove down town to a board stable and took her through to a large roofed inclosure in the rear there he led to her a span of sturdy dappled chestnuts with creamcolored manes and tails  oh the beauties the beauties saxon cried resting her cheek against the velvet muzzle of one while the other roguishly nuzzled for a share  aint they though billy reveled leading them up and down before her admiring gaze thirteen hundred an fifty each an they dont look the weight theyre that slick put together i couldnt believe it myself till i put em on the scales twentyseven hundred an seven pounds the two of em an i tried em outthat was two days ago good dispositions no faults an truepullers automobile broke an all the rest id back em to outpull any team of their weight i ever seensay howd they look hooked up to that wagon of ourn  saxon visioned the picture and shook her head slowly in a reaction of regret  three hundred spot cash buys em billy went on an thats bedrock the owner wants the money so bad hes droolin for it just gotta sell an sell quick an saxon honest to god that paird fetch five hundred at auction down in the city both mares full sisters five an six years old registered belgian sire out of a heavy standardbred mare that i know three hundred takes em an i got the refusal for three days  saxons regret changed to indignation  oh why did you show them to me we havent any three hundred and you know it all ive got in the house is six dollars and you havent that much  maybe you think thats all i brought you down town for he replied enigmatically well it aint  he paused licked his lips and shifted his weight uneasily from one leg to the other  now you listen till i get all done before you say anything ready  she nodded  wont open your mouth  this time she obediently shook her head  well its this way he began haltingly theys a youngster come up from frisco young sandow they call m an the pride of telegraph hill hes the real goods of a heavyweight an he was to fight montana red saturday night only montana red just in a little trainin bout snapped his forearm yesterday the managers has kept it quiet now heres the proposition lots of tickets sold an theyll be a big crowd saturday night at the last moment so as not to disappoint em theyll spring me

three hundred big round iron dollars wait i m tellin you its a leadpipe cinch its like robbin a corpse sandows got all the heart in the worldregular knockdownandragoutanhangon fighter ive followed m

ourn if you say no then its all bets off an everything all right an ill take to harnesswashin at the stable so as to buy a couple of plugs remember theyll only be plugs though but dont look at me while youre makin up your mind keep your lamps on the horses  it was with painful indecision that she looked at the beautiful animals  their names is hazel an hattie billy put in a sly wedge if we get em we could call it the double h outfit  but saxon forgot the team and could only see billys frightfully bruised body the night he fought the chicago terror she was about to speak when billy who had been hanging on her lips broke in  just hitch em up to our wagon in your mind an look at the outfit you got to go some to beat it  but youre not in training billy she said suddenly and without having intended to say it  huh he snorted ive been in half trainin for the last year my legs is like iron theyll hold me up as long as ive got a punch left in my arms and i always have that besides i wont let m make a long fight hes a maneater an maneaters is my meat i eat m alive its the clever boys with the stamina an endurance that i cant put away but this young sandows my meat ill get m maybe in the third or fourth roundyou know time m in a rush an hand it to m just as easy its a leadpipe cinch i tell you honest to god saxon its a shame to take the money  but i hate to think of you all battered up she temporized if i didnt love you so it might be different and then too you might get hurt  billy laughed in contemptuous pride of youth and brawn  you wont know ive been in a fight except that well own hazel an hattie there an besides saxon i just gotta stick my fist in somebodys face once in a while you know i can go for months peaceable an gentle as a lamb an then my knuckles actually begin to itch to land on something now its a whole lot sensibler to land on young sandow an get three hundred for it than to land on some hayseed an get hauled up an fined before some justice of the peace now take another squint at hazel an hattie theyre regular farm furniture good to breed from when we get to that valley of the moon an theyre heavy enough to turn right into the plowin too   the evening of the fight at quarter past eight saxon parted from billy at quarter past nine with hot water ice and everything ready in anticipation she heard the gate click and billys step come up the porch she had agreed to the fight much against her better judgment and had regretted her consent every minute of the hour she had just waited so that as she opened the front door she was expectant of any sort of a terrible husbandwreck but the billy she saw was precisely the billy she had parted from  there was no fights she cried in so evident disappointment that he laughed  they was all yellin fake fake when i left an wantin their money back  well ive got you she laughed leading him in though secretly she sighed farewell to hazel and hattie  i stopped by the way to get something for you that youve been wantin some time billy said casually shut your eyes an open your hand an when you open your eyes youll find it grand he chanted  into her hand something was laid that was very heavy and very cold and when her eyes opened she saw it was a stack of fifteen twentydollar gold pieces  i told you it was like takin money from a corpse he exulted as he emerged grinning from the whirlwind of punches whacks and hugs in which she had enveloped him they wasnt no fight at all d ye want to know how long it lasted just twentyseven secondsless n half a minute an how many blows struck one an it was me that done it here ill show you it was just like thisa regular scream  billy had taken his place in the middle of the room slightly crouching chin tucked against the sheltering left shoulder fists closed elbows in so as to guard left side and abdomen and forearms close to the body  its the first round he pictured gongs sounded an weve shook hands of course seein as its a long fight an weve never seen each other in action we aint in no rush were just feelin each other out an fiddlin around seventeen seconds like that not a blow struck nothin an then its all off with the big swede it takes some time to tell it but it happened in a jiffy in fess in a tenth of a second i wasnt expectin it myself were awful close together his left glove aint a foot from my jaw an my left glove aint a foot from his he feints with his right an i know its a feint an just hunch up my left shoulder a bit an feint with my right that draws his guard over just about an inch an i see my openin my left aint got a foot to travel i dont draw it back none i start it from where it is corkscrewin around his right guard an pivotin at the waist to put the weight of my shoulder into the punch an it connectssquare on the point of the chin sideways he drops deado i walk back to my corner an honest to god saxon i cant help gigglin a little it was that easy the referee stands over m an counts m out he never quivers the audience dont know what to make of it an sits paralyzed his seconds carry m to his corner an set m on the stool but they gotta hold m up five minutes afterward he opens his eyesbut he aint seein nothing theyre glassy five minutes more an he stands up they got to help hold m his legs givin under m like they was sausages an the seconds has to help m through the ropes an they go down the aisle to his dressin room ahelpin m an the crowd beginning to yell fake an want its money back twentyseven secondsone punchn a spankin pair of horses for the best wife billy roberts ever had in his long experience  all of saxons old physical worship of her husband revived and doubled on itself many times he was in all truth a hero worthy to be of that winghelmeted company leaping from the beaked boats upon the bloody english sands the next morning he was awakened by her lips pressed on his left hand  heywhat are you doin he demanded  kissing hazel and hattie good morning she answered demurely and now i m going to kiss you good morning  and just where did your punch land show me  billy complied touching the point of her chin with his knuckles with both her hands on his arm she shored it back and tried to draw it forward sharply in similitude of a punch but billy withstrained her  wait he said you dont want to knock your jaw off ill show you a quarter of an inch will do  and at a distance of a quarter of an inch from her chin he administered the slightest flick of a tap  on the instant saxons brain snapped with a white flash of light while her whole body relaxed numb and weak volitionless sad her vision reeled and blurred the next instant she was herself again in her eyes terror and understanding  and it was at a foot that you struck him she murmured in a voice of awe  yes and with the weight of my shoulders behind it billy laughed oh thats nothinghere let me show you something else  he searched out her solar plexus and did no more than snap his middle finger against it this time she experienced a simple paralysis accompanied by a stoppage of breath but with a brain and vision that remained perfectly clear in a moment however all the unwonted sensations were gone  solar plexus billy elucidated imagine what its like when the other fellow lifts a wallop to it all the way from his knees thats the punch that won the championship of the world for bob fitzsimmons  saxon shuddered then resigned herself to billys playful demonstration of the weak points in the human anatomy he pressed the tip of a finger into the middle of her forearm and she knew excruciating agony on either side of her neck at the base he dented gently with his thumbs and she felt herself quickly growing unconscious  thats one of the death touches of the japs he told her and went on accompanying grips and holds with a running exposition heres the toehold that notch defeated hackenschmidt with i learned it from farmer burnsan heres a halfnelsonan heres you makin roughhouse at a dance an i m the floor manager an i gotta put you out  one hand grasped her wrist the other hand passed around and under her forearm and grasped his own wrist and at the first hint of pressure she felt that her arm was a pipestem about to break  thats called the come alongan heres the strong arm a boy can down a man with it an if you ever get into a scrap an the other fellow gets your nose between his teethyou dont want to lose your nose do you well this is what you do quick as a flash  involuntarily she closed her eyes as billys thumbends pressed into them she could feel the forerunning ache of a dull and terrible hurt  if he dont let go you just press real hard an out pop his eyes an hes blind as a bat for the rest of his life oh hell let go all right all right  he released her and lay back laughing  how dye feel he asked those aint boxin tricks but theyre all in the game of a roughhouse  i feel like revenge she said trying to apply the come along to his arm  when she exerted the pressure she cried out with pain for she had succeeded only in hurting herself billy grinned at her futility she dug her thumbs into his neck in imitation of the japanese death touch then gazed ruefully at the bent ends of her nails she punched him smartly on the point of the chin and again cried out this time to the bruise of her knuckles  well this cant hurt me she gritted through her teeth as she assailed his solar plexus with her doubled fists  by this time he was in a roar of laughter under the sheaths of muscles that were as armor the fatal nerve center remained impervious  go on do it some more he urged when she had given up breathing heavily it feels fine like you was ticklin me with a feather  all right mister man she threatened balefully you can talk about your grips and death touches and all the rest but thats all mans game i know something that will beat them all that will make a strong man as helpless as a baby wait a minute till i get it there shut your eyes ready i wont be a second  he waited with closed eyes and then softly as rose petals fluttering down he felt her lips on his mouth  you win he said in solemn ecstasy and passed his arms around her    chapter xiv  in the morning billy went down town to pay for hazel and hattie it was due to saxons impatient desire to see them that he seemed to take a remarkably long time about so simple a transaction but she forgave him when he arrived with the two horses hitched to the camping wagon  had to borrow the harness he said pass possum up and climb in an ill show you the double h outfit which is some outfit im tellin you  saxons delight was unbounded and almost speechless as they drove out into the country behind the dappled chestnuts with the creamcolored tails and manes the seat was upholstered highbacked and comfortable and billy raved about the wonders of the efficient brake he trotted the team along the hard county road to show the standardgoing in them and put them up a steep earthroad almost hubdeep with mud to prove that the light belgian sire was not wanting in their makeup  when saxon at last lapsed into complete silence he studied her anxiously with quick sidelong glances she sighed and asked  when do you think well be able to start  maybe in two weeks or maybe in two or three months he sighed with solemn deliberation were like the irishman with the trunk an nothin to put in it heres the wagon heres the horses an nothin to pull i know a peach of a shotgun i can get secondhand eighteen dollars but look at the bills we owe then theres a new 22 automatic rifle i want for you an a 3030 ive had my eye on for deer an you want a good jointed pole as well as me an tackle costs like sam hill an harness like i want will cost fifty bucks cold an the wagon ought to be painted then theres pasture ropes an nosebags an a harness punch an all such things an hazel an hattie eatin their heads off all the time were waitin an i m just itchin to be started myself  he stopped abruptly and confusedly  now billy what have you got up your sleevei can see it in your eyes saxon demanded and indicted in mixed metaphors  well saxon you see its like this sandow aint satisfied hes madder n a hatter never got one punch at me never had a chance to make a showin an he wants a return match hes blattin around town that he can lick me with one hand tied behind m an all that kind of hot air which aint the point the point is the fightfans is wild to see a returnmatch they didnt get a run for their money last time theyll fill the house the managers has seen me already that was why i was so long theys three hundred more waitin on the tree for me to pick two weeks from last night if youll say the word its just the same as i told you before hes my meat he still thinks i m a rube an that it was a fluke punch  but billy you told me long ago that fighting took the silk out of you that was why youd quit it and stayed by teaming  not this kind of fightin he answered i got this one all doped out ill let m last till about the seventh not that itll be necessary but just to give the audience a run for its money of course ill get a lump or two an lose some skin then ill time m to that glass jaw of his an drop m for the count an well be all packed up an next mornin well pull out what dye say aw come on   saturday night two weeks later saxon ran to the door when the gate clicked billy looked tired his hair was wet his nose swollen one cheek was puffed there was skin missing from his ears and both eyes were slightly bloodshot  i m darned if that boy didnt fool me he said as he placed the roll of gold pieces in her hand and sat down with her on his knees hes some boy when he gets extended instead of stoppin m at the seventh he kept me hustlin till the fourteenth then i got m the way i said its too bad hes got a glass jaw hes quickern i thought an hes got a wallop that made me mighty respectful from the second roundan the prettiest little chop an comeagain i ever saw but that glass jaw he kept it in cotton wool till the fourteenth an then i connected  an say i m mighty glad it did last fourteen rounds i still got all my silk i could see that easy i wasnt breathin much an every round was fast an my legs was like iron i could afought forty rounds you see i never said nothin but ive been suspicious all the time after that beatin the chicago terror gave me  nonsenseyou would have known it long before now saxon cried look at all your boxing and wrestling and running at carmel  nope billy shook his head with the conviction of utter knowledge thats different it dont take it outa you you gotta be up against the real thing fightin for life round after round with a husky you know aint lost a thread of his silk yetthen if you dont blow up if your legs is steady an your heart aint burstin an you aint wobbly at all an no signs of queer street in your headwhy then you know you still got all your silk an i got it i got all mine dye hear me an i aint goin to risk it on no more fights thats straight easy moneys hardest in the end from now on its horsebuyin on commish an you an me on the road till we find that valley of the moon  next morning early they drove out of ukiah possum sat on the seat between them his rosy mouth agape with excitement they had originally planned to cross over to the coast from ukiah but it was too early in the season for the soft earthroads to be in shape after the winter rains so they turned east for lake county their route to extend north through the upper sacramento valley and across the mountains into oregon then they would circle west to the coast where the roads by that time would be in condition and come down its length to the golden gate  all the land was green and flowersprinkled and each tiny valley as they entered the hills was a garden  huh billy remarked scornfully to the general landscape they say a rollin stone gathers no moss just the same this looks like some outfit weve gathered never had so much actual property in my life at one timean them was the days when i wasnt rollin helleven the furniture wasnt ourn only the clothes we stood up in an some old socks an things  saxon reached out and touched his hand and he knew that it was a hand that loved his hand  ive only one regret she said youve earned it all yourself ive had nothing to do with it  huhyouve had everything to do with it youre like my second in a fight you keep me happy an in condition a man cant fight without a good second to take care of him hell i wouldnt aben here if it wasnt for you you made me pull up stakes an head out why if it hadnt been for you id adrunk myself dead an rotten by this time or had my neck stretched at san quentin over hittin some scab too hard or something or other an look at me now look at that roll of greenbackshe tapped his breastto buy the boss some horses why were takin an unendin vacation an makin a good livin at the same time an one more trade i gothorsebuyin for oakland if i show ive got the savve an i have all the frisco firmsll be after me to buy for them an its all your fault youre my tonic kid all right all right an if possum wasnt lookin idwell who cares if he does look  and billy leaned toward her sidewise and kissed her  the way grew hard and rocky as they began to climb but the divide was an easy one and they soon dropped down the canyon of the blue lakes among lush fields of golden poppies in the bottom of the canyon lay a wandering sheet of water of intensest blue ahead the folds of hills interlaced the distance with a remote blue mountain rising in the center of the picture  they asked questions of a handsome blackeyed man with curly gray hair who talked to them in a german accent while a cheeryfaced woman smiled down at them out of a trellised high window of the swiss cottage perched on the bank billy watered the horses at a pretty hotel farther on where the proprietor came out and talked and told him he had built it himself according to the plans of the blackeyed man with the curly gray hair who was a san francisco architect  goin up goin up billy chortled as they drove on through the winding hills past another lake of intensest blue dye notice the difference in our treatment already between ridin an walkin with packs on our backs with hazel an hattie an saxon an possum an yours truly an this hightoned wagon folks most likely take us for millionaires out on a lark  the way widened broad oakstudded pastures with grazing livestock lay on either hand then clear lake opened before them like an inland sea flecked with little squalls and flaws of wind from the high mountains on the northern slopes of which still glistened white snow patches  ive heard mrs hazard rave about lake geneva saxon recalled but i wonder if it is more beautiful than this  that architect fellow called this the california alps you remember billy confirmed an if i dont mistake thats lakeport showin up ahead an all wild country an no railroads  and no moon valleys here saxon criticized but it is beautiful oh so beautiful  hottern hell in the dead of summer ill bet was billys opinion nope the country were lookin for lies nearer the coast just the same it is beautiful like a picture on the wall what dye say we stop off an go for a swim this afternoon  ten days later they drove into williams in colusa county and for the first time again encountered a railroad billy was looking for it for the reason that at the rear of the wagon walked two magnificent workhorses which he had picked up for shipment to oakland  too hot was saxons verdict as she gazed across the shimmering level of the vast sacramento valley no redwoods no hills no forests no manzanita no madronos lonely and sad  an like the river islands billy interpolated richer in hell but looks too much like hard work itll do for those thats stuck on hard workgod knows theys nothin here to induce a fellow to knock off ever for a bit of play no fishin no huntin nothin but work id work myself if i had to live here  north they drove through days of heat and dust across the california plains and everywhere was manifest the new farminggreat irrigation ditches dug and being dug the land threaded by powerlines from the mountains and many new farmhouses on small holdings newly fenced the bonanza farms were being broken up however many of the great estates remained five to ten thousand acres in extent running from the sacramento bank to the horizon dancing in the heat waves and studded with great valley oaks  it takes rich soil to make trees like those a tenacre farmer told them  they had driven off the road a hundred feet to his tiny barn in order to water hazel and hattie a sturdy young orchard covered most of his ten acres though a goodly portion was devoted to whitewashed henhouses and wired runways wherein hundreds of chickens were to be seen he had just begun work on a small frame dwelling  i took a vacation when i bought he explained and planted the trees then i went back to work an stayed with it till the place was cleared now i m here for keeps an soon as the house is finished ill send for the wife shes not very well and it will do her good weve been planning and working for years to get away from the city he stopped in order to give a happy sigh and now were free  the water in the trough was warm from the sun  hold on the man said dont let them drink that ill give it to them cool  stepping into a small shed he turned an electric switch and a motor the size of a fruit box hummed into action a fiveinch stream of sparkling water splashed into the shallow main ditch of his irrigation system and flowed away across the orchard through many laterals  isn tit beautiful ehbeautiful beautiful the man chanted in an ecstasy its bud and fruit its blood and life look at it it makes a gold mine laughable and a saloon a nightmare i know i i used to be a barkeeper in fact ive been a barkeeper most of my life thats how i paid for this place and ive hated the business all the time i was a farm boy and all my life ive been wanting to get back to it and here i am at last  he wiped his glasses the better to behold his beloved water then seized a hoe and strode down the main ditch to open more laterals  hes the funniest barkeeper i ever seen billy commented i took him for a business man of some sort must aben in some kind of a quiet hotel  dont drive on right away saxon requested i want to talk with him  he came back polishing his glasses his face beaming watching the water as if fascinated by it it required no more exertion on saxons part to start him than had been required on his part to start the motor  the pioneers settled all this in the early fifties he said the mexicans never got this far so it was government land everybody got a hundred and sixty acres and such acres the stories they tell about how much wheat they got to the acre are almost unbelievable then several things happened the sharpest and steadiest of the pioneers held what they had and added to it from the other fellows it takes a great many quarter sections to make a bonanza farm it wasnt long before it was most all bonanza farms  they were the successful gamblers saxon put in remembering mark halls words  the man nodded appreciatively and continued  the old folks schemed and gathered and added the land into the big holdings and built the great barns and mansions and planted the house orchards and flower gardens the young folks were spoiled by so much wealth and went away to the cities to spend it and old folks and young united in one thing in impoverishing the soil year after year they scratched it and took out bonanza crops they put nothing back all they left was plowsole and exhausted land why theres big sections they exhausted and left almost desert  the bonanza farmers are all gone now thank the lord and heres where we small farmers come into our own it wont be many years before the whole valley will be farmed in patches like mine look at what were doing workedout land that had ceased to grow wheat and we turn the water on treat the soil decently and see our orchards  weve got the waterfrom the mountains and from under the ground i was reading an account the other day all life depends on food all food depends on water it takes a thousand pounds of water to produce one pound of food ten thousand pounds to produce one pound of meat how much water do you drink in a year about a ton but you eat about two hundred pounds of vegetables and two hundred pounds of meat a yearwhich means you consume one hundred tons of water in the vegetables and one thousand tons in the meatwhich means that it takes eleven hundred and one tons of water each year to keep a small woman like you going  gee was all billy could say  you see how population depends upon water the axbarkeeper went on well weve got the water immense subterranean supplies and in not many years this valley will be populated as thick as belgium  fascinated by the fiveinch stream sluiced out of the earth and back to the earth by the droning motor he forgot his discourse and stood and gazed rapt and unheeding while his visitors drove on  an him a drinkslinger billy marveled he can sure sling the temperance dope if anybody should ask you  its lovely to think aboutall that water and all the happy people that will come here to live  but it aint the valley of the moon billy laughed  no she responded they dont have to irrigate in the valley of the moon unless for alfalfa and such crops what we want is the water bubbling naturally from the ground and crossing the farm in little brooks and on the boundary a fine big creek  with trout in it billy took her up an willows and trees of all kinds growing along the edges and here a riffle where you can flip out trout and there a deep pool where you can swim and highdive an kingfishers an rabbits comin down to drink an maybe a deer  and meadowlarks in the pasture saxon added and mourning doves in the trees we must have mourning dovesand the big gray treesquirrels  geethat valley of the moons goin to be some valley billy meditated flicking a fly away with his whip from hatties side think well ever find it  saxon nodded her head with great certitude  just as the jews found the promised land and the mormons utah and the pioneers california you remember the last advice we got when we left oakland tis them that looks that finds    chapter xv  ever north through a fat and flourishing rejuvenated land stopping at the towns of willows red bluff and redding crossing the counties of colusa glenn tehama and shasta went the spruce wagon drawn by the dappled chestnuts with creamcolored manes and tails billy picked up only three horses for shipment although he visited many farms and saxon talked with the women while he looked over the stock with the men and saxon grew the more convinced that the valley she sought lay not there  at redding they crossed the sacramento on a cable ferry and made a days scorching traverse through rolling foothills and flat tablelands the heat grew more insupportable and the trees and shrubs were blasted and dead then they came again to the sacramento where the great smelters of kennett explained the destruction of the vegetation  they climbed out of the smelting town where eyrie houses perched insecurely on a precipitous landscape it was a broad wellengineered road that took them up a grade miles long and plunged down into the canyon of the sacramento the road rocksurfaced and easygraded hewn out of the canyon wall grew so narrow that billy worried for fear of meeting oppositebound teams far below the river frothed and flowed over pebbly shallows or broke tumultuously over boulders and cascades in its race for the great valley they had left behind  sometimes on the wider stretches of road saxon drove and billy walked to lighten the load she insisted on taking her turns at walking and when he breathed the panting mares on the steep and saxon stood by their heads caressing them and cheering them billys joy was too deep for any turn of speech as he gazed at his beautiful horses and his glowing girl trim and colorful in her golden brown corduroy the brown corduroy calves swelling sweetly under the abbreviated slim skirt and when her answering look of happiness came to hima sudden dimness in her straight gray eyeshe was overmastered by the knowledge that he must say something or burst  o you kid he cried  and with radiant face she answered o you kid  they camped one night in a deep dent in the canyon where was snuggled a boxfactory village and where a toothless ancient gazing with faded eyes at their traveling outfit asked be you showin  they passed castle crags mightybastioned and glowing red against the palpitating blue sky they caught their first glimpse of mt shasta a rosetinted snowpeak rising a sunset dream between and beyond green interlacing walls of canyona landmark destined to be with them for many days at unexpected turns after mounting some steep grade shasta would appear again still distant now showing two peaks and glacial fields of shimmering white miles and miles and days and days they climbed with shasta ever developing new forms and phases in her summer snows  a moving picture in the sky said billy at last  ohit is all so beautiful sighed saxon but there are no moonvalleys here  they encountered a plague of butterflies and for days drove through untold millions of the fluttering beauties that covered the road with uniform velvetbrown and ever the road seemed to rise under the noses of the snorting mares filling the air with noiseless flight drifting down the breeze in clouds of brown and yellow softflaked as snow and piling in mounds against the fences ever driven to float helplessly on the irrigation ditches along the roadside hazel and hattie soon grew used to them though possum never ceased being made frantic  huhwho ever heard of butterflybroke horses billy chaffed thats worth fifty bucks more on their price  wait till you get across the oregon line into the rogue river valley they were told theres gods paradiseclimate scenery and fruitfarming fruit ranches that yield two hundred per cent on a valuation of five hundred dollars an acre  gee billy said when he had driven on out of hearing thats too rich for our digestion  and saxon said i dont know about apples in the valley of the moon but i do know that the yield is ten thousand per cent of happiness on a valuation of one billy one saxon a hazel a hattie and a possum  through siskiyou county and across high mountains they came to ashland and medford and camped beside the wild rogue river  this is wonderful and glorious pronounced saxon but it is not the valley of the moon  nope it aint the valley of the moon agreed billy and he said it on the evening of the day he hooked a monster steelhead standing to his neck in the icecold water of the rogue and fighting for forty minutes with screaming reel ere he drew his finny prize to the bank and with the scalpyell of a comanche jumped and clutched it by the gills  them that looks finds predicted saxon as they drew north out of grants pass and held north across the mountains and fruitful oregon valleys  one day in camp by the umpqua river billy bent over to begin skinning the first deer he had ever shot he raised his eyes to saxon and remarked  if i didnt know california i guess oregond suit me from the ground up  in the evening replete with deer meat resting on his elbow and smoking his aftersupper cigarette he said  maybe they aint no valley of the moon an if they aint what of it we could keep on this way forever i dont ask nothing better  there is a valley of the moon saxon answered soberly and we are going to find it weve got to why billy it would never do never to settle down there would be no little hazels and little hatties nor little billies  nor little saxons billy interjected  nor little possums she hurried on nodding her head and reaching out a caressing hand to where the fox terrier was ecstatically gnawing a deerrib a vicious snarl and a wicked snap that barely missed her fingers were her reward  possum she cried in sharp reproof again extending her hand  dont billy warned he cant help it and hes likely to get you next time  even more compelling was the menacing threat that possum growled his jaws closeguarding the bone eyes blazing insanely the hair rising stiffly on his neck  its a good dog that sticks up for its bone billy championed i wouldnt care to own one that didnt  but its my possum saxon protested and he loves me besides he must love me more than an old bone and he must mind mehere you possum give me that bone give me that bone sir  her hand went out gingerly and the growl rose in volume and key till it culminated in a snap  i tell you its instinct billy repeated he does love you but he just cant help doin it  hes got a right to defend his bones from strangers but not from his mother saxon argued i shall make him give up that bone to me  fox terriers is awful highstrung saxon youll likely get him hysterical  but she was obstinately set in her purpose she picked up a short stick of firewood  now sir give me that bone  she threatened with the stick and the dogs growling became ferocious again he snapped then crouched back over his bone saxon raised the stick as if to strike him and he suddenly abandoned the bone rolled over on his back at her feet four legs in the air his ears lying meekly back his eyes swimming and eloquent with submission and appeal  my god billy breathed in solemn awe look at itpresenting his solar plexus to you his vitals an his life all defense down as much as sayin here i am stamp on me kick the life outa me i love you i am your slave but i just cant help defendin my bone my instincts strongern me kill me but i cant help it  saxon was melted tears were in her eyes as she stooped and gathered the mite of an animal in her arms possum was in a frenzy of agitation whining trembling writhing twisting licking her face all for forgiveness  heart of gold with a rose in his mouth saxon crooned burying her face in the soft and quivering bundle of sensibilities mother is sorry shell never bother you again that way there there little love see theres your bone take it  she put him down but he hesitated between her and the bone patently looking to her for surety of permission yet continuing to tremble in the terrible struggle between duty and desire that seemed tearing him asunder not until she repeated that it was all right and nodded her head consentingly did he go to the bone and once a minute later he raised his head with a sudden startle and gazed inquiringly at her she nodded and smiled and possum with a happy sigh of satisfaction dropped his head down to the precious deerrib  that mercedes was right when she said men fought over jobs like dogs over bones billy enunciated slowly its instinct why i couldnt no more help reaching my fist to the point of a scabs jaw than could possum from snappin at you theys no explainin it what a man has to he has to the fact that he does a thing shows he had to do it whether he can explain it or not you remember hall couldnt explain why he stuck that stick between timothy mcmanuss legs in the foot race what a man has to he has to thats all i know about it i never had no earthly reason to beat up that lodger we had jimmy harmon he was a good guy square an all right but i just had to with the strike goin to smash an everything so bitter inside me that i could taste it i never told you but i saw m once after i got outwhen my arms was mendin i went down to the roundhouse an waited for m to come in off a run an apologized to m now why did i apologize i dont know except for the same reason i punched mi just had to  and so billy expounded the why of like in terms of realism in the camp by the umpqua river while possum expounded it in similar terms of fang and appetite on the rib of deer    chapter xvi  with possum on the seat beside her saxon drove into the town of roseburg she drove at a walk at the back of the wagon were tied two heavy young workhorses behind half a dozen more marched free and the rear was brought up by billy astride a ninth horse all these he shipped from roseburg to the west oakland stables  it was in the umpqua valley that they heard the parable of the white sparrow the farmer who told it was elderly and flourishing his farm was a model of orderliness and system afterwards billy heard neighbors estimate his wealth at a quarter of a million  youve heard the story of the farmer and the white sparrow he asked billy at dinner  never heard of a white sparrow even billy answered  i must say theyre pretty rare the farmer owned but heres the story once there was a farmer who wasnt making much of a success things just didnt seem to go right till at last one day he heard about the wonderful white sparrow it seems that the white sparrow comes out only just at daybreak with the first light of dawn and that it brings all kinds of good luck to the farmer that is fortunate enough to catch it next morning our farmer was up at daybreak and before looking for it and do you know he sought for it continually for months and months and never caught even a glimpse of it their host shook his head no he never found it but he found so many things about the farm needing attention and which he attended to before breakfast that before he knew it the farm was prospering and it wasnt long before the mortgage was paid off and he was starting a bank account  that afternoon as they drove along billy was plunged in a deep reverie  oh i got the point all right he said finally an yet i aint satisfied of course they wasnt a white sparrow but by getting up early an attendin to things hed been slack about beforeoh i got it all right an yet saxon if thats what a farmers life means i dont want to find no moon valley life aint hard work daylight to dark hard at itmight just as well be in the city whats the difference al the time youve got to yourself is for sleepin an when youre sleepin youre not enjoyin yourself an whats it matter where you sleep youre deado might as well be dead an done with it as work your head off that way id sooner stick to the road an shoot a deer an catch a trout once in a while an lie on my back in the shade an laugh with you an have fun with you an an go swimmin an i m a willin worker too but theys all the difference in the world between a decent amount of work an workin your head off  saxon was in full accord she looked back on her years of toil and contrasted them with the joyous life she had lived on the road  we dont want to be rich she said let them hunt their white sparrows in the sacramento islands and the irrigation valleys when we get up early in the valley of the moon it will be to hear the birds sing and sing with them and if we work hard at times it will be only so that well have more time to play and when you go swimming i m going with you and well play so hard that well be glad to work for relaxation   i m gettin plumb dried out billy announced mopping the sweat from his sunburned forehead what dye say we head for the coast  west they turned dropping down wild mountain gorges from the height of land of the interior valleys so fearful was the road that on one stretch of seven miles they passed ten brokendown automobiles billy would not force the mares and promptly camped beside a brawling stream from which he whipped two trout at a time here saxon caught her first big trout she had been accustomed to landing them up to nine and ten inches and the screech of the reel when the big one was hooked caused her to cry out in startled surprise billy came up the riffle to her and gave counsel several minutes later cheeks flushed and eyes dancing with excitement saxon dragged the big fellow carefully from the waters edge into the dry sand here it threw the hook out and flopped tremendously until she fell upon it and captured it in her hands  sixteen inches billy said as she held it up proudly for inspection heywhat are you goin to do  wash off the sand of course was her answer  better put it in the basket he advised then closed his mouth and grimly watched  she stooped by the side of the stream and dipped in the splendid fish it flopped there was a convulsive movement on her part and it was gone  oh saxon cried in chagrin  them that finds should hold quoth billy  i dont care she replied it was a bigger one than you ever caught anyway  oh i m not denyin youre a peach at fishin he drawled you caught me didnt you  i dont know about that she retorted maybe it was like the man who was arrested for catching trout out of season his defense was self defense  billy pondered but did not see  the trout attacked him she explained  billy grinned fifteen minutes later he said  you sure handed me a hot one   the sky was overcast and as they drove along the bank of the coquille river the fog suddenly enveloped them  whoof billy exhaled joyfully aint it great i can feel myself moppin it up like a dry sponge i never appreciated fog before  saxon held out her arms to receive it making motions as if she were bathing in the gray mist  i never thought id grow tired of the sun she said but weve had more than our share the last few weeks  ever since we hit the sacramento valley billy affirmed too much sun aint good ive worked that out sunshine is like liquor did you ever notice how good you felt when the sun come out after a week of cloudy weather well that sunshine was just like a jolt of whiskey had the same effect made you feel good all over now when youre swimmin an come out an lay in the sun how good you feel thats because youre lappin up a suncocktail but suppose you lay there in the sand a couple of hours you dont feel so good youre so slowmovin it takes you a long time to dress you go home draggin your legs an feelin rotten with all the life sapped outa you whats that its the katzenjammer youve been soused to the ears in sunshine like so much whiskey an now youre payin for it thats straight thats why fog in the climate is best  then weve been drunk for months saxon said and now were going to sober up  you bet why saxon i can do two days work in one in this climatelook at the mares blame me if they aint perkin up already  vainly saxons eye roved the pine forest in search of her beloved redwoods they would find them down in california they were told in the town of bandon  then were too far north said saxon we must go south to find our valley of the moon  and south they went along roads that steadily grew worse through the dairy country of langlois and through thick pine forests to port orford where saxon picked jeweled agates on the beach while billy caught enormous rockcod no railroads had yet penetrated this wild region and the way south grew wilder and wilder at gold beach they encountered their old friend the rogue river which they ferried across where it entered the pacific still wilder became the country still more terrible the road still farther apart the isolated farms and clearings  and here were neither asiatics nor europeans the scant population consisted of the original settlers and their descendants more than one old man or woman saxon talked with who could remember the trip across the plains with the plodding oxen west they had fared until the pacific itself had stopped them and here they had made their clearings built their rude houses and settled in them farthest west had been reached old customs had changed little there were no railways no automobile as yet had ventured their perilous roads eastward between them and the populous interior valleys lay the wilderness of the coast rangea game paradise billy heard though he declared that the very road he traveled was game paradise enough for him had he not halted the horses turned the reins over to saxon and shot an eightpronged buck from the wagonseat  south of gold beach climbing a narrow road through the virgin forest they heard from far above the jingle of bells a hundred yards farther on billy found a place wide enough to turn out here he waited while the merry bells descending the mountain rapidly came near they heard the grind of brakes the soft thud of horses hoofs once a sharp cry of the driver and once a womans laughter  some driver some driver billy muttered i take my hat off to m whoever he is hittin a pace like that on a road like thislisten to that hes got powerful brakeszocie that was a chuckhole some springs saxon some springs  where the road zigzagged above they glimpsed through the trees four sorrel horses trotting swiftly and the flying wheels of a small tanpainted trap  at the bend of the road the leaders appeared again swinging wide on the curve the wheelers flashed into view and the light twoseated rig then the whole affair straightened out and thundered down upon them across a narrow plankbridge in the front seat were a man and woman in the rear seat a japanese was squeezed in among suit cases rods guns saddles and a typewriter case while above him and all about him fastened most intricately sprouted a prodigious crop of deer and elkhorns  its mr and mrs hastings saxon cried  whoa hastings yelled putting on the brake and gathering his horses in to a stop alongside greetings flew back and forth in which the japanese whom they had last seen on the roamer at rio vista gave and received his share  different from the sacramento islands eh hastings said to saxon nothing but old american stock in these mountains and they havent changed any as john fox jr said theyre our contemporary ancestors our old folks were just like them  mr and mrs hastings between them told of their long drive they were out two months then and intended to continue north through oregon and washington to the canadian boundary  then well ship our horses and come home by train concluded hastings  but the way you drive you oughta be a whole lot further along than this billy criticized  but we keep stopping off everywhere mrs hastings explained  we went in to the hoopa reservation said mr elastings and canoed down the trinity and klamath rivers to the ocean and just now weve come out from two weeks in the real wilds of curry county  you must go in hastings advised youll get to mountain ranch tonight and you can turn in from there no roads though youll have to pack your horses but its full of game i shot five mountain lions and two bear to say nothing of deer and there are small herds of elk toono i didnt shoot any theyre protected these horns i got from the old hunters ill tell you all about it  and while the men talked saxon and mrs hastings were not idle  found your valley of the moon yet the writers wife asked as they were saying goodby  saxon shook her head  you will find it if you go far enough and be sure you go as far as sonoma valley and our ranch then if you havent found it yet well see what we can do  three weeks later with a bigger record of mountain lions and bear than hastings to his credit billy emerged from curry county and drove across the line into california at once saxon found herself among the redwoods but they were redwoods unbelievable billy stopped the wagon got out and paced around one  fortyfive feet he announced thats fifteen in diameter and theyre all like it only bigger no theres a runt its only about nine feet through an theyre hundreds of feet tall  when i die billy you must bury me in a redwood grove saxon adjured  i aint goin to let you die before i do he assured her an then well leave it in our wills for us both to be buried that way    chapter xvii  south they held along the coast hunting fishing swimming and horsebuying billy shipped his purchases on the coasting steamers through del norte and humboldt counties they went and through mendocino into sonomacounties larger than eastern statesthreading the giant woods whipping innumerable troutstreams and crossing countless rich valleys ever saxon sought the valley of the moon sometimes when all seemed fair the lack was a railroad sometimes madrono and manzanita trees and usually there was too much fog  we do want a suncocktail once in a while she told billy  yep was his answer too much fog might make us soggy what were after is betwixt an between an well have to get back from the coast a ways to find it  this was in the fall of the year and they turned their backs on the pacific at old fort ross and entered the russian river valley far below ukiah by way of cazadero and guerneville at santa rosa billy was delayed with the shipping of several horses so that it was not until afternoon that he drove south and east for sonoma valley  i guess well no more than make sonoma valley when itll be time to camp he said measuring the sun with his eye this is called bennett valley you cross a divide from it and come out at glen ellen now this is a mighty pretty valley if anybody should ask you an thats some nifty mountain over there  the mountain is all right saxon adjudged but all the rest of the hills are too bare and i dont see any big trees it takes rich soil to make big trees  oh i aint sayin its the valley of the moon by a long ways all the same saxon thats some mountain look at the timber on it i bet theys deer there  i wonder where well spend this winter saxon remarked  dye know ive just been thinkin the same thing lets winter at carmel mark halls back an so is jim hazard what dye say  saxon nodded  only you wont be the oddjob man this time  nope we can make trips in good weather horsebuyin billy confirmed his face beaming with selfsatisfaction an if that walkin poet of the marble house is around ill sure get the gloves on with m just in memory of the time he walked me off my legs  oh oh saxon cried look billy look  around a bend in the road came a man in a sulky driving a heavy stallion the animal was a bright chestnutsorrel with creamcolored mane and tail the tail almost swept the ground while the mane was so thick that it crested out of the neck and flowed down long and wavy he scented the mares and stopped short head flung up and armfuls of creamy mane tossing in the breeze he bent his head until flaring nostrils brushed impatient knees and between the finepointed ears could be seen a mighty and incredible curve of neck again he tossed his head fretting against the bit as the driver turned widely aside for safety in passing they could see the blue glaze like a sheen on the surface of the horses bright wild eyes and billy closed a wary thumb on his reins and himself turned widely he held up his hand in signal and the driver of the stallion stopped when well past and over his shoulder talked draughthorses with billy  among other things billy learned that the stallions name was barbarossa that the driver was the owner and that santa rosa was his headquarters  there are two ways to sonoma valley from here the man directed when you come to the crossroads the turn to the left will take you to glen ellen by bennett peakthats it there  rising from rolling stubble fields bennett peak towered hot in the sun a row of bastion hills leaning against its base but hills and mountains on that side showed bare and heated though beautiful with the sunburnt tawniness of california  the turn to the right will take you to glen ellen too only its longer and steeper grades but your mares dont look as though itd bother them  which is the prettiest way saxon asked  oh the right hand road by all means said the man thats sonoma mountain there and the road skirts it pretty well up and goes through coopers grove  billy did not start immediately after they had said goodby and he and saxon heads over shoulders watched the roused barbarossa plunging mutinously on toward santa rosa  gee billy said id like to be up here next spring  at the crossroads billy hesitated and looked at saxon  what if it is longer she said look how beautiful it isall covered with green woods and i just know those are redwoods in the canyons you never can tell the valley of the moon might be right up there somewhere and it would never do to miss it just in order to save half an hour  they took the turn to the right and began crossing a series of steep foothills as they approached the mountain there were signs of a greater abundance of water they drove beside a running stream and though the vineyards on the hills were summerdry the farmhouses in the hollows and on the levels were grouped about with splendid trees  maybe it sounds funny saxon observed but i m beginning to love that mountain already it almost seems as if i d seen it before somehow its so allaround satisfyingoh  crossing a bridge and rounding a sharp turn they were suddenly enveloped in a mysterious coolness and gloom all about them arose stately trunks of redwood the forest floor was a rosy carpet of autumn fronds occasional shafts of sunlight penetrating the deep shade warmed the somberness of the grove alluring paths led off among the trees and into cozy nooks made by circles of red columns growing around the dust of vanished ancestorswitnessing the titantic dimensions of those ancestors by the girth of the circles in which they stood  out of the grove they pulled to the steep divide which was no more than a buttress of sonoma mountain the way led on through rolling uplands and across small dips and canyons all well wooded and adrip with water in places the road was muddy from wayside springs  the mountains a sponge said billy here it is the tailend of dry summer an the grounds just leakin everywhere  i know ive never been here before saxon communed aloud but its all so familiar so i must have dreamed it and theres madronosa whole grove and manzanita why i feel just as if i was coming home oh billy if it should turn out to be our valley  plastered against the side of a mountain he queried with a skeptical laugh  no i dont mean that i mean on the way to our valley because the wayall waysto our valley must be beautiful and this ive seen it all before dreamed it  its great he said sympathetically i wouldnt trade a square mile of this kind of country for the whole sacramento valley with the river islands thrown in and middle river for good measure if they aint deer up there i miss my guess an where theys springs theys streams an streams means trout  they passed a large and comfortable farmhouse surrounded by wandering barns and cowsheds went on under forest arches and emerged beside a field with which saxon was instantly enchanted it flowed in a gentle concave from the road up the mountain its farther boundary an unbroken line of timber the field glowed like rough gold in the approaching sunset and near the middle of it stood a solitary great redwood with blasted top suggesting a nesting eyrie for eagles the timber beyond clothed the mountain in solid green to what they took to be the top but as they drove on saxon looking back upon what she called her field saw the real summit of sonoma towering beyond the mountain behind her field a mere spur upon the side of the larger mass  ahead and toward the right across sheer ridges of the mountains separated by deep green canyons and broadening lower down into rolling orchards and vineyards they caught their first sight of sonoma valley and the wild mountains that rimmed its eastern side to the left they gazed across a golden land of small hills and valleys beyond to the north they glimpsed another portion of the valley and still beyond the opposing wall of the valleya range of mountains the highest of which reared its red and battered ancient crater against a rosy and mellowing sky from north to southeast the mountain rim curved in the brightness of the sun while saxon and billy were already in the shadow of evening he looked at saxon noted the ravished ecstasy of her face and stopped the horses all the eastern sky was blushing to rose which descended upon the mountains touching them with wine and ruby sonoma valley began to fill with a purple flood laying the mountain bases rising inundating drowning them in its purple saxon pointed in silence indicating that the purple flood was the sunset shadow of sonoma mountain billy nodded then chirruped to the mares and the descent began through a warm and colorful twilight  on the elevated sections of the road they felt the cool delicious breeze from the pacific forty miles away while from each little dip and hollow came warm breaths of autumn earth spicy with sunburnt grass and fallen leaves and passing flowers  they came to the rim of a deep canyon that seemed to penetrate to the heart of sonoma mountain again with no word spoken merely from watching saxon billy stopped the wagon the canyon was wildly beautiful tall redwoods lined its entire length on its farther rim stood three rugged knolls covered with dense woods of spruce and oak from between the knolls a feeder to the main canyon and likewise fringed with redwoods emerged a smaller canyon billy pointed to a stubble field that lay at the feet of the knolls  its in fields like that ive seen my mares apasturing he said  they dropped down into the canyon the road following a stream that sang under maples and alders the sunset fires refracted from the clouddriftage of the autumn sky bathed the canyon with crimson in which ruddylimbed madronos and winewooded manzanitas burned and smoldered the air was aromatic with laurel wild grape vines bridged the stream from tree to tree oaks of many sorts were veiled in lacy spanish moss ferns and brakes grew lush beside the stream from somewhere came the plaint of a mourning dove fifty feet above the ground almost over their heads a douglas squirrel crossed the roada flash of gray between two trees and they marked the continuance of its aerial passage by the bending of the boughs  ive got a hunch said billy  let me say it first saxon begged  he waited his eyes on her face as she gazed about her in rapture  weve found our valley she whispered was that it  he nodded but checked speech at sight of a small boy driving a cow up the road a preposterously big shotgun in one hand in the other as preposterously big a jackrabbit how far to glen ellen billy asked  mile an a half was the answer  what creek is this inquired saxon  wild water it empties into sonoma creek half a mile down  troutthis from billy  if you know how to catch em grinned the boy  deer up the mountain  it aint open season the boy evaded  i guess you never shot a deer billy slyly baited and was rewarded with  i got the horns to show  deer shed their horns billy teased on anybody can find em  i got the meat on mine it aint dry yet  the boy broke off gazing with shocked eyes into the pit billy had dug for him  its all right sonny billy laughed as he drove on i aint the game warden i m buyin horses  more leaping tree squirrels more ruddy madronos and majestic oaks more fairy circles of redwoods and still beside the singing stream they passed a gate by the roadside before it stood a rural mail box on which was lettered edmund hale standing under the rustic arch leaning upon the gate a man and woman composed a pieture so arresting and beautiful that saxon caught her breath they were side by side the delicate hand of the woman curled in the hand of the man which looked as if made to confer benedictions his face bore out this impressiona beautifulbrowed countenance with large benevolent gray eyes under a wealth of white hair that shone like spun glass he was fair and large the little woman beside him was daintily wrought she was saffronbrown as a woman of the white race can well be with smiling eyes of bluest blue in quaint sagegreen draperies she seemed a flower with her small vivid face irresistibly reminding saxon of a springtime wakerobin  perhaps the picture made by saxon and billy was equally arresting and beautiful as they drove down through the golden end of day the two couples had eyes only for each other the little woman beamed joyously the mans face glowed into the benediction that had trembled there to saxon like the field up the mountain like the mountain itself it seemed that she had always known this adorable pair she knew that she loved them  how dye do said billy  you blessed children said the man i wonder if you know how dear you look sitting there  that was all the wagon had passed by rustling down the road which was carpeted with fallen leaves of maple oak and alder then they came to the meeting of the two creeks  oh what a place for a home saxon cried pointing across wild water see billy on that bench there above the meadow  its a rich bottom saxon and so is the bench rich look at the big trees on it an theys sure to be springs  drive over she said  forsaking the main road they crossed wild water on a narrow bridge and continued along an ancient rutted road that ran beside an equally ancient wormfence of split redwood rails they came to a gate open and off its hinges through which the road led out on the bench  this is iti know it saxon said with conviction drive in billy  a small whitewashed farmhouse with broken windows showed through the trees  talk about your madronos  billy pointed to the father of all madronos six feet in diameter at its base sturdy and sound which stood before the house  they spoke in low tones as they passed around the house under great oak trees and came to a stop before a small barn they did not wait to unharness tying the horses they started to explore the pitch from the bench to the meadow was steep yet thickly wooded with oaks and manzanita as they crashed through the underbrush they startled a score of quail into flight  how about game saxon queried  billy grinned and fell to examining a spring which bubbled a clear stream into the meadow here the ground was sunbaked and wide open in a multitude of cracks  disappointment leaped into saxons face but billy crumbling a clod between his fingers had not made up his mind  its rich he pronounced the cream of the soil thats been washin down from the hills for ten thousan years but  he broke off stared all about studying the configuration of the meadow crossed it to the redwood trees beyond then came back  its no good as it is he said but its the best ever if its handled right all it needs is a little common sense an a lot of drainage this meadows a natural basin not yet filled level theys a sharp slope through the redwoods to the creek come on ill show you  they went through the redwoods and came out on sonoma creek at this spot was no singing the stream poured into a quiet pool the willows on their side brushed the water the opposite side was a steep bank billy measured the height of the bank with his eye the depth of the water with a driftwood pole  fifteen feet he announced that allows all kinds of highdivin from the bank an its a hundred yards of a swim up an down  they followed down the pool it emptied in a riffle across exposed bedrock into another pool as they looked a trout flashed into the air and back leaving a widening ripple on the quiet surface  i guess we wont winter in carmel billy said this place was specially manufactured for us in the morning ill find out who owns it  half an hour later feeding the horses he called saxons attention to a locomotive whistle  youve got your railroad he said thats a train pulling into glen ellen an its only a mile from here  saxon was dozing off to sleep under the blankets when billy aroused her  suppose the guy that owns it wont sell  there isnt the slightest doubt saxon answered with unruffled certainty this is our place i know it    chapter xviii  they were awakened by possum who was indignantly reproaching a tree squirrel for not coming down to be killed the squirrel chattered garrulous remarks that drove possum into a mad attempt to climb the tree billy and saxon giggled and hugged each other at the terriers frenzy  if this is goin to be our place theyll be no shootin of tree squirrels billy said  saxon pressed his hand and sat up from beneath the bench came the cry of a meadow lark  there isnt anything left to be desired she sighed happily  except the deed billy corrected  after a hasty breakfast they started to explore running the irregular boundaries of the place and repeatedly crossing it from rail fence to creek and back again seven springs they found along the foot of the bench on the edge of the meadow  theres your water supply billy said drain the meadow work the soil up and with fertilizer and all that water you can grow crops the year round there must be five acres of it an i wouldnt trade it for mrs mortimers  they were standing in the old orchard on the bench where they had counted twentyseven trees neglected but of generous girth  and on top the bench back of the house we can grow berries saxon paused considering a new thought if only mrs mortimer would come up and advise usdo you think she would billy  sure she would it aint more n four hours run from san jose but first well get our hooks into the place then you can write to her  sonoma creek gave the long boundary to the little farm two sides were worm fenced and the fourth side was wild water  why well have that beautiful man and woman for neighbors saxon recollected wild water will be the dividing line between their place and ours  it aint ours yet billy commented lets go and call on em theyll be able to tell us all about it  its just as good as she replied the big thing has been the finding and whoever owns it doesnt care much for it it hasnt been lived in for a long time andoh billyare you satisfied  with every bit of it he answered frankly as far as it goes but the trouble is it dont go far enough  the disappointment in her face spurred him to renunciation of his particular dream  well buy itthats settled he said but outside the meadow theys so much woods that theys little pasturenot more n enough for a couple of horses an a cow but i dont care we cant have everything an what they is is almighty good  let us call it a starter she consoled later on we can add to itmaybe the land alongside that runs up the wild water to the three knolls we saw yesterday  where i seen my horses pasturin he remembered with a flash of eye why not so much has come true since we hit the road maybe thatll come true too  well work for it billy  well work like hell for it he said grimly   they passed through the rustic gate and along a path that wound through wild woods there was no sign of the house until they came abruptly upon it bowered among the trees it was eightsided and so justly proportioned that its two stories made no show of height the house belonged there it might have sprung from the soil just as the trees had there were no formal grounds the wild grew to the doors the low porch of the main entrance was raised only a step from the ground trillium covert they read in quaint carved letters under the eave of the porch  come right upstairs you dears a voice called from above in response to saxons knock  stepping back and looking up she beheld the little lady smiling down from a sleepingporch clad in a rosytissued and flowing house gown she again reminded saxon of a flower  just push the front door open and find your way was the direction  saxon led with billy at her heels they came into a room bright with windows where a big log smoldered in a roughstone fireplace on the stone slab above stood a huge mexican jar filled with autumn branches and trailing fluffy smokevine the walls were finished in warm natural woods stained but without polish the air was aromatic with clean wood odors a walnut organ loomed in a shallow corner of the room all corners were shallow in this octagonal dwelling in another corner were many rows of books through the windows across a low couch indubitably made for use could be seen a restful picture of autumn trees and yellow grasses threaded by wellworn paths that ran here and there over the tiny estate a delightful little stairway wound past more windows to the upper story here the little lady greeted them and led them into what saxon knew at once was her room the two octagonal sides of the house which showed in this wide room were given wholly to windows under the long sill to the floor were shelves of books books lay here and there in the disorder of use on work table couch and desk on a sill by an open window a jar of autumn leaves breathed the charm of the sweet brown wife who seated herself in a tiny rattan chair enameled a cheery red such as children delight to rock in  a queer house mrs hale laughed girlishly and contentedly but we love it edmund made it with his own hands even to the plumbing though he did have a terrible time with that before he succeeded  how about that hardwood floor downstairsan the fireplace billy inquired  all all she replied proudly and half the furniture that cedar desk there the tablewith his own hands  they are such gentle hands saxon was moved to say  mrs hale looked at her quickly her vivid face alive with a grateful light  they are gentle the gentlest hands i have ever known she said softly and you are a dear to have noticed it for you only saw them yesterday in passing  i couldnt help it saxon said simply  her gaze slipped past mrs hale attracted by the wall beyond which was done in a bewitching honeycomb pattern dotted with golden bees the walls were hung with a few a very few framed pictures  they are all of people saxon said remembering the beautiful paintings in mark halls bungalow  my windows frame my landscape paintings mrs hale answered pointing out of doors inside i want only the faces of my dear ones whom i cannot have with me always some of them are dreadful rovers  oh saxon was on her feet and looking at a photograph you know clara hastings  i ought to i did everything but nurse her at my breast she came to me when she was a little baby her mother was my sister do you know how greatly you resemble her i remarked it to edmund yesterday he had already seen it it wasnt a bit strange that his heart leaped out to you two as you came drilling down behind those beautiful horses  so mrs hale was claras auntold stock that had crossed the plains saxon knew now why she had reminded her so strongly of her own mother  the talk whipped quite away from billy who could only admire the detailed work of the cedar desk while he listened saxon told of meeting clara and jack hastings on their yacht and on their driving trip in oregon they were off again mrs hale said having shipped their horses home from vancouver and taken the canadian pacific on their way to england mrs hale knew saxons mother or rather her poems and produced not only the story of the files but a ponderous scrapbook which contained many of her mothers poems which saxon had never seen a sweet singer mrs hale said but so many had sung in the days of gold and been forgotten there had been no army of magazines then and the poems had perished in local newspapers  jack hastings had fallen in love with clara the talk ran on then visiting at trillium covert he had fallen in love with sonoma valley and bought a magnificent home ranch though little enough he saw of it being away over the world so much of the time mrs hale talked of her own journey across the plains a little girl in the late fifties and like mrs mortimer knew all about the fight at little meadow and the tale of the massacre of the emigrant train of which billys father had been the sole survivor  and so saxon concluded an hour later weve been three years searching for our valley of the moon and now weve found it  valley of the moon mrs hale queried then you knew about it all the time what kept you so long  no we didnt know we just started on a blind search for it mark hall called it a pilgrimage and was always teasing us to carry long staffs he said when we found the spot wed know because then the staffs would burst into blossom he laughed at all the good things we wanted in our valley and one night he took me out and showed me the moon through a telescope he said that was the only place we could find such a wonderful valley he meant it was moonshine but we adopted the name and went on looking for it  what a coincidence mrs hale exclaimed for this is the valley of the moon  i know it saxon said with quiet confidence it has everything we wanted  but you dont understand my dear this is the valley of the moon this is sonoma valley sonoma is an indian word and means the valley of the moon that was what the indians called it for untold ages before the first white men came we who love it still so call it  and then saxon recalled the mysterious references jack hastings and his wife had made to it and the talk tripped along until billy grew restless he cleared his throat significantly and interrupted  we want to find out about that ranch acrost the creekwho owns it if theyll sell where well find em an such things  mrs hale stood up  well go and see edmund she said catching saxon by the hand and leading the way  my billy ejaculated towering above her i used to think saxon was small but shed make two of you  and youre pretty big the little woman smiled but edmund is taller than you and broadershouldered  they crossed a bright hall and found the big beautiful husband lying back reading in a huge mission rocker beside it was another tiny childs chair of redenameled rattan along the length of his thigh the head on his knee and directed toward a smoldering log in a fireplace clung an incredibly large striped cat like its master it turned its head to greet the newcomers again saxon felt the loving benediction that abided in his face his eyes his handstoward which she involuntarily dropped her eyes again she was impressed by the gentleness of them they were hands of love they were the hands of a type of man she had never dreamed existed no one in that merry crowd of carmel had prefigured him they were artists this was the scholar the philosopher in place of the passion of youth and all youths mad revolt was the benignance of wisdom those gentle hands had passed all the bitter by and plucked only the sweet of life dearly as she loved them she shuddered to think what some of those carmelites would be like when they were as old as heespecially the dramatic critic and the iron man  here are the dear children edmund mrs hale said what do you think they want to buy the madrono ranch theyve been three years searching for iti forgot to tell them we had searched ten years for trillium covert tell them all about it surely mr naismith is still of a mind to sell  they seated themselves in simple massive chairs and mrs hale took the tiny rattan beside the big mission rocker her slender hand curled like a tendril in edmunds and while saxon listened to the talk her eyes took in the grave rooms lined with books she began to realize how a mere structure of wood and stone may express the spirit of him who conceives and makes it those gentle hands had made all thisthe very furniture she guessed as her eyes roved from desk to chair from work table to reading stand beside the bed in the other room where stood a greenshaded lamp and orderly piles of magazines and books  as for the matter of madrono ranch it was easy enough he was saying naismith would sell had desired to sell for the past five years ever since he had engaged in the enterprise of bottling mineral water at the springs lower down the valley it was fortunate that he was the owner for about all the rest of the surrounding land was owned by a frenchmanan early settler he would not part with a foot of it he was a peasant with all the peasants love of the soil which in him had become an obsession a disease he was a landmiser with no business capacity old and opinionated he was land poor and it was an open question which would arrive first his death or bankruptcy  as for madrono ranch naismith owned it and had set the price at fifty dollars an acre that would be one thousand dollars for there were twenty acres as a farming investment using oldfashioned methods it was not worth it as a business investment yes for the virtues of the valley were on the eve of being discovered by the outside world and no better location for a summer home could be found as a happiness investment in joy of beauty and climate it was worth a thousand times the price asked and he knew naismith would allow time on most of the amount edmunds suggestion was that they take a two years lease with option to buy the rent to apply to the purchase if they took it up naismith had done that once with a swiss who had paid a monthly rental of ten dollars but the mans wife had died and he had gone away  edmund soon divined billys renunciation though not the nature of it and several questions brought it forththe old pioneer dream of land spaciousness of cattle on a hundred hills one hundred and sixty acres of land the smallest thinkable division  but you dont need all that land dear lad edmund said softly i see you understand intensive farming have you thought about intensive horseraising  billys jaw dropped at the smashing newness of the idea he considered it but could see no similarity in the two processes unbelief leaped into his eyes  you gotta show me he cried  the elder man smiled gently  let us see in the first place you dont need those twenty acres except for beauty there are five acres in the meadow you dont need more than two of them to make your living at selling vegetables in fact you and your wife working from daylight to dark cannot properly farm those two acres remains three acres you have plenty of water for it from the springs dont be satisfied with one crop a year like the rest of the oldfashioned farmers in this valley farm it like your vegetable plot intensively all the year in crops that make horsefeed irrigating fertilizing rotating your crops those three acres will feed as many horses as heaven knows how huge an area of unseeded uncared for wasted pasture would feed think it over ill lend you books on the subject i dont know how large your crops will be nor do i know how much a horse eats thats your business but i am certain with a hired man to take your place helping your wife on her two acres of vegetables that by the time you own the horses your three acres will feed you will have all you can attend to then it will be time to get more land for more horses for more riches if that way happiness lie  billy understood in his enthusiasm he dashed out  youre some farmer  edmund smiled and glanced toward his wife  give him your opinion of that annette  her blue eyes twinkled as she complied  why the dear he never farms he has never farmed but he knows she waved her hand about the booklined walls he is a student of good he studies all good things done by good men under the sun his pleasure is in books and woodworking  dont forget dulcie edmund gently protested  yes and dulcie annette laughed dulcie is our cow it is a great question with jack hastings whether edmund dotes more on dulcie or dulcie dotes more on edmund when he goes to san francisco dulcie is miserable so is edmund until he hastens back oh dulcie has given me no few jealous pangs but i have to confess he understands her as no one else does  that is the one practical subject i know by experience edmund confirmed i am an authority on jersey cows call upon me any time for counsel  he stood up and went toward his bookshelves and they saw how magnificently large a man he was he paused a book in his hand to answer a question from saxon no there were no mosquitoes although one summer when the south wind blew for ten daysan unprecedented thinga few mosquitoes had been carried up from san pablo bay as for fog it was the making of the valley and where they were situated sheltered behind sonoma mountain the fogs were almost invariably high fogs sweeping in from the ocean forty miles away they were deflected by sonoma mountain and shunted high into the air another thing trillium covert and madrono ranch were happily situated in a narrow thermal belt so that in the frosty mornings of winter the temperature was always several degrees higher than in the rest of the valley in fact frost was very rare in the thermal belt as was proved by the successful cultivation of certain orange and lemon trees  edmund continued reading titles and selecting books until he had drawn out quite a number he opened the top one bolton halls three acres and liberty and read to them of a man who walked six hundred and fifty miles a year in cultivating by oldfashioned methods twenty acres from which he harvested three thousand bushels of poor potatoes and of another man a new farmer who cultivated only five acres walked two hundred miles and produced three thousand bushels of potatoes early and choice which he sold at many times the price received by the first man  saxon receded the books from edmund and as she heaped them in billys arms read the titles they were wicksons california fruits wicksons california vegetables brooks fertilizers watsons farm poultry kings irrigation and drainage kropotkins fields factories and workshops and farmers bulletin no 22 on the feeding of farm animals  come for more any time you want them edmund invited i have hundreds of volumes on farming and all the agricultural bulletins  and you must come and get acquainted with dulcie your first spare time he called after them out the door    chapter xix  mrs mortimer arrived with seed catalogs and farm books to find saxon immersed in the farm books borrowed from edmund saxon showed her around and she was delighted with everything including the terms of the lease and its option to buy  and now she said what is to be done sit down both of you this is a council of war and i am the one person in the world to tell you what to do i ought to be anybody who has reorganized and recatalogued a great city library should be able to start you young people on in short order now where shall we begin  she paused for breath of consideration  first madrono ranch is a bargain i know soil i know beauty i know climate madrono ranch is a gold mine there is a fortune in that meadow tilthill tell you about that later first heres the land second what are you going to do with it make a living yes vegetables of course what are you going to do with them after you have grown them sell wherenow listen you must do as i did cut out the middle man sell directly to the consumer drum up your own market do you know what i saw from the car windows coming up the valley only several miles from here hotels springs summer resorts winter resortspopulation mouths market how is that market supplied i looked in vain for truck gardensbilly harness up your horses and be ready directly after dinner to take saxon and me driving never mind everything else let things stand whats the use of starting for a place of which you havent the address well look for the address this afternoon then well know where we areatthe last syllable a smiling concession to billy  but saxon did not accompany them there was too much to be done in cleaning the longabandoned house and in preparing an arrangement for mrs mortimer to sleep and it was long after supper time when mrs mortimer and billy returned  you lucky lucky children she began immediately this valley is just waking up heres your market there isnt a competitor in the valley i thought those resorts looked newcaliente boyes hot springs el verano and all along the line then there are three little hotels in glen ellen right next door oh ive talked with all the owners and managers  shes a wooz billy admired shed brace up to god on a business proposition you oughta seen her  mrs mortimer acknowledged the compliment and dashed on  and where do all the vegetables come from wagons drive down twelve to fifteen miles from santa rosa and up from sonoma those are the nearest truck farms and when they fail as they often do i am told to supply the increasing needs the managers have to express vegetables all the way from san francisco ive introduced billy theyve agreed to patronize home industry besides it is better for them youll deliver just as good vegetables just as cheap you will make it a point to deliver better fresher vegetables and dont forget that delivery for you will be cheaper by virtue of the shorter haul  no dayold egg stunt here no jams nor jellies but youve got lots of space up on the bench here on which you cant grow vegetables tomorrow morning ill help you lay out the chicken runs and houses besides there is the matter of capons for the san francisco market youll start small it will be a side line at first ill tell you all about that too and send you the literature you must use your head let others do the work you must understand that thoroughly the wages of superintendence are always larger than the wages of the laborers you must keep books you must know where you stand you must know what pays and what doesnt and what pays best your books will tell that ill show you all in good time  an think of itall that on two acres billy murmured  mrs mortimer looked at him sharply  two acres your granny she said with asperity five acres and then you wont be able to supply your market and you my boy as soon as the first rains come will have your hands full and your horses weary draining that meadow well work those plans out tomorrow also there is the matter of berries on the bench hereand trellised table grapes the choicest they bring the fancy prices there will be blackberriesburbanks he lives at santa rosaloganberries mammoth berries but dont fool with strawberries thats a whole occupation in itself theyre not vines you know ive examined the orchard its a good foundation well settle the pruning and grafts later  but billy wanted three acres of the meadow saxon explained at the first chance  what for  to grow hay and other kinds of food for the horses hes going to raise  buy it out of a portion of the profits from those three acres mrs mortimer decided on the instant  billy swallowed and again achieved renunciation  all right he said with a brave show of cheerfulness let her go us for the greens  during the several days of mrs mortimers visit billy let the two women settle things for themselves oakland had entered upon a boom and from the west oakland stables had come an urgent letter for more horses so billy was out early and late scouring the surrounding country for young work animals in this way at the start he learned his valley thoroughly there was also a clearing out at the west oakland stables of mares whose feet had been knocked out on the hard city pave meets and he was offered first choice at bargain prices they were good animals he knew what they were because he knew them of old time the soft earth of the country with a preliminary rest in pasture with their shoes pulled off would put them in shape they would never do again on hardpaved streets but there were years of farm work in them and then there was the breeding but he could not undertake to buy them he fought out the battle in secret and said nothing to saxon  at night he would sit in the kitchen and smoke listening to all that the two women had done and planned in the day the right kind of horses was hard to buy and as he put it it was like pulling a tooth to get a farmer to part with one despite the fact that he had been authorized to increase the buying sum by as much as fifty dollars despite the coming of the automobile the price of heavy draught animals continued to rise from as early as billy could remember the price of the big work horses had increased steadily after the great earthquake the price had jumped yet it had never gone back  billy you make more money as a horsebuyer than a common laborer dont you mrs mortimer asked very well then you wont have to drain the meadow or plow it or anything you keep right on buying horses work with your head but out of what you make you will please pay the wages of one laborer for saxons vegetables it will be a good investment with quick returns  sure he agreed thats all anybody hires any body forto make money outa m but how saxon an one man are goin to work them five acres when mr hale says two of us couldnt do whats needed on two acres is beyond me  saxon isnt going to work mrs mortimer retorted  did you see me working at san jose saxon is going to use her head its about time you woke up to that a dollar and a half a day is what is earned by persons who dont use their heads and she isnt going to be satisfied with a dollar and a half a day now listen i had a long talk with mr hale this afternoon he says there are practically no efficient laborers to be hired in the valley  i know that billy interjected all the good men go to the cities its only the leavins thats left the good ones that stay behind aint workin for wages  which is perfectly true every word now listen children i knew about it and i spoke to mr hale he is prepared to make the arrangements for you he knows all about it himself and is in touch with the warden in short you will parole two goodconduct prisoners from san quentin and they will be gardeners there are plenty of chinese and italians there and they are the best truckfarmers you kill two birds with one stone you serve the poor convicts and you serve yourselves  saxon hesitated shocked while billy gravely considered the question  you know john mrs mortimer went on mr hales man about the place how do you like him  oh i was wishing only today that we could find somebody like him saxon said eagerly hes such a dear faithful soul mrs hale told me a lot of fine things about him  theres one thing she didnt tell you smiled mrs mortimer john is a paroled convict twentyeight years ago in hot blood he killed a man in a quarrel over sixtyfive cents hes been out of prison with the hales three years now you remember louis the old frenchman on my place hes another so thats settled when your two comeof course you will pay them fair wagesand well make sure theyre the same nationality either chinese or italianswell when they come john with their help and under mr hales guidance will knock together a small cabin for them to live in well select the spot even so when your farm is in full swing youll have to have more outside help so keep your eyes open billy while youre gallivanting over the valley  the next night billy failed to return and at nine oclock a glen ellen boy on horseback delivered a telegram billy had sent it from lake county he was after horses for oakland  not until the third night did he arrive home tired to exhaustion but with an ill concealed air of pride  now what have you been doing these three days mrs mortimer demanded  usin my head he boasted quietly killin two birds with one stone an take it from me i killed a whole flock huh i got word of it at lawndale an i wanta tell you hazel an hattie was some tired when i stabled m at calistoga an pulled out on the stage over st helena i was johnnyonthespot an i nailed meight whoppersthe whole outfit of a mountain teamster young animals sound as adollar and the lightest of em over fifteen hundred i shipped m last night from calistoga an well that aint all  before that first day at lawndale i seen the fellow with the teamin contract for the pavinstone quarry sell horses he wanted to buy em he wanted to buy em bad hed even rent em he said  and you sent him the eight you bought saxon broke in  guess again i bought them eight with oakland money an they was shipped to oakland but i got the lawndale contractor on long distance and he agreed to pay me half a dollar a day rent for every work horse up to half a dozen then i telegraphed the boss tellin him to ship me six sorefooted mares bud strothers to make the choice an to charge to my commission bud knows what i m after soon as they come off go their shoes two weeks in pasture an then they go to lawndale they can do the work its a downhill haul to the railroad on a dirt road half a dollar rent eachthats three dollars a day theyll bring me six days a week i dont feed em shoe m or nothin an i keep an eye on m to see theyre treated right three bucks a day eh well i guess thatll keep a couple of dollaran ahalf men goin for saxon unless she works em sundays huh the valley of the moon why well be wearin diamonds before long gosh a fellow could live in the city a thousan years an not get such chances it beats china lottery  he stood up  i m goin out to water hazel an hattie feed m an bed m down ill eat soon as i come back  the two women were regarding each other with shining eyes each on the verge of speech when billy returned to the door and stuck his head in  theys one thing maybe you aint got he said i pull down them three dollars every day but the six mares is mine too i own m theyre mine are you on    chapter xx  im not done with you children had been mrs mortimers parting words and several times that winter she ran up to advise and to teach saxon how to calculate her crops for the small immediate market for the increasing spring market and for the height of summer at which time she would be able to sell all she could possibly grow and then not supply the demand in the meantime hazel and hattie were used every odd moment in hauling manure from glen ellen whose barnyards had never known such a thorough cleaning also there were loads of commercial fertilizer from the railroad station bought under mrs mortimers instructions  the convicts paroled were chinese both had served long in prison and were old men but the days work they were habitually capable of won mrs mortimers approval gow yum twenty years before had had charge of the vegetable garden of one of the great menlo park estates his disaster had come in the form of a fight over a game of fan tan in the chinese quarter at redwood city his companion chan chi had been a hatchetman of note in the old fighting days of the san francisco tongs but a quarter of century of discipline in the prison vegetable gardens had cooled his blood and turned his hand from hatchet to hoe these two assistants had arrived in glen ellen like precious goods in bond and been receipted for by the local deputy sheriff who in addition reported on them to the prison authorities each month saxon too made out a monthly report and sent it in  as for the danger of their cutting her throat she quickly got over the idea of it the mailed hand of the state hovered over them the taking of a single drink of liquor would provoke that hand to close down and jerk them back to prisoncells nor had they freedom of movement when old gow yum needed to go to san francisco to sign certain papers before the chinese consul permission had first to be obtained from san quentin then too neither man was nasty tempered saxon had been apprehensive of the task of bossing two desperate convicts but when they came she found it a pleasure to work with them she could tell them what to do but it was they who knew how do prom them she learned all the ten thousand tricks and quirks of artful gardening and she was not long in realizing how helpless she would have been had she depended on local labor  still further she had no fear because she was not alone she had been using her head it was quickly apparent to her that she could not adequately oversee the outside work and at the same time do the house work she wrote to ukiah to the energetic widow who had lived in the adjoining house and taken in washing she had promptly closed with saxons offer mrs paul was forty short in stature and weighed two hundred pounds but never wearied on her feet also she was devoid of fear and according to billy could settle the hash of both chinese with one of her mighty arms mrs paul arrived with her son a country lad of sixteen who knew horses and could milk hilda the pretty jersey which had successfully passed edmunds expert eye though mrs paul ably handled the house there was one thing saxon insisted on doingnamely washing her own pretty flimsies  when i m no longer able to do that she told billy you can take a spade to that clump of redwoods beside wild water and dig a hole it will be time to bury me  it was early in the days of madrono ranch at the time of mrs mortimers second visit that billy drove in with a load of pipe and house chicken yards and barn were piped from the secondhand tank he installed below the housespring  huh i guess i can use my head he said i watched a woman over on the other side of the valley packin water two hundred feet from the spring to the house an i did some figurin i put it at three trips a day and on wash days a whole lot more an you cant guess what i made out she traveled a year packin water one hundred an twentytwo miles dye get that one hundred and twentytwo miles i asked her how long shed been there thirtyone years multiply it for yourself three thousan seven hundred an eightytwo milesall for the sake of two hundred feet of pipe wouldnt that jar you  oh i aint done yet theys a bathtub an stationary tubs acomin soon as i can see my way an say saxon you know that little clear flat just where wild water runs into sonoma theys all of an acre of it an its mine got that an no walkin on the grass for you itll be my grass i m goin up stream a ways an put in a ram i got a big secondhand one staked out that i can get for ten dollars an itll pump more watern i need an youll see alfalfa growin thatll make your mouth water i gotta have another horse to travel around on youre usin hazel an hattie too much to give me a chance an ill never see m as soon as you start deliverin vegetables i guess that alfalfall help some to keep another horse goin  but billy was destined for a time to forget his alfalfa in the excitement of bigger ventures first came trouble the several hundred dollars he had arrived with in sonoma valley and all his own commissions since earned had gone into improvements and living the eighteen dollars a week rental for his six horses at lawndale went to pay wages and he was unable to buy the needed saddlehorse for his horsebuying expeditions this however he had got around by again using his head and killing two birds with one stone he began breaking colts to drive and in the driving drove them wherever he sought horses  so far all was well but a new administration in san francisco pledged to economy had stopped all street work this meant the shutting down of the lawndale quarry which was one of the sources of supply for paving blocks the six horses would not only be back on his hands but he would have to feed them how mrs paul gow yum and chan chi were to be paid was beyond him  i guess weve bit off moren we could chew he admitted to saxon  that night he was late in coming home but brought with him a radiant face saxon was no less radiant  its all right she greeted him coming out to the barn where he was unhitching a tired but fractious colt ive talked with all three they see the situation and are perfectly willing to let their wages stand a while by another week i start hazel and hattie delivering vegetables then the money will pour in from the hotels and my books wont look so lopsided andoh billyyoud never guess old gow yum has a bank account he came to me afterwardi guess he was thinking it overand offered to lend me four hundred dollars what do you think of that  that i aint goin to be too proud to borrow it off m if he is a chink hes a white one an maybe ill need it because you seewell you cant guess what ive been up to since i seen you this mornin ive been so busy i aint had a bite to eat  using your head she laughed  you can call it that he joined in her laughter ive been spendin money like water  but you havent got any to spend she objected  ive got credit in this valley ill let you know he replied an i sure strained it some this afternoon now guess  a saddlehorse  he roared with laughter startling the colt which tried to bolt and lifted him half off the ground by his grip on its frightened nose and neck  oh i mean real guessin he urged when the animal had dropped back to earth and stood regarding him with trembling suspicion  two saddlehorses  aw you aint got imagination ill tell you you know thiercroft i bought his big wagon from m for sixty dollars i bought a wagon from the kenwood blacksmithsoso but itll dofor fortyfive dollars an i bought pings wagona peachfor sixtyfive dollars i could agot it for fifty if he hadnt seen i wanted it bad  but the money saxon questioned faintly you hadnt a hundred dollars left  didnt i tell you i had credit well i have i stood m off for them wagons i aint spent a cent of cash money today except for a couple of longdistance switches then i bought three sets of workharnesstheyre chain harness an secondhandfor twenty dollars a set i bought m from the fellow thats doin the haulin for the quarry he dont need m any more an i rented four wagons from m an four span of horses too at half a dollar a day for each horse an half a dollar a day for each wagonthats six dollars a day rent i gotta pay m the three sets of spare harness is for my six horses then lemme see yep i rented two barns in glen ellen an i ordered fifty tons of hay an a carload of bran an barley from the store in glenwoodyou see i gotta feed all them fourteen horses an shoe m an everything  oh sure pete ive went some i hired seven men to go drivin for me at two dollars a day anouch jehosaphat what you doin  no saxon said gravely having pinched him youre not dreaming she felt his pulse and forehead not a sign of fever she sniffed his breath and youve not been drinking go on tell me the rest of this whatever it is  aint you satisfied  no i want more i want all  all right but i just want you to know first that the boss i used to work for in oakland aint got nothin on me i m some man of affairs if anybody should ride up on a vegetable wagon an ask you now i m goin to tell you though i cant see why the glen ellen folks didnt beat me to it i guess they was asleep nobodyd aoverlooked a thing like it in the city you see it was like this you know that fancy brickyard theyre gettin ready to start for makin extra special fire brick for inside walls well here was i worryin about the six horses comin back on my hands earnin me nothin an eatin me into the poorhouse i had to get m work somehow an i remembered the brickyard i drove the colt down an talked with that jap chemist whos been doin the experimentin gee they was foremen lookin over the ground an everything gettin ready to hum i looked over the lay an studied it then i drove up to where theyre openin the clay pityou know that fine white chalky stuff we saw em borin out just outside the hundred an forty acres with the three knolls its a downhill haul a mile an two horses can do it easy in fact their hardest jobll be haulin the empty wagons up to the pit then i tied the colt an went to figurin  the jap professord told me the manager an the other big guns of the company was comin up on the mornin train i wasnt shoutin things out to anybody but i just made myself into a committee of welcome an when the train pulled in there i was extendin the glad hand of the burglikewise the glad hand of a guy you used to know in oakland once a thirdrate dub prizefighter by the name oflemme seeyep i got it rightbig bill roberts was the name he used to sport but now hes known as william roberts e s q  well as i was sayin i gave m the glad hand an trailed along with em to the brickyard an from the talk i could see things was doin then i watched my chance an sprung my proposition i was scared stiff all the time for maybe the teamin was already arranged but i knew it wasnt when they asked for my figures i had m by heart an i rattled m off and the topguy took m down in his notebook  were goin into this big an at once he says lookin at me sharp what kind of an outfit you got mr roberts  mewith only hazel an hattie an them too small for heavy teamin  i can slap fourteen horses an seven wagons onto the job at the jump says i an if you want more ill get m thats all  give us fifteen minutes to consider mr roberts he says  sure says i important as all hellahemmebut a couple of other things first i want a two year contract an them figures all depends on one thing otherwise they dont go  whats that he says  the dump says i here we are on the ground an i might as well show you  an i did i showed m where id lose out if they stuck to their plan on account of the dip down an pull up to the dump all you gotta do i says is to build the bunkers fifty feet over throw the road around the rim of the hill an make about seventy or eighty feet of elevated bridge  say saxon that kind of talk got em it was straight only theyd been thinkin about bricks while i was only thinkin of teamin  i guess they was all of half an hour considerin an i was almost as miserable waitin as when i waited for you to say yes after i asked you i went over the figures calculatin what i could throw off if i had to you see id given it to em stiffregular city prices an i was prepared to trim down then they come back  prices oughta be lower in the country says the topguy  nope i says this is a winegrape valley it dont raise enough hay an feed for its own animals it has to be shipped in from the san joaquin valley why i can buy hay an feed cheaper in san francisco laid down than i can here an haul it myself  an that struck m hard it was true an they knew it butsay if theyd asked about wages for drivers an about horseshoein prices id ahad to come down because you see they aint no teamsters union in the country an no horseshoers union an rent is low an them two items come a whole lot cheaper huh this afternoon i got a word bargain with the blacksmith across from the post office an he takes my whole bunch an throws off twentyfive cents on each shoein though its on the q t but they didnt think to ask bein too full of bricks  billy felt in his breast pocket drew out a legallooking document and handed it to saxon  there it is he said the contract full of all the agreements prices an penalties i saw mr hale down town an showed it to m he says its ok an say then i lit out all over town kenwood lawndale everywhere everybody everything the quarry teamin finishes friday of this week an i take the whole outfit an start wednesday of next week haulin lumber for the buildins an bricks for the kilns an all the rest an when theyre ready for the clay i m the boy thatll give it to them  but i aint told you the best yet i couldnt get the switch right away from kenwood to lawndale and while i waited i went over my figures again you couldnt guess it in a million years id made a mistake in addition somewhere an soaked m ten per cent moren id expected talk about findin money any time you want them couple of extra men to help out with the vegetables say the word though were goin to have to pinch the next couple of months an go ahead an borrow that four hundred from gow yum an tell him youll pay eight per cent interest an that we wont want it more n three or four months  when billy got away from saxons arms he started leading the colt up and down to cool it off he stopped so abruptly that his back collided with the colts nose and there was a lively minute of rearing and plunging saxon waited for she knew a fresh idea had struck billy  say he said do you know anything about bank accounts and drawin checks    chapter xxi  it was on a bright june morning that billy told saxon to put on her riding clothes to try out a saddlehorse  not until after ten oclock she said by that time ill have the wagon off on a second trip  despite the extent of the business she had developed her executive ability and system gave her much spare time she could call on the hales which was ever a delight especially now that the hastings were back and that clara was often at her aunts in this congenial atmosphere saxon burgeoned she had begun to readto read with understanding and she had time for her books for work on her pretties and for billy whom she accompanied on many expeditions  billy was even busier than she his work being more scattered and diverse and as well he kept his eye on the home barn and horses which saxon used in truth he had become a man of affairs though mrs mortimer had gone over his accounts with an eagle eye on the expense column discovering several minor leaks and finally aided by saxon bullied him into keeping books each night after supper he and saxon posted their books afterward in the big morris chair he had insisted on buying early in the days of his brickyard contract saxon would creep into his arms and strum on the ukelele or they would talk long about what they were doing and planning to do now it would be  im mixin up in politics saxon it pays you bet it pays if by next spring i aint got a half a dozen teams workin on the roads an pullin down the county money its me back to oakland an askin the boss for a job  or saxon theyre really starting that new hotel between caliente and eldridge and theres some talk of a big sanitarium back in the hills  or it would be billy now that youve piped that acre youve just got to let me have it for my vegetables ill rent it from you ill take your own estimate for all the alfalfa you can raise on it and pay you full market price less the cost of growing it  its all right take it billy suppressed a sigh besides i m too busy to fool with it now  which prevarication was barefaced by virtue of his having just installed the ram and piped the land  it will be the wisest billy she soothed for she knew his dream of landspaciousness was stronger than ever you dont want to fool with an acre theres that hundred and forty well buy it yet if old chavon ever dies besides it really belongs to madrono ranch the two together were the original quarter section  i dont wish no mans death billy grumbled but he aint gettin no good out of it overpasturin it with a lot of scrub animals ive sized it up every inch of it theys at least forty acres in the three cleared fields with water in the hills behind to beat the band the horse feed i could raise on itd take your breath away then theys at least fifty acres i could run my brood mares on pasture mixed up with trees and steep places and such the other fiftys just thick woods an pretty places an wild game an that old adobe barns all right with a new roof itd shelter any amount of animals in bad weather cook at me now rentin that measly pasture back of pings just to run my restin animals they could run in the hundred an forty if i only had it i wonder if chavon would lease it  or less ambitious billy would say i gotta skin over to petaluma tomorrow saxon theys an auction on the atkinson ranch an maybe i can pick up some bargains  more horses  aint i got two teams haulin lumber for the new winery an barneys got a bad shouldersprain hell have to lay off a long time if hes to get it in shape an bridget aint ever goin to do a tap of work again i can see that stickin out ive doctored her an doctored her shes fooled the vet too an some of the other horses has gotta take a rest that span of grays is showin the hard work an the big roans goin loco everybody thought it was his teeth but it aint its straight loco its money in pocket to take care of your animals an horses is the delicatest things on four legs some time if i can ever see my way to it i m goin to ship a carload of mules from colusa countybig heavy ones you know theyd sell like hot cakes in the valley herethem i didnt want for myself  or in lighter vein billy by the way saxon talkin of accounts what dyou think hazel an hattie is worthfair market price  why  i m askin you  well say what you paid for themthree hundred dollars  hum billy considered deeply theyre worth a whole lot more but let it go at that an now gettin back to accounts suppose you write me a check for three hundred dollars  oh robber  you cant show me why saxon when i let you have grain an hay from my carloads dont you give me a check for it an you know how youre stuck on keepin your accounts down to the penny he teased if youre any kind of a business woman you just gotta charge your business with them two horses i aint had the use of em since i dont know when  but the colts will be yours she argued besides i cant afford brood mares in my business in almost no time now hazel and hattie will have to be taken off from the wagontheyre too good for it anyway and you keep your eyes open for a pair to take their place ill give you a check for that pair but no commission  all right billy conceded hazel an hattie come back to me but you can pay me rent for the time you did use em  if you make me ill charge you board she threatened  an if you charge me board ill charge you interest for the money ive stuck into this shebang  you cant saxon laughed its community property  he grunted spasmodically as if the breath had been knocked out of him  straight on the solar plexus he said an me down for the count but say thems sweet words aint theycommunity property he rolled them over and off his tongue with keen relish an when we got married the top of our ambition was a steady job an some rags an sticks of furniture all paid up an halfworn out we wouldnt have had any community property only for you  what nonsense what could i have done by myself you know very well that you earned all the money that started us here you paid the wages of gow yum and chan chi and old hughie and mrs paul andwhy youve done it all  she drew her two hands caressingly across his shoulders and down along his great biceps muscles  thats what did it billy  aw hell its your head that done it what was my muscles good for with no head to run emsluggin scabs beatin up lodgers an crookin the elbow over a bar the only sensible thing my head ever done was when it run me into you honest to god saxon youve been the makin of me  aw hell billy she mimicked in the way that delighted him where would i have been if you hadnt taken me out of the laundry i couldnt take myself out i was just a helpless girl id have been there yet if it hadnt been for you mrs mortimer had five thousand dollars but i had you  a woman aint got the chance to help herself that a man has he generalized ill tell you what it took the two of us its been teamwork weve run in span if wed arun single you might still be in the laundry an if i was lucky id be still drivin team by the day an sportin around to cheap dances   saxon stood under the father of all madronos watching hazel and hattie go out the gate the full vegetable wagon behind them when she saw billy ride in leading a sorrel mare from whose silken coat the sun flashed golden lights  fouryearold highlife a handful but no vicious tricks billy chanted as he stopped beside saxon skin like tissue paper mouth like silk but kill the toughest broncho ever foaledlook at them lungs an nostrils they call her ramonasome spanish name sired by morellita outa genuine morgan stock  and they will sell her saxon gasped standing with hands clasped in inarticulate delight  thats what i brought her to show you for  but how much must they want for her was saxons next question so impossible did it seem that such an amazement of horseflesh could ever be hers  that aint your business billy answered brusquely the brickyards payin for her not the vegetable ranch shes yourn at the word what dye say   ill tell you in a minute  saxon was trying to mount but the animal danced nervously away  hold on till i tie billy said she aint skirtbroke thats the trouble  saxon tightly gripped reins and mane stepped with spurred foot on billys hand and was lifted lightly into the saddle  shes used to spurs billy called after spanish broke so dont check her quick come in gentle an talk to her shes highlife you know  saxon nodded dashed out the gate and down the road waved a hand to clara hastings as she passed the gate of trillium covert and continued up wild water canyon  when she came back ramona in a pleasant lather saxon rode to the rear of the house past the chicken houses and the flourishing berryrows to join billy on the rim of the bench where he sat on his horse in the shade smoking a cigarette together they looked down through an opening among the trees to the meadow which was a meadow no longer with mathematical accuracy it was divided into squares oblongs and narrow strips which displayed sharply the thousand hues of green of a truck garden gow yum and chan chi under enormous chinese grass hats were planting green onions old hughie hoe in hand plodded along the main artery of running water opening certain laterals closing others from the workshed beyond the barn the strokes of a hammer told saxon that carlsen was wirebinding vegetable boxes mrs pauls cheery soprano lifted in a hymn doated through the trees accompanied by the whirr of an eggbeater a sharp barking told where possum still waged hysterical and baffled war on the douglass squirrels billy took a long draw from his cigarette exhaled the smoke and continued to look down at the meadow saxon divined trouble in his manner his reinhand was on the pommel and her free hand went out and softly rested on his billy turned his slow gaze upon her mares lather seeming not to note it and continued on to saxons face  huh he equivocated as if waking up them san leandro porchugeeze aint got nothin on us when it comes to intensive farmin look at that water runnin you know it seems so good to me that sometimes i just wanta get down on hands an knees an lap it all up myself  oh to have all the water you want in a climate like this saxon exclaimed  an dont be scared of it ever goin back on you if the rains fooled you theres sonoma creek alongside all we gotta do is install a gasolene pump  but well never have to billy i was talking with redwood thompson hes lived in the valley since fiftythree and he says theres never been a failure of crops on account of drought we always get our rain  come on lets go for a ride he said abruptly youve got the time  all right if youll tell me whats bothering you  he looked at her quickly  nothin he grunted yes there is too whats the difference youd know it sooner or later you ought to see old chavon his face is that long he cant walk without bumpin his knee on his chin his goldmines peterin out  gold mine  his clay pit its the same thing hes gettin twenty cents a yard for it from the brickyard  and that means the end of your teaming contract saxon saw the disaster in all its hugeness what about the brickyard people  worried to death though theyve kept secret about it theyve had men out punchin holes all over the hills for a week an that jap chemist settin up nights analyzin the rubbish theyve brought in its peculiar stuff that clay for what they want it for an you dont find it everywhere them experts that reported on chavons pit made one hell of a mistake maybe they was lazy with their borins anyway they slipped up on the amount of clay they was in it now dont get to botherin itd come out somehow you cant do nothin  but i can saxon insisted we wont buy ramona  you aint got a thing to do with that he answered i m buyin her an her price dont cut any figure alongside the big game i m playin of course i can always sell my horses but that puts a stop to their makin money an that brickyard contract was fat  but if you get some of them in on the road work for the county she suggested  oh i got that in mind an i m keepin my eyes open theys a chance the quarry will start again an the fellow that did that teamin has gone to puget sound an what if i have to sell out most of the horses heres you and the vegetable business thats solid we just dont go ahead so fast for a time thats all i aint scared of the country any more i sized things up as we went along they aint a jerk burg we hit all the time on the road that i couldnt jump into an make a go an now where dyou want to ride    chapter xxii  they cantered out the gate thundered across the bridge and passed trillium covert before they pulled in on the grade of wild water canyon saxon had chosen her field on the big spur of sonoma mountains as the objective of their ride  say i bumped into something big this mornin when i was goin to fetch ramona billy said the clay pit trouble banished for the time you know the hundred an forty i passed young chavon along the road ani dont know whyjust for ducks i guessi up an asked m if he thought the old man would lease the hundred an forty to me an what d you think he said the old man didnt own it was just leasin it himself thats how we was always seein his cattle on it its a gouge into his land for he owns everything on three sides of it  next i met ping he said hilyard owned it an was willin to sell only chavon didnt have the price then comin back i looked in on payne hes quit blacksmithinhis backs hurtin m from a kickan just startin in for real estate sure he said hilyard would sell an had already listed the land with m chavons overpastured it an hilyard wont give m another lease  when they had climbed out of wild water canyon they turned their horses about and halted on the rim where they could look across at the three densely wooded knolls in the midst of the desired hundred and forty  well get it yet saxon said  sure we will billy agreed with careless certitude ive ben lookin over the big adobe barn again just the thing for a raft of horses an a new roofll be cheaper n i thought though neither chavon or mell be in the market to buy it right away with the clay pinchin out   when they reached saxons field which they had learned was the property of redwood thompson they tied the horses and entered it on foot the hay just cut was being raked by thompson who hallod a greeting to them it was a cloudless windless day and they sought refuge from the sun in the woods beyond they encountered a dim trail  its a cow trail billy declared i bet theys a teeny pasture tucked away somewhere in them trees lets follow it  a quarter of an hour later several hundred feet up the side of the spur they emerged on an open grassy space of bare hillside most of the hundred and forty two miles away lay beneath them while they were level with the tops of the three knolls billy paused to gaze upon the muchdesired land and saxon joined him  what is that she asked pointing toward the knolls up the little canyon to the left of it there on the farthest knoll right under that spruce thats leaning over  what billy saw was a white scar on the canyon wall  its one on me he said studying the scar i thought i knew every inch of that land but i never seen that before why i was right in there at the head of the canyon the first part of the winter its awful wild walls of the canyon like the sides of a steeple an covered with thick woods  what is it she asked a slide  must bebrought down by the heavy rains if i dont miss my guess billy broke off forgetting in the intensity with which he continued to look  hilyardll sell for thirty an acre he began again disconnectedly good land bad land an all just as it runs thirty an acre thats fortytwo hundred paynes new at real estate an ill make m split his commission an get the easiest terms ever we can reborrow that four hundred from gow yum an i can borrow money on my horses an wagons  are you going to buy it today saxon teased  she scarcely touched the edge of his thought he looked at her as if he had heard then forgot her the next moment  head work he mumbled head work if i dont put over a hot one  he started back down the cow trail recollected saxon and called over his shoulder  come on lets hustle i wanta ride over an look at that  so rapidly did he go down the trail and across the field that saxon had no time for questions she was almost breathless from her effort to keep up with him  what is it she begged as he lifted her to the saddle  maybe its all a jokeill tell you about it afterward he put her off  they galloped on the levels trotted down the gentler slopes of road and not until on the steep descent of wild water canyon did they rein to a walk billys preoccupation was gone and saxon took advantage to broach a subject which had been on her mind for some time  clara hastings told me the other day that theyre going to have a house party the hazards are to be there and the halls and roy blanchard  she looked at billy anxiously at the mention of blanchard his head had tossed up as to a bugle call slowly a whimsical twinkle began to glint up through the cloudy blue of his eyes  its a long time since you told any man he was standing on his foot she ventured slyly  billy began to grin sheepishly  aw thats all right he said in mocklordly fashion roy blanchard can come ill let m all that was a long time ago besides i m too busy to fool with such things  he urged his horse on at a faster walk and as soon as the slope lessened broke into a trot at trillium covert they were galloping  youll have to stop for dinner first saxon said as they neared the gate of madrono ranch  you stop he answered i dont want no dinner  but i want to go with you she pleaded what is it  i dont dast tell you you go on in an get your dinner  not after that she said nothing can keep me from coming along now  half a mile farther on they left the highway passed through a patent gate which billy had installed and crossed the fields on a road which was coated thick with chalky dust this was the road that led to chavons clay pit the hundred and forty lay to the west two wagons in a cloud of dust came into sight  your teams billy cried saxon think of it just by the use of the head earning your money while youre riding around with me  makes me ashamed to think how much cash money each one of them teams is bringin me in every day he acknowledged  they were turning off from the road toward the bars which gave entrance to the one hundred and forty when the driver of the foremost wagon hallod and waved his hand they drew in their horses and waited  the big roans broke loose the dryer said as he stopped beside them clean crazy locobitin squealin strikin kickin kicked clean out of the harness like it was paper bit a chunk out of baldy the size of a saucer an wound up by breakin his own hind leg liveliest fifteen minutes i ever seen  sure its broke billy demanded sharply  sure thing  well after you unload drive around by the other barn and get ben hes in the corral tell matthews to be easy with m an get a gun sammys got one youll have to see to the big roan i aint got time nowwhy couldnt matthews acome along with you for ben youd save time  oh hes just stickin around waitin the driver answered he reckoned i could get ben  an lose time eh well get a move on  thats the way of it billy growled to saxon as they rode on no savve no head one man settin down an holdin his hands while another team drives outa its way doin what he oughta done thats the trouble with twodollaraday men  with twodollaraday heads saxon said quickly what kind of heads do you expect for two dollars  thats right too billy acknowledged the hit if they had better heads theyd be in the cities like all the rest of the better men an the better men are a lot of dummies too they dont know the big chances in the country or you couldnt hold m from it  billy dismounted took the three bars down led his horse through then put up the bars  when i get this place therell be a gate here he announced pay for itself in no time its the thousan an one little things like this that count up big when you put m together he sighed contentedly i never used to think about such things but when we shook oakland i began to wise up it was them san leandro porchugeeze that gave me my first eyeopener id been asleep before that  they skirted the lower of the three fields where the ripe hay stood uncut billy pointed with eloquent disgust to a break in the fence slovenly repaired and on to the standing grain muchtrampled by cattle  thems the things he criticized old style an look how thin that crop is an the shallow plowin scrub cattle scrub seed scrub farmin chavons worked it for eight years now an never rested it once never put anything in for what he took out except the cattle into the stubble the minute the hay was on  in a pasture glade farther on they came upon a bunch of cattle  look at that bull saxon scrubs no name for it they oughta be a state law against lettin such animals exist no wonder chavons that land poor hes had to sink all his claypit earnins into taxes an interest he cant make his land pay take this hundred an forty anybody with the savve can just rake silver dollars offen it ill show m  they passed the big adobe barn in the distance  a few dollars at the right time would asaved hundreds on that roof billy commented well anyway i wont be payin for any improvements when i buy an ill tell you another thing this ranch is full of water and if glen ellen ever grows theyll have to come to see me for their water supply  billy knew the ranch thoroughly and took shortcuts through the woods by way of cattle paths once he reined in abruptly and both stopped confronting them a dozen paces away was a halfgrown red fox for half a minute with beady eyes the wild thing studied them with twitching sensitive nose reading the messages of the air then velvetfooted it leapt aside and was gone among the trees  the sonofagun billy ejaculated  as they approached wild water they rode out into a long narrow meadow in the middle was a pond  natural reservoir when glen ellen begins to buy water billy said see down at the lower end therewouldnt cost anything hardly to throw a dam across an i can pipe in all kinds of hilldrip an waters goin to be money in this valley not a thousan years from nowan all the ginks an boobs an dubs an gazabos poundin their ear deado an not seein it cominan surveyors workin up the valley for an electric road from sausalito with a branch up napa valley  they came to the rim of wild water canyon leaning far back in their saddles they slid the horses down a steep declivity through big spruce woods to an ancient and all but obliterated trail  they cut this trail way back in the fifties billy explained i only found it by accident then i asked poppe yesterday he was born in the valley he said it was a fake minin rush across from petaluma the gamblers got it up an they must adrawn a thousan suckers you see that flat there an the old stumps thats where the camp was they set the tables up under the trees the flat used to be bigger but the creeks eaten into it poppe said they was a couple of killins an one lynchin  lying low against their horses necks they scrambled up a steep cattle trail out of the canyon and began to work across rough country toward the knolls  say saxon youre always lookin for something pretty ill show you whatll make your hair stand up soon as we get through this manzanita  never in all their travels had saxon seen so lovely a vista as the one that greeted them when they emerged the dim trail lay like a rambling red shadow cast on the soft forest floor by the great redwoods and overarching oaks it seemed as if all local varieties of trees and vines had conspired to weave the leafy roofmaples big madronos and laurels and lofty tanbark oaks scaled and wrapped and interwound with wild grape and flaming poison oak saxon drew billys eyes to a mossy bank of fivefinger ferns all slopes seemed to meet to form this basin and colossal forest bower underfoot the floor was spongy with water an invisible streamlet whispered under broadfronded brakes on every hand opened tiny vistas of enchantment where young redwoods grouped still and stately about fallen giants shoulderhigh to the horses mosscovered and dissolving into mold  at last after another quarter of an hour they tied their horses on the rim of the narrow canyon that penetrated the wilderness of the knolls through a rift in the trees billy pointed to the top of the leaning spruce  its right under that he said well have to follow up the bed of the creek they aint no trail though youll see plenty of deer paths crossin the creek youll get your feet wet  saxon laughed her joy and held on close to his heels splashing through pools crawling hand and foot up the slippery faces of waterworn rocks and worming under trunks of old fallen trees  they aint no real bedrock in the whole mountain billy elucidated so the stream cuts deepern deeper an that keeps the sides cavin in theyre as steep as they can be without fallin down a little farther up the canyon aint much moren a crack in the groundbut a mighty deep one if anybody should ask you you can spit across it an break your neck in it  the climbing grew more difficult and they were finally halted in a narrow cleft by a driftjam  you wait here billy directed and lying flat squirmed on through crashing brush  saxon waited till all sound had died away she waited ten minutes longer then followed by the way billy had broken where the bed of the canyon became impossible she came upon what she was sure was a deer path that skirted the steep side and was a tunnel through the close greenery she caught a glimpse of the overhanging spruce almost above her head on the opposite side and emerged on a pool of clear water in a claylike basin this basin was of recent origin having been formed by a slide of earth and trees across the pool arose an almost sheer wall of white she recognized it for what it was and looked about for billy she heard him whistle and looked up two hundred feet above at the perilous top of the white wall he was holding on to a tree trunk the overhanging spruce was nearby  i can see the little pasture back of your field he called down no wonder nobody ever piped this off the only place they could see it from is that speck of pasture an you saw it first wait till i come down and tell you all about it i didnt dast before  it required no shrewdness to guess the truth saxon knew this was the precious clay required by the brickyard billy circled wide of the slide and came down the canyonwall from tree to tree as descending a ladder  aint it a peach he exulted as he dropped beside her just look at ithidden away under four feet of soil where nobody could see it an just waitin for us to hit the valley of the moon then it up an slides a piece of the skin off so as we can see it  is it the real clay saxon asked anxiously  you bet your sweet life ive handled too much of it not to know it in the dark just rub a piece between your fingerslike that why i could tell by the taste of it ive eaten enough of the dust of the teams heres where our fun begins why you know weve been workin our heads off since we hit this valley now were on easy street  but you dont own it saxon objected  well you wont be a hundred years old before i do straight from here i hike to payne an bind the bargainan option you know while titles searchin an i m raisin money well borrow that four hundred back again from gow yum an ill borrow all i can get on my horses an wagons an hazel and hattie an everything thats worth a cent an then i get the deed with a mortgage on it to hilyard for the balance an thenits takin candy from a babyill contract with the brickyard for twenty cents a yardmaybe more theyll be crazy with joy when they see it dont need any borins theys nearly two hundred feet of it exposed up an down the whole knolls clay with a skin of soil over it  but youll spoil all the beautiful canyon hauling out the clay saxon cried with alarm  nope only the knoll the roadll come in from the other side itll be only half a mile to chavons pit ill build the road an charge steeper teamin or the brickyard can build it an ill team for the same rate as before an twenty cents a yard pourin in all profit from the jump ill sure have to buy more horses to do the work  they sat hand in hand beside the pool and talked over the details  say saxon billy said after a pause had fallen sing harvest days wont you  and when she had complied the first time you sung that song for me was comin home from the picnic on the train  the very first day we met each other she broke in what did you think about me that day  why what ive thought ever sincethat you was made for mei thought that right at the jump in the first waltz an whatd you think of me  oh i wondered and before the first waltz too when we were introduced and shook handsi wondered if you were the man those were the very words that flashed into my mindis he the man  an i kinda looked a little some good to you he queried i thought so and my eyesight has always been good  say billy went off at a tangent by next winter with everything hummin an shipshape whats the matter with us makin a visit to carmel itll be slack time for you with the vegetables an ill be able to afford a foreman  saxons lack of enthusiasm surprised him  whats wrong he demanded quickly  with downcast demurest eyes and hesitating speech saxon said  i did something yesterday without asking your advice billy  he waited  i wrote to tom she added with an air of timid confession  still he waitedfor he knew not what  i asked him to ship up the old chest of drawersmy mothers you rememberthat we stored with him  huh i dont see anything outa the way about that billy said with relief we need the chest dont we an we can afford to pay the freight on it cant we  you are a dear stupid man thats what you are dont you know what is in the chest  he shook his head and what she added was so soft that it was almost a whisper  the baby clothes  no he exclaimed  true  sure  she nodded her head her cheeks flooding with quick color  its what i wanted saxon moren anything else in the world ive been thinkin a whole lot about it lately ever since we hit the valley he went on brokenly and for the first time she saw tears unmistakable in his eyes but after all id done an the hell id raised an everything i i never urged you or said a word about it but i wanted it oh i wanted it like  like i want you now  his open arms received her and the pool in the heart of the canyon knew a tender silence  saxon felt billys finger laid warningly on her lips guided by his hand she turned her head back and together they gazed far up the side of the knoll where a doe and a spotted fawn looked down upon them from a tiny open space between the trees
