95422858	life of john coleridge patteson missionary bishop of the melanesian islands   by charlotte mary yonge     preface    there are of course peculiar advantages as well as disadvantages in endeavouring to write the life of one recently departed  on the one hand the remembrances connected with him are far fresher his contemporaries can he consulted and much can be made matter of certainty for which a few years would have made it necessary to trust to hearsay or probable conjecture  on the other there is necessarily much more reserve nor are the results of the actions nor even their comparative importance so clearly discernible as when there has been time to ripen the fruit  these latter drawbacks are doubled when the subject of the biography has passed away in comparatively early life when the persons with whom his life is chiefly interwoven are still in full activity and when he has only lived to sow his seed in many waters and has barely gathered any portion of his harvest  thus what i have written of bishop patteson far more what i have copied of his letters is necessarily only partial although his nearest relations and closest friends have most kindly permitted the full use of all that could build up a complete idea of the man as he was  many letters relate to home and family matters such as it would be useless and impertinent to divulge and yet it is necessary to mention that these exist because without them we might not know how deep was the lonely mans interest and sympathy in all that concerned his kindred and friends  other letters only repeat the narrative or the reflections given elsewhere and of these it has seemed best only to print that which appeared to have the fullest or the clearest expression  in general the story is best told in letters to the home party while thoughts are generally best expressed in the correspondence with sir john taylor coleridge to whom the nephew seems to have written with a kind of unconscious carefulness of diction  there is as voluminous a correspondence with the brother and letters to many cousins but as these either repeat the same adventures or else are purely domestic they have been little brought forward except where any gap occurred in the correspondence which has formed the staple material  letters upon the unhappy maori war have been purposely omitted and as far as possible such criticisms on living personages as it seemed fair towards the writer to omit  criticisms upon their publications are of course a different thing  my desire has been to give enough expression of bishop pattesons opinions upon church and state affairs to represent his manner of thinking without transcribing every detail of remarks which were often made upon an imperfect report and were in fact only written down instead of spoken and forgotten because correspondence served him instead of conversation  i think i have represented fairly for i have done my best faithfully to select passages giving his mind even where it does not coincide completely with my own opinions being quite convinced that not only should a biographer never attempt either to twist or conceal the sentiments of the subject but that either to apologise for or as it were to argue with them is vain in both senses of the word  the real disadvantage of the work is my own very slight personal acquaintance with the externals of the man and my ignorance of the scenes in which the chief part of his life was passed  there are those who would have been far more qualified in these respects than myself and above all in that full and sympathetic masculine grasp of a mans powerful mind which is necessarily denied to me but these fittest of all being withheld by causes which are too well known to need mention i could only endeavour to fulfil the work as best i might trusting that these unavoidable deficiencies may be supplied partly by coleridge pattesons own habit of writing unreservedly so that he speaks for himself and partly by the very full notes and records with which his friends have kindly supplied me portraying him from their point of view so that i could really trust that little more was needed than ordinary judgment in connecting and selecting  nor until the work is less fresh from my hand will it be possible to judge whether i have in any way been allowed to succeed in my earnest hope and endeavour to bring the statue out of the block and as it were to carve the figure of the saint for his niche among those who have given themselves soul and body to gods work  it has been an almost solemn work of anxiety as well as one of love may i only have succeeded in causing these letters and descriptions to leave a true and definite impression of the man and of his example  let me here record my obligations for materialsi need hardly say to the immediate family and relationsfor in truth i act chiefly as their amanuensis but likewise to the bishop of lichfield bishop abraham  lady martin the rev b t dudley the rev e codrington and captain tilly for their valuable aidthe two first mentioned by correction and revision the others by contributions such as could only be supplied by eyewitnesses and fellowworkers  many others i must thank for kindly supplying me with letters   charlotte mary yonge elderfield september 19 1873      chapter i  childhood at home and at school 18271838    so much of a mans cast of character depends upon his home and parentage that no biography can be complete which does not look back at least as far as the lives of the father and mother from whom the disposition is sure to be in part inherited and by whom it must often be formed  indeed the happiest natures are generally those which have enjoyed the full benefit of parental training without dictation and have been led but not forced into the way in which they should go  therefore it will not be irrelevant to dwell on the career of the father whose name though still of great weight in his own profession may not be equally known to the younger generation who have grown up since the words mr justice patteson were of frequent occurrence in law reports  john patteson father of the subject of the present memoir was son to a clergyman of a norfolk family and was born at coney weston on february 11 1790  he was educated at eton and there formed more than one friendship which not only lasted throughout his life but extended beyond his own generation  sport and study flourished alike among such lads as these and while they were taught by dr groodall to delight in the peculiarly elegant and accurate scholarship which was the characteristic of the highest education of their day their boyhood and youth were full of the unstained mirth that gives such radiance to recollections of the past and often causes the loyalty of affectionate association to be handed on to succeeding generations  the thorough etonian impress with all that it involved was of no small account in his life as well as in that of his son  the elder john patteson was a colleger and passed on to kings college cambridge whence in 1813 he came to london to study law in 1816 he opened his chambers as a special pleader and on february 23 1818 was married to his cousin elizabeth lee after a long engagement  the next year 1819 he was called to the bar and began to go the northern circuit  on april 3 1820 mrs patteson died leaving one daughter joanna elizabeth  four years later on april 22 1824 mr patteson married frances duke coleridge sister of his friend and fellowbarrister john taylor coleridge  this lady whose name to all who remember her calls up a fair and sweet memory of all that was good bright and beloved was the daughter of james coleridge of heaths court ottery st mary devon colonel of the south devon volunteers  he was the eldest of the numerous family of the rev john coleridge master of ottery st mary school and the poet samuel taylor coleridge was the youngest  the strong family affection that existed between all colonel coleridges children and concentrated itself upon the only sister among them made marriage with her an adoption into a group that could not fail to exercise a strong influence on all connected with it and the ties of kindred will be found throughout this memoir to have had peculiar force  john coleridge patteson his mothers second child and eldest son was born at no 9 grower street bedford square on the 1st of april 1827 and baptized on the 8th  besides the elder halfsister already mentioned another sister frances sophia coleridge a year older than and one brother james henry nearly two years younger than coleridge made up the family  three years later in 1830 mr patteson was raised to the bench at the unusually early age of forty  it is probable that there never was a period when the judicial bench could reckon a larger number of men distinguished not only for legal ability but for the highest culture and for the substantial qualities that command confidence and respect  the middle of the nineteenth century was a time when england might well be proud of her judges  there was much in the habits of the bench and bar to lead to close and friendly intimacy especially on the circuits  when legal etiquette forbade the use of any public conveyance and junior barristers shared postchaises while the leaders travelled in their own carriages all spent a good deal of time together and it was not unusual for ladies to go a great part of the circuit with their husbands especially when it lay in the direction of their own neighbourhood  the judges families often accompanied them especially at the summer assize and thus there grew up close associations between their children which made their intimacy almost like that of relationship  almost all too lived in near neighbourhood in those parts of london that now are comparatively deserted but which were then the especial abodes of lawyers namely those adjacent to bedford square where the gardens were the daily resort of their children all playing together and knowing one another with that familiarity that childhood only gives  sir john pattesons contemporaries have nearly all one by one passed away writes one of them sir john taylor coleridge  he has left few if any literary monuments to record what his intellectual powers were and even in our common profession the ordinary course and practice are so changed that i doubt whether many lawyers are now familiar with his masterly judgments but i feel that i speak the truth when i describe him as a man of singularly strong common sense of great acuteness truthfulness and integrity of judgment  these were great judicial qualities and to these he added much simplicity and geniality of temper and manners and all these were crowned by a firm unhesitating devout belief in the doctrines of our faith which issued in strictness to himself and the warmest gentlest charity to his fellowcreatures  the result was what you might expect  altogether it would be hard to say whether you would characterise him as a man unusually popular or unusually respected  such was the character of mr justice patteson a character built upon the deep solid groundwork of religion such as would now be called that of a sound churchman of the old school thoroughly devout and scrupulous in observance ruling his family and household on a principle felt throughout making a conscience of all his and their ways though promoting to the utmost all innocent enjoyment of pleasure mirth or gaiety  indeed all who can look back on him or on his home remember an unusual amount of kindly genial cheerfulness fun merriment and freedom ie that obedient freedom which is the most perfect kind of liberty  though this was in great part the effect of having such a head of the family the details of management could not but chiefly depend upon the mother and lady patteson was equally loved for her tenderness and respected for her firmness  she was indeed writes her brother a sweet and pious person of the most affectionate loving disposition without a grain of selfishness and of the stoutest adherence to principle and duty  her tendency was to deal with her children fondly but this never interfered with good training and discipline  what she felt right she insisted on at whatever pain to herself  she had to deal with strong characters  coleridge or coley to give him the abbreviation by which he was known not only through childhood but through life was a fair little fellow with bright deepblue eyes inheriting much of his nature from her and her family but not by any means a model boy  he was indeed deeply and warmly affectionate but troublesome through outbreaks of will and temper showing all the ordinary instinct of trying how far the authorities for the time being will endure resistance sufficiently indolent of mind to use his excellent abilities to save exertion of intellect passionate to kicking and screaming pitch and at times showing the doggedness which is such a trial of patience to the parent  to this lady patteson never yielded the thing was to be done the point given up the temper subdued the mother to be obeyed and all this upon a principle sooner understood than parents suppose  there were countless instances of the little boys sharp stormy gusts of passion and his mothers steady refusal to listen to his i will be good until she saw that he was really sorry for the scratch or pinch which he had given or the angry word he had spoken and she never waited in vain for the sorrow was very real and generally ended in do you think god can forgive me  when fannys love of teasing had exasperated coley into stabbing her arm with a pencil their mother had resolution enough to decree that no provocation could excuse such unmanliness in a boy and inflicted a whipping which cost the girl more tears than her brother who was full of the utmost grief a child could feel for the offence  no fault was lightly passed over not that punishment was inflicted for every misdemeanour but it was always noticed and the children were shown with grave gentleness where they were wrong or when there was a squabble among them the mothers question who will give up generally produced a chorus of i i i  withal mamma was the very life of all the fun and play and jokes enjoying all with spirits and merriment like the little ones own and delighting in the exchange of caresses and tender epithets  thus affection and generosity grew up almost spontaneously towards one another and all the world  on this disposition was grafted that which was the one leading characteristic of coleys life namely a reverent and religious spirit which seems from the first to have been at work slowly and surely subduing inherent defects and raising him step by step from grace to grace  five years old is in many cases an age of a good deal of thought the intelligence is free from the misapprehensions and misty perceptions of infancy the first course of physical experiments is over freedom of speech and motion have been attained and yet there has not set in that burst of animal growth and spirits that often seems to swamp the deeper nature throughout boyhood  by this age coley was able to read and on his birthday he received from his father the bible which was used at his consecration as bishop twenty seven years later  he had an earnest wish to be a clergyman because he thought saying the absolution to people must make them so happy a belief he must have gleaned from his prayerbook for himself since the doctrine was not in those days made prominent  the purpose was fostered by his mother  she delighted in it and encouraged it in him  no thought of a family being to be made and of coley being the eldest son ever interfered for a moment  that he should be a good servant at gods altar was to her above all price  of course however this was without pressing the thought on him  he grew on with the purpose accepted but not discussed except from time to time a halfplayful halfgrave reference to himself as a future clergyman  reverence was strongly implanted in him  his old nurse still his sisters valued servant remembers the little seven years old boy after saying his own prayers at her knee standing opposite to his little brother admonishing him to attention with think jemmy think  in fact devoutness seems to have been natural to him  it appears to have been the first strongly traceable feature in him and to have gradually subdued his faults one by one  who can tell how far this was fostered by those oldfashioned habits of strictness which it is the present habit to view as repellent every morning immediately after breakfast lady patteson read the psalms and lessons for the day with the four children and after these a portion of some book of religious instruction such as horne on the psalms or daubeny on the catechism  the ensuing studies were in charge of miss neill the governess and the lifelong friend of her pupils but the mother made the religious instruction her individual care and thus upheld its preeminence  sunday was likewise kept distinct in reading teaching employment and whole tone of conversation and the effect was assuredly not that weariness which such observance is often supposed to produce but rather lasting benefit and happy associations  coley really enjoyed bible reading and entered into explanations and even then often picked up a passage in the sermons he heard at st gilessinthefields from the rev j endell tyler and would give his homeoracles no peace till they had made it as clear to his comprehension as was possible  the love of his home may be gathered from the fact that his letters have been preserved in an unbroken series beginning from a country visit in 1834 after a slight attack of scarlet fever written in the roundhand of a boy of seven years old and finished off with the big roman capitals finis amen and ending with the uncompleted sheets bearing as their last date september 19 1871  the boys first school was at ottery st mary in devonshire of which his greatgrandfather and greatuncle had both been head masters  there was much to make ottery homelike to coley for his grandparents lived at heaths court close to the church and in the manorhouse near at hand their third son francis george coleridge a solicitor whose three boys were near contemporaries of coley and two of them already in the school  from first to last his letters to his parents show no symptom of carelessness they are full of ease and confidence outpourings of whatever interested him whether small or great but always respectful as well as affectionate and written with care and pains being evidently his very best nor does the good old formula your affectionate and dutiful son ever fail or ever produce stiffness  the shrinking from rough companions and the desire to be with the homelike relatives around proved a temptation and the little boy was guilty of making false excuses to obtain leave of absence  we cannot refrain from giving his letter of penitence chiefly for the sake of the good sense and kindness of his uncles treatment   april 26 1836  my dear papai am very sorry for having told so many falsehoods which uncle frank has told mamma of  i am very sorry for having done so many bad things i mean falsehoods and i heartily beg your pardon and uncle frank says that he thinks if i stay in a months time mr cornish will begin to trust me again  uncle frank today had me into his house and told me to reflect upon what i had done he also lectured me in the bible and asked me different questions about it  he told me that if i ever told another falsehood he should that instant march into the school and ask mr cornish to strip and birch me and if i followed the same course i did now and did not amend it if the birching did not do he should not let me go home for the holidays but i will not catch the birching  so believe me your dear son  j c patteson   on the flap of the letter uncle frank writes to the mother   my dear fannyi had coley in my room today and talked to him seriously about his misdeeds and i hope good has been done but i could scarcely keep my countenance grave when he began to reduce by calculation the exact number of fibs he had told  he did not think it was more than two or three at the utmost and when i brought him to book i had much to do to prevent the feeling that the sin consisted in telling many lies  however the dear boys confession was as free as could be expected and i have impressed on his mind the meanness cowardice and wickedness of the habit and what it will end in here and hereafter  he has promised that he will never offend in future in like manner and i really believe that his desire to be away from the school and at ease among his friends induced him to trump up the invitations c to mr cornish in which consisted his first fibs  i shall watch him closely as i would my own child and cornish has done wisely i think by giving the proper punishment of confining him to the schoolcourt c and not letting him go to his friends for some time  the dear boy is so affectionate and has so much to work on that there is no fear of him only these things must be looked after promptly and he must learn practically before his reason and religion operate that he gains nothing by a lie he is very well and wins ones heart in a moment  ever your affectionate brother  f g c   the management was effectual and the penitence real for this fault never recurred nor is the boys conduct ever again censured though the halfyearly reports often lament his want of zeal and exertion coley was sufficiently forward to begin greek on his first arrival at ottery and always held a fair place for his years but throughout his school career his character was not that of an idle but of an uninterested boy who preferred play to work needed all his conscience to make him industrious and then was easily satisfied with his performances naturally comparing them with those of other boys instead of doing his own utmost and giving himself full credit for the diligence he thought he had used  for it must be remembered that it was a real not an ideal nature not a perfect character but one full of the elements of growth  a childish childlike boy he was now and for many years longer intensely fond of all kinds of games and sports in which his light active form great agility and high spirit made him excel  cricket riding runningraces all the school amusements were his delight fireworks for the 5th of november sparkle with ecstasy through his letters and he was a capital dancer in the christmas parties at his london home  he had likewise the courage and patience sure to be needed by an active lad  while at ottery he silently bore the pain of a broken collarbone for three weeks and when the accident was brought to light by his mothers embrace he only said that he did not like to make a fuss  consideration for others kindness and sweetness of nature were always his leading characteristics making him much beloved by all his companions and an excellent guardian and example to his little brother who soon joined him at ottery  indeed the love between these two brothers was so deep quiet and fervid that it is hard to dwell on it while one is taken and the other left  it was at this time a rough buffeting boyish affection but it was also a love that made separation pain and grief and on the part of the elder it showed itself in careful protection from all harm or bullying and there was a strong underlying current of tenderness most endearing to all concerned with the boys whether masters relations friends or servants     chapter ii  boyhood at eton 18381845    after the christmas holidays of 18378 when coley patteson was nearly eleven years old he was sent to eton that most beautifully situated of public schools whose delightful playing fields noble trees broad river and exquisite view of windsor castle give it a peculiar charm joining the venerable grandeur of age to the freshness and life of youth so as to rivet the affections in no common degree  it was during the headmastership of dr hawtrey that patteson became in schoolboy phrase an eton fellow being boarded in the house of his uncle the rev edward coleridge one of the most popular and successful eton masters  several of his cousins were also in this house with other boys who became friends of his whole life and he was thoroughly happy there although in these early days he still felt each departure from home severely and seldom failed to write a mournful letter after the holidays  there is one quite pathetic in its simplicity telling his mother how he could not say his prayers nor fall asleep on his first night till he had resolutely put away the handkerchief that seemed for some reason a special link with home  it illustrates what all who remember him say how thoroughly a childlike being he still was though a wellgrown manly highspirited boy quite able to take care of himself keep his place and hold his own  he was placed in the lower remove of the fourth form which was then up to the rev charles old goodford ie that was he who taught the division so called in school  the boy was evidently well prepared for he was often captain of his division and his letters frequently tell of successes of this kind while they anticipate montem  that of 1838 was a brilliant one for queen victoria then only nineteen and her first year of sovereignty not yet accomplished came from the castle to be driven in an open carriage to salt hill and bestow her royal contribution  in the throng little patteson was pressed up so close to the royal carriage that he became entangled in the wheel and was on the point of being dragged under it when the queen with ready presence of mind held out her hand he grasped it and was able to regain his feet in safety but did not recover his perceptions enough to make any sign of gratitude before the carriage passed on  he had all a boys shyness about the adventure but perhaps it served to quicken the personal loyalty which is an unfailing characteristic of eton fellows  the royal custom of the sunday afternoon parade on the terrace of windsor castle for the benefit of the gazing public afforded a fine opportunity for cultivating this sentiment and coley sends an amusingly minute description of her majestys dress evidently studied for his mothers benefit even to the pink tips of her four long ostrich feathers and calling to mind chalons watercolours of the queen in her early youth  he finishes the description with a quaint little bit of moralising  it certainly is very beautiful with two bands playing on a calm blessed sunday evening with the queen of england and all her retinue walking about  it gives you an idea of the majesty of god who could in one short second turn it all into confusion  there is nothing to me more beautiful than the raising ones eyes to heaven and thinking with adoration who made this scene and who could unmake it again  a few days later the record is of a very different scene namely windsor fair when the eton boys used to imagine they had a prescriptive right to make a riot and revel in the charms of misrule  on the second day the eton fellows always make an immense row  so at the signal when a thing was acting the boys rushed in and pulled down the curtain and commenced the row  i am happy to say i was not there  there were a great many soldiers there and they all took our part  the alarm was given and the police came  then there was such a rush at the police  some of them tumbled over and the rest were halfknocked down  at last they took in custody three of our boys upon which every boy that was there amounting to about 450 was summoned  they burst open the door knocked down the police and rescued our boys  meantime the boys kept on shying rotten eggs and crackers and there was nothing but righting and rushing  a startling description  but this was nothing to the wild pranks that lived in the traditions of the elder generation and in a few years more the boys were debarred from the mischievous licence of the fair  coley had now been nearly a year at eton and had proceeded through the lower and middle removes of the fourth form when on november 23 he achieved the success of which he thus writes  rejoice  i was sent up for good yesterday at eleven oclock school i do not know what copy of verses for yet but directly i do i will send you a copy goodford when i took my ticket to be signed for i was obliged to get goodford abraham and my tutor to sign it said i will sign it most willingly and then kept on stroking my hand and said i congratulate you most heartily and am very glad of it  i am the only one who is sent up which is a good thing for me as it will give me forty or fifty good marks in trials  i am so splitting with joy you cannot think because now i have given you some proof that i have been lately sapping and doing pretty well  do not think that i am praising myself for i am pretty nearly beside myself you may suppose  one of his cousins adds on the same sheet i must tell you it is very difficult to be sent up in the upper fourth form and still more so in the middle remove  the subject of the latin verses which obtained this distinction was a wreath or garland and there must have been something remarkable in them for mr abraham preserved a copy of them for many years  there was something in the sweetness and docility of the boy and in the expression of his calm gentle face that always greatly interested the masters and made them rejoice in his success and among his comrades he was a universal favourite  his brother joined him at eton during the ensuing year when the queens wedding afforded the boys another glimpse of royal festivity  their tumultuous loyalty and audacity appear in coleys letter  in college stretching from hexters to mother spiers was a magnificent representation of the parthenon there were three pillars and a great thing like this a not oversuccessful sketch of a pediment with the eton and royal arms in the middle and gratulatur etona victoria et alberto  it cost £150 and there were 5000 lamps hung on it  throughout the whole day we all of us wore large white bridal favours and white gloves  towards evening the clods got on long walk wall and as gentle means would not do we were under the necessity of knocking some over when the rest soon jumped off  however f and myself declared we would go right into the quadrangle of the castle so we went into the middle of the road and formed a line  soon a rocket the signal that the queen was at slough was let off and then some life guards came galloping along and one of them ran almost over me and actually trod on fs toe which put him into dreadful pain for some time  then came the queens carriage and i thought college would have tumbled down with the row  the cheering was really tremendous the whole 550 fellows all at once roared away  the queen and consort nodding and bowing smiling c then f and i made a rush to get up behind the queens carriage but a dragoon with his horse almost knocked us over  so we ran by the side as well as we could but the crowd was so immensely thick we could not get on as quick as the queen  we rushed along knocking clean over all the clods we could and rushing against the rest and finally f and myself were the only eton fellows that got into the quadrangle  as we got there the queens carriage was going away  you may fancy that we were rather hot running the whole way up to the castle besides the exertion of knocking over the clods and knocking at doors as we passed but i was so happy  such is bliss at twelve years old  the first halfyear of 1839 had brought patteson into the remove that large division of the school intermediate between the fourth and fifth forms  the work was harder and his diligence somewhat relaxed  in fact the coley of this period and of a good while later had more heart for play than work  cricket bathing and boating were his delight and though his schoolwork was conscientiously accomplished it did not interest him and when he imagined himself to have been working hard and well it was a thunderbolt to him to find at the end of the halfyear that a great deal more had been expected of him by his tutor  it shows how candid and sweet his nature was that just as when he was a little fellow at ottery his penitent letter should contain the rebuke he had received without resentment against anyone but himself  aunt has just called me down into the drawingroom and shown me my character  i am stupefied at it it is so shocking just when i most wanted a good one on account of mammas health  i am ashamed to say that i can offer not the slightest excuse my conduct on this occasion has been very bad  i expect a severe reproof from you and pray do not send me any money nor grant me the slightest favour whilst  who has very little ability uncle says is by plodding on getting credit i who my tutor says have abilities am wickedly neglecting and offending both my heavenly and earthly father by my bad use of them  aunt called me into the drawingroom and very kindly showed me the excessive foolishness of my conduct but from this very moment i am determined that i will not lose a moment and we will see what the next three weeks will produce  poor little fellow his language is so strong that it is almost a surprise to find that he was reproaching himself for no more heinous fault than not having worked up to the full extent of his powers  he kept his promise of diligence and never again incurred reproof but was sent up for good again in november  his career through the school was above the average though not attaining to what was expected from his capabilities but the development of his nature was slow and therefore perhaps ultimately the more complete and as yet study for its own sake did not interest him indeed his mind was singularly devoid of pleasure in classical subjects though so alert in other directions  he was growing into the regular tastes of the refined fastidious eton boy wrote of the cut of his first tailcoat that this is really an important thing and had grown choice in the adorning of his room and the binding of his books though he never let these tastes bring him into debt or extravagance  his turn for art and music began to show itself and the anthems at st georges chapel on the sunday afternoons gave him great delight and in eton chapel a contemporary says i well remember how he used to sing the psalms with the little turns at the end of the verses which i envied his being able to do  nor was this mere love of music but devotion coley had daily regular readings of the bible in his room with his brother cousins and a friend or two but the boys were so shy about it that they kept an open shakespeare on the table with an open drawer below in which the bible was placed and which was shut at the sound of a hand on the door  hitherto no 33 bedford square had been the only home of the patteson family  the long vacations were spent sometimes with the judges relations in the eastern counties sometimes with lady pattesons in the west  landwith rectory in cornwall was the home of her eldest brother dr james coleridge whose daughter sophia was always like an elder sister to her children and the vicarage of st mary church then a wild beautiful seaside village though now almost a suburb of torquay was held by her cousin george may coleridge and here the brothers and sisters climbed the rocks boated fished and ran exquisitely wild in the summer holidays  christmas was spent with the judges mother at ipswich amongst numerous cousins with great merriment and enjoyment such as were never forgotten  colonel coleridge had died in 1836 his widow in her daughters house in 1838 and heaths court had become the property of mr justice coleridge who always came thither with his family as soon as the circuit was over  in 1841 feniton court about two miles and a half from thence was purchased by judge patteson much to the delight of his children  it was a roomy cheerful pleasantlysituated house with a piece of water in the grounds the right of shooting over a couple of farms and all that could render boy life happy  feniton was a thorough home and already coleys vision was when i am vicar of feniton which i look forward to but with a very distant hope i should of all things like fanny to keep house for me till i am married and again when relating some joke with his cousins about the lawpapers of the squire of feniton he adds but the squire of feniton will be a clergyman  whether this were jest or earnest this year 1841 brought the dawn of his future life  it was in that year that the rev george augustus selwyn was appointed to the diocese of new zealand  mrs selwyns parents had always been intimate with the patteson family and the curacy which mr selwyn had held up to this time was at windsor so that the old etonian tie of brotherhood was drawn closer by daily intercourse  indeed it was from the first understood that eton with the wealth that her children enjoyed in such large measure should furnish nerves and sinews to the war which her son was about to wage with the darkness of heathenism thus turning the minds of the boys to something beyond either their studies or their sports  on october 31 the rev samuel wilberforce then archdeacon of surrey and since bishop of oxford and of winchester preached in the morning at new windsor parish church and the newlymade bishop of new zealand in the afternoon  coley was far more affected than he then had power to express  he says i heard archdeacon wilberforce in the morning and the bishop in the evening though i was forced to stand all the time  it was beautiful when he talked of his going out to found a church and then to die neglected and forgotten  all the people burst out crying he was so very much beloved by his parishioners  he spoke of his perils and putting his trust in god and then when he had finished i think i never heard anything like the sensation a kind of feeling that if it had not been on so sacred a spot all would have exclaimed god bless him  the text of this memorable sermon was thine heart shall be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces also of the gentiles shall come unto thee is lx 5  many years later we shall find a reference to this the watchword of the young hearers life  the archdeacons sermon was from john xvii 20 21 neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me  and here again we find one of the watchwords of coleys life for nothing so dwelt with him and so sustained him as the sense of unity whether with these at home in england or with those in the inner home of the saints  when the sermon concluded with the words as we are giving of our best as our church is giving of her best in sending forth from her own bosom these cherished and chosen sons so let there go forth from every one of us a consenting offering let us give this day largely in a spirit of selfsacrifice as christian men to christ our lord and he will graciously accept and bless the offerings that we makethe preacher could little guess that among the lads who stood in the aisle was one in whom was forming the purpose of offering his very self also  for at that time coleridge patteson was receiving impressions that became the seed of his future purpose and the eyes of his spirit were seeing greater things than the vicarage of feniton  indeed the subject was not entirely new to him for edward coleridge was always deeply interested in missions and had done his best to spread the like feeling often employing the willing services of his pupils in copying letters from australia newfoundland c  when the bishop of new zealand came to take leave he said half in earnest half in playfulness lady patteson will you give me coley  she started but did not say no and when independently of this her son told her that it was his greatest wish to go with the bishop she replied that if he kept that wish when he grew up he should have her blessing and consent  but there was no further mention of the subject  the sisters knew what had passed but it was not spoken of to his father till long after when the wish had become purpose  meantime the boys natural development put these visions into the background  he was going on with ordinary work and play enjoying the pageantry of the christening of the prince of wales and cheering himself hoarse and halffrantic when the king of prussia came to see the school then on his fathers birthday writing with a hand quite trembling with delight to announce what he knew would be the most welcome of birthday presents namely the news that he had been sent up for a very good copy of seventynine verses all longs on napoleon e seylhia profugus passage of beresina and so forth  his latin verses were his strong point and from this time forward he was frequently sent up in all twentyfive times an almost unprecedented number  in fact he was entering on a fresh stage of life from the little boy to the lad and the period was marked by his confirmation on may 26 1842  here is his account both of it and of his first communion the soberness and oldfashioned simplicity of expression are worth remarking as tokens of the quietly dutiful tone of mind full of reverence and sincere desire to do right and resting in the consciousness of that desire while steadily advancing towards higher things than he then understood  it was a life and character where advancement with each fresh imparting of spiritual grace can be traced more easily than usual  it is observable too that the boys own earnestness and seriousness of mind seem to have to him supplied the apparent lack of external aids to devotional feeling though the confirmation was conducted in the brief formal wholesale manner which some in afterlife have confessed to have been a disappointment and a drawback after their preparation and anticipation  you will know that i have been confirmed today and i dare say you all thought of me  the ceremony was performed by the bishop of lincoln and i hope that i have truly considered the great duty and responsibility i have taken upon myself and have prayed for strength to support me in the execution of all those duties  i shall of course receive the sacrament the first time i have an opportunity and i trust worthily  i think there must have been 200 confirmed the bishop gave us a very good charge afterwards recommending us all to take pattern by the selfdenial and true devotion of the bishop of new zealand on whom he spoke for a longwhile  the whole ceremony was performed with the greatest decorum and in the retiring and coming up of the different sets there was very little noise and not the slightest confusion  i went up with the first set and the bishop came round and put his hands on the heads of the whole set about forty and then going into the middle pronounced the prayer the responses were all made very audibly and everyone seemed to be impressed with a proper feeling of the holiness and seriousness of the ceremony  after all the boys had been confirmed about seven other people were confirmed of whom two were quite as much as thirty i should think   june 5  i have just returned from receiving the holy sacrament in chapel i received it from hawtrey and okes but there were three other ministers besides  there was a large attendance seventy or eighty or more eton boys alone  i used the little book that mamma sent me and found the little directions and observations very useful  i do truly hope and believe that i received it worthily it struck me more than ever although i had often read it before as being such a particularly impressive and beautiful service  i never saw anything conducted with greater decorum  not a single fellow spoke except at the responses which were well and audibly made and really every fellow seemed to be really impressed with the awfulness of the ceremony and the great wickedness of not piously receiving it i do not know whether there will be another sacrament here before the holidays or whether i shall receive it with you at feniton next time   no doubt the whole family except the yet unconfirmed younger brother did so receive it in the summer holidays the last that were to be spent in the full joy of an unbroken household circle and as has been already said one of unusual warmth and kindliness binding closely into it all who were connected therewith  each governess became a dear friend the servants were deeply attached and for the most part fixtures and one the nurse already mentioned says she never recollects a time when master coley had to leave feniton for london without his offering the servants to take charge of their messages or parcels  all dependents and poor people in fact whatever came under judge pattesons genial broadhearted influence were treated with the like kindness and everything alive about the place seemed full of happiness and affection  the centre of this bright home had always been the mother fervently loved by all who came in contact with her fragile in health and only going through her duties and exertions so cheerily by the quiet fortitude of a brave woman  in the course of this year 1842 some severe spasmodic attacks made her family anxious and as the railway communication was still incomplete so that the journey to london was a great fatigue to an invalid her desire to spend christmas in devonshire led to her remaining there with her daughters when her husband returned to london on the commencement of term  he had been gone little more than a fortnight when on november 17 a more severe attack came on and though she was soon relieved from it she never entirely rallied and was firmly convinced that this was the beginning of the end  her husband was summoned home judge coleridge taking a double portion of his work to set him at liberty and the truth began to dawn on the poor boys at eton  do you really mean that there is anything so very very dreadful to fear is coleys cry in his note one day and the next oh papa you cannot mean that we may never unless we come down to feniton see mamma again  i cannot bear the thought of it  i trust most earnestly that it is not the case  do not hide anything from me it would make me more wretched afterwards  if it shall which i trust in his infinite mercy it will not please almighty god to take our dearest mamma unto himself may he give us grace to bear with fortitude and resolution the dreadful loss and may we learn to live with such holiness here that we may hereafter be united for ever in heaven  this letter is marked twice over only for papa but the precaution was needless for lady patteson was accustoming all those about her to speak freely and naturally of what she felt to be approaching  her eldest brother dr coleridge was greatly comforting her by his ministrations and her sons were sent for but as she did not ask for them it was thought best that they should remain at their uncle franks at ottery until on the evening of sunday the 27th a great change took place making it evident that the end was drawing near  the sufferer was told that the boys were come and was asked if she would see them  she was delighted and they came in restraining their grief while she kissed and blessed them and then throwing her arms round their father thanked him for having brought her darling boys for her to see once more  it was not long before she became unconscious and though all the family were watching and praying round her she showed no further sign of recognition as she gradually and tranquilly fell asleep in the course of the night  to his cousin mrs martyn coley wrote the following letter just after the funeral  we only came down from our rooms to go to church and directly the beautiful service was over we went upstairs again  i need not tell you what we then felt and now do feel  it is a very dreadful loss to us all but we have been taught by that dear mother who has been now taken from us that it is not fit to grieve for those who die in the lord for they rest from their labours  she is now we may safely trust a blessed saint in heaven far removed from all cares and anxieties and instead of spending our time in useless tears and wicked repinings we should rather learn to imitate her example and virtues that when we die we may sleep in him as our hope is this our sister doth and may be finally united with her in heaven yesterday was a day of great trial to us all i felt when i was standing by the grave as if i must have burst  dear papa bears up beautifully and is a pattern of submission to us all  we are much more happy than you could suppose for thank god we are certain she is happy far happier than she could be on earth she said once i wonder i wish to leave my dearest john and the children and this sweet place but yet i do wish it so lively was her faith and trust in the merits of her saviour  a deep and permanent impression was left upon the boys mind as will be seen by his frequent references to what he had then witnessed but for the present he was thought to be less depressed than the others and recovered his natural tone of spirits sooner than his brother and sisters  the whole family spent their mournful christmas at thorverton rectory with dr and mrs coleridge and their daughter fanny their chief comforters and fellowsufferers and then returned to london  the judges eldest daughter joanna who had always been entirely one with the rest had to take her place at the head of the household  in her own words it was trying for a lad of fifteen and a half but he was very good and allowed me to take the command in a way that few boys would nave done  it has struck me as remarkable that friends and relations have again and again spoken of different incidents as turningpoints in coleys life  if he had literally turned at them all his would have been a most revolving career but i believe the fact to have been that he never turned at all for his face was always set the right way but that each of these was a point of impulse setting him more vigorously on his way and stirring up his faithful will  such moments were those of admission to religious ordinances to him no dead letters but true receptions of grace and he likewise found incitements in sorrows in failures in reproofs  everything sank deeply and his mind was already assuming the introspective character that it had throughout the period of growth and formation  one of his eton companions four years younger has since spoken of the remarkable impression of inwardness patteson made on him even at this time saying that whenever he was taken by surprise he seemed to be only ruminating till he spoke or was spoken to and then there was an instant return to the outer world and ready attention to whatever was in hand  the spring found him of course in the full tide of eton interests the sixth and upper fifth forms to the latter of which he had by this time attained may contend in the public examination for the newcastle scholarship just before the easter holidays and it is a great testimony to a boys ability and industry if his name appears among the nine select for their excellence  this time 1843 coley who was scarcely sixteen had of course but little chance but he had the pleasure of announcing that his great friend edmund bastard a young devonshire squire was among the select and he says of himself you will as i said before feel satisfied that i did my best but it was an unlucky examination for me  it has done me a great deal of good in one way  it has enabled me to see where i am particularly deficient viz general knowledge of history and a thorough acquaintance with greek and roman customs law courts and expressions and greek and roman writers  i do not find myself wanting in making out a stiff bit of greek or latin if i have time but i must read history chiefly this year and then i hope to be selected next time  my tutor is not at all disappointed in me  this spring 1843 patteson became one of the eleven a perilously engrossing position for one who though never slurring nor neglecting his studies did not enjoy anything so much as the cricketfield however there the weight of his character backed by his popularity and proficiency in all games and exercises began to be a telling influence  on november 2 1843 when the anniversary of his mothers death was coming round he writes to his eldest sister   i had not indeed forgotten this time twelvemonth and especially that awful sunday night when we stood round dear mammas bed in such misery  i never supposed at that time that we could ever be happy and merry again but yet it has been so with me and though very often the recollection of that night has come upon me and the whole scene in its misery has passed before me i hope i have never forgotten that though a loss to us it was a gain to her and we ought rather to be thankful than sorrowful by the bye i do not really want a bookcase much and you gave me the irish stories and i have not yet been sent up  i would rather not have a present unless the doctor means to give me an exercise  do not lay this down to pride but you know i was not sent up last half and if this passes a blank again i do not deserve any fresh presents   this piece of selfdiscipline was crowned by joyous notices of being sent up for good and for play in the next half when also occurs a letter showing a spirit of submission to a restriction not fully understood   tuesday evening  my dearest fatherhearing that israel in egypt was to be performed at exeter hall on friday night i went and asked my tutor whether he had any objection to my running up that night to hear it and coming back the next morning quite early at six  my tutor said that without any absurd feelings on the matter he should not think himself of going to such a thing in lent  it was not he said certainly like going to the play or any of those sort of places but he did not like the idea of going at all  do you think that there was any harm in the wish  i do not ask because i wish you to write and say i may go but because i wish to learn whether my asking at all was wrong  even if you have no objection i certainly shall not go because for such a trifling thing to act in opposition to my tutor even with your consent would be very foolish  goodbye my dearest father  god bless you says your affectionate and dutiful son  j c p   this year 1844 the name of patteson appeared among the select i shall expect a jolly holiday for my reward he merrily says when announcing it to his sisters  he had begun to join the debating society at eton and for a while was the president  one of the other members says his speeches were singularly free from the bombast and incongruous matter with which eton orators from fifteen to eighteen are apt to interlard their declamations  he spoke concisely always to the point and with great fluency and readiness  a reputation for good sense and judgment made his authority of great weight in the school and his independent spirit led him to choose amongst his most intimate friends and associates two collegers who ultimately became newcastle scholars and medallists  that the most popular oppidan of his day should have utterly ignored the supposed inferiority of the less wealthy section of the school and looked on worth and high character as none the worse for being clothed in a coarse serge gown is a fact seemingly trivial to ordinary readers but very noticeable to eton men  as a rank and file collegian myself and well remembering the jew and samaritan state that prevailed between oppidans and collegers i remember with pride that patteson did so much to level the distinctions that worked so mischievously to the school  his cheerfulness and goodness were the surest guarantee for good order amongst his schoolfellows  there was no puritanism in him he was up to any fun sung his song at a cricket or football dinner as joyfully as the youngest of the party but if mirth sank into coarseness and ribaldry that instant pattesons conduct was fearless and uncompromising  here follows an account of an incident which occurred at the dinner annually given by the eleven of cricket and the eight of the boats at the hotel at slough  a custom had arisen among some of the boys of singing offensive songs on these occasions and coley who as second of the eleven stood in the position of one of the entertainers gave notice beforehand that he was not going to tolerate anything of the sort  one of the boys however began to sing something objectionable  coley called out if that does not stop i shall leave the room and as no notice was taken he actually went away with a few other brave lads  he afterwards found that as he said fellows who could not understand such feelings thought him affected and he felt himself obliged to send word to the captain that unless an apology was made he should leave the elevenno small sacrifice considering what cricket was to him but the gentlemanlike and proper feeling of the better style of boys prevailed and the eleven knew their own interests too well to part with him so the apology was made and he retained his position the affair came to the knowledge of two of the masters mr dupuis and mr abraham and they gratified their warm sense of approbation by giving patteson a bat though he never knew the reason why as we shall see in one of his last letters to one of the donors  his prowess at cricket must be described in the words of his cousin arthur duke coleridge who was at this time in college he was by common consent one of the best if not the best of the cricketers of the school  the second year of his appearance at lords cricket ground was the most memorable as far as his actual services were concerned of all the matches he played against harrow and winchester  he was sent in first in the harrow match the bowling was steady and straight but pattesons defence was admirable  he scored fifty runs in which there was but one four and by steady play completely broke the neck of the bowling eton won the  match easily patteson making a brilliant catch at point when the last harrow man retired full of  confidence eton began the winchester match  victory for a long time seemed a certainty for eton but kidding the winchester captain played an uphill game so fiercely that the bowling had to be repeatedly changed  our eleven were disorganised and the captain had so plainly lost heart that patteson resolved on urging him to discontinue his change of bowling and begin afresh with the regular bowlers  the captain allowed patteson to have his way and the game though closely contested was saved  his powers of defence were indeed remarkable  i saw the famous professional cricketer lillywhite play once at eton in his time and becoming almost irritated at the stubbornness and tenacity with which coley held his wicket  after scoring twenty and odd times in the first and forty in the second innings not out lillywhite said mr patteson i should like to bowl to you on lords ground and it would be different  oh of course modestly answered coley i know you would have me out directly there  the next cricket season this champion was disabled by a severe sprain of the wrist needing leeches splints and london advice  it was when fixing a day for coming up to town on this account that he mentioned the occurrence of the previous year in a letter to his father  i have a great object in shirking the oppidan dinner  i not only hate the idea of paying a sovereign for a dinner but last year at the cricket dinner i had a great row which i might possibly incur another time and i wish very much to avoid  then after briefly stating what had passed he adds at this dinner where the captain of the boats manages it i should be his guest and therefore any similar act of mine would make matters worse  you can therefore see why i wish tuesday to be the day for my coming up  the sprain prevented his playing in the matches at lords that summer though he was well enough to be reckoned on as a substitute in case any of the actual players had been disabled  possibly his accident was good for his studies for this was a year of much progress and success and though only seventeen he had two offers of tutorship for the holidays from mr dugdale and the marchioness of bath  the question where his university life was to be spent began to come forward  studentships at christchurch were then in the gift of the canons and a nomination would have been given him by dr pusey if he had not been too young to begin to reside so that it was thought better that he should wait and go up for the balliol scholarship in the autumn  in the october of 1844 he describes to his eldest sister the reception of king louis philippe at eton accompanied by the queen prince albert and the duke of wellington  the king wore a white great coat and looked a regular jolly old fellow  he has white frizzle hair and large white whiskers  the former i suspect is a wig  the cheering was tremendous but behind the royal carriage the cheers were always redoubled where the old duke the especial favourite hero rode  when they got off their horses in the schoolyard the duke being by some mistake behindhand was regularly hustled in the crowd with no attendant near him  i was the first to perceive him and springing forward pushed back the fellows on each side who did not know whom they were tumbling against and taking off my hat cheered with might and main  the crowd hearing the cheer turned round and then there was the most glorious sight i ever saw  the whole school encircled the duke who stood entirely alone in the middle for a minute or two and i rather think we did cheer him  at last giving about one touch to his hat he began to move on saying get on boys get on  i never saw such enthusiasm here the masters rushed into the crowd round him waving their caps and shouting like any of us  as for myself i was halfmad and roared myself hoarse in about five minutes  the king and prince kept their hats off the whole time incessantly bowing and the king speaking  he walked arminarm with the queen who looked well and very much pleased  the duke walked with that grand duchess whose name you may see in the papers for i cant spell it  very characteristic this both of etons enthusiasm for the hero and of the heros undemonstrative way of receiving it which must have somewhat surprised his foreign companions  a week or two later in november 1844 came the competition for the balliol scholarship but coley was not successful  on the saturday he writes  the scholarship was decided last night smith a rugby man got the first and grant a harrow man the second i saw the master afterwards he said i cannot congratulate you on success mr patteson but you have done yourself great credit and passed a very respectable examination  i shall be happy to allow you to enter without a future examination as we are all quite satisfied of your competency  he said that i had better come up to matriculate next term but should not have another examination  we were in about nine hours a day three hours in the evening i thought the papers very hard we had no latin elegiacs or lyrics which was rather a bore for the eton lot  i am very glad i have been up now but i confess it was the longest week i ever recollect  i feel quite seedy after a whole week without exercise the very first paper the latin essay for which we were in six hours was the worst of all my papers and must have given the examiners an unfavourable impression to start with  the rest of my papers with the exception of the greek prose and the critical paper i did very fairly i think  a greater disappointment than this was however in store for coley he failed in attaining a place among the select at his last examination for the newcastle in the spring of 1845  before the list was given out he had written to his father that the divinity papers were far too easy with no opportunity for a pretty good scholar to show his knowledge the ridicule of every one of the masters but the other papers very difficult  altogether he adds the scholarship has been to me unsatis factory  i had worked hard at greek prose had translated and re translated a good deal of xenophon plato and some demosthenes yet to my disappointment we had no paper of greek prose a thing that i believe never occurred before and which is generally believed to test a boys knowledge well  my iambics were good i expect though not without two bad faults  in fact i cannot look back upon a single paper except my latin prose without a multitude of oversights and faults presenting themselves to me i almost dread the giving out of the select  think if my name was not there  it is some consolation that hawtrey yesterday in giving me an exercise for good asked how i liked the examination upon my saying it was not such a one as i expected and that i had done badly he said that is not at all what i hear but this cannot go for much i want exercise very badly and my head is very thick and stupid as i fear this last paper must show the examiners  the omission of pattesons name from among the select was a great mortification not only to himself but his father though the judge kindly wrote  do not distress yourself about this unfortunate failure as to the newcastle  we cannot always command our best exertions when we want to do so and you were not able on this occasion to bring forward all you knew  it was not from idleness or want of attention to school business  work on regularly and you will do well at oxford  i have a line from your tutor who seems to think that it was in juvenal cicero and livy and in iambics that the faults principally were  i cannot say that i am not disappointed but i know so well the uncertainty of examinations and how much depends on the sort of papers put and on the spirits and feeling one is in that i am never surprised at such results and i do not blame you at all  those who knew coley best agree in thinking that this reverse took great effect in rousing his energies  this failure evidently made him take himself to task for in the summer he writes to his father  there are things which have occurred during my stay at eton which cannot but make me blame myself  i mean principally a want of continuous industry  i have perhaps for one half or two for instance last easter half worked hard but i have not been continuously improving and adding knowledge to knowledge half by half  i feel it now because i am sure that i know very little more than i did at easter  one thing i am improved in which is writing themes and you will be pleased to know that hawtrey has again given me the school theme prize worth 5l which counts for another sent up exercise  in reply the judge on july 22 wrote in the midst of the circuit from stafford a letter that might well do a sons heart good  i rejoice in your finale and shall be glad to see the exercise you have gone through eton with great credit and reputation as a scholar and what is of more consequence with perfect character as to truth and conduct in every way  this can only be accounted for by the assistance of the good spirit of god first stirred up in you by the instructions of your clear mother than whom a more excellent human being never existed  i pray god that this assistance may continue through life and keep you always in the same good course  a few days more and the boys departure from the enthusiastically loved school had taken place together with his final exploits as captain in the cricketfield where too he formed an acquaintance with mr c s roundell the captain of the harrow eleven which ripened into a lifelong friendship  you may suppose writes coley that i was really very miserable at leaving eton  i did not i assure you without thanking god for the many advantages i have there enjoyed and praying for his forgiveness for my sin in neglecting so many  we began our match with harrow yesterday by going in first we got 261 runs by tremendous hitting harrow 32 and followed up and got 55 eton thus winning in one innings by 176 runs the most decided beating ever known at cricket  so ended coleridge pattesons school life not reaching to all he saw that it might have been but unstained noble happy honourable and full of excellent training for the future man  no sting was left to poison the failmemory of youth but many a friendship had been formed on foundations of esteem sympathy and kindness which endured through life standing all tests of separation and difference     chapter iii  undergraduate life at balliol and journeys on the continent  18451852    university life is apt to exert a strong influence upon a mans career  it comes at the age at which there is probably the most susceptibility to new impressions  the physical growth is over and the almost exclusive craving for exercise and sport is lessening there is more voluntary inclination to intellectual application and the mind begins to get fair play  there is also a certain liberty of choice as to the course to be taken and the persons who shall become guides and this renders the pupilage a more willing and congenial connection than that of the schoolboy nor is there so wide a distance in age and habits between tutor and pupil as between master and scholar  thus it is that there are few more influential persons in the country than leading university men for the impress they leave is on the flower of english youth at the very time of life when thought has come but action is not yet required at the same time the whole genius loti the venerable buildings with their traditions the eminence secured by intellect and industry the pride that is taken in the past and its great men first as belonging to the university and next to the individual college all give the members thereof a sense of a dignity to keep up and of honour to maintain and a certainty of appreciation and fellowfeeling from the society with which they are connected  the oxford of pattesons day was yet untouched by the hand of reformation  the colleges were following or eluding the statutes of their founders according to the use that had sprung up but there had been a great quickening into activity of intellect and the religious influences were almost at their strongest  it was true that the master mind had been lost to the church of england but the men whom he and his companions had helped to form were the leaders among the tutors and the youths who were growing up under them were forming plans of life which many have nobly carried out of unselfish duty and devotion in their several stations  balliol had under the mastership of dr jenkyns attained pre eminence for success in the schools and for the high standard required of its members who formed the most delightful society the very focus of the most stimulating life of the university within those unpretending walls not yet revivified and enlarged  here coleridge patteson came to reside in the michaelmas term of 1845 beginning with another attempt for the scholarship in which he was again unsuccessful being bracketed immediately after the fourth with another etonian namely mr hornby the future headmaster his friend edmund bastard several of his relations and numerous friends had preceded him and he wrote to his sister fanny  you cannot think what a nice set of acquaintance i am gradually slipping into  palmer and myself take regular familiar walks and riddell another fellow who is the pet of the college came up the other evening and sat with me and i breakfast with them and dine c  the only inconvenience attaching itself to such a number of men is that i have to give several parties and as i meant to get them over before lent i have been coining out rather strong in that line lately as the pastrycooks bill for desserts will show in good time  i have been asked to play cricket in the university eleven and have declined though not without a little struggle but cricket here especially to play in such matches as against cambridge c entails almost necessarily idleness and expense  the struggle was hardly a little one to a youth whose fame in the cricket field stood so high and who was never happy or healthy without strong bodily exercise  nor had he outgrown his taste for this particular sport  professor edwin palmer alluded to above describes him as at this time a thorough public schoolboy with a full capacity for enjoying undergraduate society and undergraduate amusements though with so fond a recollection of eton that to some of us he hardly seemed to appreciate oxford sufficiently  again mr roundell his late adversary at lords says he was a reluctant and halfinterested sojourner was ever looking back to the playingfields of eton or forward to the more congenial sphere of a country parish  so it was his prime pleasure and glory that he thus denied himself though not with total abstinence for he played occasionally  i remember hearing of a match at ottery where he was one of an eleven of coleridge kith and kin against the rest of devon his reputation in the field was such that many years later when he chanced to be at melbourne at the same time with the champion english eleven one of the most noted professional cricketers meeting him in the street addressed him confidentially i know sir the bishop of melbourne does not approve of cricket for clergymen in public but if you would meet me in private at five oclock tomorrow morning and let me give you a few balls it would be a great satisfaction  some resolution thus was required to prevent cricket from becoming a tyrant as so often befalls those whose skill renders them valuable tennis became coleys chief recreation enabling him to work off his superfluous energy at the expense of far less time than cricket matches require and in this as in everything active he soon excelled  as to the desserts upon which the young men in turn were spending a good deal out of mere custom harmlessly enough but unnecessarily as soon as the distress of the potato famine in ireland became known patteson said i am not at all for giving up these pleasant meetings but why not give up the dessert  so the agreement was made that the cost should for the present be made over to the irish fund  another friend of this period now well known as principal shairp of st andrews was then in the last year of a five years residence he has been kind enough to favour me with the following effective sketch of coley as an undergraduate  patteson as he was at oxford comes back to me as the representative of the very best kind of etonian with much good that he had got from eton with something better not to be got at eton or any other school  he had those pleasant manners and that perfect ease in dealing with men and with the world which are the inheritance of eton without the least tincture of worldliness  i remember well the look he then had his countenance massive for one so young with good sense and good feeling in fact full of character  for it was character more than special ability which marked him out from others and made him wherever he was whether in cricket in which he excelled or in graver things a centre round which others gathered the impression he left on me was of quiet gentle strength and entire purity a heart that loved all things true and honest and pure and that would always be found on the side of these  we did not know probably he did not know himself the fire of devotion that lay within him but that was soon to kindle and make him what he afterwards became  in truth he was taking deep interest in the religious movement though in the quiet unexcited way of those to whom such doctrines were only the filling out of the teachings of their childhood  he was present at that sermon on the entire absolution of the penitent with which on the fourth sunday after epiphany 1846 dr pusey broke his enforced silence of three years  the same evening coley wrote to his sister fanny  i have just returned from university sermon where i have been listening with great delight to puseys sermon on the keys for nearly two hours  his immense benevolence beams through the extreme power of his arguments and the great research of his inquiry into all the primitive writings is a most extraordinary matter and as for the humility and prayerful spirit in which it was composed you fancied he must have been on his knees the whole time he was writing it  i went early to christ church where it was preached and after pushing through such a crowd as usually blocks up the entrance into exeter hall i found on getting into the cathedral that every seat was occupied  however standing to hear such a man was no great exertion and i never was so interested before  it will probably be printed so that you will have no occasion for any remarks of mine it is sufficient that he preached the doctrine to my mind in an invincible manner  the letter has a postscripteaster vacation will be from three weeks to a month  hurrah say i now a precious deal more glad am i to leave oxford for the holidays than eton though feniton is better than either  even in the last undergraduate year the preference for eton remained as strong as ever  coley intended to remain at oxford to read for honours through great part of the long vacation and after refreshing himself with a run to eton he wrote  now for a very disagreeable contrast but still i shall find great interest in my work as i go on and reading books for the second or third time is light work compared to the first stodge at them  i am however behindhand with my work in spite of not having wasted much time here i really dont see my way through the mass of work before me and half repent having to go up for class  i went to the opera on tuesday but was too much taken up by eton to rave about it though grisis singing and acting were out and out but in sober earnest i think if one was to look out simply for ones own selfish pleasure in this world staying at eton in the summer is paradise  i certainly have not been more happy if so happy for years and they need no convincing there of my doting attachment to the place  i go down to eton on election saturday and sunday for my last enjoyment of it this year but if i am well and nourishing in the summer of 1849 and all goes right with me it is one of the jolliest prospects of my emancipation from the schools to think of a month at eton  oh its hard work reading for it i can tell you  thus coley pattesons work throughout his undergraduate three years was so to speak against the grain though it was more diligent and determined than it had been at eton  he viewed this as the least satisfactory period of his life and probably it was that in which he was doing the most violence to his likings  it struck those who had known him at eton that he had shaken off the easygoing comfortable halfsluggish habit of mind attributed to him there and to be earnestly preparing for the future work of life  his continued interest in missions was shown by his assisting to collect subscriptions for the society for the propagation of the gospel  in fact his charm of manner and his way of taking for granted that people meant to do what they ought made him a good collector and he had had a good deal of practice at eton in keeping up the boys to the subscription for the stained glass of the east window of the chapel which they had undertaken to give  that long vacation of study was a great effort and he felt it tedious and irksome all the more from a weakness that affected his eyelids and though it did not injure his sight often rendered reading and writing painful  slight ailments concurred with other troubles and vexations to depress his spirits and besides these outward matters he seems to have had a sense of not coming up to his ideal  his standard was pitched higher than that of most men his nature was prone to introspection and his constitutional inertness rendered it so difficult for him to live up to his own views that he was continually dissatisfied with himself and this in spite of his sweet unselfish temper gave his manner at home an irritability and among strangers a reservethe very reverse of the joyous merry nature which used to delight in balls parties and gaieties  though an ardent friend he became disinclined to enter into general society nor was the distaste ever entirely overcome though he never failed to please by the charm alike of natural manner and of christian courtesy the same spirit of gentleness and kindness very soon prevailed in subduing even in family life any manifestation of the tender points of a growing character  in the autumn of 1849 he obtained a second class in the school of literae humaniores a place that fairly represented his abilities as compared with those of others  when the compulsory period of study was at an end his affection for oxford and enjoyment of all that it afforded increased considerably though he never seems to have loved the university quite as well as eton  as he intended to take holy orders he did not give up his residence there but his first use of his leisure was to take a journey on the continent with his brother and mr hornby  it was then that as he afterwards wrote his real education began partly from the opening of his mind by the wonders of nature and art and partly from the development of his genius for philology  aptitude for language had already shown itself when his sister fanny had given him some german lessons and even on his first halt at cologne he received the compliment sie sprechen deutsch wohl and he found himself talking to a german on one side and a frenchman on the other  his letters throughout his foreign travels are more copious than ever but are chiefly minute descriptions of what he saw such as would weary the reader who does not want a guidebook even full of individuality  yet they cannot be passed by without noticing how he fulfilled the duty of study and endeavour at appreciation which everyone owes to great works of art instead of turning aside with shallow conceit if he do not enter into them at first sight  after the wonders of vienna and the mines of salzburg the mountain scenery of the tyrol was an unspeakable pleasure which tries to express itself in many closely written pages crossing into italy by the stelvio pass a sharp but passing fit of illness detained coley at como for a day and caused him to call in an italian doctor who treated him on the starvation system administered no medicines and would take no fee  the next day coley was in condition to go on to milan where his first impression of the cathedral was as so often happens almost of bewilderment  he did not at first like the lombardogothic style but he studied it carefully and filled his letter with measurements and numbers though confessing that no part pleased him so much as the pinnacles terminating in statues each one a very beautiful martyrs memorial  two more visits of several hours however brought the untutored eye to a sense of the harmony of proportion and the surpassing beauty of the carvings and sculpture  it did not need so much study to enjoy lionardo da vincis great fresco of which he wrote long and elaborately and altogether milan afforded him very great delight and was a new world to him  it was the farthest limit of his travels on this occasion  the party returned by way of geneva and coley alone with four guides attempted the col du geant  then following is his account of the danger in which he found himself  on monday at 415 am we started from the montanvert with our alpenstocks plenty of ropes and a hatchet to cut steps in the ice we walked quickly over the mer de glace and in about three hours came to the difficult part  i had no conception of what it would be we had to ascend perpendicular walls of ice 30 40 50 feet high by little holes which we cut with the hatchet and to climb over places not a foot broad with enormous crevasses on each side  i was determined not to give in and said not a word but i thought that no one had a right to expose himself to such danger if known beforehand after about three hours spent in this way during which i made but one slip when i slid about twelve feet down a crevasse but providentially did not lose my head and saved myself by catching at a broken ridge of ice rising up in the crevasse round which i threw my leg and worked my way up it astride got to the region of snow and here the danger was of falling into hidden crevasses  we all five fastened ourselves to one another with ropes  i went in the middle couttet in front then payot  most unluckily the weather began to cloud over and soon a sharp hailstorm began with every indication of a fog  we went very cautiously over the snow for about three hours sinking every now and then up to our middles but only once in a crevasse when couttet suddenly fell singing out tirez tirez but he was pulled out instantly  we had now reached the top but the fog was so dense that i could scarcely see 30 feet before me and the crevasses and mountains of snow looming close round us looked awful  at this moment the guides asked me if i must make the passage  i said instantly that i wanted to do so but that i would sooner return at once than endanger the lives of any of them  they told me there was certainly great danger they had lost their way but were unwilling to give up  for an hour and a half we beat about in the fog among the crevasses trying every way to find the pass which is very narrow wet to the skin and in constant peril but we knew that the descent on the chamouni side is far more difficult than that on the courmayeur side  at last all the guides agreed that it was impossible to find the way said the storm was increasing and that our only chance was to return at once  so we did but the fearful difficulties of the descent i shall never forget  even in the finest weather they reckon it very difficult but yesterday we could not see the way we were numbed with intense cold and dispirited from being forced to return  in many places the hail and sleet had washed out the traces we trusted as guides  after about four hours we had passed the most dangerous part and in another hour we were safely upon the mer de glace which we hailed with delight couttet who reached the point of safety first jumping on the firm ice and shouting to me il ny a plus de danger monsieur  here we took off the ropes and drank some more brandy and then went as hard as we could jumping across crevasses which two days before i should have thought awkward as if they were cart ruts  we reached chamouni at 830 pm having been sixteen and a quarter hours without resting  i was not at all tired the guides thanked me for having given so little trouble and declared i had gone as well as themselves  indeed i was providentially unusually clearheaded and cool and it was not till the danger was over that i felt my nerves give way  there was a good deal of anxiety about us at chamouni as it was one of the worst days ever seen here  hornby had taken all my clothes to geneva so i put on a suit of the landlords and had some tea and at 11 pm went to bed not forgetting you may be sure to thank god most fervently for this merciful protection as on the ice i did many times with all my heart  on reviewing coolly today the places over which we passed and which i shall never forget i remember seven such as i trust never again to see a man attempt to climb  the state of the ice and crevasses is always shifting so that the next person who makes the ascent may find a comparatively easy path  we had other dangers too such as this twice the guides said to me ne parlez pas ici monsieur et allez vite the fear being of an ice avalanche falling on us and we heard the rocks and ice which are detached by the wet falling all about  the view from the top if the day is fine is about the most magnificent in the alps and as in that case i should have descended easily on the other side the excursion would not have been so difficult  i hope you will not think i have been very foolish i did not at all think it would be so dangerous nor was it possible to foresee the bad weather  my curiosity to see some of the difficulties of an excursion in the alps is fully satisfied  after this adventure the party broke up james patteson returning home with mr hornby while coley who hoped to obtain a fellowship at merton and wished in the meantime to learn german thoroughly in order to study hebrew by the light of german scholarship repaired to dresden for the purpose revelling by the way on the pictures and glass at munich descriptions of which fill three or four letters he remained a month at dresden reading for an hour a day with a german master and spending many hours besides in study recreating himself with german newspapers at the cafe where he dined and going to the play in the evening to hear colloquialisms  the picture galleries were his daily enjoyment and he declared the madonna di san sisto fully equal to his anticipations  there is that about the head of the virgin which i believe one sees in no other picture a dignity and beauty with a mixture of timidity quite indescribable  returning home for christmas coley started again in january 1851 in charge of a pupil the son of lord john thynne with whom he was to go through italy  the journey was made by sea from marseilles to naples where the old regime was still in force  shakespeare and humboldt were seized and after several hours detention on the score of the suspicious nature of his literature mr patteson was asked for a bribe  the climate was in itself a great charm to one always painfully susceptible to cold and after duly dwelling on the marvels of vesuvius and pompeii the travellers went on to rome  there the sculptures were coleys first delight and he had the advantage of hints from gibson on the theory of his admiration such as suited his love of analysis  he poured forth descriptions of statues and pictures in his letters sometimes apologisingyou must put up with a very stupid and unintelligible sermon on art  the genius loci would move the very stones to preach on such a theme  again the worst is that i ought to have months instead of days to see rome in i economise my time pretty well but yet i find every night that i can only do a little of what i propose in the morning and as for my italian an hour and a half a day is on an average more than i give to it  i suffer a good deal from weakness in the eyes it prevents my working at night with comfort  i have a master every other day i tried to draw but it hurt me so much after looking about all day that i despair of doing anything though i dont abandon the idea altogether  there are many letters on the religious state of rome  the apparently direct supplications to the saints the stories told in sermons of desperate sinnerssaved through some lingering observance paid to the blessed virgin and the alleged abuse of the confessional shocked patteson greatly and therewith he connected the flagrant evils of the political condition of rome at that time and arrived at conclusions strongly adverse to roman catholicism as such though he retained uninjured the catholic tone of his mind  it was art which was the special attraction to coley of all the many spells of old rome  he spent much time in the galleries and studied modern painters with an earnestness that makes ruskinism pervade his letters  at florence coley wrote as usual at much length of the galleries where the madonna del cardellino seems to have been what delighted him most  he did not greatly enter into michel angelos works and perhaps hardly did their religious spirit full justice under the somewhat exclusive influence of fra angelico and francia with the euskinese interpretation  the delight was indescribable  he says but i have written again and again on this favourite theme and i forget that it is difficult for you to understand what i write or the great change that has taken place in me without seeing the original works  no one can see them and be unchanged  i never had such enjoyment  his birthday presents were spent on a copy of the beloved madonna del cardellino of which he saysthough it does not reach anything like the intensity of feeling of the original is still a very excellent painting and will always help to excite in my imagination and i hope to convey to you some faint image of the exceeding beauty of this most beautiful of all paintings  readers chiefly interested in the subsequent career of the missionary would feel interrupted by the overflowing notes on painting sculpture and architecture which fill the correspondence yet without them it is scarcely possible to realise the young mans intense enthusiasm for the beautiful especially for spiritual beauty and thus how great was the sacrifice of going to regions where all these delights were unknown and unattainable  he went on to venice where he met a letter which gave a new course to his thoughts for it informed him that the deafness which had long been growing on his father had now become an obstacle to the performance of his duties as a judge and announcing his intention of retiring  in the fulness of his heart he wrote   venice hotel de la villa may 2 1851  my dearest fatheri have not been in venice an hour yet but little did i expect to find such news waiting for me as is contained in jems letter and i can lose no time in answering it  it is indeed a heavy trial for you that in addition to many years of constant annoyance from your deafness you should be obliged now in the full vigour of your mind and with the advantage of your experience to give up a profession you so thoroughly delight in  i dont deny that i have often contemplated the possibility of such a thing and i had some conversation with uncle john last winter in consequence of my fancying your deafness was on the increase though the girls did not perceive it i hope with all my heart i was wrong i told him what i know you feel that painful as it will be to you to retire from the bench if any dissatisfaction was expressed at your not hearing sufficiently what passed you would choose rather to give up your seat than to go on under such circumstances  his answer i remember was that it was most difficult to know what to do because it was no use concealing the fact that your infirmity did interfere with the working of the court more or less on circuit especially and at other times when witnesses were examined but that your knowledge of law was so invaluable that it was difficult to see how this latter advantage could fail to outweigh the former defect and everybody knew that they cant find a lawyer to fill your place though another man might do the ordinary circuit work with greater comfort to the bar though therefore nobody is so painstaking and so little liable to make mistakes yet to people in general and in the whole another man would seem to do the work nearly as well and would do his work as far as his knowledge and conscientiousness went with more easethis was something like the substance of what passed then and you may suppose that since that time i have thought more about the possibility of your retirement but as i know how very much you will feel giving up an occupation in which you take a regular pride i do feel very sorry and wish i was at home to do anything that could be done now i know well enough that you are the last man in the world to make a display of your feelings and that you look upon this as a trial and bear it as one just as you have with such great patience and submission and dear joan too always quietly borne your deafness but i am sure you must and do feel this very much and added to grannys illness you must be a sad party at home  i feel as if it were very selfish to be in this beautiful city and to have been spending so much money at florence  neither did joan in her last letter nor has jem now mentioned whether you received two letters from florence the first of which gave some description of my vetturino journey from rome to florence  i little thought when i was enjoying myself so very much there that all this was passing at home your influence in the privy council where i conclude they will offer you a seat might be so good on very important questions and it would be an occupation for you and i have always hoped that if it should please god you should retire while still in the prime of life for work you would publish some great legal book which should for ever be a record of your knowledge on these subjects  however it may be the retrospect of upwards of twenty years spent on the bench with the complete respect and admiration of all your friends is no slight thing to fall back upon and i trust that this fresh trial will turn to your good and even happiness here as we may trust with safety it will hereafter  ever your very affectionate and dutiful son  john coleridge patteson   in this winter of 1852 mr justice pattesons final decision to retire was made and acted upon  the judge delighted in no occupation so much as the pursuit of law and therefore distrusted his own opinion as to the moment when his infirmity should absolutely unfit him for sitting in court  he had begged a friend to tell him the moment that the impediment became serious and this with some hesitation was done  the intimation was thankfully received and after due consideration carried out  on january 29 1852 after twentytwo years on the bench and at the age of sixtytwo mr justice patteson wrote his letter of resignation to lord truro then lord chancellor petitioning for the usual pension  it was replied to in terms of warm and sincere regret and on the 2nd of february sir john patteson was nominated to the privy council as a member of the judicial committee where the business was chiefly conducted in writing and he could act with comparatively little obstacle from his deafness  on february 10 1852 he took his leave of the bar  the court of queens bench was crowded with barristers who rose while the attorneygeneral sir alexander cockburn made an address expressive of the universal heartfelt feeling of respect and admiration with which the retiring judge was regarded  john pattesons reply read with a voice broken by emotion is so touching in its manly simplicity and humility that a paragraph or two may well be quoted  mine he said is one of the many instances which i know that a public man without preeminent abilities if he will but exert such as it has pleased god to bestow on him honestly and industriously and without ostentation is sure to receive public approbation fully commensurate with and generally much beyond his real merits and i thank god if i shall be found not to have fallen entirely short in the use of those talents which he has entrusted to me  then after some words on the misfortune that necessitated his withdrawal he continued i am aware that on some and i fear too many occasions i have given way to complaints and impatient expressions towards the bar and the witnesses in court as if they were to blame when in truth it was my own deficiency and heartily sorry have i been and am for such want of control over myself  i have striven against its recurrence earnestly though not always successfully  my brethren on the bench and you and the public have been very kind and indulgent to me the recollection of which will remain with and be a great solace to me for the rest of my life  and now gentlemen i bid you farewell most affectionately  i wish you many years of health and happiness of success and honour in your liberal profession the duties of which have been and are and i trust ever will be performed not only with the greatest zeal learning and ability but with the highest honour and integrity and a deep sense of responsibility to god and to man and which being so performed are in my humble judgment eminently conducive under the blessing of god to maintain the just prerogative of the crown and the true right liberties and happiness of the people  he then rose from the judges seat and bowed his farewell to the assembly who stood respectful and silent except for some suppressed tokens of emotion for in truth to many the parting was from an old familiar and much trusted friend  private letters poured in expressive of deep regret esteem and affection and not only were gratefully read at the time but became to the family valuable memorials of the heartfelt appreciation gained by a highminded and upright course of life and evidences that their father had done that which is perhaps the best thing that it is permitted to man to do here below namely served god in his generation     chapter iv  fellowship of merton 18521854    in the summer of 1852 coleridge patteson stood for a fellowship of merton obtained it and moved into rooms there  every college has a distinctive character and merton if not actually the eldest is at least one of the oldest foundations at oxford and is one of the most unchanged in outward aspect  there is a peculiar charm in the beauty and seclusion of the quadrangle in the library still mediaeval even to the fittings and the church is above all impressive in the extraordinary loveliness of the early decorated architecture and the space and loftiness of the choir  the whole preeminently among the colleges gives the sense of having been unaltered for five hundred years yet still full of life and vigour  coley attached himself to merton though he never looked to permanent residence there  the curacy in the immediate neighbourhood of his home was awaiting him as soon as he should be ordained but though his purpose was unchanged and he was of full age for holy orders he wished for another year of preparation so as to be able to study both hebrew and theology more thoroughly than would be possible when pastoral labour should have begun  what he had already seen of dresden convinced him that he could there learn hebrew more thoroughly and more cheaply than at home and to this he intended to devote the long vacation of 1852 without returning to feniton there the family were settling themselves having given up the house in bedford square since james patteson had chambers in kings bench walk where the exjudge could be with him when needed in london there had some notion of the whole family profiting by sir johns emancipation to take a journey on the continent and the failure of the scheme elicited the following letter   merton june 18  my dearest fani can to a certain extent sympathise with you thoroughly upon this occasion the mere disappointment at not seeing so many interesting places and things is a sharp one but in your instance this is much increased by the real benefit you hoped to derive from a warmer climate and no wonder that the disappearance of your hopes coupled with bodily illness makes you low and uncomfortable  the weather too is trying to mind and body and though you try as usual to shake off the sense of depression which affects you your letter is certainly sad and written like the letter of one in weak health  well we shall see each other please god at christmas now  that is better than passing nearly or quite a year away from each other and some other time i hope you will be able to go to italy and enjoy all the wonders there though a tour for healths sake cannot be too soon  it is never too soon to get rid of an ailment  i find that i am getting to know the undergraduates here which is what i wanted to do it is my only chance of being of any use  true that i have to do it at the expense of two halfdays cricketing which i have quite ceased to care about but i know that when i went up to balliol i was glad when a fellow played with us  it was a guarantee for orderly conduct and as i say it gives me an opportunity of knowing men  i hope to leave london for dresden on monday week arthur is gone thither as i find out from jem and i hope the scheme will answer  if i find i cant work from my eyes or anything else preventing me i shall come home but i have no reason to expect any such thing  my best love to joan and all friends  your loving brother  j c patteson   the arthur here mentioned was the youngest son of mr frank coleridge and became coleys companion at dresden where he was studying german  he writes  patteson spoke german fluently and wrote german correctly  he had studied the language assiduously for about two years previously and so successfully that whilst we were at dresden he was enabled to dispense with a teacher and make his assistance little more than nominal  occasionally he wrote a german exercise but rather as an amusement than a discipline and merely with the view of enlarging his german vocabulary  i remember his writing an elaborate description of feniton court and imagining the place to be surrounded with trees belonging to all sorts of climates  the result was very amusing to ourselves and added to the writers stock of words on particular subjects  when our master schier appeared the conversation was led by a palpable ambuscade to the topic which had been made the subject of pattesons exercise and conversation helped to strengthen memory  after looking over a few of pattesons german exercises mr schier found so little to correct in the way of grammatical errors that these studies were almost relinquished and gave way to arabic and hebrew  before we left dresden patteson had read large portions of the koran and with the aid of hurwitzs grammar and bernhards guide to hebrew students books familiar to cambridge men he was soon able to read the psalms in the original i remember the admiration and despair i felt in witnessing pattesons progress and the wonder expressed by his teacher in his pupils gift of rapid acquirement  we had some excellent introductions amongst others to dr  a famous theologian with whom patteson was fond of discussing the system and organisation of the church in saxony up to the time of his leaving england he was constantly using olshausens commentary on the new testament a book he was as thoroughly versed in as archbishop trench himself  i think that he consulted no other books in his study of the gospels but olshausen and bengels gnomon  in our pleasures at dresden there was a mixture of the utile with the dulce  our constant visits to the theatre were strong incentives to a preparatory study of the plays of goethe schiller and lessing what noble acting we saw in that dresden theatre  with regard to the opera i have never seen weber or meyerbeers works given so perfectly and conscientiously as at dresden pattesons chief delight was the midsummer nights dream with mendelssohns music  he had a tuneful baritone voice and a correct ear for music  we hired a piano for our sittingroom and though i failed to induce him to cultivate his voice and join me in taking lessons he sang some of mendelssohns lieder very pleasingly and knew most of the bass music from the messiah by heart  he began to play a few scales on the piano and hoped to surprise his sisters on his return to england by playing chants but the arabic and hebrew studies proved too absorbing he grudged the time and thought the result disproportioned to the sacrifice  in our daily walks we talked constantly of church matters  some sharp and sad experiences in the loss of more than one of his eton and oxford friends who had abandoned the church of england failed to shake his confidence in the church he was to serve so faithfully and to die for so gloriously  his faith and daily practice seem to me a protest and warning against the folly if not the falsehood of extremes  moderation quiet consistency of life and unswerving loyalty to a faith which had been the joy and comfort of his dear mother whose loveable nature he inherited and reflected a blameless life and unfailing charity enabled him when the time came to live a life of incessant toil and face a martyrs death  i remember the present bishop of carlisle inciting cambridge undergraduates to become by virtue of earnestness gentleness and toleration guides not judges lights not firebrands  he drew a perfect description of patteson who came more completely up to that ideal than anyone i ever knew  here was a man capable of the purest and most tender friendship with an exquisite appreciation of all that is noblest in life and he was ready to give up all and content to lead the forlorn hope of christianity and perish in the front ranks of the noble army  and having been a little tried he shall be greatly rewarded for god proved him and found him worthy for himself   i have given this letter almost entire because it shows the impression coley made on one little his junior in the intimate associations of cousin neighbour and schoolfellow as well as travelling companion  this year seems to have been a marked stage of development  he was now twentyfive and the boyish distaste for mental exertion which had so long rendered study an effort of duty had passed into full scholarly enjoyment  the individuality and originality of his mind had begun to awaken and influenced probably by the german atmosphere of thought in which he was working were giving him that strong metaphysical bent which characterised his tone through life and became apparent in his sermons when he addressed an educated audience  here is a letter to his eldest sister the weather has been better suited for work and i feel pretty well satisfied with my hebrew what makes it so difficult is principally this that as it is an oriental language it is entirely different in structure and in its inflections c from any language i ever came across  i cant fall back upon anything already learnt to help me but i see my way pretty clear now and shall soon have little more than a knowledge of the meaning of the words to learn which is only a matter of patience and can be learnt with a good dictionary and practice  a real complete knowledge of the grammar is of course the great thing  the great dresden fair called the vogelschiesser is going on it began last sunday and ends next sunday  about half a mile from the town there is a very large meadow by the river where a small town of booths tents c is erected and where shooting at targets with wooden darts sham railwaytrains and ridinghorses confectionery of every kind beer of every name strength and colour pipes cigars toys gambling organgrinding fiddling dancing c goes on incessantly  the great attraction however is the shooting at the bird which occupies the attention of every saxon and is looked upon as the consummation of human invention and physical science  a great pole nearly 80 feet high is erected with a wooden bird about the size of a turkey at the top to hit this with a crossbow from a regular stand about 50 feet from the foot of the pole is the highest ambition of this great people  the accompaniments are rich in the extreme cannon firing drums rolling for a successful shot the shooting society who exist only for the sole honour and glory of hacking this bird to pieces the presence of the king  i think to day and the intense interest taken in the amusement by the whole population certainly the germans are satisfied with less than any people i ever saw barring two things smoke and beer in which they are insatiable  i went out to see it all but it rather bored me after an hour or so  tom f and i threw some dice for a pair of braces for arthur which we presented in due form and we had some shots at the targetsmine were eminently unsuccessful  last night we had a great treat  emil devrient who has been acting in london you know came back and acted marquis posa in don carlos the play acts very much better than it reads  schiller certainly has great dramatic genius only i agree with goethe that there is always a longing for exhibiting cruelty in its most monstrous form and refinement of cruelty and depravity overstepping almost the natural conditions of humanity  i always thought iago about the most awful character in shakspeare but schillers philip ii is something beyond even this without perhaps so much necessity for the exhibition of this absolute delight in evil  it is long since i have been so excited in a theatre  i was three rows from the stage heard and understood everything and was so completely carried away by the grandeur and intense feeling of devrient who was well supported by the don carlos that i had some difficulty to keep quiet and feel today rather odd shaken as it were from such a strain upon the feelings  here is a letter enclosed within one to his sister fanny on september 9 written on a scrap of paper  the apologetic tone of confession is amusing  my dearest fatheri have not before told you that i have been at work for just three weeks upon a new subject reading however hebrew every day almost for three hours as well  schier is not a great hebraist and i found the language in one sense easier than i expected so that with good grammar and dictionary i can quite get on by myself reading an easy part of the bible historical books eg at the rate of about twentyfive verses an hour  well i began to think that i ought to use the opportunities that dresden affords  i know that hebrew is not a rich language that many words occur only once and consequently have an arbitrary meaning attached to them unless they can be illustrated from cognate languages  now i have a taste for these things and have in three weeks progressed so far in my new study as to feel sure i shall make it useful and so i tell you without fear i am working at arabic  i hope you wont think it silly  it is very hard and for ten days was as hard work as i ever had in my life  i think i have learnt enough to see my way now and this morning read the first chapter of genesis in threequarters of an hour  it is rich beyond all comparison in inflexions and the difficulty arises from the extreme multiplicity of all its forms eg each verb having not only active middle and passive voices but the primitive active having not less than thirtyfive derivative forms and the passive thirteen  the noun of actioninfinitive with article to akonein of the greekis again different for each voice or form and the primitive can take any of twentytwo forms which are not compounded according to any rule  again there are twentyeight sets of irregular plurals which are quite arbitrary no grammarian has ever given any explanation about them  all mere matters of memory  the very alphabet shows the richness of the language  there are twentynine letters besides vowel points and each letter is written in four different ways so that it is different when isolated when in the beginning middle or end of a word  it took me some hours to learn them  in very many respects it is closely allied to the hebrew so that everybody who writes hebrew grammars and lexicons necessarily has much to do with arabic and a knowledge of it may be of great use in clearing up difficulties in the bible  my year in oxford will enable me to go on with it for in three weeks more i hope to be able to go on alone  tomorrow i begin the koran  my lessons will not in all exceed 31 and i really should have gone on perhaps not much faster with hebrew if i had worked it exclusively and it is hard to read so many hours at one thing and i may say now without doubt that i have laid the foundation for a study of oriental languages if i have time and opportunity that may be fairly given to them  think what one hour a day is and the pleasure to me is very great and i feel that i have a knack rather if i may say so of laying hold of these things dont mention it to anyone  there the fragment breaks off and in a letter of august 29 there occurs this reply to a message from his eldest sister  thank dear joan for her caution i know i need it sadly especially now when i am at work upon somewhat outoftheway subjects and feel the danger of forgetting that if i mistake the means for the end and feel gratified with the mere intellectual amusement i am doing very wrong even when i am working very hard at very difficult matters  i like these things i must confess and the time is so well adapted to work here and now that the weather is cool i can secure every day a good long time to myself  in the enclosed letter he announces that he shall leave dresden in another three weeks  he says  we have had a steady working time of it here and as i know some members of the family rather discourage these continental flights i just sum up the advantages thereof  being naturally endowed with a love of music the probability is that when you clara and miss horsley are together in the house as soon as a lied or sonata began away would go my books or at all events my thoughts  you know well that the piano goes at all hours and always in the morning at home then riding walking with father long sitting after dinner c do not improve the chances for reading  in fact you know that what with visitors from without friends within parties c i should have had very little reading in the vacation and that not through my own faultnot a stilbehen in the house could protect me from music here i make my own time and last week my eyes were troublesome  i walked twice every day exactly at the hour when i most wanted it and without nonsense i may say that i have in two months done really a great deal more than i could have done at home even with masters this all applies to arthur just as much  he has read german exclusively most of the time and knows as well as i do that it is not possible to work at home  if i could go on just as well as with mendelssohn ringing in my ears it would be different but i cant you remember how pleasant but how very idle last vacation was and especially the last six weeks of it  then after much about family matters commissions and little gifts which he was collecting for all at home  i should like to get something for everybody but that is not possible  luckily my lessons are less expensive than i expected and considering the work wonderfully cheap  i make good progress i can say but the difficulty is great enough to discourage any but a real grinder at such work  i have written a scrap for father and you will see that i am working away pretty well  i have finished my introductory book consisting of fortyone fables and though difficulties present themselves always to really good scholars from time to time the bible is not one of the hardest books not so hard eg as the koran  now i can at any future time if the opportunity comes go on with these things and i hope find them really useful i know you like to hear what i am doing but be sure to keep it all quiet let no one know but father and joan  you might carelessly tell it to anyone in fun and i dont wish it to be known especially dont let any of the family know  time enough if i live out my oxford year and have really mastered the matter pretty well remember this is taken up with a view to elucidate and explain what is so very hard in hebrew  hebrew is to be the hauptsache this the hulfsmittel or some day i hope one of several such helps  it is very important to accustom ones mind to the denk and anschauungswerk of the orientals which is so different from that of europeans or their language  how hard are the metaphors of the bible for this reason  there is something in all these long apologies and strenuous desire for secrecy about these arabic studies that reminds one that the character was a selfconscious introspective one always striving for humility and dreading to be thought presumptuous  a simpler nature if devoid of craving for home sympathy would never have mentioned the new study at all or if equally openhearted would have let the mention of it among home friends take its chance without troubling himself as to their possible comments  indeed it is curious to observe how elaborate he was at this period about all his concerns meditating over the cause of whatever affected him  it was a form of growth and dropped off when the time of action arrived and his character had shaped itself  it must be remembered too that his habit of pouring out all his reflections and feelings to his sisters and their preservation of his letters have left much more on record of these personal speculations than is common  his father made a much simpler matter of the arabic matter in the following characteristic letter   feniton court september 14 1852  my dearest coleyso far from thinking you wrong in learning arabic i feel sure that you are quite right  however we shall keep your secret and not say anything about it  i am heartily glad that you should acquire languages modern as well as ancient  you know i have often pressed the former on your and jems notice from myself feeling my deficiency and regret at it  i can well understand that arabic and i should suppose syriac also must be of the greatest use towards a true understanding of much of the old testament a great deal of which is doubtless not understood by those who understand only our translation or even the septuagint which i suspect to have many passages far from a faithful vehicle of the meaning of the original  i was greatly delighted with your theological letter so to speak as well as with the first and look to have some jolly conversations with you on such subjects  we have many more partridges than our neighbours and jem shoots uncommonly well  three double shots yesterday  i shoot worse than usual and cannot walk without much fatigue and frequent pain so that i shall not be able to work enough to get much sport  i got through the mary church affair very wellthat is not making a fool of myselfand if i did not do much good i think i did no harm  the bishop of exeter phillpotts is mightily pleased and wrote me a letter to that effect  of course i cannot tell you what i said it would be too long nor are you likely to see it  it was fully inserted in woolmer and from him copied into the guardian  i live in hopes to see you well and hearty at oxford on the 14th of october till when adieu god bless you  your affectionate father  j patteson   the interview with the bishop of sydney never took place for the excellent bishop broughton arrived with health shattered by his attendance on the sufferers from fever in the ship which brought him from st thomas and he did not long survive his landing  the mary church affair here referred to was the laying the foundationstone of the church built or restored it is hard to say which on the lines of the former one and preserving the old tower at st mary church near torquay  though the death of the rev gr m coleridge had broken one tie with the place it continued to be much beloved by the patteson family and sir john had taken so much share in the churchbuilding work as to be asked to be the layer of the cornerstone  the speech he made at the ensuing luncheon excited much attention and the sisters took care that their brother should not miss reading it  the stay at dresden was drawing to an end and he was preparing to return through berlin intending to go direct to oxford and reside there till the summer when he meant to seek ordination and enter on the curacy at alfington  he says to his sister joanna  it is a long time to pass without seeing you but i hope if it please god that we all live on together that it will be long before such another interval occurs  i have not grown out of an occasional fit of home sickness yet and on these occasions arthur and i talk incessantly about domestic matters and indulge our fancies in conjecturing what you are all doing and so forth  i followed joan and claras trip step by step from the den at teignmouth to st mary church oddiscombe rabbicombe ansteys cave meadfoot c how i remember every inch of the dear old places  better than the mud banks at felixstowe are they not clara  i shall keep always the scrap from the guardian with fathers speech  i dont think i remember any speech on a similar occasion so thoroughly good and so likely to do good  plain sensible and manly no question of words and unimportant differences of opinion no cant high or low just like himself  i pray i may have but a tenth part of his honesty and freedom from prejudice and party spirit  it may come under gods blessing if a mans mind is earnestly set on the truth but the danger is of setting up your own exclusive standard of truth moral and intellectual  father certainly is more free from it than any man we ever knew  he tells me in his letter that the bishop of sydney is coming home to consult people in england about synodical action c and that he is going to meet him and explain to him certain difficulties and mistakes into which he has fallen with regard to administering the oath of abjuration and the like matters  how few people comparatively know the influence father exercises in this way behind the scenes as it were  his intimacy with so many of the bishops too makes his position really of very great importance  i dont want to magnify but the more i think of him and know how very few men they are that command such general respect and bear such a character with all men for uprightness and singleness of purpose it is very difficult to know how his place could be supplied when we throw his legal knowledge over and above into the scale  i hope he will write i am quite certain that his opinion will exercise a great influence on very many people  such a speech as this at mary church embodies exactly the sense of a considerable number of the most prudent and most able men of the country and his position and character give it extra weight and that would be so equally with his book as with his speech  how delightful it will be to have him at oxford  he means to come in time for dinner on the 14th and go away on the 16th but if he likes it he will i daresay stop now and then on his way to town and back  jem will not be back in town when he goes up for the judicial committee work so he will be rather solitary there wont he  i am not however sure about the number of weeks jem must reside to keep his term  the enjoyment of the last few days at dresden was much marred by a heavy cold caught by going to see an admirable representation of egmont the last of these theatrical treats so highly appreciated the journey to berlin before the cold was shaken off resulted in an attack of illness and he was so heavy and uncomfortable as to be unable to avail himself of his opportunities of interesting introductions  he returned to his rooms at merton direct from germany  like many men who have come back to oxford at a riper age than that of undergraduate life he now entered into the higher privileges and enjoyments of the university the studies friendships and influences as early youth sometimes fails to do  he was felt by his oxford friends to have greatly developed since his balliol terms had been over and the eton boy left behind  study was no longer a toil and conscientious effort  it had become a prime pleasure and men wondered to find the plodding accurate but unenthusiastic student of three years back a linguist and philologist of no common power and attainment  mr roundell says he had become quite another person  selfcultivation had done much for him  literature and art had opened his mind and enlarged his interests and sympathies  the moral and spiritual forces of the man were now vivified refined and strengthened by the awakening of his intellectual and esthetic nature  ever reaching forward however he was on his guard against as he said making the means the end  languages were his pleasure but a pleasure held in check as only subservient to his preparation for the ministry  he did not mean to use them to the acquirement of academical honour nor promotion nor did he even rest in the intellectual delight of investigation he intended them only as keys to the better appreciation of the scriptures and of the doctrines of the church unaware as yet that the gift he was cultivating would be of inestimable value in far distant regions  in february while sir john patteson was in london his son james was the cause of much alarm owing to a mistake by which he swallowed an embrocation containing a large amount of laudanum  prompt measures however prevented any ill effects and all danger was over before the letter was sent off which informed coley of what had happened but the bare idea of the peril was a great shock to one of such warm affections and so deeply attached to his only brother  he wrote the two following letters to his father and sisters on the first impulse on the receipt of the intelligence   shrove tuesday  my dearest fatheri believe i speak truly when i say that i never in my life felt so thoroughly thankful and grateful to god for his great mercy as i did this morning on reading of dear jems danger and safety  he is less accustomed to talk about his feelings than i am in which i see his superiority but partly because our tastes are in several respects different chiefly because of his exceeding amiability and unselfishness  i am sure we love each other very dearly  ever since his illness at geneva i have from time to time contemplated the utter blank the real feeling of loss which anything happening to him would bring with it and the having it brought home close to me in this way quite upset me as it well might  i pray god that no ill effects may follow and from what you say i apprehend none  i have often thought that it is much better when two brothers propose to themselves different objects in life and pursue them with tastes dissimilar on unimportant matters  they act better upon one another just as i look to jem as i have more than once told him to give me a hint when he sees a want of common sense in anything i take up because i know i act a good deal from impulse and take an interest in many things which are perhaps not worth the time i spend on them  it is a mercy that i hope i shall never forget never cease to be thankful for  many and many a time if it please god i shall look to him in difficulties and remember how nearly once he was lost to me  i can get away with the greatest ease for a few days on thursday if desirable and perhaps old jem will feel low after this when you have left him  i think this very likely from what i know of him and if you think it too without asking him if he would like it i will come up for some other reason you will not go i know unless he is perfectly well but he might and i think would like to have some one with him just at first  let me know what you think  goodbye my dearest father  ever your affectionate and dutiful son  j c patteson   merton shrove tuesday  my dearest joan and fanhow we must all have united this morning in pouring out our thanks to god for his great mercy  you will not suspect me of being wanting in love to you if i say that the contemplation of what might have happened presented such a scene of desolation such a void that it would have required all the strength i possess to turn to god in resignation and submission to his will i have often very often thought of that illness at geneva but this brought it home to me perhaps closer still and i hope i shall never cease to be mindful of and thankful for this special providence father seems pretty confident that all mischief is prevented and jem wrote six hours after he took the laudanum and had then felt no drowsiness to speak of and dr watson said there was no fear of anything happening after two hours had elapsed  i should like to join with you in showing our gratitude by some deed of charity or whatever you think right  something that without any show might be a thankoffering to god for his signal act of mercy  ever your loving brother  j c patteson  530  i wrote this quite early this morning  i can hardly think yet what it all means  now i feel only a sense of some very heavy affliction removed  poor dear father and all of us what should we have been without him   a letter to the brother himself was written under the same impulse even more tenderly affectionate but so deep and intimate that it would almost be treason to give it to the world  the next letter was written soon after the alarm had passed but is undated  my dear fanyesterday i was unluckily too seedy with headache to go on the ice and this morning i have been skating for half an hour but the ice is spoilt  very jolly it is to be twisting and turning about once more  i thought of writing to old jem to come down for it as i should think the frost is not severe enough to freeze any but the shallow water of the floods but it was not good enough to reward him for the trouble of coming so far  the constant sense of his preservation from that great danger really prevents my feeling so acutely perhaps as i ought to do the distress of others  i really think i ought to be less cheerful and happy than i feel myself to be  i had a pleasant little talk with dr pusey on monday he was recommending me two or three books for hebrew reading but they would be of no use to me yet the language is difficult to advance far into and you know my shallow way of catching a thing at first rather quickly perhaps but only superficially  i find my interest increasing greatly in philological studies  one language helps another very much and the beautiful way in which the words ideas and the whole structure indeed of language pervades whole families and even the different families eg the indogermanic and semitic races is not only interesting but very useful  i wish i had made myself a better greek and latin scholar but unfortunately i used to hate classics  what desperate uphill work it was to read them a regular exercise of selfdenial every morning  now i like it beyond any study except divinity proper and i try to make up for lost time  there are admirable books in my possession which facilitate the acquisition of critical scholarship very much and i work at these principally applying it to new test greek lxx c but my real education began i think with my first foreign trip  it seems as if there was not time for all this for i have hebrew arabic c to go on with though this is a slow process pearson hooker blunt on the reformation a mere sketch which i read in a day or two at odd times commentaries trenchs books on parables and miracles which are in my room at home and would in parts interest you he is a writer of good common sense and a wellread man  but i of course want to be reading history as well and that involves a good deal physical geography geology c yet one things helps another very much  i dont work quite as methodically as i ought and i much want some one to discuss matters with relating to what i read  i dont say all this i am sure you know as if i wanted to make out that i am working at grand subjects  i know exceeding little of any one of them so little history eg that a school girl could expose my ignorance directly but i like to know what we are doing among ourselves and we all get to know each other better thereby  i felt so much of late with regard to jem that a natural reserve prevents so often members even of the same family from communicating freely to each other their opinions business habits of life experiences of sympathy approval disapproval and the like and when one member is gone then it is felt how much more closely such a habit of dealing with each other would have taught us to know him nothing tests ones knowledge so well as questions and answers upon what we have read stating difficulties arguments which we cant understand c to each other  ladies who have no profession to prepare for in spite of a very large correspondence and numerous household duties may in addition to their parochial work as curates take up a real course of reading and go into it thoroughly and this gives girls not only employment for the time but gives the mind power to seize every other subject presented to it  if you are quite alone your reading is apt to become desultory i find it useful to take once or twice a week a walk with riddell of balliol and go through a certain period of old testament history it makes me get it up and then between us we hammer out so many more explanations of difficult passages than at all events i should do by myself  he is moreover about the best greek scholar here which is a great help to me  you have no idea of the light that such accurate scholarship as his throws upon many disputed passages in the bible eg wisdom is justified of her children where the greek preposition probably gives the key to the whole meaning and many such  so you see dear old fan that the want of some one to pour out this to for it sounds fearfully pedantic i confess has drawn upon you this grievous infliction  my kindest love to father and dear joan  ever your loving  j c p   fanny patteson answered with arguments on the other duties which hindered her from entering on the course of deep study which he had been recommending  he replies   feb 25 1853  my dearest fani must answer your very sensible wellwritten letter at once because on our system of mutual explanation there are two or three things i wish to notice in it  first i never meant that anything should supersede duties which i am well aware you practise with real use to yourself and those about you eg the kindness and sympathy shown to friends and generally due observance of all social relations  second i quite believe that the practical application of what is already known teaching going about among the poor is of far more consequence than the acquisition of knowledge which of course for its own sake is worth nothing  third i think you perfectly right in keeping up music singing all the common amusements of a country life of course i do for indeed what i said did not apply to joan or you except so far as this that we all know probably a great deal of which each one is separately ignorant and the free communication of this to one another is desirable i think  my own temptation consists perhaps chiefly in the love of reading for its own sake  i do honestly think that for a considerable time past i have read i believe nothing which i do not expect to be of real use for i have no taste naturally for novels c without however wishing to deny that there may be novels which teach a real insight into character  barring i promessi sposi which i take up very seldom when tired i have not read one for ages i must except old mortality read last vacation at feniton but i cant deny that i like the study of languages for its own sake though i apply my little experience in it wholly to the interpretation of the bible  i like improving my scholarship it is true but i can say honestly that it is used to read the greek testament with greater accuracy so of the hebrew syriac arabic  i feel i confess sometimes that it is nice c to know several languages but i try to drive away any such thoughts and it is quite astonishing how after a few weeks a study which would suggest ideas of an unusual course of reading becomes so familiar that i never think of myself when pursuing it eg i dont think that after two hours grind at arabic the stupid wrong feeling of its being an outoftheway study comes upon me now it is getting quite natural  it comes out though when i talk or write perhaps with another but i must try and get over it  i believe it to be a good thing to break off any work once or twice a day in the middle of any reading for meditating a little while and for prayer  this is more easily done at college than elsewhere and is i hope a preventive against such thoughts  then as i jog on i see how very little i know what an immense deal i have to learn to become ordinarily well acquainted with these things  i am in that state of mind perhaps when ecclesiastes which i am now reading puts my own case exactly before me  i think whats the good of it all  and the answer comes it may be very good properly used or very mischievous if abused  i do indeed look forward to active parochial work i think i shall be very happy so employed and i often try to anticipate the time in thought and feel with perfect sincerity that nothing is so useful or so full of comfort as the consciousness of trying to fulfil the daily duties of my situation here of course i need do nothing i mean there is nothing to prevent my sitting all day in an armchair and reading pickwick one word about the way languages help me that you may not think what i am doing harder than it really is  these three bear the same kind of relation to each other or rather say these five arabic syriac hebrew chaldee ethiopia but of the last i know nothing whatever and of chaldee only so much as that it is a dialect of hebrew in the same character and consequently anyone who knows hebrew knows something about it as german to english eg bahlom arab beel syr baal heb are the same word as you can see only written in different characters and all mean a lord so baal beelzebub or baalzebeb baal peor which means literally the lord of the ravine viz the idol worshipped at the pass in the wilderness consequently in reading any one of these languages the same word keeps on occurring in all and the chief use is of course that often a word which occurs only once or twice in hebrew perhaps is in common use in the others and so its meaning is fixed  add to all this that the syriac version of the new testament was made as all agree early in the second century if not at the end of the first and thus is the very best exponent of the new testament where the greek is doubtful and the additional fact that though a mixture of chaldee and syriac was the language of palestine in our lords time yet he certainly sometimes spoke what is now our syriac eg talitha cumi c and the importance of it is apparent  surely to read the language that our blessed lord himself used is no small profit as well as delight  so i think we may each go on in our several pursuits each helping each and each trying to do so without a foolish affectation of learning  my best love to dear father and joan  ever your affectionate brother  j c p   fenelon has said that in a certain stage of piety there is much of self and coley was evidently in that stage  his own figure was the primary object before his eyes neither indulged nor admired but criticised repressed and by his very best efforts thrust aside whenever he was conscious that his selfcontemplation was self complacency  still it was in his nature to behold it and discuss it and thus to conquer and outgrow the study in time while leaving many observations upon selfculture and selftraining that will no doubt become deeply valued as the result of the practical experience of one who so truly mastered that obtrusive self  patteson was one of the most decided workers for the admission of improvements and reduction of abuses within his own college with which each oxford foundation was endeavouring to forestall compulsory reformation by a university commission  mr roundell says  his early years as fellow of merton coincided with the period of active reform at oxford which followed upon the report of the commission in 1852  what part did the future missionary bishop take in that great movement  one who worked with him at that timea time when university reform was as unfashionable as it is now fashionable well remembers  he threw himself into the work with hearty zeal he supported every liberal proposal  to his loyal fidelity and solid common sense is largely due the success with which the reform of merton was carried out  and yet in those first days of college reform the only sure and constant nucleus of the floatingliberal majority consisted of patteson and one other  whatever others did those two were always on the same side  and so somehow owing no doubt to the general enlightenment which distinguished the senior fellows of merton under the old regimean enlightenment unquestionably due to the predominance in that college of the lay nonresident elementthe new reforming spirit found itself in the ascendency  it is to the honour of patteson and equally to the honour of the older fellows of the college at that time that so great an inroad upon old traditions should have been made with such an entire absence of provocation on the one side or of irritation on the other  but patteson with all his reforming zeal was also a highbred gentleman  he remembered what was due to others as well as to himself  his bearing was one of respect for authority of deference towards those who were his superiors in age  he knew how to differ  he showed towards others the considerate courtesy which others in return so abundantly showed towards him  and this generous forbearance of the seniors had its reward  it entailed upon the juniors a reciprocity of respect  it was felt by them at the time to be an additional incentive to moderation to sobriety to desistance from extreme views  the result was that the work got done and what was done left no heartburnings behind  yet it would be delusive to pretend to claim bishop patteson as a liberal in the political sense of the word  he was no such thing if anything his instincts especially in church matters drew him the other way  but those who knew the man like those who have seen the ammergau play would as soon think of fastening upon that a sectarian character as of fixing him with party names  his was a catholic mind  what distinguished him was his openmindedness his essential goodness his singleness and simplicity of aim  he was a just man and singularly free from perturbations of self of temper or of nerves  you did not care to ask what he would call himself you felt what he was that you were in the presence of a man too pure for party of one in whose presence ordinary party distinctions almost ceased to have a meaning  such a man could scarcely be on the wrong side  both the purity of his nature and the rectitude of his judgment would have kept him straight  coley remained at merton until the long vacation of 1853 when his oxford life terminated though not his connection with the university for he retained his fellowship until his death and the friendships he had formed both at balliol and merton remained unbroken     chapter v  the curacy at alfington 18531855    preparation for ordination had become pattesons immediate object as has been already said his work was marked out  there was a hamlet of the parish of ottery st mary at a considerable distance from the church and town and named alfington  some time previously the family of sir john kennaway had provided the place with a school which afterwards passed into the hands of mr justice coleridge who in 1849 there built the small church of st james with parsonage school and house on a rising ground overlooking the valley of honiton almost immediately opposite to feniton and at the same time took on himself the expenses of the curacy and school for the vicar of the parish the rev dr cornish formerly master of ottery school  the first curate of alfington was judge coleridges son henry the wellknown author of the beautiful life of st francis xavier  on his leaving our communion it was his fathers wish that coleridge patteson should take the cure and until his ordination it was committed temporarily to other hands in especial to the rev henry gardiner who was much beloved there  in the spring of 1853 he had a long and dangerous illness when coley came to nurse him and became so much attached to him that his influence and unconscious training became of great importance  the church was served by such clerical friends as could give their assistance on sunday and the pastoral care attention to the school cottage visiting c became the employment of the candidate for holy orders who thus began his work under the direction of his disabled friend  a letter to his sister shows how he plunged into the drudgery of the parish doing that which always cost him most namely administering rebukes so that it was no wonder that he wrote with a sort of elation at having lashed himself up to the point of giving a thorough warning   feniton july 19 1853  my dearest fani am going to thorverton today to stay till thursday  gardiner came downstairs on sunday and again yesterday and is making very rapid strides towards perfect recovery  he even went out yesterday for a few minutes  so i dont mind leaving him in the least and indeed he is going to sidmouth himself probably at the end of the week  i have seen him every day without one exception and have learnt a very great deal from him  he has studied very closely school work condition of the labourer boys homes best method of dispensing charity c and on all these points his advice has been really invaluable  i feel now that i am quite to all intents working the district  people ask me about their children coming to school  i know almost all the people in the village and a good many out of it and begin to understand in a very small way what a clergymans life is  a mixture of sorrow and pleasure indeed  there are many very sad cases of hypocrisy filthiness and wickedness as i suppose there are in every district and yesterday i had a very hardworking and in one case most painful day  some people had asked me to take their boy three years and a half old to schoola wretched pair with a little savage for a son  i said i would speak to miss wilkins and put plainly before her the character of parents and child  however she wished to have him and i knew it was so far well to get the boy away from home  but such a scene ensued  the boy was really like a little savage kicked dashed his head against the wall and at length with his nose bleeding violently exhausted with his violence fell asleep  next day he is so bad he is sent home when the mother drives him back to school cursing and swearing telling miss wilkins she may kill him if she pleases  unluckily i was not in school  yesterday he was in school and more quiet but did not kneel down at prayers and seemed like a little beast beginning to be tamed  so after school i called him to me and putting him before my knees asked him some questions very kindly did he know who god was  had he never been taught to kneel down and say his prayers  of course he had not but it gave me the proper opportunity of speaking to his parents  so having now considered the matter for two or three days previously having ascertained all the facts about the people after an hour among some others in the village i went right into their cottage and luckily found father and mother and grandmother at home besides one or two more who are lodgers in a room adjoining with the door open  i am come to talk to you about william i began whereupon i saw the woman turn quite red  however i spoke for about ten minutes slowly and very quietly without any appearance as i believe of anger or passion at all but yet speaking my mind quite plainly  i had no idea any child could be so neglected  did they suppose the school was a place where any parent might send a child merely to get it out of the way of course they do you know most of them  was it possible that a child could be made good as if by magic there when it learns nothing but wicked words at home  do you think you can or ought to get rid of the duties you owe your child do you suppose that god will not require from you an account of the way you have behaved towards him you who have never taught him to know who god is what god is what is prayer what is the church who have taught that little mouth which god created for praise and blessings to curse and blaspheme  i know that many children do and say wicked things but it is in most cases owing to the neglect of their parents who do not speak kindly to their children and do what they can to keep them out of temptation but this is a different case   your boy is not fit to come into the company of little christians  awful as it is to think of he is already at his early age the very dread of the parents who live near you  they had not a word to say not a syllable beyond the objection which i had already met that other children were bad too  i did not say what i might have said with truth because it is only from gardiners report not from my own knowledgeviz that neither father nor mother ever come to church and that their house is the centre of evil to the young people of the village  now i said in conclusion i fully meant to send back your boy and tell you i would examine him six months hence to see if he was fit to be brought into the school but as i do trust he may behave better and that this may be the means of recovering him from this sad state i shall take him still unless he behaves again very badly  but remember thisthis is the turning point in the boys life and all humanly speaking depends on the example you set him what an awful thing it would be if it pleased god to take him away from you now and a fit of measles scarlatina or any such illness may do it any day  remember that you are responsible to a very great extent for your child that unless it sees you watchful over your thoughts words and actions unless it sees you regular and devout in prayer at home i dont believe they ever think of such a thing god forgive me if i am wrong unless it sees you habitually in your place in gods house you are not doing your duty to yourselves or your child you are not laying up any hope or comfort whatever for the day of your sickness and death  now i hope you clearly understand me  i have spoken plainlyexactly what i think and what i mean to act upon  you know now the sort of person you have to deal with  good morningand thereupon i marched out amazed at my own pluck and heartily glad that i had said what i wished and felt i ought to say  but i need hardly tell you that this left me in a state of no slight excitement and that i should be much comforted by hearing what you and father and joan think of my behaviour  meanwhile there are some very nice people i dearly love some of the boys and girls and i do pray that this plan of a boys home may save some from contamination  i seated with sanders last night found him and his wife very hearty about it  i have only mentioned it to three people but i rather wish it to be talked about a little now that they may be curious c to know exactly what i mean to do  the two cottages with plenty of room for the fleys family and eight boys with half an acre of garden at £11 5s the year  i shall of course begin with only one or two boysthe thing may not answer at all but everyone gardiner several farmers and two or three others quite poor in different places all say it must work well with gods blessing  i do not really wish to be scheming away working a favourite hobby c but i do believe this to be absolutely essential  the profligacy and impurity of the poor is beyond all belief  every mother of a family answers i mean every honest respectable mother of a family oh sir god will bless such a work and it is for want of this that so much misery and wretchedness abound  i believe that for a year or so it will exhaust most of my money but then it is one of the best uses to which i can apply it for my theory is that help and assistance is wanted in this way and i would wish to make most of these things selfsupporting half an acre more of garden thoroughly well worked will yield an astonishing return and i look to mary as a person of really economical habits  it is a great relief to have poured all this out  it is no easy task that i am preparing for myself  i know that i fully expect to be very much disappointed but i am determined to try it  i am determined to try and make the people see that i am not going to give way to everybody that asks but that i am going to set on foot and help on all useful industrial schemes of every kind for people of every age  i am hard at work studying spade husbandry inspectors reports of industrial schools c i am glad you are all so happy  i am so busy  best love to all  your loving  j c p   coley was thus already serving a vigorous apprenticeship in pastoral work while preparing himself for receiving deacons orders  it was a trying time both to his family and himself for as before said his standard was very high and his own strong habit of self contemplation made his dissatisfaction with himself manifest in his manner to those nearest to him  he was always gentle and unselfish not showing temper but unhappiness  here are letters showing a good deal of his state of mind the first only dated saturday evening but evidently written about this time in reply to the cautions with which his sister had replied to the above letter of eager plans of improvement   my dearest fanyour letter has just reached me from honiton and i have read it with very great interest  i liked it better on a second perusal of it which showed in itself that i wanted it for it is quite true that i require to be reminded of the only true principle upon which one ought to work and i allow quite willingly that i trace interested motiveseg love of selfapproval or applause in actions where such feelings ought least of all to enter  i certainly did feel pleased with myself for speaking plainly to those people and i often find myself indulging the notion that i am going to be a very hardworking clergyman with a remedy for all the evils of the age c  if i was to hunt about for an excuse i might perhaps find one by saying that i am in that state of mind which attends always i suppose the anticipation of any great crisis in a persons life sometimes hard work and hard thought sometimes though alas very seldom a real sense of the very awful responsibility of ministering in the church sometimes a less natural urging of the mind to contemplate and realise this responsibility  i was for some time reading wilberforces new book and this involved an examination of the question in other writers but lately i have laid all controversial works aside almost entirely and have been reading pearson bull and the apostolical fathers clement and ignatius  i shall probably read justin martyrs apologies and some treatises of tertullian before next month is over  i have read some part already there is such a very strong practical element in these very early writings that they ought to soothe and calm the mind but i cannot honestly conceal the fact that the theological interest for the most part outweighs the practical teaching  my light reading is of a new and very amusing and interesting characterviz books on school economy management of school farms allotments the modern dairy spade husbandry agricultural chemistry  k w f c and g and i have great talks and as they all agree with me i think them capital judges  i dont think at all that my present state of mind is quite natural you quite repeat my own words when you say it is transitory  a calm undisturbed spirit of prayer and peace and contentment is a great gift of god and to be waited for with patience  the motto of the christian year is very beautiful  i sent the roses on tuesday  my best love to dear father and joan  ever your loving brother  j c p   these words love of selfapproval perfectly analysed that snare of coleys early life against which he so endeavoured to guardnot selfconceit but love of selfapproval  so the easter week drew on and during it he writes to his cousin   friday wallis lodgings exeter september 1853  my dear sophywe have had a good examination i think perhaps rather harder than i expected  woolecombe and chancellor harrington spoke to me this morning thanking me for my papers and telling me to read the gospel at the ordination  i did feel very nervous last sunday and monday and the ember prayer in the morning when i was at ottery fairly upset me but i dont think anybody saw it now i am thankful to say i am very well and feel thoroughly happy  i shall be nervous no doubt on sunday and especially at reading the gospel but not i think so nervous as to break down or do anything foolish so when you know i am readingfor you wont hear me if you are in the stalls dont distress yourself about me  i cant tell what it was that upset me so on sunday and monday thinking of dear mamma and how she had wished for this the overwhelming kindness of everybody about me dear fathers simple words of very affectionate comfort and advice  but i walked into exeter and on the way got quite calm and so i have been ever since  it is not strange that the realising the near approach of what i have for years wished for and looked forward to should at times come upon me with such force that i seem scarcely master of myself but it is only excitement of feeling and ought i know to be repressed not for a moment to be entertained as a test of ones religious state being by no means a desirable thing  i am very glad the examination is over  i did not worry myself about it but it was rather hard work and now i have my time to myself for quiet thought and meditation  ever dear sophy your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   the next evening he writes   saturday 545 pm  my dearest fatheri must write my last letter as a layman to you i cant tell you the hundredth part of the thoughts that have been passing through my mind this week  there has been no return of the excitement that i experienced last sunday and monday and i have been very happy and well  today my eyes are not comfortable from i know not what cause but as all the work for them is over it does not matter so much  i am glad to have had a quiet time for reflection  indeed i do not enough realise my great unworthiness and sinfulness and the awful nature of the work i am undertaking  i pray god very earnestly for the great grace of humility which i so sadly need and for a spirit of earnest prayer that i may be preserved from putting trust in myself and may know and forget myself in my office and work  i never could be fit for such work i know that and yet i am very thankful that the time for it has come  i do not feel excited yet i am somewhat nervous because it requires an effort to meditate steadily  i have thought so much of my early life of dearest mamma what a snare it seems so full of transitory earthly plans and pursuits such a want of earnestness of purpose and steady performance of duty  god grant my life as a clergyman may be more innocent to myself and more useful to others  tell dear joan the gown came this morning  my kind love to her fan and jem  ever my dearest father  your affectionate and dutiful son  j c patteson   on the ensuing day sunday september 14 1853 john coleridge patteson received the diaconate at the hands of the venerable bishop phillpotts in exeter cathedral  his being selected to read the gospel was the proof of his superiority in the examinationno wonder considering the two additional years that he had spent in preparation and the deep study and searchings of heart of the last few months  he was established in a small house at alfingtonthe usual habitation of the curate  and of his first sermon there his uncle sir john coleridge gives the following touching description from his diary  october 23 1853yesterday morning arthur and i went to alfington church to be present at coleys first sermon  i dont know when i have been so much delighted and affected  his manner of saying the prayers was exceedingly good his voice very sweet and musical without seeming loud it was fully audible and gave assurance of more power if needed his manner quite unaffected but sweet and devout  his sermon was a very sound and good one beautifully delivered perhaps in the early parts from the very sweetness of his voice and the very rapid delivery of his words a little more variety of intonation would have helped in conveying his meaning more distinctly to those who formed the bulk of his congregation  but when he came to personal parts this was not needed  he made a kind allusion to me very affecting to me and when i was in this mood and he came to the personal parts touching himself and his new congregation what he knew he ought to be to them and to do for them what they should do for themselves and earnestly besought their prayers i was completely overcome and weeping profusely  fanny patteson and arthur coleridge were sitting with the judge and were equally overcome  when the service was over and the congregation dispersed coley joined these three in the porch holding out his hands taking theirs and shedding tears and they with himtears of warm emotion too deep for words  he was evidently surprised at the effect produced  in fact on looking at the sermon it does not seem to have been in itself remarkable but as his cousin arthur says i suppose the deep spirituality of the man and the love we bore him for years touched the emotional part of us  the text was significant we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake 2 cor iv 5  the services that the newlyordained deacon undertook were the ordinary sunday ones and wednesday and friday matins and litany saintsday prayers and lecture and an advent and lent evensong and lecture on wednesdays and fridays  these last had that great popularity which attends late services  dr cornish used to come on one sunday in the month to celebrate the holy communion which is given weekly in the mother church and when mr grardiner was able to be at sidmouth recovering from his illness he used to come over on the second sunday in the month for the same purpose and the next lent the matins were daily and followed by a lecture  at this time pattesons constitutional shrinking from general society was in full force and he also had that dislike to speaking to people in the way of censure which so often goes with tender and refined natures however strong so that if his housekeeper needed a reproof he would make his sister administer it and creep out of reach himself but this was one of the deficiencies with which he was struggling all his life and fortunately it is a fact that the most effective lectures usually come from those to whom they cost the most  this was the hardest part of his ministry  where kindness and attention were needed nothing could be more spontaneous sweet or winning than his ways  one of his parishioners a farmers daughter writes  our personal knowledge of him began some months before his ordination owing i suppose to mr gardiners severe illness and as he was very much respected mr pattesons attentions won from the first our admiration and gratitude which went on and on until it deepened into that love which i do not think could have been surpassed by the galatians for their beloved st paul which he records in his epistle to them chap iv 15  all were waiting for him at his ordination and a happy delusion seemed to have come over the minds of most if not all that he was as completely ours as if he had been ordained expressly for us  it was not his own feeling for he knew that when his apprenticeship should be past the place was too small and the work too easy for a man in full force and vigour though for the sake of his father he was glad to accept it for the present to train himself in the work and to have full time for study but he at that time looked to remaining in england during his fathers lifetime and perhaps transferring himself to manchester liverpool london or some large city where there was need of mission work among the neglected  his father was on the city of london charter commission and was in london from november to february the daughters joining him there but there was no lack of friends around alfington  indeed it was in the midst of an absolute clan of coleridges and in buckerell parish at deerpark that great old soldier lord seaton was spending the few years that passed between his commissionership in the ionian isles and his commandership in ireland  he was connected with the coleridges through the yonge family and the young people were all on familiar cousinly terms  coley was much liked by him and often joined in the rides through the lanes and to the hills with him and his daughters when there were many conversations of much interest as there could not fail to be with a man who had never held a government without doing his utmost to promote gods work in the church and for education who had moreover strong opinions derived from experience of the red indians in upper canadanamely that to reclaim the young and educate them was the only hope of making christianity take root in any fresh nation  it was at deerpark at a dinner in the late autumn of this year 1853 that i saw coley patteson for the second and last time  i had seen him before in a visit of three days that i made at feniton with my parents in the september of 1844 when he was an eton boy full of high spirits and merriment  i remember then on the sunday that he and i accompanied our two fathers on a walk to the afternoon service at ottery and that on the way he began to show something of his inner self and talked of his mother and her pleasure in feniton but it began to rain and i stayed for the night at heaths court so that our acquaintance ceased for that time  it was not a formal party at deerpark and the evening was chiefly spent in playing at games thread paper verses and the like in which coley took his part with spirit  if i had guessed what he was to be i should have observed him more but though in after years our intercourse in letters makes us feel intimate with one another these two brief meetings comprise the whole of my personal acquaintance with one in whom i then only saw a young clergyman with his heart in his work  perhaps this is the best place to mention his personal appearance as the portrait at the beginning of this volume was taken not more than a year later  he was tall and of a large powerful frame broad in the chest and shoulders and with small neat hands and feet with more of sheer muscular strength and power of endurance than of healthiness so that though seldom breaking down and capable of undergoing a great deal of fatigue and exertion he was often slightly ailing and was very sensitive to cold  his complexion was very dark and there was a strongly marked line between the cheeks and mouth the corners of which drooped when at rest so that it was a countenance peculiarly difficult to photograph successfully  the most striking feature was his eyes which were of a very dark clear blue full of an unusually deep earnest and so to speak inward yet far away expression  his smile was remarkably bright sweet and affectionate like a gleam of sunshine and was one element of his great attractiveness  so was his voice which had the rich full sweetness inherited from his mothers family and which always excited a winning influence over the hearers  thus though not a handsome man he was more than commonly engaging exciting the warmest affection in all who were concerned with him and giving in return an immense amount of interest and sympathy which only became intensified to old friends while it expanded towards new ones  here is a letter to his father undated but written not long after his settling down at alfington after expressing his regret that his voice had been inaudible to his sister joanna at a friday evening service he proceeds   i did not speak very loud because i dont think i could do so and at the same time keep my mind at work and thoughts collected anything which is so unnatural and unusual as to make me conscious of myself in a peculiar manner would prevent i fear my getting on with my oration at all  i am glad you think i could not have acted otherwise with e  i quite expect ere long to find something going on which may call for my interference and i specially guarded myself on this point  it is distinctly understood that i shall speak to him quite plainly whenever and wherever i think it necessary to do so  i do not suppose it very likely that he can go on long without my being forced to take some step but i really feel so very unequal to expressing a decided opinion upon the great question of bible readers that i am certainly glad i have not taken up a hostile position hastily  as a matter of fact he reads in very few cottages in my district tracts he distributes almost everywhere  now i see of course the distinction between a man making it his business to read the bible and neighbours dropping in occasionally to read a chapter to one who is unable to read but where you are distinctly told that the wish is most decidedly to support the clergyman and answers not unsatisfactory are given upon main points what difference remains between the two cases i have put that can furnish matter for fair argument with a man from education c disposed to take a different view of the whole question  add to this that i cannot appeal to the universal practice of the clergy why might it be said do you as a clergyman find a difficulty where mr h finds none  you are after all acting on your own private opinion though you lay claim to authority for it  i cannot successfully appeal to the distinctive teaching of our church clear and manifest as it is for the very words i think conclusive contain no such evidence for him and so on ad infinitum  besides to speak quite what i feel at present though only so perhaps because my view is necessarily unformed the natural order of things in such a district as this seems to be gain the affections of the people by gentleness and showing real interest in their welfare spiritual and temporal show them in the bible such teaching as the church considers necessary but not as yet upon the authority of the church or at least not so expressed to them lead them gradually to the acknowledgment of such truths as these that christ did found a society called the church and appoint to certain persons whom he sent the ministry of reconciliation that if we have no guide but mere opinion there will be thousands of conflicting opinions in the world even among good men whereas truth can be but one and that practically this is found to be so that it is no argument to say that the spirit so operated as to enlighten the reason of each individual to this extent viz that it may compose a creed for him or herself that the spirit acts now in the ordinary though not less real and heavenly manner and that the infinite divisions among sectaries proves the fact to be as i state it  thus i imagine the want of that external and visible church will be felt as necessary to fix the creeds pasa katadike  but to reverse this process to cram positive teaching down their throats upon the authority of the church before they know what the church is or feel the need of any power outside so to speak their own minds to guide them does seem to me in a place like this humanly speaking suicidal  i cannot of course tell how much preparatory teaching they have received but i must judge from what i see and hear and deal accordingly in each cottage  some few there are to whom i can speak as to church people in the real sense of the word but these are as two or three in a hundred  one line to say whether you think me right or wrong would be a great comfort to me  i feel no tendency to latitudinarianism but only to see much good in systems unrecognised by your very highflyers  i believe that the church teaching is represented in an unfavourable often offensive light to many of our poor because they hear words and see things which find no response in their hearts because they are told ordered almost to believe things the propriety of believing which they do not recognise because the existence of wants is implied when they have never been felt and a system for supplying them introduced which finds no room in the understanding or affections of the patient  but you know dear father what i mean without more dusky attempts at explaining myself  do not many high churchmen want a little more experimental religion in bishop jebbs sense of the terms not a religion of the feelings but a religion brought home to the heart and truly felt so as to prohibit any systematic criticism of the feelings  i am late this week with my sermons i have not begun either of them and may have one tomorrow evening if my voice will do its part  i write very long washy concerns and find it difficult to do otherwise for it is a good pull upon me week after week and latterly i have not been able to read very much  i shall look out two or three that i think fair specimens and ask you byandby to run your eye over them that you may point out the defects  my ignorance of the bible astonishes me though not so much as it ought to do  i purpose dv to commence a thorough study of the original texts  i must try to become something of a scholar at all events to make any progress in the work  i sometimes hope that in spite of my many backslidings and broken resolutions some move is taking place within where most it is wanted but i live here so quietly that i have little comparatively food for some special faults  goodbye my dear father  your affectionate and dutiful son  j c p   some move taking place within  it is impossible not to pause and observe how as confirmation and communion had almost palpably strengthened the boys struggles with his inherent faults so the grace conferred with the deacons orders is now felt to be lifting him higher and enabling him to see further than he has yet seen  sermons were however never pattesons forte  though his pen flowed so freely in letters and he could pour out his heart extemporaneously with great depth fervour and simplicity his sermons were laboured and metaphysical as if he had taken too much pains with them as it were and he could not speak to the abstract as he could to the individual or when he saw the effect of his words  it was perhaps owing to the defective system which threw two sermons a week upon a young deacon at a time when his mind was working through such an experimental course of study and thought yet his people who had learnt to believe in little but preaching would not have come to prayers alone and the extemporary addresses in which he would probably have been much more successful would have seemed to him at his age and at that periodtwenty years backtoo presumptuous to be attempted at any rate till he had better learnt his ground  how his system would have succeeded we cannot tell the nature of the peasantry of the county he had to deal with is to be quickwitted argumentative and ready of retort open to religious impressions but with much of selfopinion and conceit and not much reverence and often less conscientious in matters of honesty and morality than denser rustics of less apparent piety  the church had for a longperiod been at a peculiarly low ebb in the county and there is not a neighbourhood which has not traditions of incredibly ignorant careless and underbredif not dissipated clergy and though there were grand exceptions they were only respected as men faith in the whole system as a system was destroyed  bishop phillpotts coming down on such elements as these was in spite of his soundness of faith and grand trenchant force of character better as a warrior than as a shepherd and the controversial and political sides of his character though invaluable to the church did not recommend him to the affections of the people of his diocese who could not understand the points of the debate and wanted the direct evidence of spirituality which they could appreciate  the cholera of 1832 had been especially terrible in the unwholesome precincts of the devonshire seaports and the effect was a great craving for religion  the church was in no condition to avail herself of it in fact she would have viewed it with distrust as excitement  primitive methodism and plymouth brethrenism supplied the void gave opportunities of prayer and gratified the quickened longing for devotion and therewith arose that association of the church with deadness and of dissent with life which infected even the most carefully tended villages and with which patteson was doing his best to contend at alfington  the stage of gaining the peoples affection and confidence and of quickening their religious life he had attained and the further work of teaching them that the church alone gives security of saving union with christ was yet to come when his inward call led him elsewhere  on the 12th of december he says  yesterday was a very happy day gardiner came to help me and he administered the holy communion to twentyseven or twentyeight of my own people  this is nearly double the average before i came and two regular attendants are prevented by sickness from being at church  i trust i have not urged the necessity of communicating unwisely upon them  i preach on it once a month as you know and in almost every sermon allude to it and where occasion offers speak about it to individuals at home but i try to put before them the great awfulness of it as well as the danger of neglecting it and i warn them against coming without feeling really satisfied from what i read to them and they read in the bible concerning it  six came yesterday for the first time old william seventyfive years of age who has never been a communicant volunteered on thursday to come if i thought it right  he is and always has been i am told a thoroughly respectable sober industrious man regular at church once a day and i went to his cottage with a ticket in my pocket to urge him to consider the danger of going on as if content with what he did and without striving to press onwards c  but after a long conversation on other matters he said i should like sir to come to the sacrament if you have no objection and very happy and thankful i felt for i had prayed very earnestly that this old man might be led thither by gods grace and now it was done without any urging on my part beyond what he heard in church and what i had said to his daughter about him  the next of his letters is occupied with the pecuniary affairs of his lodging house for farm boys and the obtaining of ground where they might grow vegetables for their own use  in february his family returned home and his sister fanny thus speaks of him to a friend  he does not look well and at first we were quite uneasy for his eyes were heavy and puffed but he is much better and confesses that dinners and evenings here do him good though he quite denies the starving and mrs knowles also  she says he gets over anxious in mind and was completely chilled the week he sat in the hall  no doubt his house is still both cold and damp and the church the same and therefore the labour of reading and preaching is very great  we are by degrees interesting him in our winter life having heard all his performances and plans and he is very glad to have us back though much too busy to have missed us when we were away  now he has daily morning service with a lecture and if it lasts the impression he has made is really extraordinary  we may well pray that he should not be vain of his works  there are men whose whole lives seem changed if i am to believe what i hear  such was the young deacons early success  with an affectionate brother close at hand and friends within easy reach his fellowship preserving his connection with oxford his fathers and brothers profession with london in fact all england could offer and he would easily have it in his power to take fresh holidays on the continent and enjoy those delights of scenery architecture art and music which he loved with an appreciation and enthusiasm that could easily have become an absorbing passion  who could have a smoother easier pleasanter career open to him than the rev john coleridge patteson at six and twenty  yet even then the wish breathed to his mother at fourteen that he might devote himself to the cause of the heathen lay deep in his heart although for the present he was as it were waiting to see what god would have him do whether his duty to his father required him to remain at hand or whether he might be called to minister in some great english manufacturing town  early in 1854 it became known that the bishop of new zealand and mrs selwyn were about to spend a year in england  coleys aspirations to mission work were renewed  the thoughts excited by the sermons he had heard at eton twelve years previously grew in force  he remembered his mothers promise of her blessing and seriously considered of offering himself to assist in the work in the southern hemisphere  he discussed the matter seriously with his friend mr gardiner who was strongly of opinion that the scheme ought not to be entertained during his fathers lifetime  he acquiesced but if his heart and mind were convinced his soul and spirit were not and the yearnings for the forefront of the battle were not quenched though there was no slackening of zeal over the present little flock to make them suspect that he had a thought beyond  old ties of friendship already mentioned made the bishop and mrs selwyn promise to spend a few days at feniton and on the 19th of august the new zealand guests arrived at feniton  after joining in the family welcome coley went apart and gave way to a great burst of tears due perhaps not so mueh to disappointed ardour as to the fervent emotion excited by the actual presence of a hero of the church militant who had so long been the object of deep silent enthusiasm  the next morning coley walked from alfington to breakfast at home and afterwards went into the garden with the bishop who led him to talk freely of his present work in all its details  byandby the question arose did it satisfy him  yes the being near his father satisfied him that it was right for the present but at some future time he hoped to do more go perhaps to some great manufacturing town or as he could not help going on to say what he should like would be to go out as a missionary only the thought of his father withheld him  but replied the bishop if you think about doing a thing of that sort it should not be put off till you are getting on in life  it should be done with your full strength and vigour  then followed an endeavour on both sides to ascertain whether the inclination was a real earnest desire or only fancy for the romance of mission work  the test might be whether he were willing to go wherever he might be sent or only where he was most interested coley replied that he was willing to work anywhere adding that his sister fanny could testify whether his desire were a real one of long standing or the mere outcome of a fit of enthusiasm  therewith they separated and coley going straight to fanny told her what had passed i could not help it he saidi told the bishop of my wish  you ought to put it to my father that he may decide it she answered he is so great a man that he ought not to be deprived of the crown of the sacrifice if he be willing to make it  so coley repaired to his father and confessed his long cherished wish and how it had come forth to the bishop  sir john was manifestly startled but at once said you have done quite right to speak to me and not to wait  it is my first impulse to say no but that would be very selfish  coley explained that he was driven to speak he declared himself not dissatisfied with his present position nor he hoped impatient if his staying at home were decided upon he would cheerfully work on there without disappointment or imagining his wishes thwarted  he would leave the decision entirely in the hands of his father and the bishop  luncheon brought the whole family together and sir john making room for his younger daughter beside him said fan did you know this about coley  she answered that she had some idea but no more could pass till the meal was ended when her father went into another room and she followed him the great grief broke out in the exclamation i cant let him go but even as the words were uttered they were caught back as it were withgod forbid i should stop him  the subject could not be pursued for the bishop was public property among the friends and neighbours and the rest of the day was bestowed upon them  he preached on the sunday at alfington where the people thronged to hear him little thinking of the consequences of his visit  not till afterwards were the bishop and the father alone together when sir john brought the subject forward  the bishop has since said that what struck him most was the calm balancing of arguments like a true christian judge  sir john spoke of the great comfort he had in this son cut off as he was by his infirmity from so much of society and enjoying the young mans coming in to talk about his work  he dwelt on all with entire absence of excitement and added but there what right have i to stand in his way  how do i know that i may live another year  and as the conversation ended mind he said i give him wholly not with any thought of seeing him again  i will not have him thinking he must come home again to see me  that resolution was the cause of much peace of mind to both father and son  after family prayers that sunday night when all the rest had gone upstairs the bishop detained the young man and told him the result of the conversation then added now my dear coley having ascertained your own state of mind and having spoken at length to your father and your family i can no longer hesitate as far as you recognise any power to call on my part to invite you most distinctly to the work  the reply was full acceptance  then taking his hand the bishop said god bless you my dear coley it is a great comfort to me to have you for a friend and companion  such was the outward and such the inward vocation to the deacon now within a month of the priesthood  was it not an evident call from him by whom the whole church is governed and sanctified  and surely the noble old man who forced himself not to withhold his son his firstborn son received his crown from him who said with blessing i will bless thee  and he wrote to his brother   august 21  my dear old jemi have news for you of an unexpected and startling kind about myself and i am afraid that it will cause you some pain to hear what i am to tell you  you must know that for years i have felt a strong leaning toward missionary work and though my proceedings at alfington and even the fact of going thither might seem to militate against such a notion yet the feeling has been continually present to me and constantly exercising an increasing influence over me  i trust i have not taken an enthusiastic or romantic view of things my own firm hope and trust is that i have decided upon calm deliberate conviction and it is some proof of this that fanny and joan have already guessed my state of mind and months ago anticipated what has now taken place and so dear jem you must help them all to bear what will of course be a great trial this is my trial also for it is hard to bear the thought that i may be giving unnecessary pain and causing distress without really having considered sufficiently the whole matter  but then i think god does not call now by an open vision this thought has been for years working in my mind it was his providence that brought me into contact with the bishop in times past and has led me to speak now i cannot doubt this  i feel sure that if i was alone in the world i should go the only question that remains is am i bound to stay for my dear fathers sake or for the sake of you all and this has been answered for me by father and the bishop  and now my dear jem think well over my character sift it thoroughly and try to see what there is which may have induced me to act wrongly in a matter of so much consequence  this is the kindest thing you can do for we ought to take every precaution not to make a mistake before it is too late speak out quite plainly do tell me distinctly as far as you can see them my prevailing faults what they were in boyhood at eton and at college  it may help me to contemplate more clearly and truly the prospect before me  we shall have many opportunities i trust of discussing all this byandby  i shall tell uncle john because some arrangements must be made about alfington as soon as may be  my tutor knows something about it already it will soon be known to more  but do not suppose that i imagine myself better qualified for this work than hundreds of others more earnest and infinitely more unselfish and practically good but i have received an invitation to a peculiar work which is not offered to many others  we must all look onwards we must try to think of this world as but a short moment in our existence our real life and home is beyond the grave on september 24th i hope to be ordained priest think of me and pray for me my dear old fellow that god will give me more of your own unselfishness and care and interest for others and teach me to act not according to my own will and pleasure but solely with a view to his honour and glory  god bless you my dear old jem my dear dear brother  your most loving brother  j c p   from that moment the matter was treated as fixed and only three days later the intention was announced to the relations at thorverton  this is the letter to the little fatherless cousin paulina martyn who had always been devoted to coley and whom he loved with a triple portion of the affection children always gained from him  she was only eight years old but had the precocity of solitary children much attended to by their elders   feniton august 24 1854  my darling penai am going to tell you a secret and i am afraid it is one which will make you feel very sorry for a little while  do you remember my talking to you one day after breakfast rather gravely and telling you afterwards it was my first sermon to you well my darling i was trying to hint to you that you must not expect to go on very long in this world without troubles and trials and that the use of them is to make us think more about god and about heaven and to remember that our real and unchangeable happiness is not to be found in this world but in the next  it was rather strange for me to say all this to a bright happy good child like you and i told you that you ought to be bright and happy and to thank god for making you so  it is never right for us to try to make ourselves sad and grieve  good people and good children are cheerful and happy although they may have plenty of trials and troubles  you see how quietly and patiently mamma and grandpapa and grandmamma take all their trouble about dear aunty that is a good lesson for us all and now my darling i will tell you my secret  i am going to sail at christmas if i live so long a great way from england right to the other end of the world with the good bishop of new zealand  i dare say you know where to find it on the globe  clergymen are wanted out there to make known the word of god to the poor ignorant people and for many reasons it is thought right that i should go so after christmas you will not see me again for a very long time perhaps never in this world but i shall write to you very often and send you ferns and seeds and tell you about the norfolk island pines and you must write to me and tell me all about yourself and always think of me and pray for me as one who loves you dearly with all his heart and will never cease to pray god that the purity and innocence of your childhood may accompany you all through your life and make you a blessing as you are now my darling to your dear mother and all who know you  ever your most affectionate  j c patteson   to the childs mother the words are  i pray god that i may have chosen aright and that if i have acted from sudden impulse too much from love of display or from desire to raise some interest about myself or from any other selfish and unholy motive it may be mercifully forgiven  now at all events i must pray that with a single honest desire for gods glory i may look straight onwards towards the mark  i must forget what is behind i must not lose time in analysing my state of mind to see how during years past this wish has worked itself out i trust the wish is from god and now i must forget myself and think only of the work whereunto i am called  but it is hard to flesh and blood to think of the pain i am causing my dear dear father and the pain i am causing to others outside my own circle here  but they are all satisfied that i am doing what is right and it would surprise you although you know them so well to hear the calmness with which we talk about outfits  a heavy grief was even now on the family  the beloved uncle frank so often affectionately mentioned had been failing for some time  he had taken a journey abroad with one of his daughters in hopes of refreshment and invigoration but the fatigue and excitement were more than he could bear he returned home and took to his bed he suffered no pain and was in a heavenly state of mind indeed a most blessed deathbed most suggestive of comfort and peace to all who survive as a most evident proof of what the close of life may be if only that life is spent faithfully in doing our duty to godas patteson wrote to his old friend miss neill  and now one word about myself which at such a time i should not obtrude upon you but that the visit of the bishop of new zealand made it necessary for me to speak  i am going with him to work if all is well at the antipodes believing that the growing desire for missionary work which for years has been striving within me ought no longer to be resisted and trusting that i am not mistaken in supposing that this is the line of duty that god has marked out for me  you may be sure that all this is done with the full consent and approbation of my dear father  he and the bishop had a great deal of conversation about it and i left it entirely for them to determine that it will be a great trial to us all at christmas when we sail i cannot conceal from myself it is so great a separation that i cannot expect ever to see my dear father perhaps not any of those i love best again in this world  but if you all know that i am doing or trying to do what is right you will all be happy about me and what has just been taking place at the manor house teaches us to look on a little to a blessed meeting in a better place soon  it is from no dissatisfaction at my present position that i am induced to take this step  i have been very happy at alfington and i hope to be ordained priest on the 24th of september with a calm mind  i trust i am not following any sudden hasty impulse but obeying a real call to a real work and in the midst of much selfseeking and other alloy not wholly without a sincere desire to labour for the honour and glory of god  with this purpose full in view coleridge patteson received ordination as a priest in the ensuing ember week again at the hands of bishop phillpotts in exeter cathedral where a beautiful marble pulpit is to commemorate the fact  the wrench from home and friends could not but be terrible  the sisters indeed were so far prepared that they had been aware from the first of his wish and his mothers reception of it and when they told their father he was pleased and comforted for truly he was upheld by the strength of willing sacrifice  those were likewise sustained who felt the spirit of missionary enterprise and sympathy which was at that time so strongly infused into the church but the shock was severe to many and especially to the brother who had been devoted to coley from their earliest infancy and among his relations the grief was great  as to the district of alfington the distress was extreme  the people had viewed mr patteson as their exclusive property and could not forgive the bishop of new zealand for as they imagined tempting him away  ah sir was the schoolmistresss answer to some warm words from mr justice coleridge in praise of bishop selwyn he may beno doubt he isa very good man  i only wish he had kept his hands off alfington  it would not be easy says the parishioner from whom i have already quoted to describe the intense sorrow in view of separation  mr patteson did all he could to assure us that it was his own will and act consequent upon the conviction that it was gods will that he should go and to exonerate the bishop but for some time he was regarded as the immediate cause of our loss and he never knew half the hard things said of him by the same people who when they heard he was coming and would preach on the sunday did their utmost to make themselves and their children look their very best  indeed the affectionate writer seems to have shared the poor peoples feeling that they had thus festally received a sort of traitor with designs upon their pastor  she goes on to tell of his ministrations to her mother whose deathbed was the first he attended as a priest  it would be impossible for me to say all he was to her  not long before her death when he had just left the room she said i have not felt any pain or weakness whilst mr patteson has been here  i was not always present during his visits to her and i think their closer communings were only known to him above but their effects were discernible in that deep confidence in him on her part and that lasting impression on him for you will remember in his letter last april he goes back in memory to that time and calls ita solemn scene in my early ministry  solemn indeed it was to us all that last night of her life upon earth  he was with her from about the middle of the day on monday until about four oclock on tuesday morning when after commending her soul to god he closed her eyes with his own hands and taking out his watch told us the hour and moment of her departure  he then went home and apprised miss wilkins of her death in these words my soul fleeth unto the lord before the morning watch i say before the morning watch and at the earliest dawn of day the villagers were made aware that she had passed away by the tolling bell and tolled by him  this was not the only death during his ministry among us but it was the first occasion where he gave the communion of the sick also when he read the burial service cases of rejoicing with those that rejoiced as well as of weeping with those that wept the child and the aged seemed alike to appreciate his goodness  in him were combined those qualities which could inspire with deep reverence and entire confidence  many many are or will be the stars in the crown of his rejoicing and some owe to him under god their deeper work of grace in the heart and their quickening in the divine life  a remarkable testimony is this to the impression remaining after the lapse of sixteen years from a ministry extending over no more than seventeen months  our mr patteson the people called him to the last  yet in the face of all this grief the parting till death the work broken off the life cut short midway the profusion of needs at home for able ministers is it to be regretted that coleridge patteson devoted himself to the more remote fields abroad  i think we shall find that his judgment was right  alfington might love him dearly but the numbers were too small to afford full scope for his powers and he would have experienced the trials of cramped and unemployed energies had he remained there beyond his apprenticeship  nor were his gifts so far as can be judged exactly those most requisite for work in large towns  he could deal with individuals better than with masses and his metaphysical mind coupled with the curious difficulty he had in writing to an unrealised public either in sermons or reports might have rendered him less effective than men of less ability  he avoided moreover the temptations pain and sting of the intellectual warfare within the bosom of the church and served her cause more effectually on her borders than he could in her home turmoils  his great and peculiar gifts of languages seconded by his capacity for navigation enabled him to be the builder up of the melanesian church in so remarkable a manner that one can hardly suppose but that he was marked out for it and these endowments would have found no scope in an ordinary career  above all no man can safely refuse the call to obey the higher leadings of grace  if he deny them he will probably fall below that which he was before and lose even that which he seemeth to have  a few days later he wrote to his cousin arthur coleridge an expression of his feelings regarding the step he had taken in the midst of the pain it was costing to others   feniton november 11 9 am  my dear arthuryour letter was very acceptable because i am i confess in that state of mind occasionally when the assurance of my being right coming from another tends to strengthen my own conviction  i do not really doubt as i believe and yet knowing my want of consideration for others and many other thoughts which naturally prevent my exercising a clear sound judgment on a matter affecting myself i sometimes when i have had a conversation it throws me back upon analysing my own conduct feel inclined to go over the whole process again and that is somewhat trying  on the other hand i am almost strangely free from excitement  i live on exactly as i did before and even when alone with father talk just as i used to talk have nothing more to tell him not knowing how to make a better use of these last quiet evenings  byandby i shall wish i had done otherwise perhaps but i do not know now that i have anything specially requiring our consideration we talk about family matters the movements in the theological and political world c very little about ourselves  one of all others i delight to think of for the musics sake and far more for the glorious thought that it conveys  then shall the righteous not indeed that i dare apply it to myself as you know but it helps one on teaches what we may be what our two dear parents are and somehow the intervening space becomes smaller as the eye is fixed steadily on the glory beyond  god bless you my dear fellow  ever your affectionate  j c p   the mission party intended to sail immediately after christmas in the southern cross the schooner which was being built at blackwall for voyages among the melanesian isles  in expectation of this patteson went up to london in the beginning of december when the admirable crayon likeness was taken by mr richmond an engraving from which is here given  he then took his last leave of his uncle and of the cousins who had been so dear to him ever since the old days of daily meeting in childhood and miss neill then a permanent invalid notes down on december 13 i had the happiness of receiving the holy communion from dear coley patteson and the following morning i parted from him as i fear for ever  god bless and prosper him and guard him in all the dangers he will encounter  he wrote thus soon after his return   feniton december 22 1854  my dear miss neilli began a note to you a day or two ago but i could not go on with it for i have had so very much to do in church and out of it parochializing writing sermons c  it makes some little difference in point of time whether i am living here or at alfington and so the walking about from one house to another is not so convenient for writing letters as for thinking over sermons  i need not tell you what a real happiness and comfort it is to me to have been with you again and to have talked so long with you and most of all to have received the communion with you  it is a blessed thought that no interval of space or time can interrupt that communion of the spirit and that we are one in him though working in different corners of the lords field  i want to look you out a little book or two and fanny has told you that if ever my picture is photographed i have particularly desired them to send you a copy with my love  your cross i have now round my neck and i shall always wear it it will hang there with a locket containing locks of hair of my dear father and mother the girls and jem  you will be glad to hear that they all seem cheerful and hearty fan is not well but i do not see that she is depressed or unhappy in fact the terrible events of the war prove a lesson to all and they feel i suppose that it might be far worse and that so long as i am doing my duty there is no cause for sorrow  still there will be seasons of loneliness and sadness and it seems to me as if it always was so in the case of all the people of whom we read in the bible  our lord distinctly taught his disciples to expect it to be so and even experienced this sorrow of heart himself filling up the full measure of his cup of bitterness  so i dont learn that i ought exactly to wish it to be otherwise so much is said in the bible about being made partaker of his sufferings only i pray that it may please god to bear me up in the midst of it i must repeat that your example is constantly before me as a witness to the power that god gives of enduring pain and sickness  it is indeed and great comfort it gives me  he is not indeed keeping you still in the world without giving you a work to do and enabling you from your bed of sickness to influence strongly a circle of friends  god bless you for all your kindness to me and watchfulness over me as a child for your daily thought of me and prayers for me and may he grant that i may wear your precious gift not only on but in my heart  always your very affectionate  j c patteson  psi do not expect to sail for three weeks this morning i had a line about the ship and they say that she cannot be ready for a fortnight   on christmasday he was presented with a bible subscribed for by the whole alfington population here is a sentence from his letter of acknowledgment  if these poor needy souls can from love to a fellow creature whom they have known but a few months deny themselves their very crumb of bread to show their affection what should be our conduct to him from whom we have received all things and to whom we owe our life strength and all that we possess  the farewell service was said by one of these poor old people to be like a great funeral  sexagesima sunday was sir johns sixtysixth birthday and it was spent in expectation that it would be the last of the whole party at home for on the monday sir john was obliged to go to london for a meeting of the judicial committee  the two notes his son wrote during his absence are perhaps to prove good spirits full of the delights of skating which were afforded by the exceptionally severe frost of february 1855 which came opportunely to regale with this favourite pastime one who would never tread on solid ice again  he wrote with zest of the large merry party of cousins skating together of the dismay of the old housekeeper when he skimmed her in a chair over the ice sighing out in her terror my dear man dont ye go so fast with all manner of endearing expressionsof the little boys to whom he threw nuts to be scrambled for and of his own plunge through the thinner ice when regardless of drenched garments he went on with the sport to the last and came home with clothes frozen as stiff as a board  he was not gone when his father and brother came home on the twenty sixth prepared to go with him to southampton  the note to his cousin arthur written at this time thus ends we worked together once at dresden  whatever we have acquired in the way of accomplishments languages love of art and music everything brings us into contact with somebody and gives us the power of influencing them for good and all to the glory of god  many were touched when on the first sunday in lent as sir john patteson was wont to assist in church by reading the lessons it fell to him to pronounce the blessing of god upon the patriarch for his willing surrender of his son  after all the southern cross was detected in leaking again and as she was so small that the mission party would have been most inconveniently crowded for so long a voyage the bishop was at length persuaded to relinquish his intention of sailing in her and passages were taken for himself mrs selwyn mr patteson and another clergyman in the duke of portland which did not sail till the end of march when patteson was to meet her at gravesend  thus he did not depart till the 25th  i leave home this morning i may say for it has struck midnight he wrote to miss neill  i bear with me to the worlds end your cross and the memory of one who is bearing with great and longtried patience the cross that god has laid upon her  he chose to walk to the coach that would take him to join the railway at cullompton  the last kisses were exchanged at the door and the sisters watched him out of sight then saw that their father was not standing with them  they consulted for a moment and then one of them silently looked into his sitting room and saw him with his little bible and their hearts were comforted concerning him  after that family prayers were never read without a clause for missionaries especially the absent member of this family  he went up to his brothers chambers in london whence a note was sent home the next day to his father  i write one line tonight to tell you that i am thank god calm and even cheerful  i stayed a few minutes in the churchyard after i left you picked a few primrose buds from dear mammas grave and then walked on  at intervals i felt a return of strong violent emotion but i soon became calm i read most of the way up and felt surprised that i could master my own feelings so much  how much i owe to the cheerful calm composure which you all showed this morning  i know it must have cost you all a great effort  it spared me a great one  on the 27th the brothers went on board the duke of portland and surveyed the cabins looking in at the wild scene of confusion sure to be presented by an emigrant ship on the last day in harbour  a long letter with a minute description of the ship and the arrangements ends with i have every blessing and comfort  not one is wanting  i am not in any excitement i think certainly i do not believe myself to be in such a state as to involve a reaction of feeling  of course if i am seedy at sea for a few days i shall feel lowspirited also most likely and miss you all more in consequence but that does not go below the surface  beneath is calm tranquil peace of mind  on the 28th the two brothers joined the large number of friends who went down with the mission party among them mr edward coleridge  parting notes were written from on board to all the most beloved to little paulina of bright hopes to miss neill of her cross to arthur the german greeting lebe wohl doch nicht auf ewigkeitto mr justice coleridge   march 28 1855  my dear uncleone line more to thank you for all your love and to pray for the blessing of god upon you and yours now and for ever  we sail today  such letters from home full of calm patient cheerful resignation to his will  wonderfully has god supported us through this trial  my kind love to arthur  always my dear uncle your affectionate grateful nephew  john coleridge patteson   perhaps the frame of mind in which coley left england can best be gathered from the following extract from a letter to his father from his uncle edward  while on board i had a good deal of quiet talk with him and was fully confirmed by his manner and words of that which i did not doubt before that the surrender of self which he has made has been put into his heart by gods holy spirit and that all his impulses for good are based on the firm foundation of trust in god and a due appreciation of his mortal as well as professional condition  i never saw a hand set on the plough stead with more firmness yet entire modesty or with an eye and heart less turned backwards on the world behind  i know you do not in any way repine at what you have allowed him to do and i feel sure that ere long you will see cause to bless god not only for having given you such a son but also for having put it into his heart so to devote himself to that particular work in the great vineyard  about 5 pm the duke of portland swung round with the tide strangers were ordered on shore coleridge and james patteson said their last farewells and while the younger brother went home by the nighttrain to carry the final greetings to his father and sisters the ship weighed anchor and the voyage was begun     chapter vi  the voyage and first year  18551856    when the see of new zealand was first formed archbishop howley committed to the care of the first bishop the multitudinous islands scattered in the south pacific   the technical bounds of the diocese were not defined but matters were to a certain degree simplified by bishop selwyns resolution only to deal with totally heathen isles and whatever superiority the authorised chief pastor might rightfully claim not to confuse the minds of the heathen by the sight of variations among christians and thus never to preach in any place already occupied by missions a resolution from which he only once departed in the case of a group apparently relinquished by its first teachers  this cut off all the properly called polynesian isles whose inhabitants are of the malay type and had been the objects of care to the london mission ever since the time of john williams also the fiji islands and a few which had been taken in hand by a scottish presbyterian mission but the groups which seem to form the third fringe round the northeastern curve of australia the new hebrides banks islands and solomon isles were almost entirely open ground with their population called melanesian or black islanders from their having much of the negro in their composition and complexion  these were regarded as less quick but more steady than the polynesian race with somewhat the same difference of character as there is between the teuton and the kelt  the reputation of cannibalism hung about many of the islands and there was no doubt of boats crews having been lost among them but in most cases there had been outrage to provoke reprisals  these islands had as yet been little visited except by captain cook their first discoverer and isolated spanish exploring expeditions but of late whalers and sandal wood traders both english and american had been finding their way among them and too often acting as irresponsible adventurous men of a low class are apt to do towards those whom they regard as an inferior race  mission work had hardly reached this region  it was in attempting it that john williams had met his death at erromango one of the new hebrides but one of his best institutions had been a school in one of the samoan or navigators islands in which were educated young men of the native races to be sent to the isles to prepare the way for white men  very nobly had these samoan pupils carried out his intentions braving dislike disease and death in the islands to which they were appointed and having the more to endure because they came without the prestige of a white man  moreover the language was no easier to them than to him as their native speech is entirely different from the melanesian which is besides broken into such an extraordinary number of different dialects varying from one village to another in an island not twenty miles long that a missionary declared that the people must have come straight from the tower of babel and gone on dividing their speech ever since  just at the time of the formation of the see of new zealand the excitement caused at home by williamss death had subsided and the london missions funds were at so low an ebb that so far from extending their work they had been obliged to let some of it fall into abeyance  all this came to the knowledge of the bishop of new zealand while he was occupied with the cares of his first seven years in his more immediate diocese and in 1848 he made a voyage of inspection in hms dido  he then perceived that to attempt the conversion of this host of isles of tropical climate through a resident english clergyman in each would be impossible besides which he knew that no church takes root without native clergy and he therefore intended bringing boys to new zealand and there educating them to become teachers to their countrymen  he had lately established near auckland for the sons of the colonists st johns college which in 1850 was placed under the reverend charles john abraham the former eton master who had joined the bishop to act as archdeacon and assist in the scheme of education and here it was planned that the young melanesians should be trained  the bishop possessed a little schooner of twentytwo tons the undine in which he was accustomed to make his expeditions along the coast and in august 1849 he set forth in her with a crew of four without a weapon of any sort to launch out into the deep and let down his nets for a draught  captain erskine of hms havannah readily undertook to afford him any assistance practicable and they were to cruise in company the undine serving as a pilot boat or tender on coasts where the only guide was a few rough sketches collected from small trading vessels  they met near tanna but not before the bishop had been in dillons bay on the island of erromango the scene of williamss murder and had allowed some of the natives to come on board his vessel as a first step towards friendly intercourse  the plan agreed on by the bishop and the captain was to go as far north as vate and return by way of the loyalty isles which fringe the east coast of new caledonia to touch at that large island and then visit the island of pines at its extreme south point and there enquire into a massacre said to have taken place  this was effected and in each place the natives showed themselves friendly  from new caledonia the bishop brought away a pupil named dallup and at two of the loyalty islands nengone or mare and lifu where samoan teachers had excited a great desire for farther instruction boys eagerly begged to go with him and two were taken from each in especial siapo a young nengone chief eighteen or nineteen years old of very pleasing aspect and with those dignified princely manners which rank is almost sure to give  the first thing done with such lads when they came on board was to make clothes for them and when they saw the needle employed in their service they were almost sure to beg to be taught the art and most of them soon became wonderfully dexterous in it  on the island of pines so called from the towerlike masses of the norfolk pine on the shores was at that time the french bishop of new caledonia the oul as the natives called him and his countrymen for whom they had little love  after an interview between the two bishops the undine returned to new zealand where the native boys were brought to st johns college  the system of education there combined agricultural labour and printing with study and the authorities and the boys shared according to their strength in both for there was nothing more prominent in the bishops plan than that the coloured man was not to be treated as a mere hewer of wood and drawer of water but as a maori once expressed the idea gentleman gentleman thought nothing that ought to be done at all too mean for him piggentleman never worked  the whole community including the ladies and their guests dined together in hall  the five boys behaved well siapo being a leader in all that was good and made advances in christian knowledge but it was one of the bishops principles that none of them should be baptized till he had proved whether his faith were strong enough to resist the trial of a return to his native home and heathen friends  the climate of new zealand is far too chilly for these inhabitants of tropical regions and it was absolutely necessary to return them to their homes during the winter quarter from june to august  the scheme therefore was to touch at their islands drop them there proceed then further on the voyage and then returning the same way resume them if they were willing to come under instruction for baptism and return to the college  in the lack of a common language bishop selwyn hoped to make them all learn english and only communicate with one another in that  the undine not being large enough for the purpose was exchanged for the border maid and in the course of the next three years an annual voyage was made and boys to the number of from twelve to fourteen brought home  siapo of nengone was by far the most promising scholar  he was a strong influence when at home on behalf of the samoan teachers and assisted in the building of a round chapel smoothly floored and plastered with coral lime  in 1852 he was baptized together with three of his friends in this chapel in his own island by the bishop in the presence of a thousand persons and received the name of george  when the border maid returned though he was convalescent from a severe illness he not only begged that he might come back but that the young girl to whom he was betrothed might be taken to new zealand to be trained in christian ways  ready consent was given and the little wabisane and her companion wasitutru little chattering bird were brought on board and arrayed in petticoats fashioned by the bishops own hands from his own counterpane with white skirts above embellished with a bow of scarlet ribbon the only piece of finery to be found in the border maid  the rev william nihill had spent the period of this trip at nengone and had become deeply interested in the people  the island was then thought likely to become a centre whence to work on adjacent places but to the grief and disappointment of all george siapo did not live through the summer at st  johns  he had never recovered his illness at home and rapidly declined but his faith burnt brighter as his frame became weaker and his heart was set on the conversion of his native country  he warmly begged mr nihill to return thither and recommended him to the protection of his friends and he wished his own brother to become scholar at st johns  his whole demeanour was that of a devoted christian and when he died in the january of the year 1853 he might be regarded as the firstfruits of the melanesian church  since mr nihill was about to return to nengone and there was a certain leaven of christianity in the place the girls were not subjected to the probation of a return before baptism but were christened caroline and sarah after mrs abraham and mrs selwyn  another very satisfactory pupil was little umao  an english sailor in a dreadful state of disease had been left behind by a whaler at erromango where the little umao a mere boy had attached himself to him and waited on him with the utmost care and patience though meeting with no return but blows and rough words  the man moved to tanna where there are mineral springs highly esteemed by the natives and when the border maid touched there in 1851 he was found in a terrible condition but with the little fellow faithfully attending him  the englishman was carried to sydney and left in the hospital there but umao begged not to be sent home for he said his parents cruelly illused him and his brothers and set them to watch the fire all night to keep off evil spirits so when new zealand became too cold for him he was sent to winter at the london societys station in anaiteum  his sweet friendly nature expanded under christian training but his health failed and in the course of the voyage of 1853 he became so ill that his baptism was hastened and he shortly after died in the bishops arms  two more boys cousins from lifu also died  there never was any suspicion or displeasure shown among the relatives of these youths their own habits were frightfully unhealthy they were not a long lived people and there was often great mortality among them and though they were grieved at the loss of their sons they never seemed distrustful or ungrateful  but it was evident that even in the summer months the climate of new zealand was trying to these tropical constitutions and as it was just then determined that norfolk island should no longer be the penal abode of the doubly convicted felons of botany bay but should instead become the home of the descendants of the mutineers of the bounty who had outgrown pitcairns island the bishop cast his eyes upon it as the place most likely to agree alike with english and melanesian constitutions and therefore eminently fitted for the place of instruction  the expenses of the voyages in the border maid had been met partly by the eton association and partly by another association at sydney where a warm interest in these attempts had been excited and maintained by the yearly visits of bishop selwyn who usually visited australia while the lads were wintering at their homes  but the border maid was superannuated nor had she ever been perfectly fitted for the purpose and when in 1853 the bishop was obliged to come to england to take measures for dividing his diocese he also hoped to obtain permission to establish a melanesian school on norfolk island and to obtain the means of building a schooner yacht small enough to be navigated in the narrow shallow creeks separating the clustered islets and yet capacious enough for the numerous passengers  in the meantime mr nihill went to nengone with his wife and child  his lungs were much affected but he hoped that the climate would prolong his power of working among the christian community who heartily loved and trusted him  other fellowlabourers the bishop hoped to obtain at home though it was his principle never to solicit men to come with him only to take those who offered themselves but all the particulars of the above narration had been known to coley patteson through the bishops correspondence with mr edward coleridge as well as by the yearly report put forth by the eton association and this no doubt served to keep up in his heart the flame that had burnt unseen for so many years and to determine its direction though he put himself unreservedly at the bishops disposal to work wherever he might be sent  the means for the mission ship southern cross were raised  she was built at blackwall by messrs wigram and after all the delays sailed on the very same day as the duke of portland  meantime here are a few extracts from pattesons journalletter during the voyage  seasickness was very slightly disabling with him he was up and about in a short time and on the 8th of april was writing  what a day this has been to me the twentyeighth anniversary of my baptism to begin with and then easter day spent at sea  april 20th lat 4° n long 25° wrather hot  it is very fine to see all the stars of the heavens almost rise and pass overhead and setgreat bear and southern cross shining as in rivalry of each other and both hemispheres showing forth all their glory  only the polar star that shines straight above you is gone below our horizon and one alone knows how much toil and perhaps sorrow there may be in store for me before i see it again  but there is and will be much happiness and comfort also for indeed i have great peace of mind and a firm conviction that i am doing what is right a feeling that god is directing and ordering the course of my life and whenever i take the only true view of the business of life i am happy and cheerful  may 10it is i find quite settled and was indeed always that i am to go always with the bishop roving about the melanesian department so that for some years if i live i shall be generally six months at sea  and not little to my delight i find that the six winter months ie your summer months are the ones that we shall spend in sailing about the islands within or near the tropics so that i shall have little more shivering limbs or blue hands though i may feel in the long run the effect of a migratory swallowlike life but the sea itself is a perpetual tonic and when i am thoroughly accustomed to a sea life i think i shall be better almost on board ship  this seems the place for bishop selwyns impression as written to a friend at this very time coley patteson is a treasure which i humbly set down as a divine recompense for our own boys  he is a good fellow and the tone of his mind is one which i can thoroughly enjoy content with the to aei present yet always aiming at a brighter and better future  footnote left at home for education  june 18you must think of us at 8 pm on sundaysjust at 820 am before you come down to prayers  the bishop has a service in the college chapel then after all the runners clergy who have district chapels have returned chanting psalms and reading collects which bear especially on the subject of unity introducing the special communion thanksgiving for whitsunday and the sanctus and the prayer for unity in the accession service  i feel that it must be an impressive and very happy way of ending the sunday and you will be at sunday prayers at the other end of the world praying with us  july 3still at sea  as soon as we rounded the north cape on friday june 29 a contrary wind sprang up and we have been beating about tacking between north cape and cape brett ever since  fine sunny weather and light winds but always from the south  to me it is a matter of entire indifference i am quite ready to go ashore but do not mind a few more days at sea  the climate is delightful thermometer on deck 55° to 60° and such glorious sunsets  there is really something peculiar in the delicacy of the colours herefaint pink and blue and such an idea of distance is given by the great transparency of the air  it is full moon too now and i walk the deck from eleven to twelve every night with no greatcoat thinking about you all and my future work  last night the bishop was with me and told me definitely about my occupation for the time to come  all day we have been slowly very slowly passing along from the north headland of the bay of islands to cape brett and along the land south of it  a fine coast it is full of fine harbours and creeks the bay itself like a large torbay only bolder  due south of us is the bream headland then the barrier islands  we are only about a mile from the shore and refreshing it is to look at it but as yet we have seen no beach the rock runs right into the sea  such bustle and excitement on board emigrants getting their things ready carpenters making the old duke look smart sailors scrubbing but no painting going on to our extreme delight  it is so calm quite as smooth as a small lake indeed there is less perceptible motion than i have felt on the lake of como  no backs no bones aching though here i speak for others more than for myself for the bishop began his talk last night by saying one great point is decided that you are a good sailor  so far you are qualified for melanesia  to this may be added that patteson had been farther preparing for this work by a diligent study of the maori language and likewise of navigation and what an instructor he had in the knowledge of the coasts may be gathered from the fact that an old sea captain living at kohimarama sent a note to st johns college stating that he was sure that the bishop had come for he knew every vessel that had ever come into auckland harbour and was sure this barque had never been there before yet she had come in the night through all the intricate passages and was rounding the heads without a pilot on board  he therefore concluded that the bishop must be on board as there was no other man that could have taken command of her at such a time and brought her into that harbour  the bishop and mrs selwyn went on shore as soon as possible patteson waited till the next day  indeed he wrote on july 5 that he was in no hurry to land since he knew no one in the whole neighbourhood but archdeacon abraham  then he describes the aspect of auckland from the sea  it looks much like a small seaside town but not so substantially built nor does it convey the same idea of comfort and wealth rude warehouses c being mixed up with private houses on the beach the town already extends to a distance of perhaps half a mile on each side of this cove on which the principal part of it is built  just in the centre of the cove stands the wesleyan chapel  on the rising ground on the east of the cove is the roman catholic chapel and on the west side is st  pauls church an early english stone building looking really ecclesiastical and homelike  the college at a distance of about five miles from the town on some higher ground northwest of it is reached from the harbour by a boat ascending a creek to within a mile of the buildings so that we shall not go into the town at all when we land  by water too will be our shortest at all events our quickest way from the college to the town  july 9 st johns collegethough we reached harbour on july 5 and landed the next day i have scarcely found a minute to write a line  imagine my feelings as i touched land and jumped ashore at a creek under judge martins house in the presence of rota waitoa the only native clergyman in the diocese levi who is perhaps to be ordained and four or five other natives  tena ra fa koe e ho a how are you my friends the common new zealand greeting said i as i shook hands with them one by one  we walked up from the beach to the house  roses in full flower and mimosa with a delicate golden flower and various other shrubs and flowers in full bloom midwinter recollect  the fragrance of the air the singing of the birds the fresh smell it was raining a little and the grass was steaming were delicious as you may suppose  here i was all at once carrying up baggage maoris before and behind and everything new and strange and yet i felt as if it were all right and natural the bishop and mrs selwyn had landed the day before and we were heartily welcomed  mr martin took me into his study  i am thankful to see you as a fresh labourer among us here a man of your name needs no introduction to a lawyer  nothing could exceed his kindness  he began talking of at once  we dined at about 1230  clean mutton chops potatoes and pumpkin very good indeed jam pudding bread and plenty of water beer i refused  it did taste so good i am quite ashamed of thinking about it  about two oclock i started with the bishop for the college nearly six miles from auckland  the bishop is at a kind of collegiate establishment on the outskirts of auckland where mr kissling a clergyman is the resident and thither i go on wednesday to live till october 1 when we start please god in the southern cross for the cruise around new zealand  here at mr kisslings i shall have work with maoris learning each day i trust to speak more correctly and fluently young men for teachers and it may be for clergymen will form at once my companions and my pupils a good proportion of them being nearly or quite of my own age  i am to be constantly at the judges running in and out working on sundays anywhere as i may be sent  so much for myself  the college is really all that is necessary for a thoroughly good and complete place of education the hall all lined with kauri pine wood a large handsome room collegiate capable of holding two hundred persons the schoolroom eighty feet long with admirable arrangements for holding classes separately  there are two very cosy rooms which belong to the bishop and mrs  selwyn respectively in one of which i am now sitting  on the walls are hanging about certain tokens of melanesia in the shape of gourds calabashes c such as i shall send you one day a spade on one side just as a common horse halter hanging from abrahams bookshelf betokens colonial life  our rooms are quite large enough bigger than my room at feniton but no furniture of course beyond a bedstead a table for writing and an old bookcase but it is never cold enough to care about furniture i clean of course my room in part make my bed help to clear away things after meals c and am quite accustomed to do without servants for anything but cooking  there is a weaving room which used to be well worked a printing press from c m s which has done some good work and is now at work againenglish maori greek and hebrew types  separate groups of buildings which once were filled with lads from different melanesian islesfarm buildings barns c  last of all the little chapel of kauri wood stained desk like the inside of a really good ecclesiastical building in england porch sw angle a semicircular apse at the west containing a large handsome stone font open seats of course the east end very simple semicircular apse small windows all full of stained glass raised one step no rails the bishops chair on the north side bench on the south  here my eye and my mind rested contentedly and peacefully  the little chapel holding about seventy persons is already dear to me  i preached in it last night at the seven oclock service  we chanted the unity psalms cxxii cxxiii cxxiv and cl heartily all joining to a dear old double chant in parts  i felt my heart very full as i spoke to them of the blessedness of prayer and spiritual communion  i was at tamaki in the morning where i read prayers the archdeacon preaching  a little stone church very rude and simple but singing again good and congregation of fiftyone attentive  at panmure about three miles off in the afternoon a tiny wooden churchwhere abraham took all the duty  in the evening in the chapel he read prayers and i preached to about thirtyfive or forty people  we left the chapel just as you were getting ready for breakfast and so passed my first sunday in new zealand  today i have had hard work i walked with abraham to aucklandsix miles of rough work i promise you except the two last  i believe it was in the course of this walk that patteson experimented on his maori a native whom they visited and who presently turned upon the archdeacon and demanded why do you not speak like te pattihana  such a compliment has seldom been paid on so early an attempt at colloquialism in a new language  journal continues  lugged down boxes big empty ones from the judges house to the beach  went with the bishop to the old ship packed up books brought away all our things almost helped to pack them in a cart and drag and then walked back to the college which i reached in the dark at 730  it is delightful to see the delight of the natives when they see the bishop  eh te pikopa and then they all come round him like children laughing and talking  two common men we met on friday from rotoma 150 miles off who said that their tribe had heard that the queen of england had taken away his salary and they had been having subscriptions for him every sunday  they are of various shades of colour some light brown some nearly black and some so tattooed all over that you cant tell what colour they are i was talking today to the best of my power with a native teacher upon whose face i could not see one spot as big as a shilling that was not tattooed beautifully done in a regular pattern one side corresponding to the other  each tribe as it is said i know not how truly has a pattern of its own so they wear their coatsof arms on their faces that is all  the young christian natives are not tattooed at all and i have been today with sydney whose father was the great fighting man of honghi miscalled shanghi who was presented to george iv  this young mans father helped to exterminate a whole tribe who lived on a part of the college property as it is now and he is said to be perhaps the first new zealander who was baptized as an infant  i find it hard to understand them they speak very indistinctlynot fast but their voices are thick in general  i hope to learn a good deal before october  my first letter from the ends of the world tells of my peace of mind of one sound and hearty in body and i thank god happy calm and cheerful in spirit   july 11 1855 st  johns college auckland  my dear fani do not doubt that i am where i ought to be i do think and trust that god has given me this work to do but i need earnest prayers for strength that i may do it  it is no light work to be suddenly transplanted from a quiet little country district where every one knew me and the prestige of dear fathers life and your active usefulness among the people made everything smooth for me to a work exceeding in magnitude anything that falls to the lot of an ordinary parish priest in englandin a strange land among a strange race of men in a newly forming and worldly society with no old familiar notions and customs to keep the machine moving and then to be made acquainted with such a mass of information respecting church government and discipline educational schemes conduct of clergy and teachers etc etc  it is well that i am hearty and sound in health or i should be regularly overwhelmed with it  two texts i think of constantly whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might  sufficient for the day etc  i hardly dare look forward to what my work may be on earth i cannot see my way but i feel sure that he is ordering it all and i try to look on beyond the earth when at length by gods mercy we may all find rest  that i have been so well in body and so cheerful in mind ever since i left homei mean cheerful on the whole not without seasons of sadness but so mercifully strengthened at all timesmust i think without any foolish enthusiasm be remembered by me as a special act of gods goodness and mercy  i was not the least weary of the sea another month or two would have made very little difference to me i think  i am very fond of it and i think of my voyages to come without any degree of dread from that cause and i have no reason to expect any great discomfort from any other  i have my whole stock of lemon syrup and lime juice so that the salt meat on the southern cross will be counteracted in that way and going round those islands we shall be ashore every few days  but what most surprises me is this that when i am alone as here at night in a great for it is large cheerless lonely room as i should have thought it once though i cant help thinking of my own comforts at home and all dear faces around me though i feel my whole heart swelling with love to you all still i am not at all sad or gloomy or cast down  this does surprise me i did not think it would or could be so  i have indeed prayed for it but i had not faith to believe that my prayer would be so granted  the fact itself is most certain  i have at alfington when alone of an evening experienced a greater sense of loneliness than i have once done out here  of this hitherto i feel no doubt it may be otherwise any day of course and to what else can i attribute this fact in all soberness of mind but to the mercy of god in strengthening me for my work  much of it may be the effect of a splendid climate upon my physique that is true for indeed to find flowers in full blossom green meadows hot suns birds singing etc in midwinter with a cool steady breeze from the sea invigorating me all the while is no doubt just what i require but today we have a northeaster which answers to your southwest wind with pouring rain and yet my spirits are not going down with the barometer  all the same the said barometer will probably soon recover himself for i believe these heavy storms seldom last long there is no fire in the room where i sit which is the bishops room when he is here no fireplace indeed as it opens into mrs selwyns room  the thermometer is 58° and it is midwinter   to miss neill on the same day after repeating his conviction that he was in the right place he says   i have written to them at home what i ought not perhaps to have said of myself but that it will give them comfortthat from all sides my being here as the bishops companion is hailed as likely to produce very beneficial results  but i must assure you that i fully know how your love for me and much too high opinion of me makes you fancy that i could be of use at home  but we must not even taking this view send our refuse men to the colonies  newly forming societies must be moulded by men of energy and power and high character in fact churches must be organised the gospel must be preached by men of earnest zeal for gods glory in the salvation of souls  to lower the standard of christian life by exhibiting a feeble faint glimmering instead of a burning shining light is to stamp upon the native mind a false impression it may be for ever  remember we have no ancient customs nor timehallowed usages to make up for personal indifference and apathy we have no momentum to carry on the machine  we have to start it and give it the first impulse under the guidance of the spirit of god and oh if it takes a wrong direction at first who can calculate the evil that must follow  it is easy to steer a vessel in smooth water with a fair breeze but how are you to keep her head straight in a rolling sea with no way on her   this letter with two or three more went by the first mail after his arrival  from that time he generally kept a journalletter and addressed it to one or other of his innermost home circle while the arrival of each post from home produced a whole sheaf of answers and comments on what was told by each correspondent of family political or church matters  sometimes the letter is so full of the subject of immediate interest as absolutely to leave no room for personal details of his own actual life and this became more the case as the residence in new zealand or norfolk island lost its novelty while it never absorbed him so as to narrow his interests he never missed a mail in writing to his father and sisters and a letter to his brother was equally regular but these latter were generally too much concerned with jamess own individual life to be as fully given as the other letters which were in fact a diary of facts thoughts and impressions   july 12 st stephens mr kisslings schoolhouseyou know i am to live here when not on the southern cross or journeying in the bush so i must describe first the place itself then my room in it  the house is a large onestoried building of wood no staircase in it but only a succession of rooms there are at present fourteen or sixteen girls in the school boarding here besides rota who is a native deacon spending a month here levi who is preparing for ordination and three other men  the house stands on tableland about four hundred yards from the sea commanding glorious views of the harbour sea and islands which form groups close round the coast  it is church property all round and the site of a future cathedral is within a stones throw of it now for my room plenty large enough to begin with not less than sixteen feet long by twelve wide and at least eleven high all wood not papered or painted which i like much as the kauri is a darkish grained wood no carpet of course but i am writing now at 10 pm with no fire and quite warm  the east side of the room is one great window latticed in a wooden frame outside it a verandah and such a beautiful view of the harbour and bay beyond  i will tell you exactly what i have done today since two oclock as a sample of my life  2 pm dinner roast mutton my seat between the bishop and eota fancy the long table with its double row of maoris  after dinner away with the bishop to the hospital a plain wooden building a mile off capable of taking in about forty patients in all  i am to visit it regularly when here taking that work off the parish clergymans shoulders and a great comfort it will be  i went through it today and had a long talk with the physician and surgeon and saw the male patients two of them natives  one of them is dying and so i am to be now talking as well as i can but at all events reading and praying with this poor fellow and a great happiness it is to have such a privilege and so on  came back to tea very pleasant  after tea made eota and sydney a youngman who knows english pretty well sit in my room nb there is but one chair in which i placed eota and then i made them read maori to me and read a good deal myself and then we talked as well as we could  at 615 prayers the whole party of maoris assembled  mr kissling read the first verse of the chapter joshua vi and we each read one verse in turn and then he questioned them for perhaps fifteen minutes  they were very intelligent and answered well and it was striking to see grownup men and young women sitting so patiently to be taught  then the evening service prayers and so i knelt with these good simple people and prayed with them for the first time  very much i enjoyed all this  soon after came supper a little talking and now here am i writing to you  i wish you could see the treeferns some are quite twenty feet high in the trunk for trunk it is and the great broad frond waves over it in a way that would make that child pena clap her hands with delight  then the geraniums and roses in blossom the yellow mimosa flower the wild moncha with a white flower growing everywhere and the great variety of evergreen trees none that i have seen being deciduous make the country very pretty  the great bare volcanic hills each with its welldefined crater stand up from among the woodlands and now from among pastures grazing hundreds of oxen and this with the grand sea views and shipping in the harbour make a very fine sight  july 14i write tonight because you will like a line from me on the day when first i have in any way ministered to a native of the country  i was in the hospital today talked a little and read st luke xv to one and prayed with another maori  the latter is dying he was baptized by the wesleyans but is not visited by them so i do not scruple to go to him  rota the native deacon was with me and be talked a long while with the poor fellow  it is a great comfort to me to have made a beginning  i did little more than read a few prayers from the visitation service but the man understood me well so i may be of use i hope  he has never received the lords supper but if there is time to prepare him the bishop wishes me to administer it to him  july 20yesterday in sailed the southern cross with not a spar carried away or sail lost perfectly sound and in a fit state to be off again at once  she left england on the same day that we did and arrived just a fortnight after us and this is attributable to her having kept in low latitudes not going higher than 39° whereas we were in 51° 30 which diminished the distance and brought us in the way of more favourable winds  i saw from my windows about 9 am a schooner in the distance and told the bishop i thought it might be the southern cross she has no figurehead and a very straight bow  through the day which was very rainy we kept looking from time to time through our glasses  at 3 pm  the bishop came in come along coley i do believe it is the southern cross  so i hurried on waterproofs knowing that we were in for some mudlarking off we went lugged down a borrowed boat to the water tide being out  i took one oar a maori another and off we went bishop steering  after twenty minutes pull or thereabouts we met her jumped on board and then such a broadside of questions and answers they had a capital passage  two men who were invalided when they started died on the voyageone of dysentery i thinkall the rest flourishing the three women respectable and tidylooking individuals and two children very well  after a while the bishop and i went off to shore in one of his boats pulled by two of the crew lowestoft fishermen fine young fellows as you ever saw  then we bought fresh meat onions bread etc for them and so home by 7 pm  mudlarking very slight on this occasion only walking over the flat swamp of lowwater marsh for a quarter of a mile but on tuesday we had a rich scene  bishop and i went to the duke of portland and brought off the rest of our things but it was low water so the boats could not come within a long way of the beach and the custom is for carts to go over the muddy sand which is tolerably hard as far into the water as they can perhaps two and a half or three feet deep when it is quite calm as it was on tuesday well in went our cart which had come from the college with three valuable horses while the bishop and i stood on the edge of the water  presently one of the horses lost his footing and then all at once all three slipped up and the danger was of their struggling violently and hurting themselves  one of those in the shafts had his head under water too for a time  instanter bishop and i had our coats off my trousers were rolled over my knees and in we rushed to the horses  such a plunging and splashing but they were all got up safe  this was about 4 pm and i was busy about the packages and getting them into the carts unloading at mr kisslings till past 8 but i did not catch cold  imagine an english bishop with attending parson cutting into the water up to their knees to disentangle their carthorses from the harness in full view of every person on the beach  this is your first lesson in mudlarking coley was the remark of the bishop as we laughed over our respective appearance  july 21i was finishing my sermon for the soldiers tomorrow at 1130 when mr kissling came in to say that the schooner just come into the harbour was the vessel which had been sent to bring mr and mrs nihill from nengone or mare island  he was in very bad health when he went there and great doubts were entertained as to his coming back  i was deputed to go and see  i ran a good part of the way to the town on to the pier and there heard that mr nihill was dead  an old acquaintance of mrs nihill was on the pier so i thought i should be in the way and came back told mrs kissling and went on to the judges and told mrs martin and mrs selwyn whilst there we saw a boat land a young lady and child on the beach just below the house and they sent me down  pouring with rain here on the beach taking shelter in a boathouse with her brother i found this poor young widow and so leaning on my arm she walked up to the house  i just waited to see mrs selwyn throw her arms round her neck and then walked straight off feeling that the furious rain and wind chimed in with a violent struggle which was just going on in my own mind  i go through such scenes firmly enough at the time but when my part is over i feel just like a child and i found the tears in my eyes for the universal sympathy which has been expressed by everyone here for the lonely situation of the nihills at nengone made me feel almost a personal interest in them  he was a good linguist and his loss will be severely felt by the bishop  august 14i marked out today some pretty places for the two wooden houses for the southern cross sailors at kohimarama focus of light a quiet retired spot with a beautiful sparkling beach the schooner lying just outside the little bay a third of a mile off forty or fifty acres of flat pasturage but only sixteen properly cleared and then an amphitheatre of low hills covered with new zealand vegetation  i passed fine ferns today quite thirty feet in the stem with great spreadingfronds like branches of the norfolk island pine almost  on the 17th of august came the welcome mail from home  oh what a delight it is to see your dear handwriting again is the cry in the reply  fathers i opened first and read his letter stopping often with tears of thankfulness in my eyes to thank god for enabling him not to be overanxious about me and for the blessing of knowing that he was as well as usual and also because his work so distasteful to him was drawing to a close  then i read fans for i had a secret feeling that i should hear most from her about alfington  on the evening of that day he wrote to fanny  in answer to the expression of the pain of separation he says   there is one above who knows what a trial it is to you  for myself hard as it is and almost too hard sometimes yet i have relief in the variety and unceasingmultiplicity of my occupations  not a moment of any day can i be said to be idle  literally i have not yet had a minute to untie my guardians but for you with more time for meditating with no change of scene with every object that meets you at home and in your daily walks reminding you of me it must indeed be such a trial as angels love to look upon when it is borne patiently and with a perfect assurance that god is ordering all things for our good and so let us struggle on to the end  all good powers are on our side and we shall meet by the infinite mercy one day when there shall be no separation for ever  i read on in your letter till i came to dear coley it is very hard to live without youand i broke down and cried like a child  i was quite alone out in the fields on a glorious bright day and it was the relief i had longed for  the few simple words told me the whole story and i prayed with my whole heart that you might find strength in the hour of sadness  do as you say you do let your natural feelings work do not force yourself to appear calm do not get excited if you can help it but if your mind is oppressed with the thought of my absence do not try to drive it away by talking about something else or taking up a book etc follow it out see what it ends in trace out the spiritual help and comfort which have already it may be resulted from it the growth of dependence upon god above meditate upon the real idea of separation and think of mamma and uncle frank   august 26 1855 1040 pm s stephens auckland  my dear arthuri am tired with my sunday work which is heavy in a colony but i just begin my note on the anniversary of your dear dear fathers death  how vividly i remember all the circumstances of the last ten daysthe peaceful holy happy close of a pure and well spent life  i do so think of him not a day passing without my mind dwelling on him i love to find myself calling up the image of his dear face and my heart is very full when i recollect all his love for me and the many many tokens of affection which he used to pour out from his warm generous loving heart  i can hardly tell you what an indescribable comfort it is to me now i think of these things cut off from the society and sympathy of friends and the associations of home the memory is very active in recalling such scenes and i almost live in them again  i have very little time for indulging in fancies of any kind now i begin to get an idea of what work is but in my walks or at night if i am awake i think of dear mamma and your dear father and others who are gone before with unmixed joy and comfort  you may be quite sure that i am not likely to forget anybody or anything connected with home  how i do watch and follow them through the hours of the day or night when we are both awake and at our work  i turn out at 645 and think of them at dinner or tea at 10 i think of them at evening prayers and by my own bedtime they are in morning church or busied about their different occupations and i fancy i can almost see them  so it goes on and still i am calm and happy and very well and i think i am in my place and hope to be made of some use some day  i like the natives in this school very much  the regular wild untamed fellow is not so pleasant at firstdirty unclothed always smoking a mass of blankets his wigwam sort of place filthy his food ditto but then he is probably intelligent hospitable and not insensible to the advantage of hearing about religion  it only wants a little practice to overcome ones english feelings about dress civilisation etc and that will soon come  but here the men are nice fellows and the women and girls make capital servants and so whereas many of the clergy and gentry do not keep a servant wages being enormous and ladies like your sisters and mine do the whole work of the housemaid nurserymaid and cook which i have seen and chatted about with them i on the contrary by miss maria a wondrous curlyheaded blackeyed maori damsel arrayed in a smock weiter nichts have my room swept bed made tubyes even in new zealanddaily filled and emptied and indeed all the establishment will do anything for me  i did not care about it as i did all for myself aboard ship but still i take it with a very good grace  in about six weeks i expect we shall sail all round the english settlement of new zealand and go to chatham island  this will occupy about three months and the voyage will be about 4000 miles then we start at once upon our return for four months in the bush among the native villages on foot  then once again taking ship away for melanesia  so that once off i shall be roving about for nearly a year and shall if all goes well begin the really missionary life  it is late and the post goes to morrow  goodbye my dear arthur write when you can  ever your affectionate  j  c  patteson   august 27i have just been interrupted by mrs kissling who came to ask me to baptize privately the young son of poor eota the native deacon and his wife terena  poor fellow  this child was born two or three days after he left this place for taranaki with the bishop so he has not seen his son as yet  he has one boy about four and has lost three or four others and now this little one about three weeks old seems to be dying  i was almost glad that the first time i baptized a native child using the native language should be on fans birthday  it was striking to see the unaffected sympathy of the natives here  the poor mother came with the child in her arms to the large room  a table with a white cloth in the centre and nearly the whole establishment assembled  i doubt if you would have seen in england grownup men and women more thoroughly in earnest  it was the most comforting private baptism i ever witnessed  henri has been for an hour or more this morning asking me questions which you would seldom hear from farmers or tradesmen at home showing a real acquaintance with the bible and such a desire hunger and thirst for knowledge  what was the manna in the wilderness he began  he thought it was food that angels actually lived upon and quoted the verse in the psalm readily so man did eat angels food so i took him into the whole question of the spiritual body the various passages meats for the belly etc our lords answer to the sadducees and so on to 1 cor xv  very interesting to watch the earnestness of the man and his real pleasure in assenting to the general conclusion expressed in 1 john iii 2 concerning our ignorance of what we shall be not implying want of power on gods part to explain but his divine will in not withdrawing the veil wholly from so great a mystery  e marama ana i see it clearly now he mea ngaro a mystery  his mind had wholly passed from the carnal material view of life in heaven and the idea of food for the support of the spiritual body and the capacity for receiving the higher truths as it were of christianity showed itself more clearly in the young new zealander than you would find perhaps in the whole extent of a country parish  i think that when i know the language well enough to catechize freely it will be far more interesting and i shall have a far more intelligent set of catechumens than in england  they seem especially fond of it ask questions constantly and will get to the bottom of the thing and when the catechist is up to the mark and quick and wily in both question and illustration they get so eager and animated all answering together quoting texts etc  i think that their knowledge of the bible is in some sense attributable to its being almost the only book printed that they care much about  the 11th of september produced another long letter full of home feeling drawn forth in response to his sister  here are some extracts   sometimes i cannot help wishing that i could say all this but not often  there is one who understands and in really great trials even it is well to lean only on him  but i must write freely  you will not think me moody and downhearted because i show you that i do miss you and often feel lonely and shut up in myself  this is exactly what i experience and i think if i was ill as you often are i should break down under it but god is very merciful to me in keeping me in very good health so that i am always actively engaged every day and when night comes i am weary in body and sleep sound almost always so that the time passes very rapidly indeed and i am living in a kind of dream hardly realizing the fact of my being at half the worlds distance from you but borne on from day to day i scarcely know how  indeed when i do look back upon the past six months i have abundant cause to be thankful  i never perhaps shall know fully how it is but somehow as a matter of fact i am on the whole cheerful and always busy and calm in mind  i dont have tumultuous bursts of feeling and overwhelming floods of recollection that sweep right away all composure  your first letters upset me more than once as i reread them but i think of you all habitually with real joy and peace of mind  and i am really happy not in the sense that happiness presents itself always or exactly in the way that i used to feel it when with you all or as i should feel it if i were walking up to the lodge with my whole heart swelling within me it is much more quiet and subdued and does not perhaps come and go quite as much but yet in the midst of all i half doubt sometimes whether everything about and within me is real  i just move on like a man in a dream but this again does not make me idle  i dont suppose i ever worked harder on the whole than i do now and i have much anxious work at the hospital  such cases fan  only two hours ago i left a poor sailor by whose side i had been kneeling near threequarters of an hour holding his sinking head and moistening his mouth with wine the dews of death on his forehead and his poor emaciated frame heaving like one great pulse at each breath  for four days that he has been there brought in a dying state from the merchantman i have been with him and yesterday i administered to him the holy communion  he had spoken earnestly of his real desire to testify the sincerity of his repentance and faith and love  i have been there daily for nine days but i cannot always manage it as it is nearly two miles off  the responsibility is great of dealing with such cases but i trust that god will pardon all my sad mistakes  i cannot withhold the bread of life when i see indications of real sorrow for sin and the simple readiness to obey the command of christ even though there is great ignorance and but little time to train a soul for heaven  i cannot as you may suppose prepare for my sunday work as i ought to do from want of time  last sunday i had three whole services besides reading the communion service and preaching at 11 am and reading prayers at 5 pm  i should have preached five times but that i left my sermon at mr ts thinking to go back for it  mrs k gave me an old woolmer the other day which gladdened my eyes  little bits of comfort come in you see in these ways  nothing can be kinder than the people here i mean in auckland and its neighbourhoodreal simple hearty kindness  perhaps the work at kohimarama is most irksome to me  it is no joke to keep sailors in good humour ashore and i fear that our presence on board was much needed during the passage out  with reference to his sisters reading he continuestake care of maurice fan i do not think it too much to say that he is simply and plainly unsound on the doctrine of the atonement i dont charge him with heresy from his standpoint but remember that you have not been brought into contact with quakers socinians c and that he may conceive of a way of reconciling metaphysically difficulties which a far inferior but less inquisitive and vorsehender geist pronounces for itself simply contrary to the word of god  there are two greek prepositions which contain the gist of the whole matter huper in behalf of and anti instead of in the place of maurices doctrine goes far to do away with the truth of the last as applied to the sacrifice of christ  i have an exceedingly high regard for him and respect for his goodness no less than his ability  his position has exposed him to very great difficulties and therefore if he is decidedly wrong it is not for us to judge him  read his kingdom of christ and his early books but he is on very slippery and dangerous ground now  it is indeed a great and noble task to propose to oneself vizto teach that god is our father and to expose the false and most unhappy idea that has at times prevailed of representing god as actuated by strong indignation resentment c against the human race so that men turned from him as from some fearful avenging power  this is the worst form of anthropomorphism but this is not the scriptural idea of a just god  we cannot perhaps conceive of absolute justice certainly we are no judges of gods own revealed scheme of reconciling justice with law and so i call maurices to a certain extent human teaching more philosophy than religion more metaphysics than revelation  on the 22nd the ordination took place and the second maori deacon was ordained levi or according to maori pronunciation eivata ahea a man of about thirtyeight whose character had long been tested  immediately after the bishop mrs selwyn mr patteson and the new deacon set forth on a coasting expedition in the new vessel  the language of the journal becomes nautical and strong in praise of the conduct of the little ship which took the party first to nelson where sunday the 7th of october was spent the bishop going ashore while patteson held a service for the sailors on board first going round to the vessels anchored in the harbour to invite the mens attendance but without much success  on the 10th he wrote  already i feel to a certain extent naturalized  i do not think i should despair of qualifying myself in three months for the charge of a native parish  i dont mean that i know the niceties of the language so as to speak it always correctly but i should be able to communicate with them on ordinary subjects and to preach and catechize  but after all melanesia is becoming more and more a substantial reality  the history of bishop selwyns visitation hardly belongs to pattesons life but after one sunday mornings ministration at queen charlottes sound patteson was thus entreated at 230 i was on shore again and soon surrounded by some thirty or forty natives with whom i talked a long while about the prospect of a clergyman being settled among them  we want you  you speak so plainly we can understand you  no i am going to the islands to the blacks there nb  the maoris speak of the blacks with a little touch of contempt  you are wanted here never mind the blacks  ought not the gospel to be preached to them too  they have no teacher  is it not right they should be taught as you have been  ke rae tika ana  yes yes that is right  the settlements then new of canterbury and dunedin were visited and then the bishop remaining on shore on other work the southern cross started for the chatham isles gaining high commendation for all the good qualities of which a schooner could be supposed capable  it was pretty to see the little vessel running away from the great broadbacked rollers which rolled over the shore far above  every now and then she shipped a sea and once her deck was quite full of water up to the gunwale nearly  and as for her future skipper he says i had plenty of work at navigation  it really is very puzzling at first so much to remembercurrents compass variation suns declination equation of time lee way c  but i think i have done my work pretty well up to now and of course it is a great pleasure as well as a considerable advantage to be able to give out the true and magnetic course of the ship and to be able from day to day to give out her position  the chatham islands are dependencies of new zealand inhabited by maoris and as it has fallen to the lot of few to visit them here is this extract concerning them  i buried a man there a retired sea captain who had spent some twenty years of his life in china and his widow was a chinese woman a little dot of a thing rather nicelooking  she spoke a little english and more maori  we walked through the pa to the burial ground some twenty natives all dressed in black ie  something black about them and many in a good suit attending the funeral levi had spent the day before sunday with them and had told them about me  as i approached the pa before the funeral they all raised the native cry of welcome the tangi  i advanced speaking to them collectively and then went through the ceremony of shaking hands with each one in order as they stood in a row saying something if i could think of it to each  after the funeral they all according to native custom sat down in the open air round a large cloth on the ground on which were spread tins of potatoes fish pork c  the leader came to me and said this is the maori fashion  come my friend and sit with us and deposited three bottles of beer at my feet while provisions enough for dan lambert were stored arounda sort of homeric way of honouring me and perhaps they made a benjamin of me  however i had already eaten a mouldy biscuit and had a glass of beer at the house of the chinawoman so i only said grace for them and after talking a little while i shook hands all round and went off  their hands being used as knives and forks were not a little greasy but of course one does not think of that  as i passed the end of the pa i heard a cry and saw a very old man with a perfectly white beard too old to come to the feast who had crawled out of his hut to see me  he had nothing on but a blanket and i was sorry i had not known of his being there that i might have gone to the old gentleman so we talked and shook hands and i set off for my eight miles walk back  the whole island is one vast peat field in many places below in a state of ignition then the earth crumbles away below and pits are formed rank with vegetation splendid soil for potatoes  christmasday was spent at wellington in services on shore the christmas dinner eaten on board but the evening spent at the governors in blind mans buff and other games with the children then evening prayers on board for the crew  the stay at wellington was altogether enjoyable and it ended by mr patteson taking the command of the vessel and returning with mrs selwyn to auckland while the bishop pursued his journey by land no small proof of the confidence inspired by so recent a mariner  he was sorry to lose the sight of the further visitation and in his new years letter of 1856 written soon after receiving a budget from home there is one little touch of home sickness  really it is a fine land with wonderful facilities for large manufacturing commercial and agricultural interests worth visiting too merely for the scenery but somehow enjoying scenery depends a good deal upon having ones own friends to enjoy it with one thing i do enjoy thoroughly and that is the splendid sunsets i dont remember anywhere to have seen such fine soft golden sunsets and they are not wanting in variety for occasionally he goes to bed among red and crimson and purple clouds with wild scuds flying above which suggest to me the propriety of turning up my bed and looking out for a good roll in the night  but there is certainly a peculiar transparency in the air which makes the distances look distant indeed  this trip so cheerfully described was rather a pull on the frame which had yet to become seasoned to the heat of the southern midsummer and there was a languor about the outward man the last remnant of the original sluggishness which if ever a doubt arose of the fitness of the instrument for the work awoke it during the voyage  there was depression likewise in part no doubt from the spending the first christmas away from home and friends and partly from a secret disappointment at the arrangement which made him for a time actingmaster not to say steward of the ship so that he had to live on board of her and make himself useful on sundays according to need in the churches on shore a desultory life very trying to him but which he bore with his usual quiet determination to do obediently and faithfully the duty laid on him without picking or choosing  the journalletters continue on the 17th of january wrote a maori sermon this morning not feeling able yet to preach extempore in the native language though it is much better to do so as soon as i can now i must stick to the vessel again  i have been quite frisky really for two days past and have actually slept on shore the fourth time since september 24  the sensation is exceedingly pleasant of firm ground underneath and clean water a basin c to wash in  and yet i almost like coming back to my ship home it is really very comfortable and you know i always liked being a good deal alone  i am reading for lightish reading the first part of the third volume of neanders church history which is all about missions  it is the fifth volume in the way his works are usually bound up and came out in this box the other day  it is very interesting especially to me now and it is curious to observe how much the great men insisted upon the necessity of attending to the more secular part of missionary workagriculture fishing and other means of humanizing the social condition of the heathen among whom they lived  columbanus and boniface and his pupil gregory and others all the german missionaries almost just went on the plan the bishop wants to work out here  2 pm  i am off to otaki to see my native parishioners  what different work from calling in at s ws and other good alfingtonians  the walk will be pleasant especially as i have been grinding away at navigation all the morning  my stupid head gets puzzled at that kind of work and yet it is very good for me just because it requires accuracy  29th  just as i am beginning to get some hold of the maori so as to make real use of it the island languages are beginning to come into work  i have a curious collection here nowsome given by the judge who is a great philologist others belonging to the bishopa ms grammar here one chapter of st mark in another language four gospels in a third a few chapters of kings with the lords prayer in a fourth besides marsdens malay grammar and lexicon  mrs  nihill has given me some few sheets of the nengone language and also lent me her husbands ms grammar  one letter written « but pronounced a sort of rg in the throat yet not like an ordinary guttural she declares took two years to learn  you may fancy i have enough to do and then all my housekeeping affairs take up a deal of time for i not only have to order things but to weigh them out help to cut out and weigh the meat c and am quite learned in the mysteries of the storeroom which to be sure is a curious place on board ship  i hope you are well suited with a housekeeper if i were at home i could fearlessly advertise for such a situation  i have passed through the preliminary steps of housemaid and scullerymaid and now having taken to serving out stores am quite qualified for the post especially after my last performance of making bread and even a cake  this seems to be the right place for the description which the wife of chief justice martin gives of mr patteson at this period  the first meeting she says was the beginning of an intimate friendship which has been one of the great blessings of our lives after a short stay at st johns college he came into residence at st stephens native institution of which archdeacon kissling was then the principal  he learned rapidly to read and speak maori and won all hearts there by his gentle unassuming manners  my husband was at that time a great invalid and as our dear friend was living within five minutes walk of our house he came in whenever he had a spare halfhour  he used to bring archer butlers sermons to read with us and i well remember the pleasant talks that ensued  the two minds were drawn together by common tasks and habits of thought both had great facility in acquiring languages and interest in all questions of philology  both were also readers of german writers on church history and of critical interpretation of the new testament and i think it was a help to the younger man to be able to discuss these and kindred subjects with an older and more trained mind  i had heard much of our dear friend before he arrived and i remember feeling a little disappointed at first though much drawn to him by his gentle affectionate thoughtfulness and goodness  he said little about his future work  he had come obedient to the call and was quietly waiting to do whatever should be set him to do  as my husband a few months later told sir john patteson there was no sudden flame of enthusiasm which would die down but a steady fire which would go on burning  to me he talked much of his home  he used to walk beside my pony and tell me about his dear fatherhow lovingly his voice used to linger over those wordsof the struggle it had been to leave him of the dreariness of the day of embarkation  years after he could hardly bear to recall it to mind i remember his bright look the first day it became certain that we must visit england  why then you will see my dear father and tell him all about me  i knew all his people quite well before and when i went to visit his little parish of alfington i seemed to recognise each cottage and its humble inmates so faithfully had he described his old people and haunts  one thing that specially impressed me was his reverent appreciation of the good he had gained from older friends  he certainly had not imbibed any of the indifference to the opinion of elders ascribed to the youth of this generation  dear old tutor his uncles sir john coleridge and dr coleridge to whom he looked up with almost filial reverence the beloved uncle frank whose holy life and death he dwelt on with a sort of awe how gratefully and humbly he spoke of the help he had got from them  he was full of enthusiasm about music painting and art in general  he would flow on to willing listeners of mendelssohn and other great composers and when he found that we hoped to visit italy he was just as eager about pictures  he owned that both at dresden and at rome he had weakened his eyes by constant study of his favourite masters  altogether he gave me the impression of having had a very happy youth and having enjoyed it thoroughly  his eton and oxford life the society of men of thought at his fathers house home interests foreign travel art happy days with his brother jem in the tyrol were all entertained as pleasant memories and yet he was able without conscious effort or struggle to put them all aside for his works sake  the bishop kindly gave us a passage to wellington in the southern cross and mr patteson went with us in charge of the vessel  we were five days at sea  i used to lie on the deck and watch with amused interest the struggle going on between his student habits and his practical duties which were peculiarly distasteful to him  he was never quite well at sea but was headachy and uncomfortable  he was scrupulously neat and clean and the dirt and stiffness displeased himhow much we never knew till he spoke out one day when very ill at our house in 1870  he was not apt at teaching but he used conscientiously to hear a young lad spell and read daily  he would come up with some book of thought in his hand and seemed buried in it till he suddenly would remember he ought to be directing or overlooking in some way  this would happen half a dozen times in an afternoon  he shrank at this time from finding fault  it was a positive distress to him  at wellington we parted  he seemed a little depressed i remember as to what use he would be  i said why you will be the son timothy  this was after some years of partially failing health when these feelings had become habitual  i do not think they existed in his earlier voyages so long waited for  his face brightened up at the thought  yes if i can release the bishop of some of his anxieties that will be enough  no doubt he was depressed at parting with the chief justice and mrs martin who were thoroughly homelike friends and whose return was then uncertain  his success as a seacaptain however encouraged him and he wrote as follows on his return   kohimarama march 6 1856  southern cross  my dear miss neillhow kind of you to write to me and such a nice long letter  it cost you a great effort i am sure and much pain i fear but i know it was a comfort to you that it was written and indeed it was a great happiness to me to read it  oh these letters the intense enjoyment of hearing about you all at home i know no pleasure like it now  fond as i always was of reading letters and papers the real happiness of a mail from england now is quite beyond the conception of any but a wanderer in foreign parts  our mail went out yesterday at 2 pm rather unluckily for me as i only returned from a very rapid and prosperous voyage to wellington yesterday morning  i took the chief justice and mrs martin such dear excellent people to wellington to meet the seringapatam homeward bound from that port and i brought back from wellington the governors sick wife and suite  only absent a fortnight for a voyage of 1100 miles including three days stay at wellington  the coast of new zealand is so uncertain and the corners so many in coasting from auckland to wellington that the usual passage occupies seven or eight days and when the southern cross  appeared yesterday morning in harbour i was told by several of the officers and other residents that they feared we had put back from foul weather or because the judge could not bear the motion of the vessel  they scarcely thought we could actually have been to wellington and returned  most thankful am i for such a fine passage for i had two sets of invalids the judge being only now as we trust recovering from a severe illness and mrs martin very weakly and i felt the responsibility of having the charge of them very much  this was my second trip as commodore the bishop still being on his land journey but we expect him in auckland at the end of the month  as you may suppose i am getting on with my navigation take sights of course and work out errors of watches place of ship c it is pretty and interesting work and though you know well enough that i have no turn for mathematics yet this kind of thing is rendered so easy nowadays by the tables that are constructed for nautical purposes that i do not think i should feel afraid of navigating a ship at all  the seamanship is another thing and that the master of the ship is responsible for you ask me dear miss neill where i am settled  why settled i suppose i am never to be i am a missionary you know not a stationary  but however my home is the southern cross where i live always in harbour as well as at sea highly compassionated by all my good friends here from the governor downwards and highly contented myself with the sole possession of a cosy little cabin nicely furnished with table lots of books and my dear fathers photograph which is an invaluable treasure and comfort to me  in harbour i live in the cabin  it is hung round with barometers aneroids sympiesometers fixed chest for chronometers charts c  of course wherever the southern cross goes i go too and i am a most complete skipper  i feel as natural with my quadrant in my hand as of old with a cricket bat then i do rather have good saltwater baths and see glorious sunsets and sunrises and starlight nights and the great manyvoiced ocean the winds and waves chiming all night with a solemn sound lapping against my ear as i lie in my canvas bed six feet by two and a half and fall sound asleep and dream of home  oh there is much that is really enjoyable in this kind of life and if the cares of the vessel management of men c do harass me sometimes it is very good for me security from such troubles having been anxiously and selfishly pursued by me at home  if it please god to give success to our mission work i may some day be settled if i live on some one of the countless islands of the south pacific looking after a kind of protestant propaganda college for the education of teachers and missionaries from among the islanders but this is all uncertain  now goodbye my dear miss neill  i never doubt that in all your sufferings god does administer abundant sources of consolation to you  even my life so painless and easy is teaching me that we judge of these things by a relative standard only and i can conceive of one duly trained and prepared for heaven that many most blessed anticipations of future rest may be vouchsafed in the midst of extreme bodily pain  it is in fact a kind of martyrdom and truly so when borne patiently for the love of christ  always my dear miss neill  your very affectionate  j  c  patteson   the sundays were days of little rest  clergy were too scarce for one with no fixed cure not to be made available to the utmost and the undeveloped state of the buildings and of all appliances of devotion fell heavily and coldly on one trained to beauty both of architecture and music though perhaps the variety of employment was the chief trial  his good friday and easter sundays journal show the sort of work that came on him  taurarua good fridayi am tired for walking about in a hot sun with a melanesian kit as we call them slung round the neck with clothes and books is really fatiguing  yesterday and today are just samples of colonial work  thursday 730 prayers in chapel 1030 communion service in chapel  walked two miles to see a parishioner of the archdeacons  130 dinner 230 walked to taurarua five and a half miles in a burning sun walked on to mr ts and back again three miles and a half more  7 tea wrote a sermon and went to bed  today service and sermon for 600 soldiers at 9 communion service and preached at 11  back to taurarua after three miles walk on to the college and read prayers at 7  not much work it is true but disjointed and therefore more fatiguing i do sometimes long almost for the rest of english life the quiet evening after the busy day but i must look on to a peaceful rest by and by meanwhile work away and to be sure i have a grand example in the bishop  easter dayi was at tamaki chapel a cold bare barnlike building of scoria all this country being of volcanic origin  fifty persons present perhaps two or three faint female voices two or three rough most discordant male voices all the attempt at singing no instrument of any kind  the burthen of trying to raise the tone of the whole service to a really rejoicing thankful character wholly i suppose upon myself and i so unequal to it  but the happy blessed services themselves they gradually absorbed the mind and withdrew it from all relative and comparative ideas of externals of worship  what a training it is here for the appreciation of the wondrous beauty of our church services calming all feeling of excitement and irreverent passionate zeal and enabling one to give full scope to the joy and glory of ones heart without i hope forgetting to rejoice with reverence and moderation  here at tamaki you have nothing but the help the services themselves give and i suppose that is very good for one in reality though at the time it makes one feel as if something was wanting in the hearty sympathy and support of earnest fellowworshippers  the college chapel nicely decorated  1st sunday after easter tauraruai walked in from the college yesterday afternoon took the soldiers service at 915 am communion service and sermon at st matthews at 11 hospital at 230  preached at st pauls at 6 pm reminding me of my sundays work when i was living at st  stephens  it is a comfort to have a sunday in auckland occasionallymore like a sunday with a real church and people responding and singing  so passed that first year which many an intending missionary before patteson has found a crucial test which he has not taken into his calculations  the soreness of the wrench from home is still fresh and there is no settled or regular work to occupy the mind while the hardships are exactly of the kind that have not been anticipated and are most harassing though unsatisfying to the imagination and all this when the health is adapting itself to a new climate and the spirits are least in time so that the temper is in the most likely condition to feel and resent any apparent slight or unexpected employment  no one knows how many high hopes have sunk how many intended workers have been turned aside by this ordeal of the first year  patteson however was accepting whatever was distasteful as wholesome training in the endurance of hardships and soon felt the benefit he reaped from it  the fastidiousness of his nature was being conquered his reluctance to rebuke forced out of being a hindrance and no doubt the longsought grace of humility was rendered far more attainable by the obedient fulfilment of these lowly tasks     chapter vii  the melanesian isles  18561857    and now in his twentyninth year after all the unconscious preparation of his education and the conscious preparation of two years coleridge patteson began the definite work of his life bishop selwyn was to sail with him in the southern cross making the voyage that had been intermitted during the expedition to england introducing him to the islands and testing his adaptation to the work there  the first point was however to be sydney with the hope of obtaining leave to use norfolk island as the headquarters of the mission  they meant to touch there weather permitting on their way northward  ascension day was always bishop selwyns favourite time for starting so that the charge might be ringing freshly in his ears and those of his companions go ye and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  there was morning service and holy communion at the little college chapel on the 1st of may ascension day of 1856 then the party went on board but their first start was only to coromandel bay in order that the bishop might arrange a dispute with the maoris and they then returned to auckland to take up mrs selwyn  the crew were five in number and mr leonard harper son of the future bishop of lyttelton likewise accompanied them and relieved patteson of his onerous duties as steward  the first adventure was such a storm as the little vessel had never yet encountered  the journalletter thus describes iton saturday morning it began to blow from the northeast and for the first time i experienced a circular gale or hurricane  mrs somerville i think somewhere describes the nature of them in her physical geography  the wind veered and hauled about a point or two but blew from the northeast with great force till about seven pm we could do no more with it and had to lie to  ask old d what that means if you cant understand my description of it  the principle of it is to set two small sails one fore and one aft lash the rudder wheel amidships make all snug put on hatches batten everything down and trust to ride out the storm  as the vessel falls away from the wind by the action of one sail it is brought up to it again by the othersail  thus her head is always kept to the wind and she meets the seas which if they caught her on the beam or the quarter would very likely send her down at once  about midnight on saturday the wind suddenly chopped round to wsw so that we were near the focus of the gale it blew harder and harder till we took down the one sail forward as the ropes and spars were enough for the wind to act upon  from 1 pm  to 7 pm  on sunday it blew furiously  the whole sea was one drift of foam and the surface of the water beaten down almost flat by the excessive violence of the wind which cut off the head of every wave as it strove to raise itself and carried it in clouds of spray and great masses of water driving and hurling it against any obstacle such as our little vessel with inconceivable fury  as i stood on deck gasping for breath my eyes literally unable to keep themselves open and only by glimpses getting a view of this most grand and terrible sight it seemed as if a furious snowstorm was raging over a swelling heaving dark mass of waters  when anything could be seen beyond the first or second line of waves the sky and sea appeared to meet in one cataract of rain and spray  a few birds were driving about like spirits of the storm  it was as shakspeare calls it a regular hurly  add to this the straining of the masts the creaking of the planks the shrill whistle of the wind in the ropes and cordage the occasional crash of a heavy sea as it struck us with a sharp sound and the rush of water over the decks down the companion and hatches that followed and you have a notion of a gale of wind  and yet this was far from all the wind and sea can do and we were never in any danger i believe  that is an unlucky sea at such a time may be fatal and if anything about the schooner had been unsound it might have been awkward  at prayers the bishop read the prayer to be used in a storm but i never myself entertained the idea of our being really in peril nor did i suffer anything like the anxiety that i did when we were rounding cape palliser on our way to wellington with the judge  here we had sea room and no fear of driving upon rocks it is blowing a good deal now as you see by my writing  i have a small inkbottle of glass made like an eelpot such as tax gatherers use tied to my buttonhole and with this i can scribble away in almost any sea  dear me you could not sit still a minute even now  i was qualmish on saturday and for a minute sick but pretty comfortable on sunday though wearied by the constant pitching and rolling  the day after this namely may 15 the bishop and mr patteson rowed into cascade bay norfolk island amid a heavy surf but they saw no cascade as there had been no rain for a long time and there were only rocks surmounted by pine trees no living creature no landing place as they coasted along  at last they saw a smoothlooking rock with an iron staple and concluding that it was the way of approach they watched their time and through the surf which broke over it they leapt on it and dashed ashore before the returning swell caught them  they walked inland and met a man one of twelve convicts who had been left behind to receive the pitcairners who had not yet arrived but were on their way from their original island in hms juno  the vegetation and climate struck them as beautiful there were oranges lemons sweet potatoes and common potatoes and english vegetables and the norfolk island pine growing to a great height but writes coley it is coarser in the leaf and less symmetrical in shape than i had expected  i thought to have seen the tree of veitchs nursery garden on a scale three or four times as large and so i might have done in any of the gardens but as they grow wild in the forest they are not so very different from the more common fir tribe  they saw one house but had little time and getting down to the smooth rock stood there barefooted till the boat could back in between the rollers the bishop leapt in at the first and the boat made off at once and till it could return patteson had to cling to the clamps to hinder himself from being washed off as six or seven waves broke over him before the boat could come near enough for another spring  these difficulties in landing were one of the recommendations of the island by isolating the future inhabitants from the demoralising visits of chance vessels  then followed some days of great enjoyment of the calm warmth of the semitropical winter chiefly varied by catching a young shark and contrasting him with his attendant pilot as the ugliest and prettiest of fish  patteson used the calm to write may 30 one of his introspective letters owning that he felt physical discomfort and found it hard to banish recollections of clean water dry clothes and drink not tasting like medicine but that he most of all missed the perfect unconstrained ease of home conversation  then he continues  but now dont you see fan how good this is for me  if you think impartially of me as you recollect me you will see how soft and indolent i was how easily i fell into selfindulgent habits how little i cared to exert myself and try and exercise the influence etc a clergyman may be supposed to possess there was nothing about me to indicate energy to fit me for working out a scheme and stamping my own mind upon others who came in contact with me perhaps there is no one person who can trace any sensible influence to anything i ever did or said  now i dont of course venture to say that this is otherwise now but i think that this is the best training to make it so  i think that i ought to be gaining strength of purpose resolution energy of character under these circumstances  and observe what should i be without some such change pressing on me  just imagine me such a one as i was at alfington alone on an island with twentyfive melanesian boys from half as many different islands to be trained clothed brought into orderly habits c the report of our proceedings made in some sort the test of the working of the mission and all this to be arranged ordered and worked out by me who found h b and w p a care too great for me  ont you see that i must become very different from what i wasmore of a man to say nothing of the higher and religious side of this question  while then there is much that my carnal selfindulgent nature does not at all like and while it is always trying to rebel my better sense and the true voice within tells me that independently of this particular work requiring such a discipline the discipline itself is good for the formation of my own character oh the month of june at feniton the rhododendrons azaleas and kalmias the burst of flowers and trees the song of thrush and blackbird both unknown to new zealand  the green meadows and cawing rooks and church towers and sunday bells and the bright sparkling river and leaping trout and the hedges with primrose and violet i should like to see a hedge again and i am afraid i must add the green peas and beans and various other garden productions which would make salt pork more palatable  yes i should like to see it all again but it is of the earth after all and i have the manytwinkling smile of ocean though there is no soft woodland dell to make it more beautiful by its contrast  well i have had a happy hour scribbling away and now to work  i am less distressed now he adds a few days later in the same strain at the absence of all that is customary in england on these occasions great festivals though i dare not say how far the loss of all these privileges produces a bad effect upon my heart and character  one often loses the spirit when the form is withdrawn and i still sorely long for the worship of god in the beauty of holiness and my mind reverts to ottery church and college chapels and vast glorious cathedrals  on the 10th of june the southern cross was in sydney harbour and remained there a fortnight bishop barker gladly welcoming the new arrivals though in general bishop selwyn and his chaplain announced themselves as like the man and woman in the weatherglass only comingout by turns since one or other had to be in charge of the ship but later an arrangement was made which set them more at liberty  and the churches at sydney were a great delight to patteson the architecture music and all the arrangements being like those among which he had been trained  a sunday worth a dozen gales of wind he exclaims but you can hardly judge of the effect produced by all the good substantial concomitants of divine worship upon one who for fourteen months has scarcely seen anything but a small wooden church with almost all the warmth of devotion resting on himself  i feel roused to the core i felt the blessing of worshipping the lord with a full heart in the beauty of holiness  a very good organ well played and my joy was great when we sang the long 78th psalm to an old chant of itself almost enough to upset me the congregation singing in parts with heart and voice  his exhilaration showed itself in a letter to his little cousin paulina martin   southern cross sydney harbour june 18 1856  my darling penaare you so anxious to have a letter from me and do you think i am going to forget all about you  however you have had long before this two or three letters from me i hope and when i write to grandpapa or grandmamma or mamma you must always take it as if a good deal was meant for you for i have not quite so much time for writing as you have i dare say in spite of music and french and history and geography and all the rest of it  but i do dearly love to write to you when i can and you must be quite certain that i shall always do so as i have opportunity  dont you ever talk to me about any of your english wateringplaces and seaport towns  no one knows anything about what an harbour can be for perfect beauty of earth air and sea for wooded banks and rocky heights and fine shipping and handsome buildings and all the bustle and stir of a town of 80000 inhabitants somehow lost and hidden among gum trees and norfolk island pines and parks and gravel walks and everywhere the magnificent sea view breaking in upon the eye  dont be angry darling for i love dawlish very much and would sooner go and sail the mary jane with you in some dear little basin among the rocks at low tide and watch all the little crabs and other creatures with long latin names than walk about sydney armin arm with the bishops of new zealand and newcastle to call on the governor  but i must say what i think about the natural scenery of places that i visit and nowhere even in new zealandno not even in queen charlottes sound nor in bankss peninsula have i seen anything so completely beautiful as this harbourheoi ano thats enough the governor told us yesterday that when he was at hobart town he made the convicts cut a path through one of the deep gullies running down from a mountain 4500 feet high to the sea  the path was two miles long and all the way the treeferns between twenty and thirty feet high formed a natural roof arched and vaulted like the fretted roofs of our tudor churches and chapels  there is a botanical garden here with a very good collection of all the australian trees and shrubs and with many new zealand and many semi tropical plants besides  all the english flowers and fruits grow here as well so that in the warmer months it must look beautiful it is close to the sea which runs here in little creeks and bays close up among the public walks and buildings and as the shore is all rocky and steep at low water there is no mud or swamp or seaweed but only clear green water quite deep and always calm and tranquil because the harbour is so broken up and diversified by innumerable islets gulfs c that no wind can raise any sea of consequence in it  just now it is winter timeslight frost at night but no appearance of it after the sun is up bright hot days and bracing cold nights the very perfection of a climate in winter but in summer very hot it is so funny to me to see regular stone and brick houses and shops and carriages and cabs c all quite new to me  tonight there is a great missionary meeting  bishops of sydney new zealand and newcastle present  bishop of newcastle and a mr king advocate the cause of the australian blacks and the bishop of new zealand and unfortunate i have to speechify about melanesia what on earth to say i dont know for of course the bishop will exhaust the subject before me  however i must try and not be in a great fright but i would sooner by half be going to have a talk with a parcel of maoris  now you must get fanny patteson to tell you all about our voyage from new zealand our adventure at norfolk island c  we sail on monday 23rd for norfolk island again as it is in our way to the solomon group because we shall get the se trades just about there and so run away in style to the solomon islands and perhaps farther north still but that is not probable this time  always my darling  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   this meeting was called by the australian board of missions to receive information or propositions concerning the missions to the australians and melanesians  bishop barker of sydney was in the chair and the bishop of newcastle who had made one melanesian cruise in the border maid was likewise present  the room was crowded to excess and from 900 to 1000 were certainly present many more failing to get in  afterwards patteson writes to his father  the bishop of new zealand in introducing me to the meeting spoke before all these people of you and me in a way that almost unnerved me and i had to speak next  what he said is not reported or very badlycalling me his dear friend with his voice quiveringi never saw him more or so much affectedi ought to be most thankful to god for giving me so dear a companion c but he spoke so of you and people here seemed to know of you coming up to me and asking about you after the meeting  the bishop of newcastle spoke of you most kindly and really with very great feeling  an evening i had dreaded ended happily  before i dined with the three bishops last night with chief justice sir alfred stephen and met the trio again bishop everywhere speaking of me as one of his family  no my boys are not with me but we have my dear friend mr patteson  of course all this exhibition of feeling never comes out when we are alone we know each other too well  and now the romance of mission work is over and the real labour is to begin  there has been bad work among the islands lately but you know in whose hands we are  the collections both at the door and on the following sunday were very large and a strong warm feeling was excited in sydney which has never since died away  mr patteson was much beloved there and always met with kind welcome and ready assistance from all classes but there was one great disappointment  the bishop of new zealand on formally setting before sir william denison governorgeneral of australia his plan for making norfolk island the site of a school for training melanesian teachers and eventually the seat of a bishopric received a refusal and was not permitted even to place a chaplain there  sir william as he tells us in his published diary had heard from some quarter or other rumours respecting the melanesian scholars which made him suppose that their presence might have a bad effect upon the pitcairners and repeated that his instructions were that the islanders should be left as much as possible to themselves  the request to be permitted to place mr patteson there was refused on the ground that norfolk island belonged to the see of tasmania and not to that of new zealand  but the bishop of tasmania could hardly visit it without great inconvenience and he had therefore placed it under the care of his brother of new zealand full in whose track it lay  the matter was referred to the colonial secretary and in the meantime bishop selwyn adhered to his purpose of visiting it on leaving sydney and though he could not place his chaplain there leaving mrs selwyn to assist in the work of training the new comers to the novelties of a more temperate climate and a more genial soil than they had known on the torrid rock of pitcairns island  accordingly on the 4th of july the southern cross again approached the island and finding that the pitcairners had come and that their magistrate and mr nobbs their clergyman would gladly welcome assistance the bishop brought mrs selwyn on shore and left her there to assist mr nobbs in preparing the entire population to be confirmed on his return  but the pitcairners have been amply written about and as coleridge pattesons connection with them was only incidental i shall not dwell on them or their history  the southern cross reached anaiteum on the 14th of july  this island was occupied by mr inglis and mr greddie of the scottish presbyterian mission who had done much towards improving the natives  small canoes soon began to come off to the vessel little craft consisting of no more than the trunk of a tree hollowed out seldom more than a foot broad and perhaps eighteen inches deep all with outriggersnamely a slight wooden frame or raft to balance them and for the most part containing two men or sometimes three or four  before long not less than fifteen or twenty had come on board with woolly hair and mahogany skins generally wearing a small strip of calico but some without even this  they were small men but lithe and supple and walked about the deck quite at ease chattering in a language no one understood except the words missy inglis as they pointed to a house  presently another canoe arrived with a samoan teacher with whom the bishop could converse and who said that mr geddie was at mare  they were soon followed by a whale boat with a tahitian native teacher a futuma man and a crew of anaiteans  the futuma man had expended his energies upon his hair which was elaborately dressed after a fashion that precluded the possibility of any attention being bestowed upon the rest of his person which was accordingly wholly unencumbered with any clothing  the perfection of this art apparently consisted in gathering up about a dozen hairs and binding them firmly with grass or fine twine of cocoanut fibre plastered with coral lime  as the hair grows the binding is lengthened also and only about four or five inches are suffered to escape from this confinement and are then frizzed and curled like a mop or a poodles coat  leonard harper and i returned in this boat tahitian steering samoan futuman and anaiteans making one motley crew  the brisk trade soon carried us to the beach in front of mr ingliss house and arrived at the reef i rode out pickaback on the samoan leonard following on a halfnaked anaitean  we soon found ourselves in the midst of a number of men women and children standing round mr inglis at the entrance of his garden  i explained to him the reason of the bishops being unable to land that he alone knew the harbour on the other side of island and so could not leave the vessel  then having delivered the boxes and letters we had brought for him from auckland we went into his house gazing with delight at cocoanut trees bananas breadfruit trees citrons lemons taro c with bright tropical colouring thrown over all lighting up the broad leaves and thick foliage of the trees around us  the house itself is built after the fashion of these islands of wattle plastered with coral lime the roof thatched with the leaves of the cocoanut and pandana the fences of the garden were made of cane prettily worked together in a cross pattern the path neatly kept and everything looking clean and tidy  we sat down in a small wellfurnished room and looked out upon the garden verandah and groups of men and women standing outside  presently mrs inglis came into the room and after some discussion i was persuaded to stay all night since the schooner could not reach her anchorage before dark and the next day the watercasks were to be filled  an excellent dinner was provided roast fowl with taro a nutritious root somewhat like potato rice and jam bananas and delicious fruit bread and scotch cheese with glasses of cocoanut milk  afterwards he showed us the arrangements for boarding young men and womentwelve of the former and fourteen of the latter  nothing could well exceed the cleanliness and order of their houses sleeping rooms and cooking rooms  the houses wattled and plastered had floors covered with native mats beds laid upon a raised platform running round the inner room mats and blankets for covering and bamboo cane for a pillow  the boys were some writing some making twine some summing when we went in the girls just putting on their bonnets of their own manufacture for school  they learn all household workcooking hemming sewing c the boys tend the poultry cows cultivate taro make arrowroot c  all of them could read fluently and all looked happy clean and healthy  the girls wear their native petticoats of cocoanut leaves with a calico body  boys wear trousers and some had shirts some waistcoats and a few jackets  we walked about a small wood adjoining the house through which a small freshwater stream runs  in the wood we saw specimens of the various trees and shrubs and flowers of the island including those already noticed in mr ingliss garden and the breadfruit tree and sugarcane and a beautiful bright flower of scarlet colour a convolvulus larger than any i had ever seen elsewhere also a tree bearing a very beautiful yellow flower  we then returned to the house and shortly afterwards went to the church which is at present used also as the schoolhouse though the uprights of a larger schoolhouse are already fixed in the ground  men women and children to the number of ninetyfour had assembled in a large oblong building wattled and plastered with open windows on all sides mats arranged on the floor and a raised platform or bench running round the building for persons who prefer to sit after the english instead of the native fashion  all that were called upon to read did so fluently the singing was harsh and nasal enough but in very good time their counting very good and their writing on slates quite equal to the average performance i am satisfied of a good english parish school  they listened attentively when mr inglis spoke to them and when at his request i said a few words which he translated  the most perfect order and quiet prevailed all the time we were in the school  at the end of the lessons they came forward and each one shook hands with leonard harper and myself smiling and laughing with their quick intelligent eyes and apparently pleased to see strangers among them  by this time it was dusk and we went back to the mission house and spent a pleasant evening asking and answering questions about anaiteum and the world beyond it until 8 pm when the boarders came to prayers with two or three persons who live about the place they read the third chapter of st  matthews gospel in turns verse by verse and then a prayer from mr inglis followed  at 830 we had private family prayers and at 9 went to bed  july 16we got up at four and were soon ready for our walk to the south side of the island mr inglis came with us and ten or twelve natives  for the first halfmile we walked along the beach among cocoanut trees bananas and sugarcanes the sun not yet above the horizon tingeing the light clouds with faint pink and purple lines the freshness of the early dawn and the soft breeze playing about us gladdening at once our eyes and our hearts  soon we struck off to the south and passing through taro plantations began to ascend the slopes of the island  as we walked along we heard the sound of the logs beaten together summoning the people to attend the various schools planted in every locality under the management of native teachers and we had a good opportunity of observing the careful system of irrigation adopted by the natives for the cultivation of the taro plant  following the course of a small mountain stream we observed the labour with which the water was brought down from it upon causeways of earth carried in baskets from very considerable distances occasionally the watercourse is led round the head of various small ravines at other times the trunk of a tree is hollowed out and converted into an aqueduct but no pains have been wanting to make provision for the growth of the staple food of the island  from this scene of hope and encouragement the southern cross sailed on the sixteenth and passing erromango came in sight of fate also called sandwich a wooded island beautiful beyond description but with a bad character for cannibalism and where the samoan teachers had been murdered  so the approach was cautious and the vessel kept a mile from the shore and was soon surrounded with canoes one of them containing a native who had been instructed in samoa and was now acting as teacher  the first canoe that came had five men on board  girdles of beautifully plaited cocoanut fibre round their waists were their only clothing but some had wreaths of flowers and green leaves round their heads and most of them wore motherofpearl shells beads c round their necks and in their ears  they do not tattoo but brand their skins  all five came and presently three more and then another but seeing a large double canoe with perhaps twenty men in her coming close we stood away  two of our visitors chose to stay and we have them on board now alsoff a man of perhaps fortyfive and mospa a very intelligent young man from whom i am picking up words as fast as i can  f would have laughed to have seen me rigging them out in calico shirts buttoning them up  mospa gave me his wooden comb which they push through their hair as you ladies do coral or gold pins at parties  another fellow whose head was elaborately frizzled and plastered with coral lime departed with one of my common calico pockethandkerchiefs with my name in joans marking  this is to adorn his head and for aught i know is the first and certainly the best specimen of handwriting in the island we hope to call at all these islands on our way back from the north but at present we only dodge a few canoes c  july 20i suppose you like to know all little things so i tell you that our fate friends being presented each with a blanket just wound themselves up on the cabin floor one close to leonard and me and slept away in style that i soon taught them to eat with a knife and fork and today have almost succeeded in making them believe that plum pudding our sunday dish is a fine thing  july 21all day we have been very slowly drifting along the west side of espiritu santo  a grand mountainous chain runs along the whole island the peaks we estimate at 4000 feet high  this alone is a fine sightluxuriant vegetation to nearly the top of the peaks clouds resting upon the summit of the range from the evaporation caused by the vast amount of vegetable matter  as we were lying to about halfway along the coast we espied a brig at anchor close on shore  manned the boat and rowed about two miles to the brig found it was under the command of a notorious man among the sandalwood traders for many a dark deed of revenge and unscrupulous retaliation upon the natives  at nengone he shot three in cold blood who swam off to his ship because the people of the place were said to be about to attempt to take his vessel  at mallicolo but lately i fear he killed not less than eight though here there was some scuffling and provocation  for the nengone affair he was tried for his life at sydney captain erskine and the bishop having much to do with his prosecution  he is now dealing fairly apparently with these people and is certainly on very friendly terms with them  the bishop has known him many years and baptized some years ago his only child a son  we are glad to let these men see that we are about in these seas watching what they do and the bishop said mr  patteson is come from england on purpose to look after these islands as much as to say now there will be a regular visitation of them and outrages committed on the natives will probably be discovered  well on we rowed half a mile to shoresuch a lovely scene  a bend in the coral reef made a beautiful boat harbour and into it we rowed  clear as crystal was the water bright as tropical sun at 230 pm could make it was the foliage on the shore  numbers of children and boys were playing in the water or running about on the rocks and sands and there were several men about all of course naked and as they lead an amphibious life they find it very convenient  they work little breadfruit trees cocoanut trees and bananas grow naturally and the yam and taro cultivations are weeded and tended by the women  they have nothing to do but eat drink and sleep and lie on the warm coral rock and bathe in the surf  there was no shyness on the part of the children dear little fellows from six to ten clustering round me unable to understand my coat with pockets and what my socks could bei seemed to have two or three skins  the men came up and soon shook hands but did not seem to know the custom  a nengone man was ashore and with him i could talk a little  soon i was walking on shore arminarm with him stark naked and he was asking me about mrs nihill and her child  a little boy of the island held the other hand and so leaving the boat we walked inland into the bush to see a native village  ten minutes walk brought us to itcottages all of bamboos tied together with cocoanut fibre thatched with leaves a ridge pole and sloping roof on either side reaching to the ground  no upright poles or sidewalls they were quite open at the two ends perhaps 20 30 or even 40 feet long the general appearance clean and healthy  their food was kept on raised stages as in new zealand and they had plenty of earthenware pots and basins some of good shape and all apparently strong and serviceable  large wooden or earthenware platters are used for stirring up and pounding the yams with a heavy wooden pestle and they have a peculiar way of scraping the yam on a wooden board roughened like a grater into a pulp and then boiling it into a fine dough  they have plenty of pigs and dogs which they eat and some fowls spears i saw none but bows and arrows  i took a bow out of a mans hand and then an arrow and fitted it to the string he made signs that he shot birds with it  clubs they have but as far as i saw only used for killing pigs  there is a good deal of fighting on the island however  recollect with reference to all these places that an island fifty or sixty miles long one mass of forest with no path is not like an english county  it may take months to get an accurate knowledge of one of them we can only at present judge of the particular spots and bays we touch at  but there is every indication here of friendliness of a gentle soft disposition and i hope we shall take away some of the boys when we return  i never saw children more thoroughly attractive in appearance and mannerdear little fellows i longed to bring off some of them  you would have liked to have seen them playing with me laughing and jumping about these people dont look half so well when they have any clothes on they look shabby and gentish but seeing them on shore or just coming out of a canoe all glistening with water and looking so lithe and free they look very pleasant to the eye  the colour supplies the place of clothing  the chief and most of the men were unfortunately absent at a great feast held a few miles off but there were several women and many children  we went to their watering place about a quarter or half a mile from the beach a picturesque spot in a part of the wood to which the water from the hills is carried in canes of bamboo supported on cross sticks  the water was very clear and sweet and one of our little guides soon had a good showerbath standing under the shoot and then walking in the sun till in a few minutes his glistening skin was dry again  coming back we met a man carrying water in cocoanut shells six or eight hanging by strings two feet long at each end of a bamboo cane slung across over his shoulder nicely balanced and very pretty  one of our party carried perhaps two and a half gallons of water in a bamboo stuffed at the end with grass  about five pm we went back to the schooner and made sail for bauro san cristoval  at this place there was a great disappointment at first in the non appearance of william diddimang an old baptized scholar at st johns and though he came at last and dined on board he had evidently so far fallen away as to be unwilling to meet the bishop the canoes here were remarkably beautiful built of several pieces fastened with a kind of gum  the shape was light and elegant the thwarts elaborately carved with figures of birds or fish and the high prow inlaid with motherofpearl let into black wood  as a sunday at sea was preferable to one among curious visitors who must be entertained the schooner put out to sea to visit one to two other neighbouring islets and then to return again to bauro  kennell island where she touched on the 27th proved to be inhabited by maoris  one man who swam alone to the vessel offered the salutation of rubbing noses new zealand fashion and converse could be held in that language  two more joined him and spent the night on board in singing a kaka or song of love for their visitors  next day the island was visited  oh the beauty of the deep clefts in the coral reef lined with coral purple blue scarlet green and white the little blue fishes the bright blue starfish the little landcrabs walking away with other peoples shells  but nothing of this can be seen by you the coral loses its colour and who can show you the bright line of surf breaking the clear blue of this truly pacific ocean and the tropical sun piercing through masses of foliage which nothing less dazzling could penetrate  our three friends with two more men their wives and children form the whole population of the south end of the island at all events perhaps twenty in all  i trod upon and broke floweringbranches of coral that you would have wondered at  bellona likewise had a maorispeaking population  there was no passage through the reef so the bishop and patteson took off their coats one took two hatchets and the other two adzes and with a good header swam ashore  walking up the beach they found a place in the bush with nine beautiful canoes with nets and large wooden hooks in them but at first no people and they were leaving their presents in the canoes when patteson spied two men and advanced to them while the bishop went back to fetch the goods  after a rubbing of noses and a maori greeting the men were reassured and eleven more came up one a chief with a spear in his hand  i had my straw hat fastened by a ribbon which my friend coveted so i let him take it which he did by putting his adze my gift against it close to my ear and cutting it offnot the least occasion to be afraid of them  a characteristic comment certainly  but there was no foolhardiness  the bishop was on the alert and when presently he saw his companion linger for a moment a quick come along was a reminder that this was not the beach at sidmouth  the peculiar quickness of eyeverily circumspect though without the least betrayal of alarm or want of confidence which was learnt from the need of being always as it were on guard was soon learnt likewise by patteson while the air of suspicion or fear was most carefully avoided  the swim back to the boat was in water too warm but refreshing and ended with a dive under the boat for the pure pleasure of the thing  then as before arranged bauro was revisited on another part of the coast where iri was ready with a welcome but diddimang appeared no more  he had returned to native habits and had made no attempt at teaching but the visits he had made to new zealand were not lost for the bishop had acquired a knowledge of the language and it was moreover established in the bauro mind that a voyage in his ship was safe and desirable  this part of bauro was exceedingly beautiful  here were coral crags the masses of forest trees the creepers literally hundreds of feet long crawling along and hanging from the cliffs the cocoanut trees and bananas palms c the dark figures on the edge of the rocks looking down upon us from among the trees the people assembling on the bright beachcoral dust as it may be called for it was worn as fine as white sandcottages among the trees and a pond of fresh water close by winding away among the cliffs  here a visit was paid to iris boathouse which contained three exquisite canoes beautifully inlaid then to his house long low and open at the ends like those formerly described but with low wattled side walls  along the ridgepole were ranged twentyseven skulls not yet blackened with smoke and bones were scattered outside for a fight had recently taken place near at hand  in this golgotha the bishop using his little book of bauro words talked to the people and plainly told them that the great god hated wars and cruelty and such ornaments were horrible in his sight  iri took it all in good part and five boys willingly accepted the invitation to new zealand  one little fellow about eight years old had attached himself to coley clinging about his waist with his arms but he was too young to be taken away  iri came down to the beach and waded up to his waist in the water as the boat put off  in the night gera or guadalcanar was reached a fine mountainous island with a detached reef  numerous canoes surrounded the vessel bringing yarns for barter  fishhooks were of no account it was small hatchets that were in request and the bauro boys could hold some sort of converse with the people though theirs was quite another dialect  they were gaily decked out with armlets frontlets bracelets and girdles of shell and almost all of them wore not only noserings but plugs of wood or motherofpearl in the tip of the nose  one man in particular had a shell eyelethole let into his nose into which he inserted his unicorn decoration  the bishop amused himself and coley by saying as he hung a fishhook on this mans nosehook naso suspendis adunco  others had six or eight pieces of wood sticking out from either side of the nose like a cats whiskers  two young men were taken from hence and more would have gone but it was not thought well to take married men  the isle of mara or malanta had a very shy population who seemed to live inland having probably been molested by the warlike gera men it had been supposed that there was a second islet here but the southern cross boats crew found that what had been taken for a strait was only the mouth of a large river where the casks were filled  the wondrous beauty of the scene sea and river alike fringed with the richest foliage birds flying about i saw a large blue bird a parrot i suppose fish jumping the perfectly still water the mysterious smoke of a fire or two the call of a man heard in the bush just enough of novelty to quicken me to the full enjoyment of such a lovely bay as no english eyes save ours have ever seen  no communication with the native inhabitants was here accomplished but at four little flat cocoanutcovered islets named after torres were the headquarters of an english dealer in cocoanut oil  the native race were maorispeaking but their intercourse with sailors had given them a knowledge of the worst part of the english language and as usual it was mournfully plain how much harm our countrymen instil  the next group sighted on the 17th of august had already a remarkable history to which patteson refers in his journal with no foreboding of the association those reefs and bays were to acquire for him and far more through him  alvaro de mendana had in 1567 gone forth from peru on a voyage of discovery in the pacific and had then found and named most of the solomon isles  grera and bauro owed their names of guadalcanar and san cristoval to him  in 1594 he obtained permission to found a colony on san cristoval and set forth with his wife and four ships but the bauro people were spared that grievous misfortune of a spanish settlement mendana missed his way blundered into the marquesas first and then came upon a cluster of islands one large and beautiful two small and one a volcano in full action  he called the large island santa cruz and fancied the natives of the same race he had seen in bauro but they knew nothing of the language he had learnt there and though courteous at first presently discharged their arrows  however he found a beautiful harbour on the other side of the island and a friendly and dignified old chief called malope who in south sea fashion exchanged names and presents with him  mendana and his wife dona ysabel seem to have wished to be on good terms with the natives and taught them to sign the cross and say amigos and they proceeded to found their intended city but neither mendana nor malope could restrain their followers there were musketshots on one side and arrowshots on the other and at last the chief malope himself fell into the hands of some spanish soldiers who murdered him  mendana punished them with death but his own health was fast failing he died in a few weeks and his widow deserted the intended city and returned home with the colonists having probably bequeathed to the island a distrust of white men  all this was in pattesons mind as he shows by his journal as the lovely scenery of santa cruz rose on him  the people came out in canoes with quantities of yams and taro of which they knew the full value but the numbers were so large that no quiet work could be done and there was little to be done but to admire their costume armlets necklaces plates of motherofpearl but no nose ornaments they had strips of a kind of cloth woven of reed and elaborate varieties of headgear some plastering their hair white with coral lime others yellow others red others had shaved half the head with no better implement than a sharp shell and others had produced two lines of bristles like hogs manes on a shaven crown  their decorations made a great sensation among the solomon islanders who made offers of exchange of necklaces c  in the evening the schooner made for the volcano about three miles off  it was a magnificent sighta perfect cone the base of the mountain and all except the actual cone being under water  the cone was apparently about 2000 feet high clouds hanging about it near the top lurid and fiery increasing the grandeur of the glow at the summit  every minute streams of fire falling from the top or sides rushed down the mount so that for a space of perhaps half a mile in breadth the whole cone was always streaked and sometimes covered with burningmasses of stones cinders c  bumbling noises were heard only a few times  about 7 to 9 am  we sailed quite round the island and saw there that the fiery appearance at night is not actually fire or flame but caused by hot burning stones and masses of scoria c constantly falling down the sides of the cone which on the lee side are almost perpendicular  on the weather side are cocoanut trees and one small house but we could see no people  it was grand to see the great stones leaping and bounding down the sides of the cone clearing 300 or 400 feet at a jump and springing up many yards into the air finally plunging into the sea with a roar and the splash of the foam and steam combined  this was on the 12th of august and here is the ensuing note how full now of significance which it would be faithless to term melancholywe then went on to nukapu an island completely encircled by a coral reef  the natives soon came off in canoes and brought breadfruit and cocoanuts  they spoke a few words of maori but wore their hair like the people of santa cruz and resembled them in the character of their ornaments and in their general appearance they had bows and clubs of the same kind tapa stained with turmeric armlets earrings and noserings of bone and tortoiseshell  returning to santa cruz a large supply of the produce was obtained by barter but the people were still in such noisy crowds that nothing could be effected beyond these commercial transactions  tubua was the next ensuing island a lovely spot within its encircling ring over which the bishop and patteson waded and found thirteen men on the beach  patteson went up to the first tied a bit of red tape round his head and made signs that he wanted a cocoanut in exchange for a fishhook  plenty were forthcoming but the bishop to his companions surprise made a sudden sign to come away and when the boat was regained he said i saw some young men running through the bush with bows and arrows and these young gentry have not the sense to behave well like their parents  vanikoro was the next stage  this too had its history encircled as it is with a complete reef of coral in some parts double  in the year 1785 two french vessels which were commanded by count la perouse and named la boussole and lastrolabe had set forth from brest on a voyage of discovery in the pacific  they made a most discursive survey of that ocean from kamtschatka southwards and at the end of 1787 were at the samoan isles then unconverted and where their two boats crews were massacred and the boats lost  the ships came to port jackson in australia to build fresh boats left it in february 1788 and were never heard of more  one or two attempts were made to ascertain their fate but none succeeded till in 1826 a sandalwood trader named dillon found in the possession of a european who had lived since 1813 in ticopia the silver guard of a sword and ascertained from him that the natives had several articles such as china glass and the handle of a silver fork which evidently came from a ship  he had been told that these articles had been procured from another isle called vanikoro where two large ships had been wrecked  his intelligence led to the fitting out of a vessel in which he was sent to ascertain the fate of the frenchmen and by the help of the man who had been so long in ticopia he was able to examine a vanikoran chief  it appeared that the two ships had run aground on the parallel reefs  one had sunk at once and the crew while swimming out had been some of them eaten by the sharks and others killed by the natives indeed there were sixty european skulls in a temple  the other vessel had drifted over the reef and the crew entrenched themselves on shore while building another vessel  they went out and foraged for themselves in the taro fields but they made no friends they were shipspirits with noses two hands long before their faces their cocked hats  articles were recovered that placed the fact beyond a doubt and which were recognised by one of the expedition who had left it in kamtschatka the sole survivor  of the fate of the twomasted vessel built by the shipwrecked crew nothing was ever discovered  the mission party landed here but saw nobody  they sent a black boy up a tree for cocoanuts and left a tomahawk beneath it as payment that there were inhabitants somewhere there was horrible proof for a frightful odour led to search being made and the new zealander hoari turning up the ground found human bones with flesh hanging to them a little farther off was a native oven namely a pit lined with stones  this was pattesons nearest contact with cannibalism and it left a deep impression of horror  the banks group of islands came nextgreat banks isle or in the native language vanua lava valua or saddle isle a long narrow ridge of hills mota or sugarloaf island an equally descriptive name star island and santa maria  these places were to become of great importance to the mission but little was seen of them at this time the walls of coral round them were remarkably steep and difficult of access  valua had no beach and no canoes and such swarms of natives clustering upon the cliffs that the bishop did not think it prudent to land  in mota though the coast for the most part rises up in sheer crags forty or fifty feet above the sea with a great volcanic cone in the centre a little cove was found with a good beach where a number of inhabitants had assembled  they were entirely without clothing or ornament neither tattooed nor disfigured by betelnut and their bright honest faces greatly attracted patteson though not a word of their language could be then understood  he wanted to swim ashore among them but the bishop would not allow it lest it should be difficult to escape from the embraces of so many without giving offence  great numbers swam out to the boat and canoes brought fruits of all kinds and bamboos decked with leaves and flowers i crammed native combs in my hair says patteson picked up what words i could and made up the rest by a grand display of gesticulation  at santa maria the next day there was the like scene around the boat only the sight of a bit of striped calico caused immense excitement  at other islands it had been unheeded but here the people were mad to get it and offered their largest yams for strips of it and a pair of scarlet braces were purchased for two beautiful bows  at vanua lava or great banks island on the 20th a large canoe with seven men came alongside threequarters of a mile from shore  they would not however venture on board till patteson had gone into the water and placed himself in their canoe after which they were induced to come on deck were decorated with the order of the tape and received axes  no weapon was seen among them and there was reason to think them the tractable and hopeful race they have since proved  bligh island the next visited plainly revealed itself as the cone of an enormous submerged volcano the water forming a beautiful and extensive bay where numbers of people could be seen  there was a landing and a little trading for yams and then after the like intercourse with some of the inhabitants of the cluster of small islets named after torres the vessel steered for espiritu santo but wind and time forbade a return to the part previously visited nor was there time to do more than touch at aurora and exchange some fishhooks for some bows  at malicolo in 1851 the bishop and his party while fetching water had been assailed with stones and arrows and had only escaped by showing the utmost coolness  there was therefore much caution shown in approaching this bay called port sandwich and the boat stopped outside its breakwater coral reef where numerous canoes flocked round the people with their bows and arrows not attempting to barter  their faces were painted some red some black or yellow an old chief named melanbico was recognised by the bishop and called by name into the boat  another old acquaintance named nipati joined him and it was considered safe to row into the harbour  the bishop had learnt a little of the language and talked to these two while patteson examined nipatis accoutrementsa club a bow arrows neatly made handsomely feathered and tipped with a deadly poison tortoiseshell earrings and a very handsome shell armlet covering the arm from the elbow eight or nine inches upward his face painted red and black  the bishop read out the list of names he had made on the former visit and to several the answer was dead or shot and it appeared that a great mortality had taken place  large numbers however were on the beach and the bishop and patteson landed among them and conversed with them but they showed no disposition to trade and though some of the lads seemed halfdisposed to come away with the party they all changed their minds and went back again however all had behaved well and one little boy when offered a fishhook at once showed that he had received one already  it was plain that a beginning had been made which might lead to further results  two whales were seen while rowing back to the ship  oneabout a third of a mile offleapt several times fairly out of the water and fell back on the sea with a regular crack dashing up the spray in clouds  there was now very little time to spare as the time of an ordination at auckland was fixed and two important visits had yet to be paid so the two fate guests were sent ashore in the canoes of some of their friends and the southern cross reached nengone on the 1st of september  the bishop had left a boat there some years before and the samoan teacher mark who had been mrs nihills best friend and comforter came out in it with a joyful party full of welcome  the bishop and patteson went ashore taking with them their two bauro scholars to whom the most wonderful sight was a cow they never having seen any quadruped bigger than a pig  all the native teachers and their wives were assembled and many of the people in front of the house where mr nihill had died  they talked of him with touching affection as they told how diligently he had striven to bring young and old to a knowledge of his god and they eagerly assisted in planting at his grave a cross which the bishop had brought from auckland for the purpose and which bore the words i am the resurrection and the life  the coral lime church and the houses of the teachers among the cocoa nut trees gave the place a civilised look and most of the people had some attempt at clothing  here several passengers were taken in the two girls caroline wabisane and sarah wasitutru were both marriedcaroline to a maori named simeona and sarah to a man from her own isle called nawiki  all these and two more men wished to go to st johns for further instruction and were taken on board making up a party of fourteen melanesians besides sarahs baby mrs nihill will be glad to have the women writes coley and i am glad to have the othersnot the baby of course  close quarters indeed but not for very long for on the 3rd of september the schooner again put into norfolk island and on the next sunday coley was present at the confirmation of the whole population excepting the younger children and at the subsequent communion strong hopes were then entertained that the pitcairners standing as it were between the english and the islanders would greatly assist in the work of the gospel but this plan was found only capable of being very partially carried out  off norfolk island he wrote to his brother an account of the way of life on the voyage and of the people  they are generally gentle and seem to cling to one not with the very independent goodwill of new zealanders but with the soft yielding character of the child of the tropics  they are fond that is the word for them  i have had boys and men in a few minutes after landing follow me like a dog holding their hands in mine as a little child does with its nurse  my manner of life on board is as i described it before  i eschewed shoes and socks rather liking to be paddling about all day when not going on shore or otherwise employed which of course made up eight or ten out of the thirteen hours of daylight  when i went ashore which i did whenever the boat went then i put on my shoes and always swam in them for the coral would cut my feet to pieces usual swimming and wading attireflannel shirt dark grey trousers cap or straw hat shoes basket round my neck with fishhooks or perhaps an adze or two in my hand  i enjoyed the tropical climate very muchreally warm always in the water or out of it  on the reefs when i waded in shallow water the heat of it was literally unpleasant more than a tepid bath  on the 13th of september the little missionary vessel came safe into harbour at auckland and coley and his boysthey were considered especially as histook up their quarters at st johns college  all through the voyage he had written the journals here followed for the general benefit of his kindred and at other leisure moments he had written more personal letters  on his sister fannys birthday when the visit to malicolo was just over after his birthday wishes he goes on  and now how will you be when this reaches feniton  i think of all your daily occupationsschool garden driving cyour sunday reading visiting the cottages c and the very thought of it makes me feel like old times  when occasionally i dream or fall into a kind of trance when awake and fancy myself walking up from the lodge to the house and old forms and faces rise up before me i can scarcely contain the burst of joy and happiness and then i give a shake and say well it would be very nice but look about the horizon and see how many islands you can count and then instead of thoughts of home for myself i am tempted to induce others to leave their homes though i dont really think many men have such a home to leave or remain so long as i did one of the home fireside  i have been reading one or two of the german books you sent out friedrich der grosse is interesting but henceforth i dont think i shall have time for aught but a good german novel or two for wet days and jumping seas or such a theological book as i may send for  the effect of the voyage seems to have shown itself in an inflamed leg which was painful but not disabled for some time  there was a welcome budget of letters awaiting himone from his uncle dr coleridge to which this is the reply   september 15 1856 st johns college  your letter of march 26 was awaiting my arrival here  how thankful i am that as fan says in little as in great things god is so good to us  letters from me arriving on the anniversary of my departure and all at thorverton  you are clearly right in what you say about my post in the s x  i did not like it at first just as a schoolboy does not like going back to school but that it was good for me i have no doubt and now see here i am on shore for seven or eight months if i live so long my occupations most interesting working away with twelve melanesians at languages etc with the highest of all incentives to perseverance trying to form in them habits of cleanliness order decency etc  last night sundaytheir first sunday in new zealand after explaining to the solomon islands boys seven in number the nature of the lords prayer as far as my knowledge of their language would carry me i thought myself justified in making them kneel down round me and they uttered with their lips after me ie the five most intelligent the first words of prayer to their father in heaven i dont venture to say that they understood muchneither does the young child taught at his or her mothers kneesneither do many grown persons perhaps know much about the fulness of the prayer of prayersthese scenes teach me my ignorance which is one great gainyet they knew i think that they were praying to some great and mighty onenot an abstractiona conscious loving being a father and they know at least the name of his son jesus christ  their first formula was god the father god the son and god the holy ghost only one god  i cant yet explain that our blessed lord came from heaven and died for our sins neither as far as human thought may reach does the power of gods spirit as yet work in their hearts consciousness of sin and with that the sense of the need of a redeemer and saviour  i asked in my sermon yesterday the prayers of the people for the grace of gods holy spirit to touch the hearts and enlighten the understandings of these heathen children of a common father and i added that greatly did their teachers need their prayers that god would make them apt to teach and wise and simple in endeavouring to bring before their minds the things that belong unto their peace  you too dear uncle will think i know of these things for my trust is great  in this cold climate 26° or 27° of latitude south of their own island i have much anxiety about their bodily health and more about their souls  the four youngest sixteen to eighteen sleep in my room  one is now on my bed wrapped up in a great opossum rug with cold and slight fever last night his pulse was high today he is better i have to watch over them like a cat  think of living till now in a constant temperature of 84° and being suddenly brought to 56°  new zealand is too cold for them and the college is a cold place wind howling round it now  norfolk island is the place and the pitcairners themselves are most cooperative and hearty i trust that in another year i may be there  thank you for all your kind wishes on my birthday  i ought to wish to live many years perhaps to try and be of use especially as i am so unfit to go now or rather i ought not to wish at all  sometimes i feel almost fainthearted which is cowardly and forgetful of our calling to fight manfully under christs banner  ah my bishop is indeed a warrior of the cross  i cant bear the things sophy said in one of her letters about my having given up  it seems mock humility to write it but dear uncle if i am conscious of a life so utterly unlike what all you dear ones fancy it to be what must it be in the sight of god and his holy angels  what advantages i have always had and have now and not a day goes by and i can say i have done my duty  goodbye dear dear uncle  always your affectionate and grateful nephew  j  c  patteson  love to dear aunt   almost the first experience after settling in at st johns college was a sharp attack of fever that fell on kerearua one of the bauro lads  such illnesses it seemed were frequent at home and generally fatal  his companion hirika remarked kerearua like this in bauro ah in a few days he would die byandby we go back to bauro  the sick boys were always lodged in coleys own room to be more quiet and thoroughly nursed  fastidiousness had been so entirely crushed that he really seemed to take pleasure in the arrangement speaking with enthusiasm of the patients obedience and gratitude and adding he looks quite nice in one of my nightshirts with my plaid counterpane and the plaid joan gave me over it a blanket next to him  the melanesians readily fell into the regular habits of short school work out of doors meals in hall and bedtime and they were allowed a good deal of the free use of their limbs needful to keep them happy and healthy  now and then they would be taken into auckland as a great treat to see the soldiers on parade and of course the mere living with civilization was an immense education to them besides the direct instruction they received  the languages of nengone and bauro were becoming sufficiently familiar to mr patteson to enable him to understand much of what they said to him  he writes to miss neill october 17   i talk with them about common things and learn a great deal of their wild savage customs and habits but i can do but little as yet in the way of real instruction  some ideas i trust they are beginning to acquire concerning our blessed lord  is it not a significant fact that the god worshiped in gfera and in one village of bauro is the serpent the very type of evil  i need not say that these dear boys have won their way to my heart they are most docile and affectionate  i think some will really if they live leave their own island and live with me at norfolk island or here or wherever my dwelling may be whenever i am not in the southern cross  but of course i must not dwell on such notions  if it come to pass that for some years i can retain a hold upon them they may be instructed sufficiently to make them teachers in their turn to their own people  but all this is in the hands of god  my home journal will tell you particulars of our voyage  dont believe in the ferocity c of the islanders  when their passions are excited they do commit fearful deeds and they are almost universally cannibals ie after a battle there will be always a cannibal feast not otherwise  but treat them well and prudently and i apprehend that there is little danger in visiting them meaning by visiting merely landing on the beach the first time going perhaps to a native village the next time sleeping on shore the third spending ten days the fourth c c  the language once learnt from the pupils we bring away all is clear  and now goodbye my dear miss neill that i think of you and pray for you you know and i need not add that i value most highly your prayers for me  when i think of my happiness and good spirits i must attribute much very much to gods goodness in accepting the prayers of my friends  after the old custom of telling the home party all his doings the journalletter of the 27th of november goes through the teaching to the bauro boys  i really think they comprehend thus much that god who made all things made man adam and eve very good and holy that adam and eve sinned that they did not listen to the word of god but to the bad spirit that god found them out though they were afraid and tried to hide for he sees and knows all things that he drove them out of the beautiful garden and said that they must die that they had two sons cain and abel that cain killed his brother and that all fighting and killing people and all other sins i mention all for which i have names came into the world because of sin that god and man were far apart not living near no peace between them because men were so evil  that god was so good that he loved men all the time and that he promised to save all men who would believe in his son jesus christ who was to die for them for i cant yet express was to die that men might not go down to the fire but live for ever with god  that by and by he sent a flood and drowned all men except noah and seven other people because men would not be good that afterwards there was a very good man named abraham who believed all about jesus christ and god chose him and his son isaac and his son jacob and his twelve sons to be the fathers of a people called jews that those people alone knew about god and had teachers and praying men and that they killed lambs and offered them gave them to god as a sign of jesus christ being one day slain and offered to god on a cross but these very men became wicked too and at last when no man knew how to be happy and good jesus christ came down from heaven  his mother was mary but he had no father on earth only god the father in heaven was his father the holy ghost made mary to be mother of jesus christ  then i take two books or anything else and say this one is god and this is man  they are far apart because man is so bad and god is so good  but jesus christ came in the middle between them and joins them together  he is god and he is man too so inside him god and man meet like the meeting of two men in one path and he says himself he is the true way the only true path to god and heaven  god was angry with us because we sinned but jesus christ died on the cross and then god the father forgave us because jesus christ gave his life that we might always live and not die  by and by he will come to judge us and he knows what we do whether we steal and lie or whether we pray and teach what is good  men of bauro and gera and santa cruz dont know that yet but you do and you must remember if you go on doing as they do after you know gods will you will be sent down to the fire and not see jesus christ who died that you might live  i think that they know all this and much in the exactly equivalent words  of course i find difficulty in rendering religious ideas in a language which contains scarcely any words adequate to express them but i am hopeful enough to believe that they do know so much at all events  how far their hearts are affected one alone knows  it is indeed but little after they have been with us four months but till i had them on shore i could get very little work done  the constant boat work took me away and anywhere in sight of islands of course they were on deck in eagerness to see the strange country  then i could not work with energy while my leg would not let me take exercise  but it is now beginning to be a real pleasure as well as duty to teach both nengone and bauro people  enough of the language to avoid most of the drudgery has been got over i hope though not near enough for purposes of exact and accurate translation  i have given at length this account of pattesons fundamental teaching though to some it may seem to savour of the infant school because in spite of being hampered by imperfect knowledge of the language he has thrown into it the great principle both of his action and teaching namely the restoration of the union of mankind with god through christ  it never embraced that view of the heathen world which regards it as necessarily under gods displeasure apart from actual evil committed in wilful knowledge that it is evil  he held fast to the fact of man having been created in the image of god and held that whatever good impulses and higher qualities still remained in the heathen were the remnants of that image and to be hailed accordingly  above all he realised in his whole life the words to st peter what god hath cleansed that call not thou common and not undervaluing for a moment sacramental grace viewed human nature while yet without the offer thereof as still the object of fatherly and redeeming love and full of fitful tokens of good coming from the only giver of life and holiness and needing to be brought nearer and strengthened by full union and light instead of being left to be quenched in the surrounding flood of evil  and were by nature the children of wrath he did not hold to mean that men were objects of gods anger lying under his deadly displeasure but rather children of wild impulse creatures of passion swayed resistlessly by their own desires until made children of grace and thus obtaining the spiritual power needful to enable them to withstand these passions  an extract from the sermon he had preached at sydney may perhaps best serve to illustrate his principle  and this love once generated in the heart of man must needs pass on to his brethren that principle of life must needs grow and expand with its own inherent energy the seed must be developed into the tree and strike its roots deep and wide and stretch out its branches unto the sea and its boughs unto the rivers  no artificial nor accidental circumstances can confine it it recognises no human ideas of nationality or place or time but embraces like the dome of heaven all the works of god  and love is the animating principle of all  in every star of the sky in the sparkling glittering waves of the sea in every flower of the field in every creature of god most of all in every living soul of man it adores and blesses the beauty and the love of the great creator and preserver of all  viewed indeed from that position which was occupied by ancient philosophers the existing contrarieties between nations might well appear inexplicable and intellectual powers might seem to be the exclusive heritage of particular nations  but christianity leads us to distinguish between the nature of man as he came fresh from the hands of his creator and that natural propensity to sin which he has inherited in consequence of his fall from original innocence  it teaches that as god has made of one blood all nations to dwell together on the face of the whole earth and has given in virtue of this common origin one common nature destined to be pure and holy and divine so by virtue of redemption and regeneration the image of god may be restored in all and whatever is the result of his depravity therefore may be overcome  and this seems to be the answer to all statements relating to the want of capacity in certain nations of the earth for the reception of divine truth that every man because he is a man because he is a partaker of that very nature which has been taken into the person of the son of god may by the grace of god be awakened to the sense of his true life of his real dignity as a redeemed brother of christ  the spark of heavenly fire may indeed have been all but quenched by the unbridled indulgence of his passions the natural wickedness of the heart of man may have exhibited itself with greater fearfulness where no laws and customs have introduced restraints against at least the outward expression of vice but the capacity for the christian life is there though overlaid it may be with monstrous forms of superstition or cruelty or ignorance the conscience can still respond to the voice of the gospel of truth  and one who so entirely believed and acted upon these words found them true  the man who verily treated the lads he had gathered round him with a perfectly genuine sympathy a love and a selfdenialnay more an identification of self with themawoke all that was best in their characters and met with full response  enthusiastic partiality of course there was in his estimate of them but is it not one of the absolute requisites of a good educator to feel that enthusiasm like the parent for the child  and is it always the blind admiration at which outsiders smile is it not rather indifference which is blind and love which sees the truth  i would not exchange my position with these lads and young men for anything he wrote on december 8 to his uncle the eton master i wish you could see them and know them i dont think you ever had pupils that could win their way into your heart more effectually than these fellows have attached themselves to me  it is no effort to love them heartily  gariri a dear boy from san cristoval is standing by me now at my desk in amazement at the pace that my pen is going not knowing that i could write to you my dear old tutor for hours together if i had nothing else to do  he is i suppose about sixteen a most loveable boy gentle affectionate with all the tropical softness and kindliness  we have seven solomon islandersfive from mata a village at the northwest of san cristoval and two from the southeast point of guadalcanar or gera a magnificent island about twentyfive or twenty miles to the northwest of san cristoval  from frequent intercourse they are almost bilingual a great lounge for me as one language does for both the structure of the two island tongues is the same but scarcely any words much alike  however that is not much odds  then from nengone where you remember mr nihill died after eighteen months residence on the island we have four men and two women both married  of these two men and both the women have been baptized some time ago by the bishop in 1852 and one by the london mission who now occupy the island  these four i have with full trust admitted to the holy communion  mr  nihill had taught them well and i am sure they could pass an examination in scriptural history simple doctrinal statements c as well as most young english people of the middle class of life  the other two are well taught and one of them knows a great deal but poor fellow he misconducted himself at nengone and hence i cannot recommend him to the bishop for baptism without much talk about him  but i think my love is more poured out upon my bauro and gera lads they are such dear fellows and i trust that already they begin to know something about religion  certain it is that they answer readily questions and say with their mouths what amounts almost to a statement of the most important christian truths  of course i cannot tell what effect this may have on their hearts  they join in prayer morning and evening they behave admirably and really there is nothing in their conduct to find fault with  if it please god that any of them were at some future time to stay again with us i have great hopes that they may learn enough to become teachers in their own country  the nengone lads are quite in a different position  their language has been reduced to writing the gospel of st mark translated and they can all read a little english so that at evening prayers we read a verse all round and then i catechise and expound to them in nengone  i really trust that by gods blessing some real opening into the great solomon group has been effected  there is every hope that many boys will join us this next voyage  no one can say what may be the result  as yet it is possible to get on without more help but i do not for a moment doubt that should god really grant not only a wide field of labour but some such hope of cultivating it he will send forth plenty of men to share in this work  men who have some means of their own£100 a year is enough or even lessor some aptitude for languages surely will feel drawn in this direction  it is the happiest life a man can lead full of enjoyment physical and mental exquisite scenery famous warm climate lots of bathing yams and taro and cocoanut enough to make an aldermans mouth water and such loving gentle people  but of course something depends on the way in which a man looks at these things and a fine gentleman who cant get on without his servant and cant put his luggage for four months into a compass of six feet by oneandahalf wont like it  you know the kind of incidents that occur so i need not repeat them to you  i have quite learnt to believe that there are no savages anywhere at least among black or coloured people  id like to see anyone call my bauro boys savages  why the fellows on the reef that have never seen a white man will wade back to the boat and catch ones arms to prevent one falling into pits among the coral just like an old nurse looking after her child  this they did at santa maria where we two swam ashore to a party of forty or fifty men and where our visit was evidently a very agreeable one on both sides though we did not know one syllable of the language and then but i almost tremble to think of the immense amount of work opening upon one  whither will it lead  but i seldom find any time for speculations and oh my dear tutor i am as happy as the day is long though it never seems long to me my dear father writes in great anxiety about the denison case  oh dear what a cause of thankfulness it is to be out of the din of controversy and to find hundreds of thousands longing for crumbs which are shaken about so roughly in these angry disputes  it isnt high or low or broad church or any other special name but the longing desire to forget all distinctions and to return to a simpler state of things that seems naturally to result from the very sight of heathen people  who thinks of anything but this they have not heard the name of the saviour who died for them when he is standing with crowds of naked fellows round him  i cant describe the intense happiness of this life  i suppose trials will come some day and i almost dread the thought for i surely shall not be prepared to bear them  i have no trials at all even of a small kind to teach me how to bear up under great ones  in truth coleridge patteson had entered on the happiest period of his life  he had found his vocation and his affections were fastening themselves upon his black flock so that without losing a particle of his home love the yearnings homewards were appeased and the fully employed time and sense of success and capability left no space for the selfcontemplation and selfcriticism of his earlier life  he gives amusing sketches of the scenes  the donkey here a fatally stubborn brute is an unceasing amusement to my boys no one of them can retain his seat more than ten minutes but they all fall like cats on their legs amid cries of laughter the donkey steers straight for some small scrubby trees and then kicks and plunges or else rubs their legs against the sides of the house and all this time the boys are leaping about the unfortunate fellow who is mounted and the fun is great  wadrokala one of the nengone lads who had recently made his first communion became the prominent scholar at this time  he had thought a good deal  one night he said i have heard all kinds of words usedfaith repentance praise prayerand i dont clearly understand what is the real great thing the chief thing of all they used these words confusedly and i feel puzzled  then i read that the pharisees knew a great deal of the law and so did the scribes and yet they were not good  i am not doing anything good now i know something of the bible and i can write and i fear very much i often feel very much afraid that i am not good i am not doing anything good  he was talked to and comforted with hopes of future work but a day or two later his feelings were unconsciously hurt by being told in joke that he was wearing a shabby pair of trousers to save the good ones to take home to nengone  his remonstrance was poured out upon a slate mr patteson this is my wordi am unhappy because of the word you said to me that i wished for clothes  i have left my country  i do not seek clothes for the body  what is the use of clothes  can my spirit be clothed with clothes for the body  therefore my heart is greatly afraid but you said i greatly wished for clothes which i do not care for  one thing only i care for that i may receive the life for my spirit  therefore i fear i confess and say to you it is not the thing for the body i want but the one thing i want is the clothing for the soul for jesus christs sake our lord  soon after a very happy christmas wadrokala and kainwhat expressed a desire after a final visit to their native island to return with mr patteson and be prepared to be sent as native teachers to any dark land as the samoans had come to them  wadrokala narrated something of the history of his island a place with 6000 inhabitants with one tribe forming a priestly caste the head of which was firmly believed by even these christian nengonese to possess the power of striking men dead by his curse  caroline kainwhat and kowine were the children of a terrible old chief named bula who had fiftyfive wives and whose power was almost absolute if anyone offended him he would send either a priest or one of his sons to kill the man and bring the corpse of which the thighs were always reserved for his special eating the trunk being given to his slaves  if one of his wives offended him he sent for the high priest who cursed hersimply said she has died and die she did a young girl who refused to marry him was killed and eaten or if any person omitted to come into his presence crouching the penalty was to be devoured in fact he seems to have made excuses for executions in order to gratify his appetite for human flesh which was considered as particularly dainty fare  everyone dreaded him and when at last he died a natural death his chief wife was strangled by her own brother as a matter of course  such horrors as these had pretty well ceased by that time though still many nengonese were heathen and the priests were firmly believed to have the power of producing death and disease at will by a curse  wadrokala with entire conviction declared that one of his fathers wives had thus been made a cripple for life  nengonese had become almost as familiar to coley as maori and his sundays at this time were decidedly polyglot since besides a regular english service at taranaki he often took a maori service and preached extempore in that tongue feeling that the peoples understanding went along with him and there were also in early morning and late evening prayers partly in nengonese partly in bauro at the college chapel and a sermon first in one language and then repeated in the other  the nengone lads who had the question of adherence to the london mission at home or the church in new zealand put to them came deliberately to entreat to remain always with mr patteson saying that they saw that this teaching of the church was right and they wished to work in it  it was a difficult point as the london mission was reasserting a claim to the loyalty isles and the hopes of making them a point dappui were vanishing but these men and their wives could not but be accepted and simeona was preparing for baptism  a long letter to professor max muller on the languages will be found in the appendix  the bishop of new zealand thus wrote to sir john patteson respecting coley and his work   taurarua auckland march 2 1857  my dear judgeyour letter of december 5 made me very happy by assuring me of the satisfaction which you feel in your sons duties and position  i do indeed most thankfully acknowledge the goodness of god in thus giving me timely aid when i was pledged to a great work but without any steady force to carry it on  coley is as you say the right man in the right place mentally and physically the multiplicity of languages which would try most men is met by his peculiar gift the heat of the climate suits his constitution his mild and parental temper makes his black boys cling about him as their natural protector and his freedom from fastidiousness makes all parts of the work easy to him for when you have to teach boys how to wash themselves and to wear clothes for the first time the romance of missionary work disappears as completely as a great mans heroism before his valet de chambre  on sunday february 22 we had a native baptism an adult from nengone and his infant child  coley used the baptismal service which he had translated and preached fluently in the nengone tongue as he had done in the morning in new zealand  the careful study which we had together of the latter on our voyage out will be of great use in many other dialects and mrs nihill has given him her husbands nengone manuscripts  you know in what direction my wishes tend viz that coley when he has come to suitable age and has developed as i have no doubt he will a fitness for the work should be the first island bishop upon the foundation of which you and your brother judge and sir w farquhar are trustees that norfolk island should be the see of the bishop because the character of its population the salubrity of its climate and its insular position make it the fittest place for the purpose  your affectionate and grateful friend  g a  new zealand   by the same mail patteson himself wrote to miss neill  if it please god to give us some few native teachers from bauro and grera not to be sent before but to go with or follow us ie bishop and me in a short time the word of god might be heard in many a grand wild island resplendent with everything that a tropical climate and primeval forests etc can bestow and thickly populated with an intelligent and as i imagine tolerably docile race of whom some are already stretching out their hands unto god  all these solomon islanders here would answer questions about christianity as well perhaps as children of nine or ten years old in england  some seem to feel that there is a real connection between themselves and what they are taught and speak of the love of god in giving jesus christ to die for them and say that gods holy spirit alone can enlighten their dark hearts  that beautiful image of light and darkness seems common to all nations  the regular word used by the nengone people who are far more advanced in christian knowledge and practice for all heathen places is the dark lands  on sunday week february 22 we had a deeply interesting service in the college chapel at 715 pm just as the english world was beginning its sunday  simeona and his infant boy of four weeks and three days old were baptized  the college chapel was nicely lighted font decorated simply  i read the service in nengone having had all hands at work setting the types and printing on friday and saturday the bishop took the part of the service which immediately precedes the actual baptism and baptized them bothfirst the father by the name of george selwyn then the baby by the name of john patteson this was the special request of the parents and as it is my dear fathers name how could i object  he is of course my godson and a dear little fellow he is  at the end of my sermon i added a few words to george and besought the prayers of the nengone people for him and his child  we have now four regular communicants among them wadrokala mark kainwhat carry and sarah  george is baptized and baby and sarahs child lizzy i baptized long ago  in about two months d v we are off for a good spell of four or five months among the islands taking back this party though some of them will by and by rejoin us again i hope  the plan of starting in april for a four or five months cruise was disconcerted as regarded bishop selwyn by the delay of bishop harper and the archdeacons in arriving for the intended synod which was thus put off till may too wintry a month for the melanesians to spend in new zealand  after some doubt it was decided that mr patteson should make a short voyage for the mere purpose of returning his scholars to their homes come back to auckland and make a fresh start when the bishop was ready  in prospect of the parting patteson writes to his beloved old governess march 19 1857  you will like a report of my pupils especially as i can give most of them a good ticket little mark and all as we used to say of yours though not as often as we ought to have done to our dear mother  you never had such willing pupils though you turned out some i hope eventually as good  in your hands these lads would be something indeed  really they have no faults that i can detect and when their previous state is considered it is wonderful for all this time they have been with us the greatest fault has been a fit of sulkiness lasting about half a day with three of them  their affection gentleness unselfishness cheerfulness willingness to oblige in some of them a natural gentlemanly way of doing things and sometimes indications of what we should call high principleall these things give one great hopes not for them only but for all these nations that refined by christianity they may be bright examples of manly virtues and christian graces  to some no doubt these expressions will seem exaggerated but not to those who have had any experience of the peculiar suavity and grace that often is found in the highbred men of native races before they are debased by the corruptions brought in by white men moreover in every case the personal influence of the teacher when in immediate contact with a sufficiently small number is quite enough to infuse good habits and obviate evil ones to an extent quite inconceivable to those who have not watched the unconscious exertion of this power  patteson knew that too much reliance must not be placed on present appearance  it is dangerous he says to have persons clinging to you too much i feel that but then these fellows i take it are very impulsive and no doubt the cocoanuts in their own land will exercise a counter influence to mine and so i shall soon be undeceived if i learn to think too much of their personal affection but i never knew such dear lads i dont know how i shall get on without them  you must be looking forward to your spring and summer  how delicious some of those days are in england  we miss the freshness of a deciduous foliage our evergreens look dull and we have no deciduous trees as yet  a good scamper with joan on the east hill or a drive with fan in the pony carriage along a lane full of primroses and violets would be pleasant indeed and so would a stroll with old jem up the river be happy indeed and i could almost quit the southern cross for dear fathers quarterdeck in the hermitage but that i am i believe sailing in the right vessel and as i trust on the right course to the haven where we may all meet and rest for ever  on good friday the three nengone young men who had been baptized were confirmed and on the wednesday in easter week the southern cross sailed this time with a responsible sailing master  at nengone mr patteson had a friendly interview with mr craig the london societys missionary and explained to him the state of things with regard to these individual pupils then after being overwhelmed with presents by the christian population shaped his course for bauro  on the way he had the experience of a tropical thunderstorm after having been well warned by the sinking of the barometer through the whole of the day the 27th of april  at 730 the breeze came up and the big drops began when suddenly a bright forked flash so sustained that it held its place before our eyes like an immense whitehot crooked wire seemed to fall on the deck and be splintered there  but one moment and the tremendous crack of the thunder was alive and around us making the masts tremble  for more than an hour the flashes were so continuous that i think every three seconds we had a perfect view of the whole horizon  i especially remember the firmament between the lurid thunder clouds looking quite blue so intense was the light  the thunder rolled on without cessation but the tremendous claps occurred only at intervals  we have no lightning conductor and i felt somewhat anxious went below and prayed god to preserve us from lightning and fire read the magnificent chapter at the end of job  as the storm went on i thought that at that very hour you were praying from lightning and tempest good lord deliver us  we had no wind furious rain repeated again from midnight to three this morning  about eleven the thunder had ceased but the broad flashes of lightning were still frequent  the lightning was forked and jagged and one remarkable thing was the length of time that the line of intense light was kept up like a gigantic firework so that the shape of the flash could be drawn with entire accuracy by any one that could handle a pencil  it was a grand and solemn sight and sound and i am very thankful we were preserved from danger for the storm was right upon us and the danger must have been great  a ready welcome awaited the southern cross at bauro in a lovely bay hitherto unvisited where a perfect flotilla of canoes came off to greet her and the two chiefs iri and eimaniaka came on board and no less than fiftyfive men with them  the chiefs and about a dozen men were invited to spend the night on board  the former lay on the floor of the inner cabin talking and listening while their host set before them some of the plain truths of christianity  he landed next day and returned the visit by going to iris hut where he pointed to the skulls discoursed on the hatefulness of such decorations and recommended their burial  he also had an opportunity of showing a christians horror of unfilial conduct when rimaniaka struck his mother for being slow in handing yams and when a man begged for a passage to gera in direct opposition to his fathers commands he was dismissed with the words i will have nothing to do with a man who does not obey his own father  at gera there was also a great assembly of canoes and as all hands were wanted on board patteson went ashore in a canoe with the brother of one of the scholars  he was told that he was the first white man who had ever landed there and the people showed a good deal of surprise but were quite peaceable and the presence of women and children was a sign that there was no danger  when he tried to return to the ship a heavy sea came on and the canoes were forced to put back and he thus found himself obliged to spend the night on the island  he was taken into a house with two rooms in each of which numbers of men were lying on the ground a small wood fire burning in the midst of each group of three or four  a grass mat was brought him and a bit of wood for a pillow and as he was wet through cold and very tired he lay down but sleep was impossible from tormenting vermin as well as because it seemed to be the custom of the people to be going backwards and forwards all night sitting over the fire talking then dropping asleep and waking to talk again  a yam was brought him after about an hour and long before dawn he escaped into the open air and sat over a tire there till at high tide at six oclock in the morning he was able to put off again and reach the ship where fortyfive natives had slept and behaved well  the sense of cold and dirt and weariness was not pleasing he confesses and certainly the contrast to the eton and oxford habits was great  there was a grand exchange of presents hatchets adzes hooks and empty bottles on one side and a pig and yams on the other immediately after follows a perilous adventure which as we shall find made a deep impression  it is thus related in a letter for the benefit of thorverton rectory   at sea lat 19° 50 s long 167° 41 e  my dearest unclemay is a month specially connected henceforward in my mind with a merciful deliverance from great peril which god vouchsafed to us on may 2nd  we touched on a reef at the isle of guadalcanar one of the solomon islands in lat 9° 50 and but for gods mercy in blessing our exertions we might have incurred fearful danger of losing the mission vessel  as it was in a couple of minutes we were off the reef and in deep safe waterto him be the praise and the glory  i have written all particulars as usual to my father and now that the danger has been averted you will rejoice to hear how great a door is opened to us in that part of the world personal safety ensured and so far as can be judged of no apparent obstacle in the way of the mission in that quarter  had this great peril not occurredand it was to human eyes and in human language the mere chance of a minutei might have dwelt with too much satisfaction on the bright side of the picture  as it is it is a lesson to me to think soberly  i can hardly trust myself to write yet with my usual freedom of the scenery natives c  one great thought is before meis it all real that we touched on that reef in the sight of hundreds of natives  it was not a sense of personal dangerthat could not occur at such a time but the idea that the vessel might be lost the missionary operations suspended c this shot through me in those two minutes  but i had no time for more than mental prayer for i was pulling at ropes with all my strength not till it was all over could i go below and fall on my knees in a burst of thanksgiving and praise  we suppose that there must be a very strong undercurrent near the reef at the mouth of the bay for the vessel instead of coming round as usual and there was abundance of room would not obey the helm and we touched an outlying rock before we could alter the sails when she rounded instantly on the other tack  humanly speaking she would have come off very soon as the tide was flowing and she received no damage as we came very gently against the rock which was only about the size of an ordinary table  but it is an event to be remembered by me with thankfulness all my life  i think the number of natives who had been on deck and about us in canoes that morning could not have been less than 450 they behaved very well  of the five principal chiefs three could talk some bauro language so i could communicate with them and this was one reason why i felt satisfied of their goodwill  they gave me two pigs about 500 or 600 cocoanuts and upwards of a ton of yams though i told them i had only two small hatchets five or six adzes a few gimlets and empty bottles to give in exchange  if i had not been satisfied of their being quite friendly i would not have put ourselves so entirely into their power but it is of the greatest consequence to let the natives of a place see that you are not suspicious and where there is no evident hazard in so doing i think i ought to act upon it  perhaps the bishop being an older hand at it will think i was rash but as far as the natives are concerned the result shows i was quite right the letting go a kedge in deepish water is another matter that was a mistake i know now  but we could not work the vessel by reason of the crowds of natives and what was i to do  either not stand close in as they all expected or let go a kedge  if i did not go into the mouth of the bay they would have said he does not trust us and mutual suspicion would have been possibly the result and i could not make them understand rightly the reason why i did not want to drop the kedge or small anchor  i had slept on shore about three miles up the bay among a number of natives twentyfive or twentysix in the same room with me on the previous evening at least i lay down in my things which by the bye were drenched through with salt and rain water  they said i was the first white person that had been ashore there  they treated me very well  how in the face of all this could i run the risk of letting them think i was unwilling to trust them  so i think still that i was right in all but one thing  i ought to have ascertained better the nature of the current and the bottom of the harbour to see if there was good holding ground  but it is easier to do those things in an english port than in the sight of a number of natives and especially when there is but one person able to communicate with the said natives  if i went off in the boat sounding who was to look after the schooner  if i stayed on board who was to explain to the natives what was being done in the boat  besides we have but five men on board including the master and mate and one of them was disabled by a bad hand so that if i had manned the boat i should have left only three ablebodied men on boardit was a puzzle you see dear uncle  now i have entered into this long defence lest any of you dear ones should think me rash  indeed i dont want to run any risks at all  but there was no risk here as i supposed and had we chosen to go round on the other tack we should have known nothing of a risk now  as it was we did run a great hazard of grounding on the reef and therefore laus deo  oh dear little pena if you had only seen the village which as yet i alone of white people have been allowed to seethe great tall cocoanuts so tall and slender at the top that i was almost afraid when a boy was sent up to gather some nuts for methe cottages of bamboo and cocoanut leavesthe great forest trees the parrots flying about among the branchesthe crowd of men and children and a few women all looking at and some talking to the strange chief who had spoken the truth and brought their kinsman as he promisedthe sea in the harbour shut off by small islets and looking like a beautiful lake with high wooded and steep banksthe pretty canoes on the beach and the great state canoe lying at its stone anchor about fifty yards off about fifty feet long and inlaid throughout with motherofpearl the spears leaning against the housesmen stalking about with a kind of club the great chief puruhanua gave me hisi think your little head would have been almost turned crazy  june 4th aucklandwe reached harbour a week ago in a violent squall of wind and rain at 845 pm  anxious night after the anchor was dropped lest the vessel should drag  nine days coming from norfolk island very heavy weatherno accident but jibboom pitched away while lying to in a southeaster  your loving nephew  j  c  p   the rev benjamin thornton dudley for several years a most valuable helper in the work both at home and abroad gives the following account of his own share in it and his recollections of that first year  the first time i ever saw mr patteson was in the beginning of 1856 when you this is a letter to mrs selwyn all visited lyttelton in the newly arrived southern cross  that indescribable charm of manner calculated at once to take all hearts by storm was not perhaps as fully developed in him then as afterwards and my experience was then comparatively limited yet his words in the sermon he preached on behalf of the melanesian mission a kind of historical review of the growth and spread of the gospel although coming after the wonderful sermon of the bishop in the morning made a deep impression on several of us myself among the number  you came to lyttelton at the end of 1856 again this time without him and the bishop brought me up to st johns college and placed me under him there  i remember at first how puzzled i felt as to what my position was and what i was expected to do  not a single direction was given me by mr patteson nor did he invite me to take a class in the comparatively small melanesian school  gradually it dawned upon me that i was purposely left there and that i was expected to offer myself for anything i could do  when i offered myself i was allowed to assist in this and that until at length i fell into my regular place  although the treatment i received in this respect puzzled me i felt his great kindness from the first how bright he was in those days and how overflowing with spirits when among the melanesians  what fun there used to be of a morning when he would come and hunt the lazy ones out of bed drive them down to the bath house and there assist their ablutions with a few basins of water thrown at them and what an amount of quiet chaff used to go on at breakfast time about it as we sat with them in the great hall without any of those restraints of the high table which were introduced at dinner  during the first voyage made that year to return our melanesian party i think mr patteson was feeling very much out of sorts  i do not remember any time during the years in which i was permitted to see so much of him when he took things so easily  he spoke of himself as lazy and i confess i used to wonder somewhat how it was that he retired so completely into the cabin and did apparently so little in the way of study  he read the heir of redclyffe and other books of light reading in that voyage  i understood better afterwards what raw youth as i was at the time puzzled me in one for whom i was already beginning to entertain a feeling different from any previously experienced  that seems to me now to have been quite a necessary pause in his life after he had with wholeheartedness and full intention given himself to his work but before he had fully faced all its requirements and had learnt to map out his whole time with separate toil  so concluded what may be called the first term of coley pattesons tutorship of his island boys  his work is perhaps best summed up in this sentence in a letter to me from mrs abraham mr pattesons love for them and his facility in communicating with them in their own tongue make his dealing with the present set much more intimate and effective than it has ever been before and their affections towards him are drawn out in a lively manner     chapter viii  st johns college and lifu 18571859    it seems to me that the years between 1856 and 1861 were the very brightest of coleridge pattesons life  he had left all for christs sake and the gospels and was reaping the blessing in its freshness his struggles with his defects had been successful the more so because he was so full of occupation that the old besetting trouble selfcontemplation had been expelled for lack of opportunity and he had become far more simple since humility was ceasing to be a conscious effort  there is a lightheartedness about his letters like that of the old eton times  something might have been owing to the impulse of health which was due to the tropical heat  most probably this heat was what exhausted his constitution so early but at first it was a delightful stimulus and gave him exemption from all those discomforts with which cold had affected him at home  this exhilaration bore him over the many trials of close contact with uncivilised human nature so completely that his friends never even guessed at his natural fastidiousness  that which might have been selfish in this fastidiousness was conquered though the refinement remained  even to the last in his most solitary hours this personal neatness never relaxed but the victory over disgust was a real triumph over self which no doubt was an element of happiness  while the bishop continued to go on the voyages with him he had companionship guidance and comparatively no responsibility while his success that supreme joy was wonderfully unalloyed and he felt his own especial gifts coming constantly into play  his love for his scholars was one continual well of delight and really seemed to be an absolute gift enabling him to win them over and compensating for what he had left even while he did not cease to love his home with deep tenderness  another pair of new zealand friends had to be absent for a time archdeacon abrahams arm was so severely injured by an accident with a horse that the effects were far more serious than those of a common fracture  the disaster took place in pattesons presence i shall never forget writes his friend his gentleness and consideration as he first laid me down in a room and then went to tell my wife  it was found necessary to have recourse to english advice the archdeacon and mrs abraham went home and were never again residents at auckland  a letter to mr  justice coleridge was written in the interval between the voyages   auckland june 12 1857  my dear uncleyou will not give me credit for being a good correspondent i fear but the truth is that i seldom find time to do more than write long chatty letters to my dear father and sisters occasionally to thorverton and to miss neill and one or two others to cheer them in their sickness and weariness  any news from afar may be a real relaxation  for myself i need only say that i find these dear people most attractive and winning that it is no effort to love them that they display all natural gifts in a remarkable waygood temper affection gentleness obedience gratitude c occasionally real selfrestraint  dear hirikas last words to me at san cristoval were oh i do love you so and his conduct showed it  he is a bright handsome lad clever but inaccurate of most sweet disposition  in matters of personal cleanliness healthy appearance c the change in seven months was that of a lad wholly savage becoming neat tidy in dress and of gentlemanly appearance  in some ways he was my pet of the whole party though i have equally bright hopes of grariri a sturdy honest fellow with the best temper i almost ever found among lads of sixteen anywhere and kerearua is the most painstaking fellow of the lot and a boy whose distinguishing features it would be hard to describe but he may be summed up as a very good boy and certainly a most loveable one  sumaro and kimarua older and less interesting  i printed short catechisms a translation of the lords prayer creed general confession two or three other of the common prayer prayers and one or two short missionary prayers in the dialect of both islands but i can only speak at all fluently the language of san cristoval  of the nengone people i could say much more  the two young women married and the two young unmarried men had been under mr nihills instruction two or three years baptized and were regular communicants while at the college  simeona was baptized on the same day as his infant son after he had been with us five months  he and the other four were confirmed at the college chapel and he afterwards received the holy communion with the rest  kowine a lad of seventeen is not baptized though well instructed we were not wholly satisfied about him  of the knowledge of them all i can speak with the utmost confidence  they know more a great deal than most candidates for confirmation in a wellregulated english parish  it was delightful to work with them  we wrote bible history which has reached about fifty sheets in ms in small handwriting bringing the history to the time of joshua very many questions and answers and translated ninety pages of the prayer book including services for infant and adult baptism catechism burial service c  it is most interesting work though not easy and much of it will no doubt be altered when we come to know the language thoroughly well this island of nengone called also maro and britannia island contains about 6500 inhabitants of whom some profess christianity while the remainder are still fighting and eating one another though accessible to white people  we hope to have time to see something of the heathen population though the london mission society having reoccupied the island we do not regularly visit it with the intention of establishing ourselves the language is confined to that island  i call it language not dialect for it is i believe really distinct from any others we have or have heard of very soft like italian and capable of expressing accurately minute shades of meaning  causative forms c remind us of the oriental structure one peculiarity that of the chiefs dialect or almost language running parallel to that of common life i think i have before mentioned  in about a month i suppose we shall be off again for three or four months and we long to get hold of pupils from the banks archipelago santa cruz espiritu santo in which no ground is broken at present we visited them last year but did not get any pupils lovely islands very populous and the natives very bright intelligent looking  but how i long to see again some of my own dear boys i do so think of them  it may be that two or three of them may come again to us and then we may perhaps hope that they may learn enough to be really useful to their own people dear uncle i should indeed rejoice much to see my dear dear father and sisters and jem and all of you if it came in the way of ones business but i think so long as i am well that the peculiar nature of this work must require the constant presence of one personally known to and not only officially connected with the natives  while i feel very strongly that in many ways intercourse occasionally resumed with the home clergy must be very useful to us yet if you can understand that there is no one to take ones place you see how very unlikely it must be that i can move from this hemisphere  i say if you can understand for it does seem sad that one should really be in such a position that ones presence should be of any consequence but till it please god that the bishop shall receive other men for this mission there is no other teacher for these lads and so we must rub on and do the best we can  of course i should be most thankful most happy if during his lifetime i once more found myself at home but i dont think much nor speculate about it and i am very happy as i am well and hearty  you wont suspect me of any lessening of strong affection for all that savours of home  i think that i know every face in alfington and in feniton and very many in ottery as of old i believe i think of all with increasing affection but while i wonder at it i must also confess that i can and do live happy day after day without enjoying the sight of those dear faces  always your affectionate and grateful nephew  j c patteson   as soon as the southern cross had carried bishop harper back to lyttelton the melanesian voyage was recommenced this time with a valuable assistant in mr benjamin dudley  mrs selwyn was again dropped at norfolk island and five young pitcairners were taken on board to serve as a boats crew and also to receive instruction  this was a more extensive voyage than the first as more time could be spent on it but there is less full description as there was less time for writing and besides these coral islands are much alike futuma was the first new island visited  the canoes did not venture to come off to us so we went ashore in the boat bishop and i wading ankledeep to the beach  forty or fifty natives under a deep overhanging rock crouching around a fire plenty of lads and boys no women  some tanna men in the group with their faces painted red and black hair as you know elaborately frizzled and dressed with coral lime  the futuma people speak a different language from those of anaiteum and the tanna people speak a third having moreover four dialects of their own  these three islands are all in sight of each other  tanna has an active volcano now smoking away and is like a hotbed wonderfully fertile  people estimate its population at 10000 though it is not very large about thirty miles long  at futuma the process by which these coral islands have been upheaved is well seen  the volcanic rocks are lying under the coral which has been gradually thrust upwards by them  as the coral emerged the animal went on building under water continually working lower and lower down upon and over the volcanic formation as this heaved in its upward course the coral formation out of the sea  erromango was occupied by the scottish mission and mr gordon was then living there in peace and apparent security when a visit was paid to him and patteson gathered some leaves in dillons bay the spot where john williams met his death sixteen years before not as now was understood because he was personally disliked but because he was unconsciously interfering with a solemnity that was going on upon the beach  at fate isle the people were said to be among the wildest in those seas  when the royal sovereign was wrecked they had killed the whole crew nineteen in number eaten ten at once and sent the other nine as presents to their friends  very few appeared but there was a good opening exchange of presents  a great number of small islets lie around fate forming part of the cluster of the new hebrides the bishop had been at most of them before and with a boats crew of three pitcairners and one english sailor starting early and spending all day in the boat he and patteson touched at eleven in three days and established the first steps to communication by obtaining 127 names of persons present and making gifts  these little volcanic coral isles were all much alike and nothing remarkable occurred but the obtaining two lads from mai named petere and laure for a ten months visit  poor fellows they were very seasick at first and begged to go home again but soon became very happy and this connection with petere had important consequences in the end  these lads spoke a language approaching maori whereas the fate tongue prevailed in the other isles  at mallicolo on august 20 a horrible sight presented itself to the eyes of the two explorers when they walked inland with about eighteen most obliging and courteous nativesan open space with four hollowed trunks of trees surrounding two stones the trees carved into the shape of grotesque human heads and among them a sort of temple made of sloping bamboos and pandanus leaves meeting at the top from whence hung a dead man with his face painted in stripes of red and yellow procured it was thought from the pollen of flowers  there was not enough comprehension of the language to make out the meaning of all this  ambrym the next island was more than usually lovely and was destined to receive many more visits  the women made their approach crawling some with babies on their backs  whitsuntide where the casks had to be filled with water showed a great number of large resolutelooking men whose air demanded caution but says the journal practice makes perfect and we get the habit of landing among strangers the knack of managing with signs and gesticulations and the feeling of ease and confidence which engenders confidence and goodwill in the others  quarrels usually arise from both parties being afraid and suspicious of each other  lepers isle owes its unpleasant name to its medicinal springs  it is a particularly beautiful place containing a population of good promise  three landings were made there and at the fourth place patteson jumped ashore on a rock and spent some time in calming the fears of a party of natives who had been frightened in their canoe by the boat under sail overtaking them  hey fingered bows and arrows but only from nervousness he says  however they seem to have suspected the visitors of designs on their load of fine taro and it was some time before the owner would come out and resume it  on all these isles the plan could as yet only be to learn names and write them down so as to enquire for acquaintance next time either make presents or barter them for provisions discover the class of language and invite scholars for another time  so at star island three or four natives said in ten moons you two come back very good then we go with you  i think patteson tells his sisters you would have liked to have seen me standing on a rock with my two supporters two fine young men who will i trust go with us next time my arms round their necks and a fine background of some thirty or forty dark figures with bows and arrows c and two or three little rogues perched on a point of rock above me just within reach asking for fishhooks  he says it in all simplicity but the picture presupposes some strength of mind in the sisters who were to appreciate it  few natives appeared at espiritu santo and the vessel passed on to oanuta or cherry island where the bishop had never been and where a race of dull goodnatured giants was found  the chief was a noble looking man with an aquiline nose and seemed to have them well under command and some of the younger men who had limbs which might have been a model for a sculptor could have lifted an ordinarysized englishman as easily as a child  they were unluckily already acquainted with whalers whom they thought the right sort of fellows since they brought tobacco and spirits did not interfere with native habits nor talk of learning for which the giants saw no need  the national complexion here was of a lighter yellow the costume a tattooed chest the language akin to maori and it was the same at tikopia where four chiefs one principal one immensely fat received their visitors seated on a mat in the centre of a wide circle formed by natives the innermost seated the others looking over them these too were accustomed to whalers and when they found that pigs and yams in exchange for spirits and tobacco were not the object they were indifferent  they seemed to despise fishhooks and it was plain that they had even obtained muskets from the whalers for there were six in the chiefs house and one was fired not maliciously but out of display  the bishop told them his object and they understood his language but were uninterested  the fat chief regaled the two guests with a cocoanut apiece and then seemed anxious to be rid of them  the banks islands as usual were much more hopeful santa maria coming first  canoes came round the vessel and the honesty of the race showed itself for one little boy who had had a fishhook given him wished to exchange it for calico and having forgotten to restore the hook at the moment swam back with it as soon as he remembered it  there was a landing and the usual friendly intercourse but just as the boat had put off a single arrow was suddenly shot out of the bush and fell about ten yards short  it was curious that the spanish discoverers had precisely the same experience  it was supposed to be an act of individual mischief or fun and the place obtained the appropriate name of cock sparrow point  it was not possible to get into the one landingplace in the wall round motas sugarloaf but there was an exchange of civilities with the saddleites and in vanua lava the largest member of the group a beautiful harbour was discovered which the bishop named port patteson after the judge  the santa cruz group was visited again on the 23rd of september nothing remarkable occurred indeed pattesons journal does not mention these places but that of the bishop speaks of a first landing at nukapu and an exchange of names with the old chief acenana and the next day of going to the main island where swarms of natives swam out with cries of toki toki and planks before them to float through the surf  about 250 assembled at the landing place as before chiefly eager for traffic  the volcano isle was also touched at but the language of the few inhabitants was incomprehensible  the mountain was smoking and redhot cinders falling as before on the steep side  it was tempting to climb it and investigate what probably no white man had yet seen but it was decided to be more prudent to abstain  some events of the visit to bauro are related in the following letter to the young cousin whose confirmation day had been notified to him in time to be thought of in his prayers   off san cristoval october 5 1857  my dearest penait was in a heathen land among a heathen people that i passed the sundaya day most memorable in your lifeon which i trust you received for the first time the blessed sacrament of our saviours body and blood  my darlingas i knelt in the chiefs house upon the mat which was also my bedthe only christian in that large and beautiful island my prayers were i hope offered earnestly that the full blessedness of that heavenly union with the lord jesus christ and in him with the father and the holy ghost might rest upon you for ever  i had reckoned upon being on board that sunday when the holy eucharist was administered on board our vessel but as we reached mwaata our well known village at san cristoval on saturday we both agreed that i had better go ashore while the vessel went away to return for me on monday  my day was now passed strangely enough my first sunday in a land where no sunday is known  it was about 3 pm on saturday when i landed and it was an effort to have to talk incessantly till dark  then the chief iri went with me to his house  it is only one oblong room with a bamboo screen running halfway across it about halfway down the room  it is only made of bamboo at the sides and leaves for the roof  yams and other vegetables were placed along the sides  there is no floor but one or two grass mats are placed on the ground to sleep on  iri and his wife and an orphan girl about fourteen or fifteen i suppose slept on the other side of the screen and two lads called grariri and parenga slept on my side of it  i cant say i slept at all for the rats were so very many coming in through the bamboo on every side and making such a noise i could not sleep though tired  they were running all about me  well at daylight i sent gariri to fetch some water and shaved and washed to the great admiration of iri and the ladies and of others also who crowded together at the hole which serves for door and windows  i lay down in my clothes all but my coat but i took a razor and some soap ashore  sunday was spent in going about to different neighbouring settlements and climbing the coral rocks was hard work the thermometer at sea being 85° in the cool cabin as the bishop told me today  of course many people were at work in the yam grounds several of which i saw but i found considerable parties at the different villages and had on the whole satisfactory conversations with them  they listened and asked questions and i told them as well as i could the simplest truths of christianity  i had a part of a yam and drank four cocoanuts during the day besides eating some mixture of yam taro and cocoanut all pounded together  people offered me food and nuts everywhere  walked back with a boy called tahi for my guide and stopped at several plantations and talked with the people  sat out in the cool evening on the beach at mwaata after much talk in a chiefs house called tarua people came round me on the beach and again i talked with them a sort of halfpreaching half conversing these talks were till iri said we must go to bed  slept a little that night  i can truly say that you were in my head all day  after my evening prayers when i thought of youfor it was about 9 pm  1010 am with you and you were on your way to churchi thought of you kneeling between your dear mamma and grandmamma and dear grandpapa administering to his three beloved ones the bread of life and i was very happy as i thought of it for i trust through the mercy of god and the merits of our lord that we shall be by him raised at the last day to dwell with him for ever  but indeed i must not write to you how very unworthy i felt to belong to that little company  this morning about eleven the vessels boat came off for me with the bishop  i had arranged about some lads coming on with us and it ended in seven joining our party  only one of our old scholars has come again he is that dear boy grariri whose name you will remember  now i have had a good change of shirts etc and feel clean and comfortable though i think a good nights rest will do me no harm i have written to you the first minute that i had time  what a blessed happy day it must have been for you and i am sure they thought of you at feniton  your loving cousin  j c p   this strange sunday was spent in conversation with different sets of natives and that some distinct ideas were conveyed was plain from what old iri was overheard saying to a man who was asking him whether he had not a guest who spoke bauro yes said iri adding that he said men were not like dogs or pigs or birds or fishes because these cannot speak or think  they all die and no one knows anything more about them but he says we shall not die like that but rise up again  on monday the 7th of october grera was revisited and toto a last years scholar came forth with his welcome in a canoe but it was rather a mixed success for the danger of the vessel on her previous visit was a warning against bringing her into the harbour where there was no safe anchorage and this disappointed the people thirteen indeed slept on board and the next morning sixty canoes surrounded the vessel and some hundred and sixty came on deck at once but they brought only one pig and a few yams and refused to fetch more saying it was too fara considerable inconvenience considering the necessity of providing the melanesian passengers with vegetable food  the whole nine slept in the inner cabin orariri on pattesons sofa feet to feet the others on the floor like herrings in a barrel  the great island of new caledonia was next visited  the bishop had been there before and basset one of the chiefs lamented that he had been so long absent and pleaded hard to have an english missionary placed in his part of the country  it was very sad to have no means of complying with the entreaty and the bishop offered him a passage to auckland there to speak for himself  he would have come but that it was the season for planting his yams but he hoped to follow and in the meantime sent a little orphan named kanambat to be brought up at auckland  the little fellow was pleased enough with the ship at first but when his countrymen who had been visiting there left her he jumped overboard and was swimming like a duck after them when at a sign from the bishop one of the pitcairners leapt after him and speedily brought him back  he soon grew very happy and full of play and fun and was well off in being away from home for the french were occupying the island and poor basset shortly after was sent a prisoner to tahiti for refusing to receive a roman catholic priest  nengone were reached on october 23 and most of the old scholars were ready with a warm welcome but mr creagh the london missionary had taken wadrokala away with him on an expedition and of the others only kowine was ready to return though the two married couples were going on well and one previous scholar of the bishops and four new ones presented themselves as willing to go  urgent letters from the neighbouring isle of lifu entreated the bishop to come thither and with a splendid supply of yams the southern cross again set sail and arrived on the 26th  this island had entirely abandoned heathenism under the guidance of the samoans  the people felt that they had come to the end of the stock of teaching of these good men and entreated for an englishman from the bishop and thus here was the third island in this one voyage begging for a shepherd and only one english priest had been found to offer himself to that multitude of heathen  the only thing that could be done was to take john cho a former st johns scholar to receive instruction to fit him for a teacher and with him came his young wife naranadune and their babe whom the bishop had just baptized in the corallime chapel with three other children  the next few days were spent in great anxiety for wailumai a youth from grera who was taken ill immediately after dinner with a most distressing difficulty of breathing  he proved to have a piece of sugar cane in his throat which made every breath agony and worked a small ulcer in the throat  all through the worst patteson held him in his arms with his hand on his chest several times he seemed gone and ammonia and sal volatile barely revived him  his first words after he was partially relieved were i am bishop  i am patihana meaning that he exchanged names with them the strongest possible proof of affection in melanesian eyes  he still seemed at the point of death and they made him say god the father god the son and god the holy ghost  jesus christ son of god  at last a favourable change took place but he continued so ill for several days that his two attendants never did more than lie down in their clothes nor was it till the third day that he at length coughed up the piece of cane that had caused the mischief  he still required so much care that patteson did not go on shore at norfolk island when the five pitcairners were exchanged for mrs selwyn  on november 15 auckland harbour was again reached after this signally prosperous voyage  it is thus summed up in a letter written two days later   november 17 1857 st johns college  my dear miss neillthanks for your £21 2s and more thanks still for your prayers and constant interest in this part of the world after nearly seventeen weeks at sea we returned safely on sunday morning the 15th with thirtythree melanesians gathered from nine islands and speaking eight languages  plenty of work for me i can teach tolerably in three and have a smattering of one or two more  one is the wife of a young man john cho an old scholar baptized his halfbrother is chief of lifu isle a man of great influence the london mission independents are leaving all their islands unprovided with missionaries and these people having been much more frequently visited by the bishop than by the john williams turn to him for help  by and by i will explain all this at present no time  we visited sixtysix islands and landed eightyone times wading swimming c all most friendly and delightful only two arrows shot at us and only one went nearso much for savages  i wonder what people ought to call sandalwood traders and slavemasters if they call my melanesians savages  you will hear accounts of the voyage from fanny  i have a long journal going to my father but i cant make time to write at length any more  i am up before five and not in bed before eleven and you know i must be lazy sometimes  it does me good  oh how great a trial sickness would be to me  in my health now all seems easy were i circumstanced like you how much i should no doubt repine and murmur  god has given me hitherto a most merciful share of blessings and my dear fathers cordial approbation of and consent to my proceedings is among the greatest  the anniversary of my dear mothers death comes round in ten days that is my polar star humanly speaking and whensoever it pleases god to take my dear dear father to his rest how blessed to think of their waiting for us if it be his merciful will to bring me too to dwell before him with them for ever  i must end for i am very busy  the weather is cold and my room full of lads and young men  if i was not watching like a cat they would be standing about in all sorts of places and catching cold  i send you in a box a box made by pitcairners of pitcairn woods  ever your loving old pupil  j c patteson   the little new caledonian remained at taurarua with the bishop and as there was no woman at st johns to take the charge of chos wife she was necessarily sent to mrs kisslings school for maori girls while her husband pursued his studies at st johns  patteson often gave his services at the maori village of orakei where there was to be a central native school managed by pirimona philemon a welltrained man a candidate for holy orders  however this did not satisfy his countrymen  as if i had not enough to do old wi comes with a request from the folks at orakei that i would be their minita and take the management of the concern  rather rich is it not  i said of course that i was minita for the islanders  oh let the bishop take another man for that you are the minister for us  he is you know wonderfully tatooed and a great object of curiosity to the boys  before many days had passed there had occurred the first case of that fatal tetanus which became only too well known to those concerned in the mission  of course all weapons were taken from the scholars but one of the san cristoval boys named tohehammai fetched one of his own arrows out of mr dudleys room to exchange with an english lad for a shirt and as he was at play carrying the arrow in his left hand behind his back and throwing a stick like a spear with the other he sharply pricked his right arm within the elbow against the point of the arrow but thinking nothing of the hurt and knowing that the weapons were forbidden playthings he said nothing for twelve days but then complained of stiffness in the arm two doctors happened to be at the college that day one thought it rheumatism the other mentioned the word tetanus but for three days more the arm was merely stiff it was hung in a sling and the boy went about as usual until on the fifteenth day spasmodic twitchings in the arm came on  liniment of chloroform was rubbed in and the boy was kept under chloroform but in vain the next day his whole body was perfectly rigid with occasional convulsions  about 4 pm his throat had become contracted and the endeavour to give him nourishment brought on convulsive attacks  the bishop came at 8 pm and after another attempt at giving him food which produced a further spasm he was lying quietly when patteson felt his pulse stop  he is dying the bishop said  father into thy hands we commend his spirit  pattesons amen came from his heart  the poor fellow made no sound as he lay with his frame rigid his back arched so that an arm could be thrust under it  he was gone in that moment unbaptized patteson writes  i had much conflict with myself about it  he had talked once with me in a very hopeful way but during his illness i could not obtain from him any distinct profession of faith anything to make me feel pretty sure that some conviction of the truth of what he he hd been taught and not mere learning by rote was the occasion of his saying what he did say  i did wish much that i might talk again with the bishop about it but his death took us by surprise  i pray god that all my omission and neglect of duty may be repaired and that his very imperfect and unconscious yearnings after the truth may be accepted for christs sake  the arrow was reported to have been poisoned but by the time the cause of the injury had been discovered it had been thrown away and could not be recovered for examination  indeed lockjaw seems to be so prevalent in the equatorial climates and the natives so peculiarly liable to it that poison did not seem needful to account for the catastrophe  altogether these lads were exotics in new zealand and exceedingly fragile  in the very height of summer they had to wear corduroy trousers blue serge shirts red woollen comforters and blue scotch caps and the more delicate a thick woollen jersey in addition and with all these precautions they were continually catching cold or getting disordered and then the bauro and grera set could only support such treatment as young children generally need  the loyalty islanders were much tougher and stronger and easier to treat but they too showed that the climate of auckland was a hard trial to their constitutions  on the last day of march came tidings of the sudden death of the muchbeloved and honoured dr james coleridge of thorverton  it is a great shock says the letter written the same day not that i feel unhappy exactly nor low but that many many memories are revived and keep freshening on my mind and since i left england his warm loving almost too fond letters have bound me very closely to him and sorely i shall miss the sight of his handwriting though he may be nearer to me now than before and his love for me is doubtless even more pure and fervent  i confess i had thought sometimes that if it pleased god to take you first the consciousness that he would be with you was a great comfort to menot that any man is worth much then  god must be all in all  but yet he of all men was the one who would have been a real comfort to you and even more so to others  to his cousin he writes   wednesday in passion week 1858 st johns college  my dearest sophyyour letter with the deep black border was the first that i opened with trembling hand thinking is it dear dear uncle gone to his eternal rest or dear aunty not that dear child may god grant for that would somehow seem to all most bitter of all less so to speak reasonable and natural  and he is really gone that dear loving courageous warmhearted servant of christ the desire of our eyes taken away with a stroke  i read your letter wondering that i was not upset knelt down and said the two prayers in the burial service and then came the tears for the memory of him rose up very vividly before me and his deep love for me and the notes of comfort and encouragement he used to write were very fresh in my mind  i looked at the print of him the one he sent out to me with your loving old uncle in pencil on it  i have all his letters when making a regular clearance some months ago i could not tear up his although dangerous ones for me to read unless used as a stimulant to become what he thought me  his jacob sermon in his own handwriting i have by me  but more than all the memory of his holy life and his example as a minister of christ have been left behind for us as a sweet undying fragrance his manner in the sick roomi see him now and hear that soft steady clear voice repeating verses over my dear mothers deathbed his kindly loving ways to his poor people his voice and look in the pulpit never to be forgotten  i knew i should never see him again in this world may god of his mercy take me to be with him hereafter  thank you dear sophy for writing to me every word about him is precious from his last letter to me  you will believe how sweet it is to me every month now to give the holy eucharist to my three dear ones  all complaints of old men must be serious  i wish i had more time to write but i am too busy in the midst of school and printing scripture histories and private prayers and translations in nengone bauro lifu and as all my time out of school is spent in working in the printing office i really have not a minute unoccupied  with one exception i have scarcely ever taken an hours walk for some six weeks  a large proportion of the printing is actually set up by my own fingers but now one nengone lad the flower of my flock can help me mucha young man about seventeen or eighteen of whom i hope very muchmalo baptized by the name of harper an excellent young man and a great comfort to me  he was setting up in type a part of the little book of private prayers i am now printing for them  i had just pointed out to him the translation of what would be in englishit is good that a man as he lies down to sleep should remember that that night he may hear the summons of the angel of god so then let him think of his death and remember the words of st paul awake thou that sleepest etc when in came the man whom the archdeacon left in charge here with my letters  i hope sir there is no bad news for you and my eye lighted on the deep black border of your envelope  tomorrow if i live i enter upon my thirtysecond yeara solemn warning i have received today as another year is passing from me may some portion of his spirit rest on me to bless my poor attempt to do what he did so devotedly for more than forty years his duty as a soldier and servant of his lord and master into whose joy he has no doubt now entered  easter daywhat an easter for him and doubtless we all who will by and by as the world rolls round receive the holy eucharist shall be in some way united to him as well as to all departed saints members of his mystical body  april 12bishop came out yesterday afternoon from auckland  after baptisms at 5 and evening service at 7 sat till past 11 settling plans thus god willing start this day fortnight to return the boysthis will occupy about two months as we come back from the far north he will drop one at lifu one of the loyalty islands with large population he will go on to new zealand stay perhaps six weeks in new zealand or it may be two months so that with the time occupied by his voyage from lifu to new zealand 1000 miles and back he will be away from lifu about two and a half or three months then picking me up say about september 12 we go on at once to the whole number of our islands spending three months or so among them getting back to new zealand about the end of november  so that i shall be in melanesia dv from the beginning of may to the end of november  i shall be able to write once more before we start letters which you will get by the june mail from sydneyand of course i shall send letters by the bishop when he leaves me at lifu but i shall not be able to hear again from england till the bishop comes to pick me up in september  never mind  i shall have plenty to do and i can think of those dear ones at home and of you all in gods keeping with perfect comfort  the lifu people are in a more critical state than any others just now otherwise i should probably stop at san cristoval  a few years ago they were very wild cannibals of course but they are now building chapels and thirsting for the living waters  what a privilege and responsibility to go to them as christs minister to a people longing for the glad tidings of the gospel of peace  samoan teachers have been for a good many years among them  i cannot write now to dearest aunty or pena  may god bless you and abundantly comfort you i think i see his dear face  i see him always  your loving cousin  j c patteson   chos wife had arrived in a cart at the college when her baby was a day old so rapid is recovery with mothers in those climates  i saw the baby observes the journal quite strong not darkbut i dont care for them till they can talk on the contrary i think them a great bore especially in wooden houses where a child with good lungs may easily succeed in keeping all the inhabitants awake  april 12settled that i stop at lifu in the interval between the two voyages  i think lifu wants me more than any other island just now  some 15000 or 20000 stretching out their hands to god  the london mission independent sent samoan teachers long ago but no missionary even after frequent applications  at last they applied personally to the bishop he being well known to them of old  i cant go for good because i have of course to visit all these islands but i shall try to spend all the time that i am not at sea or with boys in new zealand perhaps three months yearly with them till they can be provided with a regular clergyman  so i shall have no letters from you till the return of the vessel to pick me up in september  but be sure you think of me as very happy and well cared for though i am glad to say not a white man on the island lots of work but i shall take much exercise and see most of the inhabitants  the island is large not so large as bauro but still large  you will say all that is kind to all relations buckerell etc thank the dear old vicar for the spurs and tell him that i had a battle royal the other day with a colonial steed which backed into the bush and kicked and played the fool amazingly till i considerably astonished him into a gallop in the direction i wanted to go by a vigorous application of the said spurs  god bless and keep you all  your loving  j c patteson   a few days later he writes   the southern cross returning to lifu will bring my letters but unless a stray whaler comes to lifu while i am there on its way to sydney that will be the only exchange of letters  i am afraid this will be an increase of the trial of separation to you all but it is not sent until you have learnt to do pretty well without me and you will be comforted by knowing that this island of lifu with many inhabitants is in a very critical state that what it most wants is a missionary and that as far as i am concerned all the people will be very anxious to do all they can for me  i take a filter and some tea  we shall have yams taro cocoanuts occasionally a bit of turtle a fowl or a bit of pork  so you see i shall live like an alderman i mean if i am to go to every part of the island heathen and all  perhaps 20000 people scattered over many miles  i say heathen and all because only a very small number of the people now refuse to admit the new teaching  samoans have been for some time on the island and though i dare say their teaching has been very imperfect and only perhaps ten or fifteen people are baptized they have chapels and are far advanced beyond any of the islands except nengone and toke always excepting anaiteum  hence it is thought the leaven may work quietly in the solomon islands without me but that at lifu they really require guidance  so now i have a parochial charge for three months of an island about twentyfive miles long and some sixteen or eighteen broad  i feel that my letters after so long an absence may contain much to make me anxious so that i shall not look with unmixed pleasure to my return to my great packet yet i feel much less anxiety than you might imagine i know well that you are in gods keeping and that is enough  after just touching at nengone early in may the southern cross went on to lifu and on landing the bishop and mr patteson found a number of people ready to receive them and to conduct them to the village where the chief and a great number of people were drawn up in a halfcircle to receive them  the young chief angadhohua bowed and touched his hat and taking coleys hand held it and whispered we will always live together  by and by we will talk about it was the answer and they were taken to a new house belonging to one of the samoans built of lath plastered and thatch with one large room and a lesser one at each of its angles  there the bishop and mr patteson sat on a chest and seventy or eighty men squatted on mats john cho and the native teacher foremost  there was a five minutes pause  lifu was not yet familiar to coley who spoke it less well than he had spoken german and john cho said to him shall i tell them what you have said to me formerly  he then explained that mr patteson could only offer them a visit of three or four months and would then have the charge of lads from dark isles  silence again then angadhohua asked cannot you stop always  there are many difficulties which you cannot understand which prevent me  would you like me to shut the door which god has opened to so many dark lands  no no but why not have the summer school here as well as the winter  because it does the lads good to see new zealand and because the bishop who knows better than i do thinks it right  and cannot we have a missionary  however they were forced to content themselves with all that could be granted to them and it was further explained that mr patteson would not supersede the native teachers nor assume the direction of the sunday services only keep a school which any one might join who liked  this was felt to be only right in good faith to the london mission in order not to make dire confusion if they should be able to fill up the gap before the church could  after sleeping in the house patteson produced the books that had been printed for them at st johns  would that you could have seen their delight  about two pages indifferently printed was all they had hitherto  now they saw thirtytwo clearly printed 8vo pages of bible history sixteen of prayers rubrics c eight of questions and answers  you see said i cunningly that we dont forget you during these months that i cant live among you  they began reading at once and crying excellent exactly right the very thing  it was thought good that some one from lifu should join the mission party and testify to their work and on the invitation the chief angadhohua a bright youth of seventeen volunteered to go  it was an unexampled thing that a chief should be permitted by his people to leave them there was a public meeting about it and a good deal of excitement but it ended in cho as spokesman coming forward with tears in his eyes saying yes it is right he should go but bring him back soon  what shall we do  patteson laid his hand on the young chiefs shoulder answering god can guard him by sea as on land and with his blessing we will bring him back safe to you  let some of the chiefs go with him to protect him  i will watch over him but you may choose whom you will to accompany him  so five chiefs were selected as a bodyguard for the young angadhohua who was prince of all the isle but on an insecure tenure for the french in new caledonia were showing a manifest inclination to annex the loyalty group  the heavily loaded boat had a perilous strife with the surf before the ship was reached and it was a very rough passage to anaiteum where some goods had to be left for mr inglis and he asked that four fate visitors might be taken home  this was done and mr grordon was visited at erromango on the way and found well and prosperous  at mai the reception of petere and laure was ecstatic  there was a crowd on shore to meet them and on the two miles walk to the village parties met hugged and wept over them  at the village mr patteson addressed the people for ten minutes and petere made an animated exposition of what he had learnt and his speeches evidently had great effect  his younger brother and two little boys all came in his stead and would form part of the winter school at lifu  the espiritu santo boy the dunce of the party was set down at home and the banks islanders were again found pleasant honest and courteous thinking as it appeared afterwards that the white men were the departed spirits of deceased friends  a walk inland at vanua lava disclosed pretty villages nestling under banyan trees one of them provided with a guestchamber for visitors from other islands  two boys sarawia and another came away to be scholars at lifu as well as his masters in the language of which he as yet scarcely knew anything but which he afterwards found the most serviceable of all these various dialects  the 26th of may brought the vessel to bauro where poor old iri was told of the death of his son and had a long talk with mr patteson beginning with do you think i shall see him again  it was a talk worth having though it was purchased by spending a night in the house with the rats  it seemed as though the time were come for calling on the baurese to cease to be passive and sixty or seventy men and women having come together mr patteson told them that he did not mean to go on merely taking their boys to return them with heaps of fishhooks and knives but that unless they cared for good teaching to make them good and happy here and hereafter he should not come like a trader or a whaler  that their sons should go backwards and forwards and learn but to teach at home and that they ought to build a holy house where they might meet to pray to god and learn his will  much of this was evidently distasteful though they agreed to build a room  i think he writes that the trial stage of the work has arrived this has less to attract outwardly than the first beginning of all and as here they must take a definite part they the great majority who are not yet disposed to decide for good are made manifest and the difficulty of displacing evil customs is more apparent  in fact these amiable docile baurese seemed to have little manliness or resolution of character and sumaro a scholar of 1857 was especially disappointing for he pretended to wish to come and learn at lifu but only in order to get a passage to gera where he deserted and was well lectured for his deceit  the gera people were much more warlike and turbulent and seemed to have more substance in them though less apt at learning  patteson spent the night on shore at perua a subsidiary islet in the bay sleeping in a kind of shed upon two boards more comfortably than was usual on these occasions  showing confidence was one great point and the want of safe anchorage in the bay was much regretted because the people could not understand why the vessel would not come in and thought it betokened mistrust  many lads wished to join the scholars but of those who were chosen two were forced violently overboard by their friends and only two eventually remained making a total of twelve pupils for the winter school at lifu with five languages between them seven with the addition of the nengone and lifu scholars  you see writes patteson on june 10 on the voyage that our difficulty is in training and organising nations raising them from heathenism to the life morally and socially of a christian  this is what i find so hard  the communication of religious truth by word of mouth is but a small part of the work  the real difficulty is to do for them what parents do for their children assist them tonay almost force upon themthe practical application of christian doctrine  this descends to the smallest matters washing scrubbing sweeping all actions of personal cleanliness introducing method and order habits of industry regularity giving just notions of exchange barter trade management of criminals division of labour to do all this and yet not interfere with the offices of the chief and to be the model and pattern of it who is sufficient for it  on june 16 mr patteson was landed at lifu for his residence there with the five chiefs his twelve boys and was hospitably welcomed to the large new house by the samoan  he and four boys slept in one of the corner rooms the other eight lads in another the rarotongan teacher tutoo and his wife in a third  the central room was parlour school and hall and as it had four unglazed windows and two doors opposite to each other and the tradewind always blowing the state of affairs after daylight was much like that which prevailed in england when king alfred invented lanterns while in the latter end of june the days were of course as short as they could be on the tropic of capricorn so that patteson got up in the dark at 530 in the morning  at 7 the people around dropped in for prayers which he thought it better not to conduct till his position was more defined  then came breakfast upon yams cooked by being placed in a pit lined with heated stones with earth heaped over the top  mr and mrs tutoo with their white guest sat at the scrap of a table which with a small stool was the only thing on four legs in the place except an occasional visitor in the shape of a pig  then followed school two hundred lifu people came and it was necessary to hold it in the chapel  one oclock dinner on yams and very rarely on pig or a fowl baked or rather done by the same process and in the afternoon some reading and slate work with the twelve melanesians and likewise some special instruction to a few of the more promising lifuites  at 630 another meal of yams but this time patteson had recourse to his private store of biscuit and the evening was spent in talk till bedtime at 9 or 930  it was a thorough sharing the native life but after a few more experiments it was found that english strength could not be kept up on an exclusive diet of yams and the loyalty isles are not fertile  they are nothing but rugged coral in an early stage of development great ridges upheaved bare and broken and here and there with pits that have become filled with soil enough to grow yams and cocoanuts  the yamsexcept those for five of the lads whose maintenance some of the inhabitants had undertakenwere matter of purchase and formed the means of instruction in the rules of lawful exchange  a fixed weight of yams were to constitute prepayment for a pair of trousers a piece of calico a blanket tomahawk or the like and all this was agreed to cho being a great assistance in explaining and dealing with his people  but it proved very difficult to keep them up to bringing a sufficient supply and as they had a full share of the universal spirit of haggling the commissariat was a very harassing and troublesome business and as to the boys it was evident that the experiment was not successful  going to new zealand was seeing the world  horses cows sheep a town soldiers c were to be seen there whereas lifu offered little that they could not see at home and schooling without novelty was tedious  indeed the sight of civilised life the being taken to church the kindness of the friends around the college were no slight engines in their education but the lifu people were not advanced enough to serve as an exampleexcept that they had renounced the more horrible of their heathen habits  they were in that unsettled state which is peculiarly trying in the conversion of nations when the old authoritative customs have been overthrown and the christian rules not established  it was a good sign that the respect for the chief was not diminished one evening an english sailor for there turned out to be three whites on the island who was employed in the sandalwood trade was in the house conversing with tutoo when angadhohua interrupted him and hein ignorance of the youths rankpushed him aside out of the way  the excitement was great  a few years previously the offender would have been killed on the spot and as it was it was only after apology and explanation of his ignorance that he was allowed to go free but an escort was sent with him to a place twenty miles off lest any one should endeavour to avenge the insult not knowing it had been forgiven  many of the customs of these loyalty isles are very unhealthy and the almost exclusive vegetable diet produced a low habit of body that showed itself in all manner of scrofulous diseases especially tumours under which the sufferer wasted and died  much of pattesons time was taken up by applications from these poor creatures who fancied him sure to heal them and had hardly the power certainly not the will to follow his advice  nor had he any authority  he only felt himself there on sufferance till the promised deputation should come from rarotonga from the london mission to decide whether the island should be reserved by them or yielded to the church  meantime he says on sunday  tutoo has had a pretty hard days work of it poor fellow and he is anything but strong  at 930 we all went to the chapel which began by a hymn sung as roughly as possible but having rather a fine effect from the fact of some 400 or 500 voices all singing in unison then a long extemporary prayer then another hymn then a sermon nearly an hour long  it ought not to have taken more than a quarter of an hour but it was delivered very slowly with endless repetitions otherwise there was some order and arrangement about it another hymn brought the service to an end about 11  but his work was not done school instantly succeeded in the same building and though seven native teachers were working their classes the burthen of it fell on him  school was concluded with a short extemporary prayer  at three service againhymn prayer another long sermon hymn and at last we were out of chapel there being no more school  to be sure is the entry on another sunday little thought i of old that sunday after sunday i should frequent an independent chapel as for extemporary prayer not being a form that is absurd  these poor fellows just repeat their small stock of words over and over again and but that they are evidently in earnest it would seem shockingly irreverent sometimes  most extravagant expressions tutoo is a very simple humbleminded man and i like him much  he would feel the help and blessing of a prayerbook poor fellow to be a guide to him but even the lords prayer is never heard among them  so careful was mr  patteson not to offend the men who had first worked on these islands that on one sunday when tutoo was ill he merely gave a skeleton of a sermon to john cho to preach  on the 27th of july however the deputation arrived in the john williams two ministers and mr creagh on his way back to nengone and the upshot of the conference on board after a dinner in the house of apollo the native teacher was that as they had no missionary for lifu they made no objection to mr patteson working there at present and that if in another year they received no reinforcement from home they would take into consideration the making over their teachers to him  my position is thus far less anomalous my responsibility much increased  god will i pray and trust strengthen me to help the people and build them up in the faith of christ  august 2yesterday i preached my two first lifu sermons rather nervous but i knew i had command of the language enough to explain my meaning and i thought over the plan of my sermons and selected texts  fancy your worthy son stuck up in a pulpit without any mark of the clergyman save white tie and black coat commencing service with a hymn then reading the second chapter of st matthew quite new to them then a prayer extemporary but practically working in i hope the principle and much of the actual language of the prayer bookie confession prayer for pardon expression of belief and praisethen another hymn the sermon about forty minutes  text i am the way c  afternoon thy word is a lantern unto my feet  you can easily understand how it was simple work to point out that a man lost his way by his sin and was sent out from dwelling with god the recovery of the way by which we may again return to paradise is practically the one great event which the whole bible is concerned in teaching  the subject admitted of any amount of illustration and any amount of reference to the great facts of scripture history and everything converges to the person of christ  i wish them to see clearly the great pointsfirst gods infinite love and the great facts by which he has manifested his love from the very first till the coming of christ exhibited most clearly the infinite wisdom and love by which mans return to paradise has been effected  significant is that one word to the thief on the cross paradise the way open again the guardian angel no longer standing with flaming sword in the entrance admission to the tree of life  the services were much shorter than usual chiefly because i dont stammer and bungle and take half an hour to read twenty verses of the bible and also because i discarded all the endless repetitions and unmeaning phrases which took up half the time of their unmeaning harangues  about an hour sufficed for the morningservice the evening one might have been a little longer  i feel quite at my ease while preaching and john told me it was all very clear but the prayersoh i did long for one of our common prayerbooks  one effect of the independent system began to reveal itself strongly how could definite doctrines be instilled into the converts by teachers with hardly any books and no formula to commit to memory what was the faith these good samoans knew and taught  no doctrinal belief exists among them writes patteson in the third month of his stay  a man for years has been associated with those who are called the people that seek baptism  he comes to me  j g p  who instituted baptism  a  jesus  j g p  and he sent his apostles to baptize in the name of whom  dead silence  why do you wish to be baptized  to live  all that jesus has done for us and given to us and taught us is for that object  what is the particular benefit we receive in baptism  no conception  such is their state  i would not hesitate if i thought there were any implicit recognition of the doctrine of the trinity but i cant baptize people morally good who dont know the name into which they are to be baptized who cant tell me that jesus is god and man  there is a lad who soon must die of consumption whom i now daily examine  he has not a notion of any truth revealed from above and to be embraced and believed as truth upon the authority of gods word  a kind of vague morality is the substitute for the creed of the apostles  what am i to do  i did speak out for three days consecutively pretty well but i am alone and only here for four months and yet i fear i am expecting too much from them and that i ought to be content with something much less as the so to speak qualifications but surely they ought to repent and believe  to say the word i believe without a notion of what they believe surely that wont do  they must be taught and then baptized according to our lords command suited for adults  constant private teaching to individuals was going on and the 250 copies of the lifu primer were dispersed where some thousands were wanted and mr patteson wrote a little book of sixteen pages containing the statement of the outlines of the faith and of scripture history but this could not be dispersed till it had been printed in new zealand  and in the meantime a fresh element of perplexity was arising  the french had been for some time past occupying new caledonia and a bishop had been sent thither about the same time as bishop selwyn had gone to new zealand but though an earnest and hardworking man he had never made much progress  he had the misfortune of being connected in the peoples minds with french war ships and aggression and moreover the south sea race seem to have a peculiar distaste for the roman catholic branch of the church for which it is not easy to account  the loyalty isles as lying so near to new caledonia were tempting to the french empire and the bishop at the same time felt it his duty to attempt their conversion  some priests had been placed at the north end of the island for about six months past but the first communication was a letter on july 6 complaining partly in french partly in english that since mr pattesons arrival the people had been making threatening reports now mr patteson had from the first warned them against showing any unkindness to the french priests and he wrote a letter of explanation and arranged to go and hold a conference  on the way while supping with the english sailor at the village where he was to sleep he heard a noise and found the frenchman pere montrouzier had arrived  he was apparently about forty intelligent very experienced in mission work and conversant with the habits and customs of french and english in the colonies moreover with plenty of firmness in putting forward his cause  he seems to have been supported by the state in a manner unusual with french missions  i had one point only that i was determined to press patteson says namely liberty to the people to follow any form of religion they might choose to adopt  i knew that they and i were completely in his power yet that my line was to assume that we were now about to arrange our plans for the future independently of any interference from the civil power  he let me see that he knew he could force upon the lifu people whatever he pleased the french government having promised him any number of soldiers he may send for to take possession if necessary of the island  they have 1000 men in new caledonia steamers and frigates of war and he told me plainly that this island and nengone are considered as natural appendages of new caledonia and practically french possessions already so that of course to attempt doing more than secure for the people a religious liberty is out of the question  he promised me that if the people behaved properly to him and his people he would not send for the soldiers nor would he do anything to interfere with the existing state of the island  he will not himself remain here long being commissioned in consequence of his fourteen years experience to prepare the way for the french mission here  he told me that twenty missionaries are coming out for this group about seven or eight of whom will be placed on lifu others on nengone c that the french government is determined to support them that the commandant of nimia in new caledonia had sent word to him that any number of men should be sent to him at an instants notice in a war steamer to do what he might wish in lifu but that honestly he would do nothing to compel the people here to embrace romanism but that if necessary he would use force to establish the missionaries in houses in different parts of the island if the chiefs refused to sell them parcels of land for instance one acre  the captain of the iris an english frigate called on him on monday and sent me a letter by him making it quite clear that the french will meet with no opposition from the english government  he too knew this and of course knew his power but he behaved i must say well and if he is really sincere about the liberty of religion question i must be satisfied with the result of our talk  i was much tired  we slept together on a kind of bed in an unfurnished house where i was so cold that i could not sleep besides my head ached much so my night was not a very pleasant one in the morning we resumed our talk but the business was over really the question that we had discussed the evening before was brought to an issue however by his requiring from john cho who was with us permission to buy about an acre of land in his territory  john was much staggered at this  it looked to him like a surrender of his rights  i told him at great length why i thought he must consent but finally it was settled that as john is not the real chief i should act as interpreter for the frenchmen and send him from mu an answer to a letter which he addresses to me but which is in fact intended for the chief  it is i suppose true that civilised nations do not acknowledge the right of a chief to prevent any one of his subjects from selling a plot of his land to a foreigner unless they may be at war with that particular nation  he said that france would not allow a savage chief to say my custom in this respect is different from yours and again this is not a taking possession  it is merely requiring the right to put up a cottage for which i pay the just price  he told me plainly if the chiefs did not allow him to do so he would send for soldiers and put it up by force but not use the soldiers for any other purpose  of course i shall relate all this to angadhohua at mu and make them consent  he told me that at new caledonia they had reserved inalienably one tenth of the land for the natives that the rest would be sold to french colonists of the poor class no one possessing more than ten acres that 5000 convicts would be sent there and the ticketof leave system adopted and that he thought the worst and most incorrigible characters would be sent to lifu  poor john  but i cant help him he must make such terms as he can for he and his people are wholly in their power  our talk being ended i found a great circle of men assembled on the outside with a pile of yams as usual in the centre for me  i was glad to see a small pile also for the frenchman  i made my speech in his presence but he knows not lifu  be kind to the french give them food and lodging  this is a duty which you are bound to pay to all men but if they try to persuade you to change the teaching which you have received dont listen to them  who taught you to leave off war and evil habits to build chapels to pray remember that  trust the teachers who have taught you the word of god  this was the kind of thing i said  then off we settwo miles of loose sand at a rattling pace as i wanted to shake off some 200 people who were crowding about me  then turning to the west climbed some coral rocks very quickly and found myself with only half my own attendants and no strangers  sat down drank a cocoanut and waited a long time for john who cant walk well and then quietly went on the remaining eight or nine miles to zebedees place a samoan teacher  they were very attentive and gave me some supper they had a bed which was of course given up to me in spite of opposition  they regard a missionary as something superhuman almost sometimes i cant make them eat and drink with me they think it would be presumptuous  large meeting of people in the afternoon and again the following morning to whom i said much what i had already said at we  then fifteen miles over to apollos place on the west coast a grand bay with perfectly calm water delicious in the winter months  comfortable quarters apollo a cleverish freespoken fellow  i went on the same afternoon two miles of very bad road to visit the french priest who is living here  more talk and of a very friendly nature  he has been eighteen months at san cristoval but knows not the language at woodlark island new caledonia c  we talked in french and english  he knows english fairly but preferred to talk french  this days work was nineteen miles  slept at apollos  next morning went a little way in canoes and walked six miles to tomas place meeting held speech as usual present of yams pig c  walked back the six miles started in double canoe for gaicha the other side of the bay wind cold some difficulty in getting ashore  walked by the bad path to apollos and slept there again frenchman came in during the evening  next day friday meeting in the chapel  walked twenty miles back to we where i am now writing  went the twenty miles with no socks feet sore and shoes worn to pieces cutting off leather as i came along  nothing but broken bottles equals jagged coral  paths went so that you never take three steps in the same direction and every minute trip against logs coral hidden by long leaves arid weeds trailing over the path often for half a mile you jump from one bit of coral to another  no shoes can stand it and i was tired i assure you  indeed for the last two days if i stopped for a minute to drink a nut my legs were so stiff that they did not get into play for five minutes or so  july 16ththe captain of the iris frigate passing lifu dropped me a line which satisfied me that the french will meet with no impediment from the english government in the prosecution of their plans out here  well this makes ones own path just as easy because all these things great and small are ordered for us but yet i grieve to think that we might be occupying these groups with missionaries  even ten good men would do for a few years and is it unreasonable to think that ten men might be found willing to engage in such a happy work in such a beautiful part of the worldno yellow fever no snakes c  i think of the banks islands vanua lava with its harbour and streams and abundance of food and with eight or nine small islands round it speaking the same language few dialectic differences of consequence as i believe  even one good man might introduce religion here as we have received it pure and undefiled  oh that there were men who could believe this and come out unconditionally placing themselves in the bishops hands unreservedly  he must know the wants and circumstances of the islands far better than they can and therefore no man ought to stipulate as to his location c  did the early teachers do so  did titus ever think of saying to st paul mind i must be an elder or bishop or whatever he was of crete  just as if that frame of mind was compatible with a real desire to do what little one can by gods help to bring the heathen to a knowledge of christ  at this moment one man for the banks group and another for mai and the neighbouring islands would be invaluable  if anything occurs to make me leave these loyalty islands as my residence during a part of the year i am off to banks or mai or solomon isles  but what am i  in many respects not so well qualified for the work as many men who yet perhaps have had a less complete education  i know nothing of mechanics and cant teach common things i am not apt to teach anything i fear having so long deferred to learn the art of teaching but of course exposing ones own shortcomings is easy enough  how to get the right sort of men  first qualification is commonsense guided of course by religious principle  some aptitude for languages but that is of so little consequence that i would almost say no one was sufficient by itself as a qualification of course the mission work tends immensely to improve all earnest men the eccentricities and superfluities disappear by degrees as the necessary work approves itself to the affection and intellect  the french question resulted in a reply in angadhohuas name that the people should be permitted to sell ground where the mission required it and that in the one place specified about which there was contention the land should be ceded as a gift from the chiefs this observes mr patteson is the first negotiation which has been thrust upon me  i more than suspect i have made considerable blunders  by the 13th of august he had to walk over the coral jags for another consultation with pere montrouzier whose negotiation with cho had resulted in thorough misunderstanding each thinking the other was deceiving him and not dealing according to promise to mr patteson the pere had in his fourteen years experience imbibed a great distrust of the natives and thought mr patteson placed too much confidence in them while the latter thought him inclined to err the other way however matters were accommodated at heavy cost to poor coleys feet  a second pair of shoes were entirely cut to pieces and he could not put any on the next day his feet were so blistered  the troubles were not ended for when the ground was granted there followed a stipulation that the chiefs should not hinder the men from working at the building and when the men would not work the chiefs were suspected of preventing it and a note from pere montrouzier greatly wounded pattesons feelings by calling john cho faux et artificieux  however after another note he retracted this and a day or two after came the twenty miles over the coral to make a visit to the english clergyman  there is much to like in him a gentleman thoroughly well informed anxious of course to discuss controversial points and uncommonly well suited for that kind of work he puts his case well and clearly and of course it is easy to make their system appear most admirably adapted for carrying out all the different duties of a church as it is consistent in all or nearly all particulars given the one or two leading points on which all depend  the church of england here is very much in the position of any one of those other bodies wesleyan independent or presbyterian and though we have a bishop at the headof what however  of one individual clergyman  oh that we had now a good working forcetwenty or thirty men with some stuff in them and there are plenty if they would only come  meanwhile france sends plenty of men steamers bring them houses cows for themselves and as presents for nativessupports the missionary in every way  new caledonia is handy for the central school everything almost that can be requisite  never mind work on one small life is a mighty trifling thing considered with reference to those great schemes overruled by god to bring out of them great ultimate good no doubt  there was an interchange of books between the french and english priest  pere montrouzier lent and finally gave martinets solution de grands problemes which patteson calls a very interesting book with a great deal of dry humour about it not unlike newmans more recent publications  it is he montrouzier says thought very highly of in france  he is a wellread man i should imagine in his line and that is pretty extensive for he is a really scientific naturalist something of a geologist a good botanist besides having a good acquaintance with ecclesiastical literature  there was the more time for recreation with the peres french books and the serious work of translating st marks grospel and part of the litany into lifu as the inhabitants were all called off from school in the middle of august by a whale being washed ashore over a barrier reefnot far from me  all the adjacent population turned out in grass kilts with knives and tomahawks to hack off chunks of flesh to be eaten and of blubber to be boiled into oil and in the meantime the neighbourhood was by no means agreeable to anyone possessing a nose  meanwhile sarawia the best of the banks pupils had a swelling on the knee and required care and treatment but soon got better medical knowledge as usual patteson felt one of the great needs of missionary life  cases of consumption and scrofula were often brought to him and terrible abscesses under which the whole body wasted away  poor people he writes a consumptive hospital looms in the far perspective of my mind a necessary accompaniment i feel now of the church and the school in early times  i wish i could contrive some remedy for the dry food everything being placed between leaves and being baked on the ground losing all the gravy and when you get a chicken it is a collection of dry strings  if i could manage boiling but there is nothing like a bit of iron for fireplace on the island and to keep up the wood fire in the bush under the saucepan is hard work  i must commence a more practical study than hitherto of robinson crusoe and the swiss family why does no missionary put down hints on the subject  my three months here will teach me more than anything that has happened to me and i dare say i shall get together the things i want most when next i set forth from new zealand i find it a good plan to look on from short periods to short periods and always ask what next  and at last it brings one to the real answerwork as hard as you can and that rest which lacks no ingredient of perfect enjoyment and peace will come at last  among the needs he discovered was thisby the bye good cheap bible prints would be very useful large so as to be seen by a large class illustrating just the leading ideas  schnorrs bible prints by rose and bingen are something of the kind that i mean something quite rude will do  twentyfour subjects comprising nothing either conventional or symbolical would be an endless treasure for teachers the intervening history would be filled up and illustrated by smaller pictures but these would be pegs on which to hang the great events these lads ought to know  each should be at least twentyfour inches by ten  try to remember in the choice of any other picture books for them that anything that introduces european customs is no use yet pictures of animals are the best things  one or two of a railway a great bridge a view of the thames with steamers rushing up and down would all do but all our habits of social life are so strange that they dont interest them yet  when i next reach auckland i suppose my eyes will rejoice at seeing your dear old likenesses  when we build our permanent central schoolhouse at kohimarama i shall try to get a little snuggery and then furnish it with a few things comfortably i shall then invest in a chest of drawers as i dare say my clothes are getting tired of living in boxes since march 1855  i can hardly tell you how much i regret not knowing something about the treatment of simple surgical cases  if when with w i had studied the practicalbled drawn teeth mixed medicines rolled legs perpetually it would have been worth something  surely i might have foreseen all this  i really dont know how to find the time or the opportunity for learning  how true it is that men require to be trained for their particular work  i am now just in a position to know what to learn were i once more in england  spend one day with old fry mason another with john venn carpenter and two every week at the exeter hospital and not look on and see others work theres the mischief do it oneself  make a chair a table a box fit everything help in every part of making and furnishing a house that is a cottage  do enough of every part to be able to do the whole  begin by felling a tree saw it into planks mix the lime see the right proportion of sand c know how to choose a good lot of timber fit handles for tools c  many trades need not be attempted but every missionary ought to be a carpenter a mason something of a butcher and a good deal of a cook  suppose yourself without a servant and nothing for dinner to morrow but some potatoes in the barn and a fowl running about in the yard  thats the kind of thing for a young fellow going into a new country to imagine to himself  if a little knowledge of glazing could be added it would be a grand thing just enough to fit in panes to windowframes which last of course he ought to make himself  much of this cannot be done for you  i can buy window frames in auckland and glass but i cant carry a man a thousand miles in my pocket to put that glass into these frames and if it is done in new zealand ten to one it gets broken on the voyage whereas glass by itself will pack well  besides a pane gets broken and then i am in a nice fix  to know how to tinker a bit is a good thing else your only saucepan or teakettle may be lying by you useless for months  in fact if i had known all this before i should be just ten times as useful as i am now  if anyone you know thinks of emigrating or becoming a missionary just let him remember this  to these humble requisites it appears that a missionary ought on occasion to be able to add those of a prime minister and lawgiver angadhohua a bright clever lad only too easily led was to be instructed in the duties of a chief mr patteson scrupulously trying in vain to make him understand that he was a person of far more consideration and responsibility than his white visitor would be in his own country  the point was to bring the christian faith into connection with life and government  much talk have i had with john in order that we may try to put before them the true grounds on which they ought to embrace christianity writes mr patteson when about to visit a heathen district which had shown an inclination to abandon their old customs and also the consequences to which they pledge themselves by the profession of a religion requiring purity regularity industry c but i have little doubt that our visit now will result in the nominal profession of christianity by many heathen  angadhohua john and i go together and isaka a samoan teacher who has been a good deal among them  i shall make an arrangement for taking one of their leading men to new zealand with me that he may get some notion of what is meant by undertaking to become a christian  it is in many respects a great benefit to be driven back upon the very first origin of a christian society one sees more than ever the necessity of what our lord has provided a living organised community into which the baptized convert being introduced falls into his place as it were naturally sees around him everything at all times to remind him that he is a regenerate man that all things are become new  a man in apostolic times had the lessons of the apostles and disciples practically illustrated in the life of those with whom he associated  the church was an expression of the verbal teaching committed to its ministers  how clearly the beauty of this comes out when one is forced to feel the horrible blank occasioned by the absence of the living teacher influencing moulding building up each individual professor of christianity by a process always going on though oftentimes unconsciously to him on whom it operates  but how is the social life to be fashioned here in lifu according to the rule of christ  there is no organised body exemplifying in daily actions the teaching of the bible  a man goes to chapel and hears something most vague and unmeaning  he has never been taught to grasp anything distinctlyto represent any truth to his mind as a settled restingplace for his faith  who is to teach him  what does he see around him to make him imperceptibly acquire new habits in conformity with the bible  is the christian community distinguished by any habits of social order and intercourse different from non christians  true they dont fight and eat one another now but beyond that are they elevated as men  the same dirt the same houses the same idle vicious habits in most cases no sense of decency or but very little  where is the expression of the scriptural life  is it not a most lamentable state of things  and whence has it arisen  from not connecting christian teaching in church with the improvement in social life in the hut and village which is the necessary corollary and complement of such teaching  by gods grace i trust that some little simple books in lifu will soon be in their houses which may be useful  it is even a cause for thankfulness that in a few days for the southern cross ought to be here in a week with 500 more copies some 600 or more copies in large type of the lords prayer creed and ten commandments will be in circulation but they wont use them yet  they wont be taught to learn them by heart and be questioned upon them yet they may follow by and by  hope on is the rule  give them the bible is the cry but you must give them the forms of faith and prayer which christendom has accepted to guide them and oh that we were so united that we could baptize them into a real living exemplification and expressionan embodiment of christian truth walking sleeping eating and drinking before their eyes  christ himself was that on earth and his church ought to be now  these men saw to accept his teaching was to bind themselves to a certain course of life which was exhibited before their own eyes  hence multitudes approved his teaching but would not accept itwould not profess it because they saw what was involved in that profession  but now men dont count the cost they forget that if any man come to me is followed by which of you intending to build a tower c  hence the great and exceeding difficulty in these latter days when christianity is popular  in this state of things it was impossible to baptize adults till they had come to a much clearer understanding of what a christian ought to do and to believe and therefore coleys only christenings in lifu were of a few dying children whom he named after his brother and sisters as he baptized them with water brought in cocoanut shells having taught himself to say by heart his own translation of the baptismal form  he wrote the following letter towards the end of his stay   september 6 1858 lifu loyalty islands  my dear miss neillthe delay of four or five days in the arrival of the southern cross gives me a chance of writing you a line  the bishop dropped me here this day three months and told me to look out for him on september 1  as new zealand is 1000 miles off and he cant command winds and waves of course i allow him a wide margin and i begged him not to hurry over my important business in new zealand in order to keep his appointment exactly  but his wont is to be very punctual  i have here twelve lads from the northwest islands from seven islands speaking six languages  the plan of bringing them to a winter school in some tropical isle is now being tried  the only difficulty here is that lifu is so large and populous and just now what with french priests on it and the most misty vague kind of teaching from independents the only thing to oppose to the complete machinery of the romish system demands so much time that it is difficult to do justice to ones lads from the distant lands that are living with one here  the bishop had an exaggerated notion of the population here  i imagine it to be somewhere about 8000  the language is not very hard but has quite enough difficulty to make it more than a plaything the people in that state when they venerate a missionarya very dangerous state i do my best to turn the reverence into the right channel and towards its proper object  you will see by the last melanesian report of which i desired a copy to be sent to you that our work is very rapidly increasing that openings are being made in all directions and that had we men of trust we could occupy them at once  as it is we keep up a communication with some seventyfour islands waiting if it may be that men may be sent trying to educate picked men to be teachers but i am not very sanguine about that  at all events the first flush of savage customs c is being i trust removed so that for some other body of christians if not the church of england the door may be laid open  of course the interest of the work is becoming more and more absorbing so that much as there is indeed going on in your world to distract and grieve one it comes to me so weakened by time and distance that i dont sympathise as i ought with those who are suffering so dreadfully from the indian mutiny or the commercial failure or the great excitement and agitation of the country  you can understand how this can be perhaps for my actual present work leaves me small leisure for reflecting and for placing myself in the position of others at a distance and when i have a moments time surely it is right that i should be in heart at feniton with those dear ones and especially my dear dear father of whom i have not heard for five months so that i am very anxious as to what account of him the southern cross may bring and try to prepare myself for news of increased illness c  you i imagine my dear miss neill are not much changed to those who see you day by day but i should find you much weaker in body than when i saw you last and yet it did not seem then as if you had much strength to lose i dont hear of any sudden changes or any forms of illness the gradual exhausting process is going on but accompanied i fear with even greater active pain than of old your sufferings are indeed very severe and very protracted a great lesson to us all  yet you have much even speaking only of worldly comfort which makes your position a much happier one than that of the poor suffering souls whom i see here  their house is one round room a log burning in the centre no chimney the room full of smoke common receptacle of men women boys girls pigs and fowls  in the corner a dying woman or child  no water in the island that is fresh a few holes in the coral where water accumulates more or less brackish no cleanliness no quiet no cool fresh air hot smoky atmosphere no proper food a dry bit of yam and no knowledge of a life to come such is the picture of the invalided or dying south sea islander  all dying children under years of discretion i baptize and all the infants brought to the chapel by parents who themselves are seeking baptism but i have not baptized any adults yet they must be examined and taught for some time for the samoan and rarotongan teachers sent by the independent missionaries are very imperfectly instructed and quite incapable of conveying definite teaching to them  i dont see humanly speaking how this island is to be kept from becoming purely roman catholic  they have a large staff of men and are backed up by the presence of a complete government establishment in new caledonia only two or three days distant while what have we four months a year of the time partially otherwise occupied by melanesian schools of one missionary and while here these four months i have my lads from many islands to teach so that i cant lay myself out to learn this one language c  i am writing this on september 16  southern cross not yet come and my lads very anxious i confess i should like to see it not only as you will believe because all my stores are gone  i have not a morsel of biscuit or grain of sugar left and am reduced to native fare which does not suit my english constitution for very long  yams and taro and a fowl now and then will be my food until the ship comes hitherto i have had coffee and biscuits in addition  my very kind love to mrs s  and many thanks for the letters which i much enjoy  your very affectionate old pupil  j c p   the whole of september passed without the arrival of the southern cross  the fact was that after mr patteson had been left at lifu the vessel when entering portaufrance new caledonia had come upon a coral reef and the damage done to her sheathing was so serious that though she returned to auckland from that trip she could not sail again without fresh coppering and as copper had to be brought from sydney for the purpose there was considerable delay before she could set forth again so that it was not till the last day of september that she gladdened pattesons eyes and brought the long desired tidings from home  this voyage was necessarily short as there were appointments to be kept by the bishop in new zealand in november and all that could be aimed at was the touching at the more familiar islands for fresh instalments of scholars  the grand comet of 1858 was one feature of this expeditionwhich resulted in bringing home fortyseven melanesians so that with the crew there were sixtythree souls on board during the homeward voyage  as you may suppose the little southern cross is cram full but the bishops excellent arrangements in the construction of the vessel for securing ventilation preserve us from harm by gods blessing every day a thorough cleaning and sweeping goes on and frequent washing and as all beds turn up like the flap of a table and some thirty lads sleep on the floor on mats and blankets by 7 am all traces of the night arrangements have vanished  the cabin looks and feels airy meals go on regularly the boys living chiefly on yams puddings and cocoanuts and plenty of excellent biscuit  we laid in so many cocoanuts that they have daily one apiece a great treat to them  a vessel of this size unless arranged with special reference to such objects could not carry safely so large a party but we have nothing on board to create conceal or accumulate dirt no hold no storeroom no place where a mixed mess of spilt flour and sugar and treacle and old rotten potatoes and cocoanut parings and bits of candle can all be washed together into a dark foul hold hence the whole ship fore and aft is sweet and clean stores are kept in zinc lockers puttied down and in cedar boxes lined with zinc  we of course distribute them ourselves a hired steward would be fatal because you cant get a servant to see the importance of care in such details  mr patteson always in the most careful manner paid respect both to the chiefs person and his dicta  he declined more than once to give directions which he said ought to issue from the chief although on one of these occasions he was asked by the chief himself  he foresaw clearly the evils that might follow if the peoples respect for recognised authority were weakened instead of being as it might be turned to useful account  and so he always accorded to john cho and to other persons of rank when they were with us in the mission school just such respect as they were accustomed to receive at the hands of their own people  for instance he would always use to a moderate extent the chiefs language in addressing john cho or any other of the loyalty chiefs and it being a rule of theirs that no one in the presence of the chiefs should ever presume to sit down higher than the chiefs he would always make a point of attending to it as regarded himself and once or twice when on shore in the islands the chief had chosen to squat down on the ground among the people he would jocularly leave the seat that had been provided for him and place himself by the chiefs side on the ground  all this was keenly appreciated as significant but alas the loyalty islanders were not long to remain under his charge  the ensuing letter was written to sir john taylor coleridge after learning the tidings of his retirement from the bench in the packet of intelligence brought by the vessel   november 10 1858 lat 31° 29 s long 171° 12 e  my dear uncle johni see by the papers that you have actually resigned and keep your connection with the judges only as a privy councillor  i am of course on my own account heartily glad that you will be near my dear father for so many months of the year and you are very little likely to miss your old occupation much with your study at heaths court so i shall often think of you in summer sitting out on the lawn by johns pinus excelsis and in winter in your armchair by the fire and no doubt you will often find your way over to feniton  and then you have a glorious church oh i do long for a venerable building and for the sound of ancient chants and psalms  at times the sunday is specially a day on which my mind will go back to the old country but never with any wish to return i have never experienced that desire and think nothing but absolute inability to help on a melanesian or a maori will ever make a change in that respect  i feel as certain as i can be of anything that i should not be half as happy in england as i am in new zealand or in lifu in the banks or solomon islands c  i like the life and the people everything about it and them  coppering the schooner caused delay so that he the bishop could give but two months instead of three to the island voyage for he starts on november 25 for a three months confirmation tour 1000 miles among the new zealanders which will bring him to wellington by march 1 for the commencement of the first synod  consequently we have only revisited some of our seventy and odd islands but we have no less than fortyseven melanesians from twelve islands on board of whom three are young married women while two are babies  this makes our whole number on board sixty viz four pitcairners fortyseven melanesians ourselves  crew  sixtythree a number too great for so small a vessel but for the excellent plan adopted by the bishop in the internal arrangement of the vessel when she was built and the scrupulous attention to cleanliness in every place fore and aft  as it is we are not only healthy but comfortable able to have all meals regularly school prayers just as if we had but twenty on board  nevertheless i think if you could drop suddenly on our lower deck at 9 pm and visit unbeknown to us the two cabins you would be rather surprised at the number of the sleeperstwelve in our aftercabin and fortyfive in the larger one which occupies twothirds of the vessel  of course we make no invasion upon the quarters forward of the four men before the mastcommon seamen and take good care that master and mate shall have proper accommodation  one gets so used to this sort of thing that i sleep just as well as i used to do in my own room at home and by 630 or 7 am all vestiges of anything connected with sleeping arrangements have vanished and the cabins look like what they arelarge and roomy we have you know no separate cabins filled with bunks c abominations specially contrived to conceal dirt and prevent ventilation  light calico curtains answer all purposes of dividing off a cabin into compartments but we agree to live together and no one has found it unpleasant as yet  we turn a part of our cabin into a gunaikhon at night for the three women and two babies by means of a canvas screen  bishop looks after them washes the babies tends the women when sick c while i by virtue of being a bachelor shirk all the trouble  one of these women is now coming for the second time to the college her name is carry  margaret cho is on her second visit and hrarore is the young bride of kapua now coming for his third time and baptized last year  we wish to make both husbands and wives capable of imparting better notions to their people  we have i think a very nice set on board  i think everything points to vanua lava the principal island of the banks group becoming our centre of operations ie that it would be the place where winter school would be carried on with natives from many islands from solomon islands group to the northwest and santa cruz group to north new hebrides to south and loyalty islands southwest and also the depot among the islands a splendid harbour safe both from trade and hurricane winds plenty of water abundantly supplied with provisions being indeed like a hothouse with its hot springs constantly sending up clouds of vapour on the high hills a population wholly uninjured by intercourse with traders and whalers it being certain that our vessel was the first at all events that has ever been seen by the eyes of any member of this generation on the islands i could prove this to you easily if i had time  they are most simple gentle and docile unwarlike not cannibals i verily believe as good a specimen of the natural fallen man as can be met with wholly naked yet with no sense of shame in consequence timid yet soon learning to confide in one intelligent and gleaming with plenty of spirit and fun  as the island though 440 miles north of the loyalty isles is not to leeward of them it would only take us about eight days more to run down and a week more to return to it from new zealand than would be the case if we had our winter school on one of the loyalty islands  so i hope now we may get a missionary for lifu and so i may be free to spend all my time when not in new zealand at vanua lava  temperature in winter something under 80° in the shade being in lat 13° 45 5  the only thing against vanua lava is the fact that elephantiasis abounds among the natives and they say that the mortality is very considerable there so it might not be desirable to bring many lads to it from other islands but the neighbouring islands of mota and valua and uvaparapara are in sight and are certainly healthy and our buildings are not so substantial as to cause much difficulty in shifting our quarters if necessary the language is very hard but when it is ones business to learn a thing it is done after a while as a matter of course  we have quite made up our mind that new zealand itself is the right place for the headquarters of the mission  true the voyage is long and lads can only be kept there five or six months of the year but the advantages of a tolerably settled state of society are so great and the opportunities of showing the melanesians the working of an english system are so many that i think now with the bishop that new zealand should be the place for the summer school in preference to any other  i did not think so at one time and was inclined to advocate the plan of never bringing the lads out of the tropics but i think now that there are so many good reasons for bringing the lads to new zealand that we must hope to keep them by good food and clothing safe from colds and coughs  norfolk island would have been in some ways a very good place but there is no hope now of our being settled there  i can hardly have quite the same control over lads brought to an island itself wholly uncivilised as i can have over them in new zealand but as a rule melanesians are very tractable  certainly i would sooner have my present school to manage fortyfive of all ages from nine to perhaps twentyseven or eight from twelve or thirteen islands speaking at least eight languages than half the number of english boys up to all sorts of mischief  thank you dear uncle for the xavier a little portable book is very nice for taking on board ship and i dare say i may read some of his letters in sight of many a heathen island  goodbye my dear uncle  your affectionate and grateful nephew  j c patteson   savages are all fridays if you know how to treat them is a saying of pattesons in one of his letters and a true one  in truth there was no word that he so entirely repudiated as this of savage and the courtesy and untutored dignity of many of his native friends fully justified his view since it was sure to be called forth by his own conduct towards them  the chiefs having a great idea of their own importance and being used to be treated like something sacred and never opposed were the most difficult people to deal with and in the present voyage there was a time of great anxiety respecting a young chief named aroana from the great isle of malanta  he fell into an agony of nervous excitement lest he should never see his island again an attack of temporary insanity came on and he was so strong that mr patteson could not hold him down without the help of the bishop and another and it was necessary to tie him down as he attempted to injure himself  he soon recovered and the cooler latitudes had a beneficial effect on him but there was reason to fear that in malanta the restraint might be regarded as an outrage on the person of a chief  the voyage safely ended on the night of the 16th of november  here is part of a letter to mr edward coleridge written immediately after reading the letters that had been waiting in auckland   my father writesmy tutor says that there must be a melanesian bishop soon and that you will be the man a sentence which amused me not a little  the plan is that the bishop should gradually take more and more time for the islands as he transfers to the general synod all deeds documents everything for which he was corporation sole and as he passes over to various other bishops portions of new zealand finally retaining only the north part of the northern island to take the melanesian bishopric  i urged this plan upon him very strongly one day when somewhere about lat 12° s  i fancy he pressed me to talk freely about the matter  i said one condition only i think should be present to your mind viz that you must not give up the native population in new zealand and to this he assented  if dear tutor you really were not in joke just try to find some good man who would come and place himself under the bishops direction unreservedly and in fact be to him much what i am  the ability and earnestness c  seriously i am not at all fitted to do anything but work under a good man  of course should i survive the bishop and no other man come out why it is better that the ensign should assume the command than to give up the struggle altogether but this of course is pure speculation  the bishop is hearty and i pray god may be bishop of melanesia for twenty years to come and by that time there will be many more competent men than i ever shall be to succeed him to say nothing of possible casualties climate c  goodbye my dear uncle kind love to all  your loving nephew and pupil  j c patteson   the three women and the two babies were disposed of in separate houses but their husbands with thirtynine other melanesians four norfolk islanders two printers mr dudley and mr patteson made up the dinnerparty every day in the hall of st johns college  not a little happy i feel at the head of my board with two rows of merry happylooking melanesians on either side of me  the coughs colds and feverish attacks of these scholars were the only drawback the slightest chill made them droop and it was a subject of joy to have any day the full number in hall instead of one or two lying ill in their tutors own bedchamber  on the 29th of december came the exceeding joy of the arrival of the judge and mrs martin almost straight from feniton ready to talk untiringly of everyone there  on the new years day of 1859 there was a joyful thanksgiving service at taurarua for their safe return at which all the best church people near were present and when john cho made his first communion  on the 20th these muchloved friends came to make a long stay at the college and the recollections they preserved of that time have thus been recorded by lady martin  it will be remembered that she had parted from him during the year of waiting and irregular employment  we were away from new zealand nearly three years  we had heard at feniton dear coleys first happy letters telling of his voyages to the islands in 18567 letters all aglow with enthusiasm about these places and people  one phrase i well remember his kindly regret expressed for those whose lot is not cast among the melanesian islands  on our return we went to live for some months at st johns college where mr patteson was then settled with a large party of scholars  we soon found that a great change had passed over our dear friend his whole mind was absorbed in his work  he was always ready indeed to listen to anything there was to tell about his dear father but about our foreign travels his favourite pictures the scenes of which we had heard so much from him he would listen for a few minutes but was sure in a little while to have worked round to melanesia in general or to his boys in particular or to some discussion with my husband on the structure of their many languages and dialects  it was then that bishop abraham said that when the two came to their ninth meaning of a particle he used to go to sleep  there were a very fine intelligent set of young men from the loyalty islands some sleepy lazy ones from mai some fierce wildlooking lads from the solomon islands who had long slits in their ears and bone horns stuck in their frizzly hair  mr patteson could communicate with all more or less easily and his readily delicate hearing enabled him to distinguish accurately sounds which others could not catchwonderful mp and piv and mbw which he was trying to get hold of for practical purposes  he was in comfortable quarters in one long low room with a sunny aspect  it looked fit for a student with books all about and pictures and photos of loved friends and places on the walls but he had no mind to enjoy it alone  there was sure to be some sick lad there wrapped up in his best rugs in the warmest nook by the fire he had morning and afternoon school daily in the large schoolroom mr dudley and mr lask assisting him  schoolkeeping in its ordinary sense was a drudgery to him and very distasteful  he had none of that bright lively way and readiness in catechising which made some so successful in managing a large class of pupils at once but every person in the place loved to come to the evening classes in his own room where in their own language he opened to them the scriptures and spoke to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god  it was in those private classes that he exercised such wonderful influence his musical voice his holy face his gentle manner all helping doubtless to impress and draw even the dullest long after this he told me once how after these evening classes one by one some young fellow or small boy would come back with a gentle tap at the door i want to talk to you and then and there the heart would be laid open and counsel asked of the beloved teacher  it was very pleasant to see him among his boys  they all used to go off for a walk on saturday with him sometimes to town and he as full of fun with them as if they had been a party of eton boys  he had none of the conventional talk so fatal to all true influence about degraded heathen  they were brethren ignorant indeed but capable of acquiring the highest wisdom  it was a joke among some of us that when asked the meaning of a nengone term of endearment he answered naively oh it means old fellow  he brought his fresh happy kindly feelings towards english lads and young men into constant play among melanesians and so they loved and trusted him  i think that exclusiveness of interest which lady martin describes and which his own family felt and which is apt to grow upon missionaries as indeed on every one who is very earnestly engaged in any work diminished as he became more familiar with his work and had a mind more at liberty for thought  mr dudley thus describes the same periodit was during the summers of 18578 and 18589 that the loyalty islanders mustered in such numbers at st johns college as it was supposed that they at least lifu would be left in the hands of the church of england  mr patteson worked very hard these years at translations and there was an immense enthusiasm about printing the lifuites and nengonese striving each to get the most in their own language  never shall i forget the evening service during those years held in the college chapel consisting of one or two prayers in bauro gera and other languages and the rest in nengonese occasionally changing to lifu when mr patteson used to expound the passage of scripture that had been translated in school during the day  usually the loyalty islanders would take notes of the sermon while it went on but now and then it was simply impossible for although his knowledge of nengonese at that time as compared with what it was afterwards was very limited and his vocabulary a small one from which to choose his expressions he would sometimes speak with such intense earnestness and show himself so thoroughly en rapport with the most intelligent of his hearers that they were compelled to drop their papers and pencils and simply to to listen  i remember one evening in particular  for some little time past the conduct of the men especially the married men had not been at all satisfactory  the married couples had the upper house and john cho simeona and kapua had obtained a draughtboard and had regularly given themselves up to draughtplaying night and day neglecting all the household duties they were expected to perform to the great annoyance of their wives who had to carry the water and do their husbands work in other ways as well their own  this became soon known to mr patteson and without saying anything directly to the men he took one evening as his subject in chapel those words of our lord if thy hand or thy foot offend thee c and spoke as you know he did sometimes speak and evidently was entirely carried out of himself using the nengonese with a freedom which showed him to be thinking in it as he went on and with a face only to be described as the face of an angel  we all sat spellbound  john cho simeona and the other walked quietly away without saying a word and in a day or two afterwards i learnt from john that he had lain awake that night thinking over the matter that fear had come upon him lest he might be tempted again and jumping up instantly he had taken the draught board from the place where he had left it and had cast it into the embers of their fire  many and many a time was i the recipient of his thoughts walking with him up and down the lawn in front of the cottage buildings of an evening when he would try to talk himself clear  you may imagine what a willing listener i was whatever he chose to talk upon and he often spoke very freely to me i being for a long time his only resident white companion  it was not long before i felt i knew his father well and reverenced him deeply  he never was tired of talking of his home and of former days at eton and oxford and then while travelling on the continent  often and often during those early voyages have i stood or sat by his side on the deck of the southern cross as in the evening after prayers he stood there for hours dressed in his clerical attire all but the grey tweed cap one hand holding the shrouds and looking out to windward like a man who sees afar off all the scenes he was describing  thinking over those times since one understands better far than one did at the time the reality of the sacrifice he had made in devoting himself for life to a work so far away from those he loved best on earth  the bishop of wellington for to that see archdeacon abraham had been consecrated while in england arrived early in march and made a short stay at the college during which he confirmed eleven and baptized one of pattesons flock  mrs abraham and her little boy remained at the college while her husband went on to prepare for her at wellington and thus there was much to make the summer a very pleasant one only chequered by frequent anxieties about the health of the pupils as repeated experiments made it apparent that the climate of st johns was too cold for them  another anxiety was respecting lifu for the london missionary society had after all undertaken to supply two missionaries from england and it was a most doubtful and delicate question whether the wishes of the natives or the established principle of noninterference with preoccupied ground ought to have most weight  the primate was so occupied by new zealand affairs that he wrote to mr patteson to decide it himself and he could but wait to be guided by circumstances on the spot  to mr edward coleridge he writes on the 18th of march   i have many and delightful talks with mr martin on our languages we see already how strong an infusion of polynesian elements exists in the melanesian islands  with the language of four groups we are fairly acquainted now besides some of the distinguishing dialects which differ very much from one another nevertheless i think that byandby we shall connect them all if we live but as some dialects may have dropped out altogether we may want a few links in the chain to demonstrate the connection fully to people at a distance  it is a great refreshment to me to work out these matters and the judge kindly looked up the best books that exist in all the polynesian languages so that we can found our induction upon a comparison of all the dialects now from the solomon islands to the marquesas with the exception of the santa cruz archipelago  we have been there two or three times but the people are so very numerous and noisy that we never have had a chance as yet of getting into a quiet talk by signs c with any of the people  still as we know some polynesian inhabitants of a neighbouring isle who have large sea canoes and go to santa cruz we may soon get one of them to go with us and so have an interpreter get a lad or two and learn the language  we are sadly in want of men yet we cannot write to ask persons to come out for this work who may be indisposed when they arrive in new zealand to carry out the particular system on which the bishop proceeds  any man who would come out and consent to spend a summer at the melanesian school in new zealand in order to learn his work and would give up any preconceived notions of his own about the way to conduct missionary work that might militate against the bishops plansuch a man would be of course the very person we want but we must try to make people understand that halfeducated men will not do for this work  men sent out as clergymen to the missionfield who would not have been thought fit to receive holy orders at home are not at all the men we want  it is not at all probable that such men would really understand the natives love them and live with them but they would be great dons keeping the natives at a distance assuming that they could have little in common cideas wholly destructive of success in missionary or in any work  that pride of race which prompts a white man to regard coloured people as inferior to himself is strongly ingrained in most mens minds and must be wholly eradicated before they will ever win the hearts and thus the souls of the heathen  what a preachment as usual about melanesia  your loving old pupil and nephew  j c patteson   next follows a retrospective letter   april 1 1859 st johns college  my dearest fatherthirtytwo years old today  well it is a solemn thing to think that one has so many days and months and years to account for  looking back i see how fearfully i wasted opportunities which i enjoyed of which i fancy i should now avail myself gladly but i dont know that i fancy what is true for my work now though there is plenty of it is desultory and i dare say hard application continuously kept up would be as irksome to me as ever  it seems very strange to me that i never found any pleasure in classical studies formerly  now the study of the languages for its own sake even is so attractive to rue that i should enjoy working out the exact and delicate powers of greek particles c but i never cared for it till it was too late and the whole thing was drudgery tn me  i had no appreciation again of historians or historians only thought thucydides difficult and herodotus prosy and tacitus dull and livy apparently easy and really very hard  so again with the poets and most of all i found no interest fancy in plato and aristotle  they were presented to me as merely school books not as the great effort of the cultivated heathen mind to solve the riddle of mans being and i in those days never thought of comparing the heathen and christian ethics and the great writers had no charm for me  then my french  if i had really taken any pains with old tarver in old daysand it was your special wish that i should do sohow useful it would be to me now whereas though i get on after a sort i dont speak at all as i ought to do and might have learnt to do it is sad to look back upon all the neglected opportunities and it is not only that i have not got nearly so to speak a quantity of useful materials for ones work in the present time but that i find it very hard to shake off desultory habits  i suppose all persons have to make reflections of this kind more or less sad but somehow i feel it very keenly now for certainly i did waste time sadly and it so happens that i have just had tom browns schooldays lent me and that i spent some time in reading it on this particular day and of course my eton life rose up before me  what a useful book that is  a real gain for a young person to have such a book  that is very much the kind of thing that would really help a boymanly true and plain  i hear from sydney by last mail that the bishop is really desirous to revive the long dormant board of missions  he means to propose to send a priest and a deacon to every island ready for them and to provide for themif they are forthcoming and funds  of this latter i have not much doubt  april 24i have to get ready for three english full services to morrow besides melanesian dittoso goodbye my dearest father  your loving and dutiful son  j c patteson   sir john patteson might well say in a letter of this summer to bishop selwyn  as to my dear boy coley i am more and more thankful every day that i agreed to his wishes and in whatever situation he may be placed feel confident that his heart will be in his work and that he will do god service  he will be contented to work under any one who may be appointed bishop of melanesia or any other title or to be the bishop himself  if i judge truly he has no ambitious views and only desires that he may be made as useful as his powers enable him to be whether in a high or subordinate situation  nothing could be more true than this  there was a general sense of the probability that mr patteson must be the first missionary bishop but he continued to work on at the immediate business always keeping the schemes and designs which necessarily rose in his mind ready to be subjected to the control of whomsoever might be set over him  the cold had set in severely enough to make it needful to carry off his party of coughing shivering melanesians before easter and the southern cross sailed on the 18th  patteson took with him a good store of coffee sugar and biscuits being uncertain whether he should or should not again remain at lifu  in the outward voyage he only landed his pupils there and then went on to the banks islands where sarawia was returned at vanua lava and after mr patteson had spent a pleasant day among the natives mota was visited next after  may 24on monday at 3 pm we sailed from port patteson across to mota  here i landed among 750 people and the boat returned to the vessel  she was to keep up to windward during the night and call for me the next morning  i walked with my large following from the teach up a short steep path to the village near to which indeed only 200 yards off is another considerable village  the soil is excellent the houses goodbuilt round the open space which answers to the green in our villages and mighty banyan trees spreading their lofty and widebranching arms above and around them  the side walls of these houses are not more than two feet high made only of bamboos lashed by cocoanut fibre or wattled together and the long sloping roofs nearly touch ground but within they are tolerably clean and quite dry  the moon was in the first quarter and the scene was striking as i sat out in the open space with some 200 people crowding round memen women and children fires in front where yams were roasting the dark brown forms glancing to and fro in the flickering light the moons rays quivering down through the vast trees and the native hollow drum beating at intervals to summon the people to the monthly feast on the morrow  i slept comfortably on a mat in a cottage with many other persons in it  much talk i had with a large concourse outside and again in this cottage on christianity and all were quiet when i knelt down as usual and said my evening prayers  up at 530 am and walked up a part of the sugar loaf peak from which the island derives its english name and found a small clear stream flowing through a rocky bed back to the village where were some 300 people assembled sat some time with them then went to the beach where the boat soon came for me  after this there was a good deal of bad weather but all the lads were restored to their islands including aroana the young malanta chief who had begun by a fit of frenzy but had since behaved well and who left his english friends with a promise to do all in his power to tame his people and cure them of cannibalism  then came some foul winds and hot exhausting weather  i have done little more than read stanleys sinai and palestine and helpss spanish america two excellent books and most delightful to me  the characters in the spanish conquest of mexico and america generally the whole question of the treatment of natives and that nobleman las casasare more intelligible to me than to most persons probably  the circumstances of my present life enable me to realise it to a greater extent  then i have been dipping into a little ethnology yesterday a little plato but it is almost too hot for anything that requires a working headpiece  you know i take holiday time this voyage when we are in open water and no land near and it is great relaxation to me  a pretty severe gale of wind followed a sharp test of pattesons seamanship  then came one day of calm when we all got our clothes dry and the deck and rigging looked like an old clothes shop  then we got a fairish breeze but we can get nothing in moderation  very soon it blew up into a strong breeze and here we are lying to with a very heavy sea  landsmen would call it mountainous i suppose  i am tired for i have had an anxious time and we have had but one quiet night for an age and then i slept from 930 pm to 730 am continuously it may be that this is very good training for me  indeed it must give me more coolness and confidence  i felt pleased as well as thankful when we made the exact point of nengone that i had calculated upon and at the exact time  on the 20th of june auckland harbour was safely attained but the coming back without scholars did not make much of holiday time for their master who was ready to give help to other clergymen whenever it might be needed though in fact this desultory occupation always tried him most  on the 25th of july he says  i have had a sixty miles walk since i wrote last some part of it over wild country  i lost my way once or twice and got into some swamps but i had my little pocketcompass  my first day was eighteen miles in pouring rain no road in your sense of the word but a good warm room and tea at the end  next day on the move all day by land and water seeing settlers scattered about  third day sunday services at two different places  fourth day walk of some twentyseven miles through unknown regions baptizing children at different places and reaching after divers adventures a very hospitable restingplace at 8 pm in the dark next day an easy walk into auckland and taurarua  yesterday sunday very wet day  manofwar gig came down for me at 915 am took the service on board 11 am  st pauls service afternoon hospital a mile or so off 6 pm st pauls evening service 830 arrived at taurarua dripping  the same letter replies to one from home  i thank you my dear father for writing so fully about yourself and especially for seeing and stating so plainly your full conviction that i ought not to think of returning to england  it would as you say humanly speaking interfere most seriously with the prospects of the mission  some dear friends write to me differently but they dont quite understand as you have taken pains to do what our position is out here and they dont see that my absence would involve great probable injury to the whole work  it is curious how few there are who know anything of new zealand and melanesia  of course it is useless to speculate on the future but i see nothing at all to make it likely that i shall ever revisit england i cant very well conceive any such state of things as would make it a duty to gratify my constant inclination  and my dear father i dont scruple to say for you will understand me that i am happier here than i should be in england where even though i were absent only a few months i should bear about with me the constant weight of knowing that melanesia was not provided for  and strange as it may seem this has quite ceased to be a trial to me  the effort of subduing the longing desire to see you is no longer a great one i feel that i am cheerful and bright and lighthearted and that i have really everything to make a man thankful and contented  and if you could see the thankful look of the bishop when he is again assured that there is no item of regret or desire to call me home on your part you would feel i know that colonial work does require especially an unconditional unreserved surrender of a man to whatever he may find to do  but while admiring the noble spirit in which the son held fast his post and the father forebore to unsettle him there let not their example he used in the unkind and ignorant popular cry against the occasional return of colonial bishops  for be it remembered that dire necessity was not drawing coleridge patteson to demand pecuniary assistance round all the platforms of english towns  the eton and the australian and new zealand associations supplemented by the society for the propagation of the gospel and his own family relieved him from the need of having to maintain his mission by such means  all these letters are occupied with the arrangements for raising means for removing the melanesian college to a less bleak situation and it is impossible to read them without feeling what a difference it made to have a father who did not view giving to gods work as robbing his family  on the 13th of august patteson was on board preparing for the voyage very cold and eager for the tropics  the parting voice in his farewell letter is i think i see more fully that work by the power of gods spirit is the condition of us all in this world tiny and insignificant as the greatest work of the greatest men is in itself yet the one talent is to be used  it was meant to be a farewell letter but another followed in the leisure while waiting for the bishop to embark with some strong not to say fiery opinions on the stern side of duty  i feel anxious to try to make some of the motives intelligible upon which we colonial folk act sometimes  first  i think that we get a stronger sense of the necessity for dispensing with that kind of courtesy and good nature which sometimes interferes with duty than people do in england  so a man placed as i am for example really cannot oftentimes avoid letting it be seen that work must come first and by degrees one sympathises less than one possibly should do with drones and idlers in the hive and feels it wrong to assent to a scheme which lets a real work suffer for the sake of acquiescing in a conventional recognition of comfort claims of society c  would the general of an army say to his officers pray gentlemen dont dirty your boots or fatigue your horses to succour the inhabitants of a distant village  or a captain to his mates and middies dont turn out dont go aloft  it is a thing hard and you might get wet  and the difference between us and people at home sometimes is that we dont see why a clergyman is not as much bound as an officer in the army or navy to do what he is pledged of his own act to do and that at home the parsonage and ponycarriage delusion practically makes men forget this  i forget it as much as any man and should very likely never have seen the mistake but for my coming to new zealand and it is one of the great blessings we enjoy  there is a mighty work to be done  god employs human agents and the bible tells us what are the rules and conditions of their efficiency  oh but poor man he has a sickly wife  yes but it remaineth that those who have wives be as they that have none  true but the case of a large family  whosoever loveth child more than me c  second  the fact that we live almost without servants makes us more independent and also makes us acquainted with the secrets of each others housekeeping c  all that artificial intercourse which depends a good deal upon a wellfitted servants hall does not find place here  more simple and more plain and homely in speech and act is our life in the colonieseg you meet me carrying six or seven loaves from town to the college  oh i knew that the bishop had to meet some persons there today and i felt nearly sure there would be no breakfast then  of course an english person thinks why didnt he send the bread  to which i answer who was there to send  i dont mean that i particularly like turning myself into a miller one day and a butcher the next but that doing it as a matter of course where there is no one else to do it one does sometimes think it unreasonable to say as has been said to the bishoptwo thousand pounds a year you want for your mission work  yes said the bishop and not too much for sailing over ten thousand miles and for educating clothing and feeding some forty young men  i mean that conventional notions in england are preventing people from really doing half what they might do for the good of the needy  i dont know how this might be said to be a theory tending to revolutionise society but i think i do know that there is a kind of religious common sense which comes in to guide people in such matters  only i do not think it right to admit that plea for not doing more in the way of almsgiving which is founded upon the assumption that first of all a certain position in society must be kept up which involves certain expenditure  a barrister is living comfortably on £800 a year or a clergyman in his living of £400  the professional income of the one increases and a fatter living is given to the other or some money is left them  what do they do  instantly start a carriage another servant put the jackofalltrades into a livery turn the buttons into a flunkey and the village girl into a ladies maid  is this really right  they were well enough before  why not use the surplus for some better purpose  i imagine that we the clergy are chiefly to blame for not only not protesting against but most contentedly acquiescing in such a state of things  you ask now for something really demanding a sacrifice  i cant afford it  what not to rescue that village from starvation not to enable that good man to preach the gospel to people only accessible by means of such an outlay on his vessel c give up your carriage your opera box dont have so many grand balls c  oh no it is all a corban to the genius of society  now is this scriptural or not my dear father  i dont mean that any individual is justified in dictating to his neighbour still less in condemning him  but are not these the general principles of religion and morality in the bible  there are duties to society but a good man will take serious counsel as to what they are and how far they may be militating against higher and holier claims  august 24why i wrote all this my dearest father i hardly know only i feel sure that unless men at home can by taking real pains to think about it realise the peculiar circumstances of colonial life they will never understand any one of us  i have written fan a note in which i said something about my few effects if i should die  one thing i should like to say to you not as venturing to do more than let you be in full possession of my own mind on the matter should i die before you die would it be wrong for me to say make the melanesian mission my heir  it may be according to the view which generally obtains that the other three should then divide my share  but now i would take what may seem the hard view of which i have been writing and say they have enough to maintain them happily and comfortably  the mission work without such a bequest will be much endangered  i feel sure that they would wish it to be so for of course you know that this large sum of which you write will be if i survive you regarded simply as a bequest to the mission in which i have a life interest and the interest of which in the main would be spent on the mission  but i only say plainly without any reserve what i have thought about it not for one moment putting up my opinion against yours of course in case you take a contrary view  we sail i hope tomorrow but the bishop is more busy than ever  again my dearest father  your loving and dutiful son  j c patteson   the history of this voyage was as usual given in a long letter for the feniton fireside but there was a parallel journal also kept for the bishop of wellington which is more condensed and therefore better for quotation  the manner in which the interest in and connection with all english friends and relations was kept up is difficult to convey though it was a very loveable part of the character  little comments of condolence or congratulation and messages of loving remembrance to persons mentioned by playful names would only be troublesome to the reader but it must be taken for granted that every reply to a home packet was full of these evidences that the black children on a thousand isles had by no means driven the cousins and friends of youth from a heart that was enlarged to have tenderness for all   lat 9° 29 s long 163° se  southern cross october 9 1859  my dear bishopwe are on our way from uleawa to the santa cruz group having visited the loyalty islands southern new hebrides banks island 2 and solomon islands  the bishop so planned the voyage as to run down the wind quickly to the solomon islands and do the real work coming home not as usual beating up in the open water between the santa cruz archipelago banks islands and new hebrides to the east and new caledonia to the west  we are thus able to visit vanua lava on the way out and home also and as we meant to make the banks islands the great point this voyage that was of course great gain  we touched at norfolk island going on to nengone we found everybody away at the distant yam grounds and could not wait to see them  at lifu the first thing that shocked us was johns appearance one of those fatal glandular swellings has already produced a great change in him  he looked sallow and weak and i fear ut sit vitalis he spoke to me very calmly about his illness which he thinks is unto death and i did not contradict him  we had much private talk together  he is a fine fellow and i believe a sincere christian man  then came the applications to us not to desert them and letters enumerating all the villages of lifu almost without exception and entreating us to suffer them to be connected with us and we had to answer that already two missionaries from the l m s are on their way from sydney to lifu and that it would do harm to have two rival systems on the island  they acquiesced but not heartily and it was a sad affair altogether all parties unhappy and dissatisfied and yet unable to solve the difficulty  then came a talk with angadhohua johns halfbrother the real chief  the poor lad feels now what a terrible thing it will be for him and his people if they should lose john  nothing can be nicer than his way of talking i know you dont think me firm enough and that i am easily led by others  what am i to do if john dies  we all respect him  he has been taught so much and people all listen to him i gave him the best advice that i could and longed to be able to do something for him and his people  it was however a comfort to leave with them st mark scripture books c  we called at tanna to see poor mr paton who lost his wife last april  he is living on there quite alone and has already lived down the first angry opposition of some of the people and the unkind treatment that he received from men and women alike who mocked him because of his wifes death c  he has had much fever and looked very ill but his heart was in his work and the bishop said he seemed to be one of the weak things which god hath chosen  i know he made me feel pretty well ashamed of myself  next day we spent a few hours with mr and mrs gordon at erromango he has a small house on the high tableland overlooking dillons bay and certainly is exposed to winds which may for aught i know rival those of wellington notoriety  the situation is however far preferable in the summer to that on the beach which is seldom free from malaria and ague  then we sailed to the great bay of pango landed at fate a fellow who had come to the bishop in new zealand for a passage and in the afternoon sailed away through the pool the landlocked space between mallicolo and espiritu santo to the west aspee ambrym whitsuntide aurora to the east where for eighty miles the water is always smooth the wind always steady the scenery always lovely and where on this occasion the volcano was bright  being nearly becalmed to the southeast of lepers isle the bishop gave me the choice of a visit to whitsuntide or lepers island  i voted for the latter and delighted we were to renew an acquaintance made two years ago and not since kept up with these specially nice people  we were recognised at once but we have a very small vocabulary  the sea was running heavily into the bay but it is sand there and not much rock on the beach and we had a jolly swim ashore  then we bought a few yams which the surf did not permit us to get to the boat and had a very pleasant visit for as we sat among them words came into ones head or were caught from their mouth and at the end of twenty minutes we were getting on a little  the old chief took me by the hand and led me aside to the spot where the ladies were assembled and divining no doubt that i was a bachelor politely offered me his daughter and his protection c if i would live among them  i missed seeing the bishop knocked clean over by the breakers as he was swimming off to the boat i was still talking to the people with my back to the sea and only saw him staggering to his feet again thinking to myself that if he was knocked over i had better look out i awaited a smooth and swam out comfortably  the next morning sunday at ten we dropped anchor in port patteson the harbour which you know the bishop would call after my father  the first person who came off to us was sarawia my old lifu pupil from this island  then came a good many men  i told them there would be no going ashore and no trading till the next day palemana your friend matawathki c were at church all dressed and wellbehaved  what nice orderly people they are to be sure  the next day we bought lots of yams and gave away seeds and fruit trees or rather planted them and looked for a place for a station and fixed at last on the risingground which forms the east side of the harbour and the bishop arming himself with an axe led a party to clear the bush which was very thick  they made a fair path through in one afternoon to the top and a healthy place might be found now with little trouble to return to at night from the schools c in the village below and so shirk the malaria  but the next day as i had anticipated rather changed his intentions as to the principal station being formed at vanua lava we landed at sugar loaf island and with something of pride i showed off to him the beauties of the villages where i slept in may last the dry soil the spring of water the wondrous fertility the large and remarkably intelligent welllooking population the great banyan tree twentyseven paces roundand at once he said this is such a place as i have seen nowhere else for our purpose  the bishop had seen this island before i was with him during one of the border maids voyages and knew the people of course but had not happened to have walked in shore at all and so the exceeding beauty and fitness of the island for a mission station had not become so apparent to him  we know of no place where there seems to be such an unusual combination of everything that can be desired humanly speaking for such an institution  so that is settled dv that next winter i should be here if alive and well and that the banks islands should be regarded as the central point of the mission  such boys  brighteyed merry fellows many really handsome of that reddish yellow tinge of colour which betokens affinity with polynesian races as their language also testifies  the majority of the people were pleasing in their appearance and manner  well all this was very hopeful and we went off very happy taking eumau the boy who first met us at port patteson when we found it out and old wompas who was with me at lifu and another from mota to see the northern islands  i think our work is more likely now to revolve upon a fixed centre sugar loaf island in the banks groupthat we shall make the occupation of the group the first ohject and do all with reference to that as the necessary part of the work to be attended to first in the choice of scholars eg we have considered whether we should not limit our selection to such as might pass the next winter with me at sugar loaf island and so that the vessel need not run down to leeward of it  solomon islands are the extreme verge  in the east island where there would be merely a question of nothing or something we may take very young men who would perhaps not be easy to keep out of harm at sugar loaf because there will be no difficulty about returning them to their homes  november 11thwe found in the santa cruz group that the news of captain fronts and his two mens death in vanikoro and as we suppose the news of the cordelia having been at that island to inquire into the matter had made the people anxious uneasy noisy and rather rude  that poor man went to make a station at vanikoro in the usual way taking three poor new caledonian women with him  the vanikoro people killed the three english and took away the women  we did not land at sta cruz but we had a more pleasant intercourse than heretofore with thirty or forty canoes crews  timelin island we ascertained to be identical with nukapu an old familiar place whose latitude we had not ascertained correctly before  the small reef polynesian islands did not give us so good a reception as last year though there was no unfriendliness  the news about vanikoro had made them suspicious of visits from white men  but they will be all right by next time  we saw a pleasant party at bligh island brought away one young man from that island and two lads belonging to a neighbouring small island called eowa  the next day we watered on the north side of vanua lava and in the evening went across to santa maria  here we landed on the next day among two hundred or more people shy and noisy  we bought a few yams and i detected some young fellows stealing from our little heap i would not overlook this but the noticing it made them more suspicious that we meant to hurt them as the bishop and i after some twenty minutes turned to rejoin the boat the whole crowd bolted like a shot right and left into the bush  evidently they must have had some trading crew tire a parting shot in mere wantonness at them from their boat  i expected some arrows to be shot at us but they did not shoot any  the same evening saturday we stood across the passage with a brisk breeze and took up our party consisting of five and including sarawia and four others anciently noted as promising in appearance  we reached mota sugar loaf island in time to leave me for a nights visit to the people  i had time before the boat called next day at noon to see five or six of their villages  people quite accustomed to expect meall most friendly apparently pleased to be told that i would stop with them in the winter  seven scholars joined us here  at mai i slept in the house of petere and laure  things are promising  it is quite ready for a missionary  we brought away moto pepeu and the two young boys who were with me at lifu and very many wished to come  thence we had a very long passage to lifu  john cho is i am thankful to say very much better  the two men from the london missionary society are on the island the lifu people tell me that in the north of the island many are accepting the teaching of the two french priests  william martin tahia and chakham a principal chief and old scholar are with us  at nengone wadrokala george simeona and harper malo have come away for good we number thirtynine melanesians this is a long letter which will try your patience  always my dear bishop  affectionately yours  j c patteson   another long letter was written during this voyage to mr edward coleridge a great portion of it on the expediency of the islands being taken under british protection also much respecting the church of new zealand which is scarcely relevant to the immediate subject and only at the end is there anything more personal  the last accounts of my father were unusually good but i well know what news may be awaiting our return from a voyage whether long or short and i try to be ready for any news yet i suppose that i cannot at all realize what it would be  it makes some difference when the idea of meeting again in this world has been relinquished for now four and a half years yet it is all very well to wait or think about it  i was not so upset by dear uncle jamess death as i should no doubt have been had i enjoyed the prospect of frequently seeing him  somehow when all ideas of time and space are annihilated by death one must think about such separations in a religious way for separations in any other sense to us here from people in england have already taken place  i must except however the loving wise letters and the power of realising more clearly perhaps the occupations of those still in the bodytheir accustomed places and duties though i suppose we can tell quite enough about all this in the case of those who have died in the true faith of christ to know at all events that we are brought and united to them whenever we think or do anything religiously  i often think that this is well brought out in the heir of redclyffethe loss of the bright outside the life and energy and vigour and all the companionable and sociable qualities contrasted with the power of thinking oneself into the inner spiritual relations that exist between the worlds visible and invisible  all this effort is much diminished in our case  there is no very great present loss at least it is not so sensibly felt by a great deal as it would be if we missed some one with whom we lived up to the time of his death  it is much easier to think of them as they are than it could be in the case of persons who remember so vividly what they so lately were and this is why i suppose the news of uncle jamess death seemed to affect me so much less than i should have expected and it may be so again certain it is that i loved him dearly and that i miss his letters very much indeed but i think that the point i felt most about him was the sad affliction to his family and the great loss to my dear father who had of late seen more than ever of him  from the home letter i only quote from the reflections so regularly inspired by the anniversary of the 28th of november  after lamenting that it was difficult to realise those scenes in his mothers illness which he and his brother only knew from narration patteson adds  the memory of those days would perhaps have been more precious to me if i had witnessed more with my own eyes  and yet of course it really mattered nothing at all because the lesson of her life does not depend on an acquaintance with a few days of it and what i saw when i was there i never have forgotten and hope that i never may forget  and indeed i feel now with regard to you my dear father that i have not learned to know you better while i was with you than i do now  i think that in some ways i enter more almost into your mind and thought or that i fancy i do so just as the present possession of anything so often prevents our really taking pains to learn all about it  we rest content with the superficial knowledge of that which is most easily perceived and recognised in it  i think i know from your letters and from the fact of my absence from you making me think more about you as much about you as those present  i very much enjoy a letter from joan which gives me a kind of tableau vivant of you all  that helps me to realize the home life so do the photographs they help in the same way  but your letters and the fact that i think so much about them and about you are my real helps  the voyage ended on the 7th of december  it was the last made under the guidance of the bishop of new zealand and alas the last return of the first southern cross     chapter ix  mota and st andrews college kohimarama 18591862    with the year 1860 a new period and one far more responsible and eventful began  after working for four years under bishop selwyns superintendence coleridge patteson was gradually passing into a sphere of more independent action and though his loyal allegiance to his primate was even more of the heart than of the letter his time of training was over he was left to act more on his own judgment and things were ripening for his becoming himself a bishop he had nearly completed his thirtythird year and was in his fullest strength mental and bodily and as has been seen the idea had already through bishop selwyns letters become familiar to his family though he himself had shrunk from entertaining it  the first great change regarded the locality of the melanesian school in new zealand  repeated experience had shown that st johns college was too bleak for creatures used to basking under a vertical sun and it had been decided to remove to the sheltered landingplace at kohimarama where buildings for the purpose had been commenced so as to be habitable in time for the freight of 1859  it should be explained that the current expenses of the mission had been defrayed by the eton and sydney associations with chance help from persons privately interested together with a grant of £200 and afterwards £300 per annum from the society for the propagation of the gospel  the extra expense of this foundation was opportunely met by a discovery on the part of sir john patteson that his eldest son living upon the merton fellowship had cost him £200 a year less than his younger son and therefore that in his opinion £800 was due to coleridge  moreover the earlier voyages and in especial the characters of siapo and umao had been so suggestive of incidents fabricated in the daisy chain that the proceeds of the book were felt to be the due of the mission and at this time these had grown to such an amount as to make up the sum needful for erecting such buildings as were immediately requisite for the intended college  these are described in the ensuing letter which i give entire because the form of acknowledgment is the only style suitable to what however lightly acquired was meant as an offering even though it cost the giver all too little   kohimarama dec 21 1859  my dear cousini have received at length from my father a distinct statement of what you have given to the melanesian mission  i had heard rumours before and the bishop of wellington had spoken to me of your intentions but the fact had not been regularly notified to us  i think i know you too well to say more than this  may god bless you for what you have lent to him and give us who are specially connected with the mission grace to use your gift as you intend it to be used to his glory in the salvation of souls  but you will like to hear how your gift will be appropriated  for three summers the melanesian scholars lived at st johns college which is situated on a low hill from which the ground falls away on every side leaving it exposed to every wind that blows across and around the narrow isthmus  thank god we had no death traceable to the effect of the climate but we had constant anxiety and a considerable amount of illness when arrangements were completed for the arrival of a new principal to succeed the bishop of wellington the college was no longer likely to be available for the mission school  consequently we determined to build on the site long ago agreed upon to put up some substantial buildings and to remove some of the wooden buildings at the college which would not be required there and set them up again at kohimarama  just opposite the entrance into the auckland harbour between the island of eangitoto with its double peak and the easternmost point of the northern shore of the harbour lies a very sheltered bay with its seafrontage of rather more than a quarter of a mile bounded to the east south and west by low hills which where they meet the sea become sandy cliffs fringed with the redflowerbearing pohutakawa the whole of this bay the seventy acres of flat rich soil included within the rising ground mentioned and some seventy acres more as yet lying uncleared adjoining the same block of seventy acres and likely to be very valuable as the land is capitalthe whole of this was bought by the bishop many years ago as the property of the mission and is the only piece of church land over which he retains the control every other bequest or gift to the amount of 14000 acres having been handed over by him to the general synod  this he retains till the state of the melanesian mission is more definitely settled  on the west corner of this bay we determined to build  a small tide creek runs for a short way about sse from the extreme end of the western part of the beach then turns early eastward and meets a small stream coming down from the southern hill at its western extremity  this creek encloses a space extending along the whole width of the bay of about eighteen or twenty acres  at the east end stand three wooden cottages occupied by the master mate and a married seaman of the southern cross  at the west end stands the melanesian school  fences divide the whole space into three portions whereof the western one forms our garden and orchard and the others pasture for cows and working bullocks small gardens being also fenced off for the three cottages  the fifty acres of flat land south of the creek we are now clearing and ploughing  the situation here is admirably adapted for our school  now that we have a solid wall of the scoria from the volcanic island opposite we have a complete shelter from the cold south wind  the cliff and hill to the west entirely shut off the wind from that quarter and the north and east winds are always warm  the soil is very dry and the beach composed exclusively of small pipi shellssmall bivalves so that by putting many cartloads of these under our wooden floors and around our buildings we have so perfect a drainage that after heavy rain the soil is quite dry again in a few hours  it causes me no anxiety now when i am for an hour away from my flock to be thinking whether they are lying on the ground forgetting that the hot sun overhead does not destroy the bad effect of a damp clay soil such as that at st johns college  the buildings at present form three sides of a quadrangle but the south side is only partly filled up  the large schoolroom eighty feet long with three sets of transepts has been removed from the college and put up again so as to form the east side of the quadrangle  this is of wood so is the small wooden quadrangle which serves now for dormitories and a part of which i occupy my house consisting of three little rooms together measuring seventeen feet by seven  these dormitories are the southern side of the quadrangle but do not reach more than halfway from the east to the west side room being left for another set of dormitories of equal size when we want them and can afford them  the west side consists of a very nice set of stone buildings including a large kitchen store room and room for putting things in daily and immediate use and the hall which is the northern part of the side of the quadrangle is a really handsome room with simple open roof and windows of a familiar collegiate appearance  these buildings are of the dark grey scoria almost imperishable i suppose and look very well  the hall is just long enough to take seven of us at the high table so to speak and thirtyfour at the long table stretching from the high table to the end of the room  at present this is used for school also as the carpenters who are making all our fittings shelves c are still in the large schoolroom  we take off the north end of the schoolroom including one set of transepts for our temporary chapel  this part will be lined ie  boarded neatly inside  the rest of the building is very rough but it answers its purpose  in all the stone buildings the rough stone is left inside just as it is outside  it does not look bad at all to my eye and i doubt if i would have it lined if we had funds to pay for it  i hope eventually that stone buildings will take the place of the present wooden schoolroom and dormitories but this ought to last many years  here we live most happily and comfortably  the climate almost tropical in summer  the beautiful scenery of the harbour before our eyes the smooth sea and clean dry beach within a stones throw of my window  the lads and young men have their fishing bathing boating and basking in the sun which all day from sunrise to sunset beats right upon us for the west cliff does not project more than a few yards to the north of us and the eastern boundary is low and some way off  i see the little schooner at her moorings whenever i look off my book or my paper and with an operaglass can see the captain caulking the decks  all is under my eye and the lads daily say college too cold kohimarama very good all the same bauro mota as the speaker belongs to one or other of our fourteen islands represented the moment we heard of your gift we said simultaneously let it be given to this or to some specific and definite object  i think you will like to feel not only that the money came most opportunely but that within the walls built with that money many many hundreds i trust of these melanesian islanders will be fed and taught and trained up in the knowledge and fear of god  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   before the old year was out came the tidings of the death of good miss neill the governess whom patteson had so faithfully loved from early childhood and whose years of suffering he had done his best to cheer  at rest at last  in the same letter in answer to some complaint from his sister of want of detail in the reports he says am i trying to make my life commonplace  well really so it is more or less to me  things go on in a kind of routine  two voyages a year five months in new zealand though certainly twothirds of my flock fresh every year  i suppose it still sounds strange to you sometimes and to others always but they should try to think for themselves about our circumstances  and you know fan i cant write for the world at large anecdotes of missionary life and swell the number of the gems and other trashy books  if people who care to know would think of what their own intuition tells them of human nature and history tells them of heathenism they can make out some notion of real missionary work  the school is the real work  teaching adults to read a strange tongue is hard work i have little doubt but that the bishop is right in saying they must be taught english but it is so very difficult a language not spelt a bit as pronounced and their language is all vocalic and so easy to put into writing  but if you like i will scatter anecdotes aboutof how the bishop and his chaplain took headers hand in hand off the schooner and roundhouse and how the bishop got knocked over at lepers island by a big wave and how i borrowed a canoe at tariko and paddled out yams as fast as the bishop brought them to our boat cbut this is rubbish  this letter is an instance of the reserve and reticence which mr patteson felt so strongly with regard to his adventures and pupils he could not endure stories of them to become as it were stock for exciting interest at home  there was something in his nature that shrank from publishing accounts of individual pupils as a breach of confidence as much or perhaps even more than if they had been english people likely to know what had been done  moreover instances had come to his knowledge in which harm had been done to both teachers and taught by their becoming aware that they were shown off to the public in print  such things had happened even where they would have seemed not only unlikely but impossible and this rendered him particularly cautious in writing of his work so that his reports were often dry while he insisted strongly on his letters to his family being kept private  the actual undertakings of the mission did not exceed its resources so that there was no need for those urgent appeals which call for sensation and incident to back them and thus there sometimes seemed to the exterior world to be a lack of information about the mission  the letters of january 1860 show how the lads were fortified against weather they wear a long flannel waistcoat then a kind of jersey shaped thing with short trousers reaching a little below the knee for they dabble about like ducks here the sea being not a hundred yards from the building  all the washing of course and most of the clothesmaking they can do themselves i can cut out after a fashion and they take quickly to needle and thread but now the auckland ladies have provided divers very nice garments their sunday dresses are very nice indeed  the question of the bishopric began to come forward  on the 18th of january a letter to sir john patteson after speaking of a playful allusion which introduced the subject details how mrs selwyn had disclosed that a letter had actually been despatched to the duke of newcastle then colonial secretary asking permission to appoint and consecrate john coleridge patteson as missionary bishop of the western pacific isles  jcpwell then i must say what i feel about it  i have known for some time that this was not unlikely to come some day but i never spoke seriously to you or to the martins when you insinuated these things because i thought if i took it up gravely it would come to be considered a settled thing  mrs swell so it has been and is  jcpbut has the bishop seriously thought of this that he has had no trial of any other man that i could give any other man who may come perhaps the full benefit of my knowledge of languages and of my acquaintance with the islands and the people while we may reasonably expect some one to come out before long far better fitted to organise and lead men than i am  has he fairly looked at all the per contra  mrs si feel sure he has  jc pi dont deny that my father tells me i must not shrink from it that some things seem to point to it as natural that i must not venture to think that i can be as complete a judge as the bishop of what is good for melanesiabut what necessity for acting now  here came an interruption but the conversation was renewed later in the day with the bishop himself when patteson pleaded for delay on the score that the isles were as yet in a state in which a missionary chaplain could do all that was requisite and that the real management ought not to be withdrawn from the bishop to which the reply was that at the present time the bishop could do much to secure such an appointment as he wished but in case of his death even wishes expressed in writing might be disregarded  after this the outpouring to the father continues  i dont mean to shrink from this  you tell me that i ought not to do so and i quite believe it  i know that no one can judge better than you can as to the general question and the bishop is as competent to decide on the special requirements of the case  but my dear father you can hardly tell how difficult i find it to be amidst all the multiplicity of works a man of devotional prayerful habits how i find from time to time that i wake up to the fact that while i am doing more than i did in old times yet that i pray less  how often i think that god gives habitually to the bishop all that sail with him that the work is prospering in his hands but will it prosper in mine  i know he can use any instrument to his glory i know that and that he will not let my sins and shortcomings hinder his projects of love and blessing to these melanesian islanders but as far as purity of motive and a spirit of prayer and selfdenial do go for anything in making up the qualification on the human side for such an officein so far do they exist in me  you will say i am over sensitive and expect too much  that i think very likely may be true  it is useless to wait till one becomes really fit for that of course i never shall be but while i believe most entirely that grace does now supply all our deficiencies when we seek it fully i do feel frightened when i see that i do not become more prayerful more real in communion with god this is what i must pray for earnestly to become more prayerful more constantly impressed with the necessity of seeking for everything from him  you all think that absence from relations living upon yams want of the same kind of meat and drink that i had at home that these things are proofs of sincerity c  i believe that they all mean just nothing when the practical result does not come to thisthat a man is walking more closely with his god  i dare not say that i can feel humbly and reverently that my inner life is progressing  i dont think that i am as earnest in prayer as i was  whether it be the effect of the amount of work distracting me or sometimes of physical weariness or of the selfindulgence laugh as you may which results from my never being contradicted or interfered with or much worried still i do feel this and may he strengthen me to pray more for a spirit of prayer  i dont know that the actual time for my being consecrated if i live is nearer by reason of this letter i think it most probable that it may take place when the general synod meets and consequently five bishops will be present in 1862 at nelson  but i suppose it is more fixed than it has been hitherto and if the bishop writes to you as he may do even more plainly than he speaks to me you will know what especially to ask for me from god and all you dear ones will recollect daily how i do inwardly tremble at the thoughts of what is to come  do you remember how strangely i was upset before leaving home for my ordination as a deacon and now it is coming to thisa church to be planted organised edified among the wild heathen inhabitants of melanesia and what hope can there be for me if there is to be no growth of a fervent thankful humble spirit of prayer and love and adoration  not that as i feel to my great comfort gods work is dependent upon the individual growth in grace even of those who are entrusted with any given work but it is in some way connected with it  and yet the upshot of it all is that i shall do dv what the bishop tells me is right  i hope he wont press on the matter but i am content now to leave it with him knowing what you have said and being so thankful to leave it with you and him  there is a letter to his sister fanny of the same date beginning merrily about the family expostulation on receiving a box of reports where curiosities had been expected  fancy not thinking your worthy brothers important publications the most satisfactory treasures that any box could contain  the authors feelings are seriously injured  what are melanesian shells to melanesian statistics and lifu spears to a dissertation on the treatment of lifu diseases  great is the ingratitude of the houses of feniton and dawlish  well it must have been rather a sell as at eton it is called to have seen the longdesired and highlypaidfor box disgorge nought but melanesian reports all thanks to mrs martin who packed it after i was off to the islands  i cannot send you anything yet but i will bear in mind the fact that reports by themselves are not considered satisfactory  does anybody read them after all for they really cost me some days trouble which i cant find time for again  this years report for i suppose there must be one is not begun and i dont know what to put in it  i have but little news beyond what i have written once for all to father  the decisive letter from the bishop of new zealand to the duke of newcastle is in the governors hands and all discussion of the question is at an end  may god bring out of it all that may conduce to his glory but how i dread what is to come you who remember my leaving home first for my deacons ordination can well imagine  it is true i have seen this coming for a year or two and have seen no way of preventing its coming upon meno one else has come out the bishop feels he cannot work his present diocese and melanesia he is satisfied that he ought to take new zealand rather than the islands that the time is come for settling the matter while he is able to settle it and i had nothing to say for all personal objections he overruled  so then if i live it is settled and that at all events is a comfort many of my melanesians have heavy coughssome twelve but i dont think any of them seriously ill only needing to be watched  i am very well only i want some more exercise which by the bye it is always in my power to take and am quite as much disposed as ever to wish for a good game at tennis or fives to take it out of me  your loving brother  j c patteson   the birthday letter of february 11 is a happy one though chiefly taken up with the business matters respecting the money required for the mission of which sir john was one trustee  life was pleasant then for patteson says  i do feel sometimes that the living alone has its temptations and those great ones i mean that i can arrange everythingmy work my hours my whole lifeafter my own pleasure a great deal more than probably is good for me and it is very easy to become in a manner very selfindulgent  i think that most likely as our work dv progresses one or two men may be living with me and that will supply a check upon me of some kind  at present i am too much without it  here i am in my cosy little room after my delicious breakfast of perfect coffee made in jems contrivance hot milk and plenty of it dry toast and potato  missionary hardships on the grass between me and the beacha distance of some seventy yardslie the boys canvas beds and blankets and rugs having a good airing the schooner lies at anchor beyond and three or four miles beyond the schooner lies eangitoto the great natural breakwater to the harbour  with my dollonds operaglass that you gave me i can see the master and mate at their work refitting  everything is under my eye  our long boat and whale boat socalled from their shapes lie on the beach covered with old sails to protect them from the sun the lads are washing clothes or scrubbing their rooms and all the roomskitchen hall storeroom and schoolroom  there is a good southwestern breeze stirringour cold wind but it is shut off here and scarcely reaches us and the sun has great power  i have the jolliest little fellows this timeabout seven of them fellows scarcely too big to take on my knee and talk to about god and heaven and jesus christ and i feel almost as if i had a kind of instinct of love towards them as they look up wonderingly with their deep deep eyes and smooth and glossy skins and warm soft cheeks and ask their simple questions  i wish you could have seen the twenty banks islanders as i told them that most excellent of all talesthe story of joseph  how their eyes glistened and they pushed out their heads to hear the sequel of his making himself known to his brethren and asking once more about the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive  i can never read it with a steady voice nor tell it either  sir john had thus replied to the tirade against english conventional luxury  the conventional notions in this old country are not always suited to your country and i quite agree that even here they are carried too far  yet there are other people than the needy whose souls are entrusted to the clergy here and in order to fulfil that trust they must mix on some degree of equality with the gentry and with the middle classes who are welltodo  then again consider both as to clergy and laity here  if they were all to lower themselves a peg or two and give up many not only luxuries but comforts numbers of tradesmen and others working under them aye even merchants manufacturers and commercial men of all sorts would be to some extent thrown out of employ  the artificial and even luxurious state of society here does really prevent many persons from falling into the class of the needy  all this should be regulated in its due proportion  every man ought so to limit his expenses as to have a good margin for charitable purposes of all sorts but i cannot think that he is doing good by living himself like a pauper in order to assist paupers  if all men did so labour of all kinds would be overstocked with hands and more paupers created  true it is that we all are too apt as means increase some to set our hearts upon them which is wickedness some to indulge in over much luxury which is wicked also there should be moderation in all things  i believe that more money is given in private charities of various kinds in helping those who are struggling with small means and yet not apparently in the class of the needy than the world is aware of and those who do the most are precisely those who are never heard of but do not mistake me  i am no advocate for luxury and idle expenditure  yet i think you carry your argument a little farther than is just  the impositions that are practised or attempted to be practised upon charitable people are beyond all conception  the following is the answer   april 23 1860  my dearest fatherthank you for writing your views about luxuries extravagant expenditure and the like  i see at once the truth of what you say  what i really mean is something of this kind  a high degree of civilisation seems to generate perhaps necessarily a state of society wherein the natural desires of people to gratify their inclinations in all directions conjoined with the power of paying highly for the gratification of such inclinations tends to call forth the ingenuity of the working class in meeting such inclinations in all agreeable ways  so springs up a complicated mechanism by which a habit of life altogether unnecessary for health and security of life and property is introduced and becomes naturalised among a people  if this is the necessary consequence of the distinction between rich and poor and the course of civilisation must result in luxury and poverty among the two classes respectively and this seems to be so it is of course still more evident that the state of society being once established gradually through a long course of years no change can subsequently be introduced excepting in one way  it is still in the power of individuals to act upon the community by their example eg the early christians though only for a short time showed the result of the practical acceptance of the lords teaching in its effect upon society  rich and poor comparatively speaking met each other half way  the rich man sold his possessions and equal distribution was made to the poor  all that i contend for is that seeing the fearful deterioration and no less fearful extravagance of a civilised country the evil is one which calls loudly for careful investigation  thousands of artisans and labourers who contribute nothing to the substantial wealth of the country and nothing towards the production of its means of subsistence would be thrown out of employment and therefore that plan would be wrong  jewellers c c all kinds of fellows who simply manufacture vanities are just as honest and good men as others and it is not their fault but the fault if it be one at all of civilisation that they exist  but i dont see why the evil being recognised some comprehensive scheme of colonisation might not be adopted by the rulers of a christian land to empty our poorhouses and draft off the surplus population giving to the utterly destitute the prospect of health and renewed hopes of success in another thinlyinhabited country and securing for those who remain behind a more liberal remuneration for their work by the comparative absence of competition  i hardly know what to write to you my dear father about this new symptom of illness  i suppose from what you say that at your time of life the disease being so mild in its form now will hardly prove dangerous to you especially as you submit at once to a strictness of diet which must be pretty hard to follow outjust the habit of a whole life to be given up and i know that to forego anything that i like in matters of eating and drinking wants an effort that i feel ashamed of being obliged to make  i dont therefore make myself unnecessarily anxious though i cant help feeling that such a discipline must be hard  you say that in other respects you are much the same but that means that you are in almost constant pain and that you cannot obtain entire relief from it except in bed  still my dear father as you do bear it all how can we wish that god should spare you one trial or infirmity which we know are in his providence making you daily riper and riper for heaven  i ought not to write to you like this but somehow the idea of our ever meeting anywhere else has so entirely passed from my mind that i try to view things with reference to his ultimate purpose and work  your loving and dutiful son  j c patteson   the most present trouble of this summer was the sickness of simeona the account of him on ash wednesday is he is dying of consumption slowly and may go back with us two months hence but i doubt it poor fellow he makes the worst of his case and is often discontented and thinks himself aggrieved because we cannot derange the whole plan of the school economy for him  i have everything which is good for him every little dainty and everyone is most kind but when it comes to a complaint because one pupilteacher is not set apart to sit with him all day and another to catch him fish of course i tell him that it would be wrong to grant what is so unreasonable  some one or other of the most stupid of the boys catches his fish just as well as a pupilteacher and he is quite able to sit up and read for two or three hours a day and would only be injured by having another lad in the room on purpose to be the receptacle of all his moans and complaints yet i know poor fellow it is much owing to the disease upon him  in spite of his fretfulness and exactions the young man meeting not with spoiling but with true kindness responded to the touch  lady martin tells us i shall never forget dear mr pattesons thankfulness when after a long season of reserve he opened his heart to him and told him how step by step this sinfulness of sin had been brought home to him  he knew he had done wrong in his heathen boyhood but had put away such deeds when he was baptized and had almost forgotten the past or looked on it as part of heathenism  but in his illness tended daily and hourly by our dear friend his conscience had become very tender  he died in great peace  his death is mentioned in the following letter to sir john coleridge   march 26 1860  this day 5 years i left home  it was a black monday indeed  my dear uncleat three this morning died one of my old scholars by name george selwyn simeona from nengone  he was here for his third time for two years a regular communicant having received a good deal of teaching before i knew him  he was baptized three years ago  i did not wish to bring him this time for it was evident that he could not live long when we met last at nengone and i told him that he had better not come with us but he said heaven was no farther from new zealand than from nengone and when we had pulled some little way from shore he ran down the beach and made us return to take him in  gradual decline and chronic bronchitis wore him to a skeleton  on thursday the bishop and i administered the holy eucharist to him and he died at 3 am today with his hand in mine as i was in the act of commending his soul to god  his wife a sweet good girl one of mrs selwyns pupils from nengone in old times died last year  they leave one boy of three years whom i hope to get hold of entirely and as it were adopt him  the clear bright moon was right over my head as after a while and after prayer with his friends i left his room the quiet splash of the tiny waves on our sheltered shore and the little schooner at her anchorage and i thanked god that one more spirit from among the melanesian islanders was gone to dwell we trust with jesus christ in paradise  he will not be much missed in the melanesian school work for for months he could not make one of us  i find trenchs notes on the authorised version of the new testament very useful chiefly as helping one to acquire a habit of accurate criticism for oneself and when we come dv to translate any portion of the scriptures of course such books are very valuable  last mail brought me but a very few letters  the account of my dear fathers being obliged to submit to discipline did not alarm me though i know the nature of the disease and that his father died of it  it seems in his case likely to be kept under but as i have said before i cannot feel uneasy and anxious about him be the accounts what they may  it is partly selfish for i am spared the sight of his suffering but then i do long for a look at his dear face and for the sound of his voice  five years of absence has of course made so much change in my mind in this respect that i do not now find myself dreaming of home constantly thinking of it the first freshness of my loss is not felt now  but i think i love them all and you all better than ever and i trust that i am looking inward on the whole to the blessedness of our meeting hereafter  but this work has its peculiar dangers  a man may become so familiarised with the habits of the heathen that insensibly his conscience becomes less sensitive  there is a danger in living in the midst of utter lawlessness and violence and though the blessings and privileges far excel the disadvantages yet it is not in every way calculated to help one forward as i think i have in some ways found by experience  well this is all dull and dry  but our life is somewhat monotonous on shore varied only by the details of incidents occurring in school and witnessing to the growth of the minds of my flock  they are a very intelligent set this year and there are many hopeful ones among them  we have worked them hard at english and all can read a little and some eight or ten really read nicely but then they do not understand nearly all they read without an explanation just like an english boy beginning his knowledge of letters with latin or french a still spoken language  in about a month we shall dv start to take them back but the vessel will be absent but a short time as i shall keep the solomon islanders with me in the banks archipelago for the winter and so avoid the necessity of the schooner running 200 or 300 miles to leeward and having to make it up again  i have slept ashore twice in the banks islands but no other white man has done so and that makes our course very clear as they have none of the injuries usually committed by traders c to revenge  goodbye once more my dearest uncle  your affectionate and grateful nephew  j c patteson   the calmness of mind respecting his father which is here spoken of was not perpetual and his grief broke out at times in talks with his young friend and companion mr dudley as appears by this extract  i remember his talking to me more than once on the subject of his father and especially his remarking on one occasion that his friends were pressing him to come out there oftener and suggesting when he seemed out of health and spirits that he was not taking care of himself but that it was the anguish he endured as night after night he lay awake thinking of his father gradually sinking and craving for him and cheerfully resigning him that really told upon him  i know that i obtained then a glimpse of an affection and a depth of sorrow such as perfectly awed me and i do not think i have witnessed anything like it at all either before or since  it was then that he seemed to enter into the full meaning of those words of our lord in st mark x 2930 ie into all that the leaving there spoken of involved  yet in spite of this anxiety there was no flinching from the three months residence at mota entirely out of reach of letters  a frame house with planks for the floor was prepared at auckland to be taken out and a stock of wine provisions and medicines laid in the rev b y ashwell a new zealand clergyman joined the mission party as a guest with two maori youths one the son of a deacon and besides mr dudley another pupil mr thomas kerr was beginning his training for service in the mission  sailing on one of the last days of april there was a long passage to nengone where the party went ashore and found everything in trouble the french constantly expected and the chiefs entreating for a missionary from the bishop and no possibility of supplying them  lifu was rendered inaccessible by foul winds  much to my sorrow writes mr  patteson i could not land my two pupilteachers who of course wished to see their friends and who made me more desirous to give them a run on shore by saying at once dont think of us it is not safe to go  but i thought of what my feelings would be if it were the devonshire coast somewhere about sidmouth and no landing  however they as well as the three nengonese wadrokala harper malo and martin tahia went on contentedly  off mai may 19thmr kerr has been busy taking bearings c for the purpose of improving our ms chart and constructing a new one commodore loring wanted me to tell him all about port patteson and asked me if i wished a manofwar to be sent down this winter to see me supposing the new zealand troubles to be all over  i gave him all the information he wanted told him that i did not want a vessel to come with the idea of any protection being required but that a manofwar coming with the intention of supporting the mission and giving help and not coming to treat the natives in an offhand manner might do good  i did not speak coldly but really i fear what mischief even a few wildish fellows might do on shore among such people as those of the banks islands  a foreandaft schooner in sight  probably some trader  may be a schooner which i heard the french had brought for missionary purposes  what if we find a priest or two at port patteson however my course is clear any way work straight on  may 21stschooner a false alarm  we had a very interesting visit on saturday afternoon at mai  we could not land till 4 pm walked at once to the village a mile and a half inland  after some excitement caused by our appearance the people rushing to welcome us we got them to be quiet and to sit down  i stood up and gave them a sermonette then made dudley who speaks good mai say something  then we knelt down and i said the second good friday collect inserted a few petitions which you can imagine anyone would do at such a time then a simple prayer in their language the lords prayer in english and the grace  on friday mota was reached and the people showed great delight when the frame of the house was landed at the site purchased for a number of hatchets and other goods so that it is the absolute property of the mission  saturday was spent in a visit to port patteson where the people thronged while the watercasks were being filled and bamboos cut down with entreaties that the station might be there and the mosquitoes thronged toomr patteson had fiftyeight bites on one foot  on whit sunday after holy communion on board the party went on shore and prayed for i cannot say with the people of vanua lava  and on whit monday the house was set up in a most lovely spot says mr dudley beneath the shade of a gigantic banyan tree the trunk and one long horizontal branch of which formed two sides of as beautiful a picture as you would wish to look upon the sloping bank with its cocoanut breadfruit and other trees forming the base of the picture and the coral beach the deep clear blue tropical ocean with others of the banks islands valua matlavo and uvaparapara in the distance forming the picture itself  at least a hundred natives came to help pulling down materials from their own houses to make the roof and delighted to obtain a bit of iron or still better of broken glass to shave with  in the afternoon the master of the said house using a box for a desk wrote our little house will i think be finished tonight anyhow we can sleep in it if the walls are but half ready they are merely bamboo canes tied together  we sleep on the floor boarded and well raised on poles two feet and more from the groundbeds are superfluous here  here then was the first stake of the churchs tabernacle planted in all melanesia  the boards of the floor had been brought from new zealand the heavy posts on which the plates were laid were cut in vanua lava and the thatch was of cocoanut leaves the leaflets ingeniously bound together native fashion and quite waterproof but a mat or piece of canvas had to be nailed within the bamboo walls to keep out the rain  on wednesday a short service was held the first ever known in mota and then mr ashwell and mr kerr embarked leaving mr patteson and mr dudley with their twelve pupils in possession  mr dudley had skill to turn their resources to advantage  space was gained below by making a frame to which knapsacks bags c could be hung up and the floor was only occupied by the four boxes which did the further part of tables desks and chairs in turn  as to beds was not the whole floor before them and observes the journal now i see the advantage of having brought planks from new zealand to make a floor  we all had something level to lie on at night and when you are tired enough a good smooth plank or a box does just as well as a mattress  fresh water was half a mile off and had to be fetched in bamboos but this was a great improvement upon lifu where there was none at all and a store of it was always kept in four twentygallon casks three on the beach and one close to the house  the place was regularly purchased  june 8thi have just bought for the mission this small clearing of half an acre and the two acres say leading to the sea with twenty or more breadfruits on it  there was a long talk with the people and some difficulty in finding out the real proprietors but i think we arranged matters really well at last  you would have been amused at the solemnity with which i conducted the proceeding making a great show of writing down their names and bringing each one of the owners up in their turn to see his name put down and making him touch my pen as i put a cross against his name  having spent about an hour in enquiring whether any other person had any claim on the land or trees i then said now this all belongs to me and they assented  i entered it in my bookson behalf of the melanesian mission but they could only understand that the land belonged to the bishop and me because we wanted a place where some people might live who should be placed by the bishop to teach them  of course the proceeding has no real validity but i think they will observe the contract not quite the same thing as the transfer of land in the old country  here about 120 men quite naked represented the interests of the late owners and dudley and i represented the mission  the days were thus laid outmorning school in the village first with the regular scholars then with any one who liked to come in and then when the weather permitted a visit to some village sometimes walking all round a circuit of ten miles but generally each of the two taking a separate village talking to the people teaching them from cards and encouraging interrogatories  mr patteson always had such an attraction for them that they would throng round him eagerly wherever he went  the mota people had a certain faith of their own they believed in a supreme god called ikpat who had many brothers one of whom was something like loki in the northern mythology always tricking him ikpat had disappeared in a ship taking the best of everything with him  it was also believed that the spirits of the dead survived and ranged about at night maddening all who chanced to meet them and like many other darkly coloured people the motans had begun by supposing their white visitors to be the ghosts of their deceased friends come to revisit them  there were a good many other superstitions besides and a ceremony connected with one of them was going on the second week of the residence at motaapparently a sort of freemasonry into which all boys of a certain age were to be initiated  the journal says  there is some strange superstitious ceremony going on at this village  a space had been enclosed by a high hedge and some eighteen or nineteen youths are spending a month or more inside the fence in a house where they lie wrapped up in mats abundantly supplied with food by the people who from time to time assemble to sing or perform divers rites  i had a good deal of trouble with the father of our second years pupil tagalana who insisted upon sending his son thither  i warned him against the consequences of hindering his son who wished to follow christ  he yielded because he was evidently afraid of me but not convinced as i have no right to expect he should be  the next morning comes an old fellow and plants a redflowering branch in our small clearing whereupon our mota boys go away not wishing to go but not daring to stay  no people came near us but byandby comes the man who had planted it with whom i had much talk which ended in his pulling up and throwing away the branch and in the return of our boys  in the evening many people came to whom i spoke very plainly about the necessity of abandoning these customs if they were in earnest in saying they wished to embrace the word of god  on sunday they gave up their singing at the enclosure or only attempted it in a very small way  june 6thi am just returned from a village a mile and a half off called tasmate where one of their religious ceremonies took place this morning  the village contains upwards of twenty houses built at the edge of the bush which consists here almost exclusively of fruitbearing treescocoanut trees bananas breadfruit and large almond trefts are everywhere the most conspicuous  the sea view looking south is very beautiful  i walked thither alone having heard that a feast was to be held there  as i came close to the spot i heard the hum of many voices and the dull booming sound of the native drum which is nothing but a large hollow tree of circular shape struck by wooden mallets some few people ran off as i appeared but many of them had seen me before  the women about thirty in number were sitting on the ground together in front of one of the houses which enclosed an open air circular space in front of another house were many children and young people  in the long narrow house which forms the general cooking and lounging room of the men of each village and the sleeping room of the bachelors were many people preparing large messes of grated yam and cocoanut in flat wooden dishes  at the long oblongshaped drum sat the performers two young men each with two short sticks to perform the kettledrum part of the business and an older man in the centre whose art consisted in bringing out deep hollow tones from his wooden instrument  around them stood some thirty men two of whom i noticed especially decked out with red leaves and feathers in their hair  near this party and close to the long narrow house in the end of which i stood was a newly raised platform of earth supported on stones  on the corner stone were laid six or eight pigs jaws with the large curling tusks left in them  this was a sacred stone  in front of the platform were three poles covered with flowers red leaves c  for about an hour and a half the men at or around the drum kept up an almost incessant shouting screaming and whistling moving their legs and arms in time not with any wild gesticulations but occasionally with some little violence the drum all the time being struck incessantly  about the middle of the ceremony an old tall thin man with a red handkerchief our gift at some time round his waist began ambling round the space in the middle of the houses carrying a boars skull in his hand  this performance he repeated three times  then a man jumped up upon the platform and moving quickly about on it and gesticulating wildly delivered a short speech after which the drum was beat louder than ever then came another speech from the same man and then the rain evidently hastening matters to a conclusion to the whole thing without any ceremony of consecrating the stone as i had expected  in the long room afterwards i had the opportunity of saying quietly what i had said to those about me during the ceremony the same story of the love of god especially manifested in jesus christ to turn men from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god with what power that verse speaks to one while witnessing such an exhibition of ignorance or fear or superstition as i have seen to day  and through it all i was constantly thinking upon the earnestness with which these poor souls follow out a mistaken notion of religion  such rain as fell this morning would have kept a whole english congregation from going to church but they never sought shelter nor desisted from their work in hand and the physical effect was really great the perspiration streamed down their bodies and the learning by heart all the songs and the complicated parts of the ceremony implied a good deal of pains  christians do not always take so much pains to fulfil scrupulously their duties as sometimes these heathens do  and indeed their bondage is a hard one constant suspicion and fear whenever they think at all  everything that is not connected with the animal part of our nature seems to be the prey of dark and gloomy superstitions the spiritual part is altogether inactive as an instrument of comfort joy peace and hope  you can imagine that i prayed earnestly for these poor souls actually performing before me their strange mysteries and that i spoke earnestly and strongly afterwards  the argument with those who would listen was what good comes of all this  what has the spirit you call ikpat ever done for you  has he taught you to clothe yourselves build houses c  does he offer to make you happy  can you tell me what single good thing has come from these customs  but if you ask me what good thing has come to us from the word of god first you had better let me tell you what has happened in england of old in new zealand nengone or lifu then i will tell you what the word of god teachesand these with the great outline of the faith  every village in the island had the platforms poles and flowers and the next day at a turn in the path near a village the mission party suddenly came upon four sticks planted in a row two of them bearing things like oneeyed masks two others like mitres painted red black and white  as far as could be made out they were placed there as a sort of defiance to the inhabitants but mr patteson took down one and declared his intention of buying them for fishhooks to take to new zealand that the people might see their dark and foolish customs  some effect had already been produced the people declared that there had been much less of fighting since the missionaries had spoken to them eighteen months back and they had given up some of the charms by which they used to destroy each other but there was still much carrying of bows and on the way home from this expedition mr patteson suddenly came on six men with bows bent and arrows pointed in his direction  he at once recognised a man from veverao the next village to the station and called out all right  it proved that a report had come of his being attacked or killed on the other side of the island and that they had set out to defend or avenge him  he received his champions with reproofthis is the very thing i told you not to do  it is all your foolish jealousy and suspicion of them  there is not a man on the island who is not friendly to me and if they were not friendly what business have you with your bows and arrows  i tell you once more if i see you take your bows again though you may do it as you think with a good intention towards me i will not stay at your village  if you want to help me receive the word of god abandon your senseless ceremonies  that will be helping me indeed  cannot you live at peace in this little bit of an island was the constant theme of these lectures and when wompas his old scholar appeared with bow and arrows saying i am sent to defend you the answer was dont talk such nonsense  give me the bow  this was done and patteson was putting it across his knee to break it when the youth declared it was not his  if i see these things again you know what will become of them  the mitres and masks were gone but the veverao people were desperately jealous of the next village auta alleging that the inhabitants were unfriendly and by every means trying to keep the guest entirely to themselves while he resolutely forced on their reluctant ears if you are sincere in saying that you wish to know god you must love your brother  god will not dwell in a divided heart nor teach you his truth while you wilfully continue to hate your brother  the st barnabas day on which most of this was written was a notable one for it was marked by the first administration of both the sacraments in mota  in the morning one english and four nengonese communicants knelt round their pastor and in the evening after a walk to auta and much of this preaching of peace and goodwill then a dinner which was made festive with preserved meat and wine there came a message from one ivepapeu a leading man whose child was sick  it was evidently dying and mr patteson in the midst of the people told them that  the son of god had commanded us to teach and baptize all nations that they did not understand the meaning of what he was about to do but that the word of jesus the son of god was plain and that he must obey it that this was not a mere form but a real gift from heaven not for the body but the soul that the child would be as likely to die as before but that its spirit would be taken to god and if it should recover it must be set apart for god not taken to any heathen rites but given to himself to be trained up as a child of god  the parents consented then he continues we knelt and in the middle of the village the naked group around me the dying child in its mothers lap i prayed to god and christ in their language to bless the child according to his own promise to receive it for his own child and to convey to it the fulness of the blessing of his holy sacrament  then while all were silent i poured the water on its head pronouncing the form of words in english and calling the child john the first christian child in the banks islands  then i knelt down again and praised god for his goodness and prayed that the child might live if it were his good pleasure and be educated to his glory and then i prayed for those around me and for the people of the island that god would reveal to them his holy name and word and will and so with a few words to the parents and people left them as darkness settled down on the village and the bright stars came out overhead  the innocent firstfruits of mota died three days later and mr patteson found a great howling and wailing going on over its little grave under a long low house  this was hushed when he came up and spoke of the resurrection and described the babes soul dwelling in peace in the kingdom of the father where those would join it who would believe and repent cast away their evil practices and be baptized to live as children of god  kneeling down he prayed over it thanking god for having taken it to himself and interceding for all around  they listened and seemed touched no opposition was ever offered to him but he found that there was much fighting and quarrelling many of the villages at war with each other and a great deal too much use of the bow and arrow though the whole race was free from cannibalism  they seemed to want to halt between two opinions to keep up their orgies on the one hand and to make much of the white teacher on the other and when we recollect that two unarmed englishmen and twelve blacks from other islands were perfectly isolated in the midst of a heathen population having refused protection from a british manofwar it gives a grandeur to the following narrative  june 7thone of their chief men has just been with two breadfruit as a present  i detected him as a leader of one of their chief ceremonies yesterday and i have just told him plainly that i cannot accept anything from him neither can i suffer him to be coming to my place while it is notorious that he is teaching the children the very things they ought not to learn and that he is strongly supporting the old false system while he professes to be listening attentively to the word of god  i made him take up his two breadfruit and carry them away and i suppose it will be the story all over the village that i have driven him away  byandby we will listen to the word of god when we have finished these ceremonies  yes you hearken first to the voice of the evil spirit you choose him firsthand then you will care to hear about god  the ceremony was to last twenty days and only affected the lads who were blackened all over with soot and apparently presented pigs to the old priest and were afterwards admitted to the privileges of eating and sleeping in the separate building which formed a kind of clubhouse for the men of each village and on which mr patteson could always reckon as both a lecture room and sleeping place  the people kept on saying that byandby they would make an end of their wild ritual and throw down their enclosures and at the same time they thronged to talk to him at the mission station and built a shed to serve for a school at auta  meantime the little estate was brought into order  a pleasant day of landscapegardening was devoted to clearing gaps to let in the lovely views from the station and a piece of ground was dug and planted with pineapples vines oranges and cotton also a choicer species of banana than the indigenous one  breadfruit was so plentiful that breakfast was provided by sending a boy up a tree to bring down four or five fruits which were laid in the ashes and cooked at once and as to banana leaves we think nothing of cutting one down four feet long and twenty inches wide of a bright pale green just to wrap up a cooked yam or two  the first week in july with wadrokala mark and two malanta men mr patteson set forth in the boat that had been left with him for an expedition among the other islands beginning with saddle island or valua which was the proper name  the day after leaving eowa the weather changed and as on these perilous coasts there was no possibility of landing two days and the intervening night had to be spent in the open fouroared boat riding to a grapnel  very glad they were to get into port patteson and to land in the wet as it can rain in the tropics  the nearest village however was empty everybody being gone to the burial wake of the wife of a chief and there was no fire to cook the yams everything dreary and deserted but a short walk brought the wet and tired party to the next village where they were made welcome to the common house and after supping on yams and chocolate spent a good night and found the sea smooth the next day for a return to headquarters  these first weeks at mota were very happy but after that the strain began to tell  mr patteson had been worn with anxiety for his father and no doubt with awe in the contemplation of his coming episcopate and was not in a strong state of health when he left kohimarama and the lack of animal food the too sparing supply of wine and the bare board bed told upon him  on the 24th of july he wrote in a letter to his uncle edward   i have lost six days a small tumour formed inside the ear about two inches from the outer ear and the pain has been very considerable and the annoyance great  last night i slept for the first time for five nights and i have been so weary with sleeplessness that i have been quite idle  the mischief is passing away now  that ear is quite deaf it made me think so of dear father and joan with their constant trial  i dont see any results from our residence here and why should i look for them  it is enough that the people are hearing some of them talking and a few thinking about what they hear  all in gods own time  mr dudley adds his chief trouble at this time was with one of his ears  the swelling far in not only made him deaf while it lasted but gave him intense and protracted agony  more than once he had to spend the whole night in walking up and down the room  but only on one occasion during the whole time do i remember his losing his patience and that was when we had been subjected to an unusually protracted visitation from the loafers of the village who would stretch themselves at full length on the floor and table if we would let them and altogether conduct themselves in such a manner as to call for summary treatment very different from the more promising section  the half jocular but very decided manner in which he cleared the house on this occasion and made them understand that they were to respect our privacy sometimes and not make the mission station an idling place was very satisfactory  it was no small aggravation of the pain to feel that this might be the beginning of permanent deafness such as would be fatal to his usefulness in a work in which accuracy of ear was essential  however this gradually improved and another boat voyage was made but again was frustrated by the torrents of rain  in fact it was an unusually wet and unwholesome season which told upon everyone  mark chakham the nengonese was brought very near the grave by a severe attack of dysentery  all the stores of coffee chocolate wine and biscuit were used up  the southern cross had been due full a month and nothing was heard of her through the whole of september  teaching and conversation went on all this time trying as it was and the people still came to hear though no one actually undertook to forsake his idols  i am still hopeful about these people is the entry on september 18 though all their old customs and superstitions go on just as before  but 1 they know that a better teaching has been presented to them  2 they do not pursue their old habits with the same unthinkingsecurity  3 there are signs of a certain uneasiness of mind as if a struggle was beginning in them  4 they have a vague consciousness some of them that the power is passing away from their witchcrafts sorceries c by which unquestionably they did and still do work strange effects on the credulous people like pharaohs magicians of old  this was ground gained and one or two voyages to vanua lava and the other isles were preparatory steps and much experience had been acquired and resulted in this  the feasibility of the bishops old scheme is more and more apparent to me  only i think that in taking away natives to the summer school it must be understood that some and they few are taken from new islands merely to teach us some of their languages and to frank us so that we may have access in safety to their islands  should any of them turn out well so much the better but it will not be well to take them with the expectation of their becoming teachers to their people  but the other section of the school will consist of young men whose behaviour we have watched during the winter in their own homes whose professions we have had an opportunity of testing they may be treated as young men on the way to become teachers eventually to their countrymen  one learns much from living among a heathen people and only by living in our pupils homes shall we ever know their real characters  poor fellows they are adepts in all kinds of deceitfulness at a very early age and so completely in our power on board the schooner and at kohimarama that we know nothing of them as they are  the very paper this is copied from shows how the stores were failing for the full quarto sheets have all failed and the journal is continued on note paper  not till october 1 was mr pattesons watch by a poor dying woman interrupted by tidings that a ship was in sight  and soon it was too plain that she was not the southern cross though happily neither trader nor french mission ship  in a short time there came ashore satisfactory letters from home but with them the tidings that the little southern cross lay in many fathoms water on the new zealand coast  on her return on the night of the 17th of june just as new zealand itself was reached there was a heavy gale from the northeast  a dangerous shoal of rocks called the hen and chickens stands out from the head of ngunguru bay and in the darkness and mist it was supposed that these were safely passed when the ship struck on the eastern chicken happily on a spot somewhat sheltered from the violence of the breakers  the two passengers and the crew took refuge in the rigging all night and in the morning contrived to get a line to land on which all were safely drawn through the surf and were kindly received by the nearest english settlers  so after five years good service ended the career of the good southern cross the first  she had gone down upon sand and much of the wreck might have been recovered and made useful again had labour not been scarce at that time in new zealand that the bishop could find no one to undertake the work and all he could do was to charter another vessel to be despatched to bring home the party from mota nor were vessels fit for the purpose easy to find and the schooner zillahwelcome as was the sight of herproved a miserable substitute even in mere nautical capabilities and her internal arrangements were of course entirely inappropriate to the peculiar wants of the mission  this was the more unfortunate because the very day after her arrival mr dudley was prostrated by something of a sunstroke  martin tehele was ill already and rapidly became worse and wadrokala and harper malo sickened immediately nor was the former patient recovered  mr dudley wadrokala and harper were for many days in imminent danger and were scarcely dragged through by the help of six bottles of wine providentially sent by the bishop  mr dudley says  during the voyage mr  pattesons powers of nursing were severely tried  poor martin passed away before we arrived at nengone and was committed to the deep  before he died he was completely softened by mr pattesons loving care and asked pardon for all the trouble he had given and the fretfulness he had shown  poor fellow  i well remember how he gasped out the lords prayer after mr patteson a few minutes before he died  we all who had crawled up round his bed joining in with them  oh what a long dreary time that was  light baffling winds continually and we in a vessel as different from the southern cross as possible absolutely guiltless i should think of having ever made two miles an hour to windward in a wind  the one thing that stands out as having relieved its dreariness is the presence of mr patteson the visits he used to pay to us and the exquisite pathos of his voice as from the corner of the hold where we lay we could hear him reading the morning and evening prayers of the church and leading the hymn  these prevented these long weary wakeful days and nights from being absolutely insupportable  at last nengone was reached and wadrokala and harper were there set ashore better but very weak  here the tidings were known that in lifu john cho had lost his wife margaret and had married the widow of a karotongan teacher a very suitable match but too speedy to be according to european ideas and on november 26 the zillah was off the three kings new zealand   monday nov 26 1860  zillah schooner off the three kings n of new zealand  you know pretty well that kohimarama is a small bay about onethird of a mile along the sea frontage twoandahalf miles due east of auckland and just opposite the entrance into the harbour between the north head and eangitoto  the beach is composed entirely of the shells of pipi small cockles always therefore dry and pleasant to walk upon  a fence runs along the whole length of it  at the eastern end of it a short distance inside this n  sea fence are the three cottages of the master and mate and fletcher  sam fletcher is a manofwars man age about thirtyeight who has been with us some four years and a half  he has all the habits of order and cleanliness that his life as coxswain of the captains gig taught him he is a very valuable fellow  he is our extra man at sea  each of these cottages has its garden and all three men are married but only the master grange has any family one married daughter  then going westward comes a nineacre paddock and then a dividing fence inside ie to w of which stand our buildings  now our life here is hard to represent  it is not like the life of an ordinary schoolmaster still less like that of an ordinary clergyman  much of the domestic and cooking department i may manage of course to superintend  i would much rather do this than have the nuisance of a paid servant  so at 5 am say i turn out i at once go to the kitchen and set the two cooks of the week to work light fire put on yams or potatoes then back to dress read c in and out all the time of the kitchen till breakfast time say 8 or 830  you would be surprised to see how very soon the lads will do it all by themselves and leave me or mr kerr to give all our attention to school and other matters  so you can fancy joan now the manner of life  my little room with my books is my snuggery during the middle of the day and at night i have also a large working table at one end of the big school room covered with books papers c and here i sit a good deal my room being too small to hold the number of books that i require to have open for comparison of languages and for working out grammatical puzzles  then i am in and out of the kitchen and store room and boys rooms seeing that all things clothes blankets floors c are washed and kept clean and doing much what is done in every house  snuggery no doubt it looked compared with the zillah but what would the eton fellow of fifteen years back have thought of the bare scantily furnished room with nothing but the books prints and photographs around to recall the tastes of old and generally a sick melanesian on the floor  however he was glad enough to return thither though with only sixteen scholars from ten places  among them was taroniara from bauro who was to be his follower faithful to death  the following addition was made to the letter to mr edward coleridge begun in banks islands   kohimarama dec 1 1860  one line my dear tutor before i finish off my pile of hastily written letters for this mail  alas alas for the little schooner that dear little vessel our home for so many months of each year so admirably qualified for her work  whether she may be got off her sandy bed no one can say great expense would certainly be incurred and the risk of success great also  i have not yet had time to talk to the bishop i only reached new zealand on november 28  we cannot however well do our work in chartered vessels then follows a full detail of the imperfections of the zillah and all other australian merchant craft then but dear old tutor even the southern cross though what would i give to see her now at her usual anchorage from the window at which i am now sitting for a time retires into the distance as i think of what is to take place dv in january next  i hoped that i had persuaded the bishop that the meeting of the general synod in february 1862 would be a fit time  i do not see that the dukes despatch makes any difference in the choice of the time  but all was settled in my absence and now at the feast of the epiphany or of the conversion of st paul as suits the convenience of the southern bishops the consecration is to take place  i am heartily glad that the principle of consecrating missionary bishops will be thus affirmed and acted upon but oh if some one else was to be the bishop  and yet i must not distrust gods grace and the gift of the holy spirit to enable me for this work  i try and pray to be calm and resigned and i am happy and cheerful  and it is a blessed thing that now three of your old dear friends once called selwyn abraham hobhouse should be consecrating your own nephew and pupil gathered by gods providence into the same part of gods field at the ends of the earth   still with his heart full of the neverforgotten influence of his mother he thus begins his home letter of the same date   kohimarama dec 1  my dearest fatheri could not write on november 28 but the memory of that day in 1842 was with me from morning to night  we anchored on that day at 1 am and i was very busy till late at night  i had no idea till i came back from the islands that there was any change in the arrangements for the consecration in february 1862  but now the bishops of wellington and nelson have been summoned for the feast of the epiphany or of the conversion of st paul and all was done in my absence  i see too that you in england have assumed that the consecration will take place soon after the reception of the dukes despatch  i must not now shrink from it i know  i have full confidence in your judgment and in that of the bishop and i suppose that if i was speaking of another i should say that i saw reasons for it  but depend upon it my dear father that a man cannot communicate to another the whole of the grounds upon which he feels reluctant to accept an office  i believe that i ought to accept this in deference to you all and i do so cheerfully but i dont say that my judgment agrees wholly with you all  and yet there is no one else and if the separation of new zealand and melanesia is necessary i see that this must be the consequence so i regard it now as a certainty  i pray god to strengthen and enable me i look forward thanks to him hopefully and cheerfully i have the love and the prayers of many many friends and soon the whole church of england will recognise me as one who stands in special need of grace and strength from above  oh the awful power of heathenism the antagonism not of evil only but of the evil one rather i mean the reality felt of all evil emanating from a person as st paul writes and as our lord spoke of him  i do indeed at times feel overwhelmed as if i was in a dream then comes some blessed word or thought of comfort and promised strength and grace  but enough of this  the southern cross cannot i think be got off without great certain expense and probable risk  i think we shall have to buy another vessel and i dare say she may be built at home but i dont know what is the bishops mind about it  i shall write to merton i dont know why i should needs vacate my fellowship  i have no change of outward circumstances brought upon me by my change presently from the name of presbyter to bishop and we want all the money  what you say about a missionary bishop being for five months of the year within the diocese of another bishop i will talk over with the bishop of new zealand  i think our synodical system will make that all right and as for my work it will be precisely the same in all respects my external life altered only to the extent of my wearing a broader brimmed and lower crowned hat  dear joan is investing moneys in cutaway coats buckles without end and no doubt kneebreeches and what she calls gambroons whereof i have no cognizance none of which will be worn more than say four or five times in the year gambroons and aprons and lawn sleeves wont go avoyaging depend upon it  just when i preach in some auckland church i shall appear in full costume but the buckles will grow very rusty indeed  how kind and good of her to take all the trouble i dont laugh at that and at her dear love for me and anxiety that i should have everything but i could not help having a joke about gambroons whatever they are  goodbye once more my dearest father  you will i trust receive this budget about the time of your birthday  how i think of you day and night and how i thank you for all your love and perhaps most of all not only letting me come to melanesia but for your great love in never calling me away from my work even to see your face once more on earth  your loving and dutiful son  j c patteson   remark upon a highminded letter is generally an impertinence both to the writer and the reader but i cannot help pausing upon the foregoing to note the force of the expression that thanks the father for the love that did not recall the son  what a different notion these two men had of love from that which merely seeks self gratification  observe too how the old selfcontemplative self tormenting spirit that was unhappiness in those days of growth and heartsearching at the first entrance into the ministry had passed into humble obedience and trust  looking back to the correspondence of ten years ago volumes of progress are implied in the quiet enough of this  there were however some delays in bringing the three together and on the new years day of 1861 the designate writes to bishop abraham i dare say the want of any positive certainty as to the time of the consecration is a good discipline for me  i think i feel calm now but i know i must not trust feelings and when i think of those islands and the practical difficulty of getting at them and the need of so many of those qualities which are so wonderfully united in our dear primate i need strength from above indeed to keep my heart from sinking  but i think that i do long and desire to work on by gods grace and not to look to results at all  a supplementary mail made possible a birthday letter the last written at 6 am on the 11th of february i wanted of course to write to you today  many happy returns of it i wish you indeed for it may yet please god to prolong your life but in any case you know well how i am thinking and praying for you that every blessing and comfort may be given you  oh i how i do think of you night and day when mrs selwyn said goodbye and spoke of you i could not stand it  i feel that anything else as i fancy i can speak of with composure but the verses in the bible such as the passage which i read yesterday in st mark x almost unnerve me and i cant wish it to be otherwise  but i feel that my place is here and that i must look to the blessed hope of meeting again hereafter  of course no treat is so great to me as the occasional talks with the bishop  oh the memory of those days and evenings on board the southern cross  well it was so happy a life that it was not good for me i suppose that it should last  but i feel it now that the sense of responsibility is deepening on me and i must go out to work without him and very very anxious i am sometimes and almost oppressed by it  but strength will come and it is not ones own work which is the comfort and if i fail which is very likely god will place some other man in my position and the work will go on whether in my hands or not and that is the real point  some talk i find there has been about my going home  i did not hear of it until after mrs selwyn had sailed  it was thought of but it was felt as i certainly feel that it ought not to be my work lies out here clearly and it is true that any intermission of voyages or residences in the islands is to be avoided  mrs selwyn had gone home for a year and had so arranged as to see the patteson family almost immediately on her return  meantime the day drew on  the consecration was not by royal mandate as in the case of bishops of sees under british jurisdiction but the duke of newcastle then colonial secretary wrotethat the bishops of new zealand are at liberty without invasion of the royal prerogative or infringement of the law of england to exercise what bishop selwyn describes as their inherent power of consecrating mr patteson or any other person to take charge of the melanesian islands provided that the consecration should take place beyond british territory  in consequence it was proposed that the three consecrating bishops should take ship and perform the holy rite in one of the isles beneath the open sky but as bishop mackenzie had been legally consecrated in cape town cathedral the attorneygeneral of new zealand gave it as his opinion that there was no reason that the consecration should not take place in auckland   kohimarama feb 15 1861  my dearest fathermr kerr who has just returned from auckland where he spent yesterday brings me the news that the question of the consecration has been settled and that it will take place dv on sunday week st matthias day february 24  i ought not to shrink back now  the thought has become familiar to me and i have the greatest confidence in the judgment of the bishop of new zealand and i need not say how your words and letters and prayers too are helping me now  indeed though at any great crisis of our lives no doubt we are intended to use more than ordinary strictness in examining our motives and in seeking for greater grace deeper repentance more earnest and entire devotion to god and amendment of life yet i know that any strongemotion if it existed now would pass away soon and that i must be the same man as bishop as i am now in this sense viz that i shall have just the same faults unless i pray for strength to destroy them which i can do equally well now and that all my characteristic and peculiar habits of mind will remain unchanged by what will only change my office and not myself  so that where i am indolent now i shall be indolent henceforth unless i seek to get rid of indolence and i shall not be at all better wiser or more consistent as bishop than i am now by reason simply of being a bishop  you know my meaning  now i apply what i write to prove that any strong excitement now would be no evidence of a healthy state of mind  i feel now like myself and that is not at all like what i wish to be  and so i thank god that as before any solemn season special inducements to earnest repentance are put into our minds so i now feel a special call upon me to seek by his grace to make a more faithful use of the means of usefulness which he gives me that i may be wholly and entirely turned to him and so be enabled to do his will in melanesia  you know my dearest father that i do not indeed undervalue the grace of ordination only i mean that the right use of any great event in ones life as i take it is not to concentrate feeling so much on it as earnestness of purpose prayer for grace and for increase of simplicity and honesty and purity of heart perhaps other matters affect me more than my supposed state of feeling so that my present calmness may be attributed to circumstances of which i am partially ignorant and indeed i do wonder that i am calm when one moments look at the map or thought of the countless islands almost overwhelms me  how to get at them where to begin  how to find men and means  how to decide upon the best method of teaching c  but i must try to be patient and to be content with very small beginningsand endings too perhaps   sunday feb 24 st matthias 10 amthe day is come my dearest father and finds me i thank god very calm  yesterday at 6 pm in the little chapel at taurama the three bishops the dear judge lady martin mrs abraham mr lloyd and i met together for special prayer  how we missed mrs selwyn dear dear mrs selwyn from among us and how my thoughts passed on to you  evening hymn exhortation in consecration service litany from the st augustines missionary manual with the questions in consecration service turned into petitions psalm cxxxii cxxxi li lesson i tim iii special prayer for the elect bishop among the heathen for the conversion of the heathen and the gloria in excelsis  then the dear bishop walked across to me and taking my hand in both of his looking at me with that smile of love and deep deep thought so seldom seen and so deeply prized  i cant tell you what i feel he said with a low and broken voice  you know itmy heart is too full   ah the memory of six years with that great and noble servant of god was in my heart too and so we stood tears in our eyes and i unable to speak  at night again when after arranging finally the service i was left with him alone he spoke calmly and hopefully  much he said of you and we are all thinking much of you  then he said i feel no misgiving in my heart i think all has been done as it should be many days we three have discussed the matter  by prayer and holy communion we have sought light from above and it is i believe gods will  then once more taking both hands he kissed my forehead god bless you my dear coley  i cant say more words and you dont desiderate them  no said i my heart as yours is too full for words  i have lived six years with you to little purpose if i do not know you full well now  and then i walked in the perfect peace of a still cloudless night the moon within two days of fullthe quarter of a mile to st stephens schools where i slept last night  on the way i met the bishop of wellington and mrs abraham coming up from st stephens to the bishops house  j c pwhat a night of peace the harbour like a silver mirror  b of wdominus tecum  mrs ai trust you will sleep  j c pi thank you i think so  i feel calm   sunday night 10 pm  feniton sunday 1040 amit is overa most solemn blessed service  glorious day  church crowdedmany not able to find admittance but orderly  more than two hundred communicants  more tomorrow dv  all day you have been in our minds  the bishop spoke of you in his sermon with faltering voice and i broke down yet at the moment of the veni creator being sung over me and the imposition of hands i was very calm  the bible presented is the same that you gave me on my fifth birthday with your love and blessing  oh my dear dear father god will bless you for all your love to me and your love to him in giving me to his service  may his heavenly blessing be with youall your dear ones for ever  your most loving and dutiful son  j c patteson missionary bishop   february 25thi am spending today and tomorrow hereie sleeping at the judges dining and living half at his house and half at the bishopsquiet and calm it is and i prize it  the music yesterday was very good organ well played  the choirs of the three town churches and many of the choral society people filled the gallerysome eighty voices perhaps  the veni creator the only part that was not good well sung but too much like an anthem  tagalana halfsitting halfkneeling behind me held the book for the primate to read from at the imposition of handsa striking group i am told   here ends the letter to which a little must be added from other pens and first from mrs abrahams letter for the benefit of eton friends   the consecration was at st pauls church in default of a cathedral  built before the bishop arrived st pauls has no chancel and the clergy including a maori deacon were rather crowded within the rail  mr patteson was seated in a chair in front ten of his island boys close to him and several working men of the rougher sort were brought into the benches near  we were rather glad of the teaching that none were excluded  the service was all in harmony with the occasion and the sermon gave expression to all the individual and concentrated feeling of the moment as well as pointing the lesson and its teaching  the sermon was on the thought of the festival and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the hearts of all men show whether of these two thou hast chosen acts i 24  after speaking of the special import and need of the prayers of those gathered to offer up their prayers at the holy communion for those who were to exercise the office of apostles in their choice he spoke in words that visibly almost overpowered their subject  in this work of god belonging to all eternity and to the holy catholic church are we influenced by any private feelings any personal regard  the charge which st paul gives to timothy in words of awful solemnity to lay hands suddenly on no man may well cause much searching of heart  i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality  does our own partial love deceive us in this choice we were all trained in the same place of education united in the same circle of friends in boyhood youth manhood we have shared the same services and joys and hopes and fears  i received this my son in the ministry of christ jesus from the hands of a father of whose old age he was the comfort  he sent him forth without a murmur nay rather with joy and thankfulness to these distant parts of the earth  he never asked even to see him again but gave him up without reserve to the lords work  pray dear brethren for your bishops that our partial love may not deceive us in this choice for we cannot so strive against natural affection as to be quite impartial  and again as the primate addressing more especially his beloved son in the ministry exclaimed may christ be with you when you go forth in his name and for his sake to those poor and needy people and his eye went along the dusky countenances of his ten boys coleridge patteson could hardly restrain his intensity of feeling  another letter from the same lady to the sisters adds further details to the scene after describing the figures in the church  lady martin who had never seen the dress the cassock and rochet before said that coley reminded her of the figures of some young knight watching his armour as he stood in his calm stedfastness and answered the questions put to him by the primate  the whole service was very nicely ordered and the special psalm well chanted  with one exception which was alas the veni creator the music was good and coley says was a special help to him the pleasure of it and the external hold that it gave helping him out of himself as it were and sustaining him  lady martin adds her touch to the picture and it may perhaps be recorded for those who may in after times read the history of the first bishop of the melanesian church that whatever might be wanting in the beauty of st pauls auckland never were there three bishops who outwardly as well as inwardly more answered to the dignity of their office than the three who stood over the kneeling coleridge patteson  i shall never forget the expression of his face as he knelt in the quaint rochet  it was meek and holy and calm as though all conflict was over and he was resting in the divine strength  it was altogether a wonderful scene the three consecrating bishops all such noblelooking men the goodly company of clergy and hohuas fine intelligent brown face among them and then the long line of island boys and of st stephens native teachers and their wives were living testimonies of mission work  coley had told us in the morning of a consecration he had seen at rome where a young greek deacon had held a large illuminated book for the pope to read the words of consecration  we had no such gorgeous dresses as they but nothing could have been more simply beautiful and touching than the sight of tagalanas young face as he did the same good office  there was nothing artistic about it the boy came forward with a wondering yet bright look on his pleasant face just dressed in his simple grey blouse  you will read the sermon so there is no need to talk about it your brother was overcome for a minute at the reference to his father but the comfort and favour of his heavenly master kept him singularly calm though the week before he had undoubtedly had much struggle and his bodily health was affected  all the friends who were thus brought together were like one family and still called the new bishop by the never disused abbreviation that recalled his home  he was the guest of the now retired chief justice and lady martin who were occupying themselves in a manner probably unique in the history of law and lawyers by taking charge of the native school at st stephens  the next two were great days of letter writing  another long full letter was written to the father telling of the additional record which each of the three consecrating bishops had written in the bible of his childhood and then going into business matters especially hoping that the warden and fellows of merton would not suppose that as a bishop he necessarily had £5000 a year and a palace whereas in fact the see had no more than the capital of £5000 required by government  he had already agreed with his father that his own share of the inheritance should go to the mission and as he says on hearing the amount  hard enough you worked my dear father to leave your children so well off  dear old jem will have enough and my children now dwell in 200 islands and will need all that i can give them  god grant that the day may come when many of them may understand these things and rise up and call your memory blessed  your words of comfort and blessing come to me with fresh strength just now two days only after the time when you too had you been here would in private have laid your hand on my head and called down gods blessing upon me  i shall never know in this world what i owe to your prayers  there is much too of his brothers marriage and in a separate letter to the sisters there are individual acknowledgments of each article of the equipment gratifying the donor by informing her that the cutaway coat was actually to be worn that very evening at a dinner party at the chief justices and admiring the gambroon which turned out to be the material of the cassock so much as to wish for a coat made of it for the islands  apropos of the hat you know my forehead is square so that an oval hat does not fit it would hang on by the temples which form a kind of right angle with the forehead  another letter of that 26th was from the bishop of wellington to dr goodford respecting this muchloved old pupil  anything more conscientious and painstaking cannot be conceived than the way he has steadily directed every talent every hour or minute of his life to the one work he had set before him  however small or uncongenial or drumdrudgerylike his occupation however hard or dangerous or difficult it seemed to be always met in the same calm gentle selfpossessed spirit of love and duty which i should fancy that those who well knew his good and largeminded largehearted father and his mother whom i have always heard spoken of as saintly could best understand  perhaps the most marked feature in his character is his genuine simplicity and humility  i never saw it equalled in one so gifted and so honoured and beloved  it is really creditable to the community to see how universal is the admiration for his character for he is so very good so exceedingly unworldly and therefore such a living rebuke to the selfishness of the world and though so gentle yet so firm and uncompromising that you would have supposed he would hardly be popular outside the circle of friends who know him and understand him  certainly he is the most perfect character i ever met  the last day of february was that of the installation  again mrs abraham must speak  on thursday last we had another happy day at kohimarama where bishop patteson was duly installed in the temporary chapel of st andrews college as we hope to call it after the church at cocksmoor in the daisy chain  the morning was grey and we feared rain would keep us ladies away hut we made the venture with our willing squire mr m in the iris boat to help us  the pity was that after all lady martin could not go as she had an invalid among her maori flock whom she could not trust all day by herself the day lightened and our sail was pleasant  the primate and missionary bishop planted a norfolk pine in the centre of the quadranglethe tree planted by the water side c the bishop then robed and proceeded to chapel and the primate led the little service in which he spoke the words of installation and the mew bishop took the oath of allegiance to him  the veni creator was sung and the primates blessinggiven  the island boys looked on from one transept the iris sailors from another and charlie stood beside me  i am afraid his chief remembrance of the day is fixed upon kanambats tiny boat and outrigger which he sat in on the beach and went on voyages in which the owner waded by his side and saw him kanambat skim along the waves like a white butterfly  we all dined in hall after the boys on roast beef and plum pudding melons and water melons and strolled about the place and beach at leisure till it was time to sail back again  on the sunday the new bishop preached at st marys one of the sermons that broke from him when he was too much excited if the word may be used for his usual metaphysical style  the subject was the promise of the comforter his eternal presence and anointing and the need of intercessory prayer for which the preacher besought earnestly as one too young for his office and needing to increase in the holy spirit more and more  very far were these from being unrealised words  gods grace had gone along with him and had led him through every step and stage of his life and so mastered his natural defects that friends who only knew him in these years hear with incredulous indignation of those flaws he had conquered in his younger days  fearless as a man tender as a woman showing both the best sides of human nature says one of the new zealand friends who knew him best always drawing out the good in all about him by force of sympathy and not only taking care that nothing should be done by others that he would not do himself but doing himself what he did not like to ask of them and thinking that they excelled him humility the effort of his life was achieved at last the more truly because not consciously  the letter to his father was again almost wholly on money matters but at the end come two notable sentences  how can i thank you for giving me up to this work and for all the wise and loving words with which you constantly cheer me and encourage me  your blessing comes now to strengthen me as work and responsibilities are fast accumulating upon me  i thank god that he enables us at the two ends of the world to see this matter in the same way so that no conflict of duties arises in my mind  this book essays and reviews i have but pray send your copy also also any good books that may be produced bearing on that great question of the atonement and on inspiration authority of scripture c  how sad it is to see that spirit of intellectualism thinking to deal with religion in forgetfulness of the necessary conditions of humility and faith  how different from the true gnosis   kohimarama april 29 1861  my dearest fatheras i read your letters of feb 2125 you are i trust reading mine which tell you of what took place on feb 24 that point is settled  i almost fear to write that i am a bishop in the church of christ  may god strengthen me for the duties of the office to which i trust he has indeed called me  as i read of what you say so wisely and truly and dear joan and fan and aunt james and all of my having expected results too rapidly at mota i had sitting with me that dear boy tagalana who for two months last winter was in the great sacred enclosure though dear lad not by his own will yet his faith was weak and no wonder  now gods holy name be praised for it he is i verily believe in his very soul taught by the spirit to see and desire to do his duty i feel more confidence about him than i have done about anyone who has come into my hands originally in a state of complete heathenism it is not that his knowledge only is accurate and clearly grasped but the humility the loving spirit the apparent personal appropriation of the blessing of having been brought to know the love of god and the redemption wrought for him by the death of christ this is what as i look upon his clear truthful eyes makes me feel so full of thankfulness and praise  but tagalana if i should die you used to say that without my help you should perhaps fall back again is that true  no no i did not feel it then as i do now in my heart  i cant tell how it came there only i know he can never die and will always be with me  you know you said you were only like a signpost to point out the way that leads to him and i see that we ought to follow you but to go altogether to him  i cant tell you my dearest father what makes up the sum of my reasons for thinking that god is in his mercy bringing this dear boy to be the firstfruits of mota unto the christ but i think that there is an inward teaching going on now in his heart which gives me sure hope for i know it is not my doing  all you all say about mota is most true i never thought otherwise really but i wrote down my emotions and impulses rather than my deliberate thoughts that my letter written under such strange circumstances might become as a record of the effect produced day by day upon us by outward circumstances  what some of you say about selfpossession on ones going about among the people being marvellous is just what of course appears to me commonplace  of course it is wrong to risk ones life but to carry ones life in ones hand is what other soldiers besides those of the cross do habitually and no one as i think would willingly hurt a hair of my head in melanesia or that part of it where i am at all known  how i think of those islands  how i see those bright coral and sandy beaches strips of burning sunshine fringing the masses of forest rising into ridges of hills covered with a dense mat of vegetation  hundreds of people are crowding upon them naked armed with wild uncouth cries and gestures i cannot talk to them but by signs  but they are my children now  may god enable me to do my duty to them  i have now as i write a deepening sense of what the change must be that has passed upon me  again i go by gods blessing for seven months to melanesia  all that our experience has taught us we try to remember food medicine articles of trade and barter  but what may be the result  who can tell  you know it is not of myself that i am thinking  if god of his great mercy lead me in his way to me there is little worth living for but the going onward with his blessed work though i like my talks with the dear bishop and the judge  but others are committed to memr pritt and mr kerr go with me  shall i find dear old wadrokala and harper alive and if alive well  and yet thank god we go on day by day so happy so hopeful  i see two sermons by the bishop of oxford gods revelation mans trial please send them  they bear i conclude on the controversy of the day  i need not tell you that i find a very great interest in reading these books or rather at present in talking now and then when we meet with the judge on the subject of which those books treat  the books i have not read  but i know no refreshment so great as the reading any books which deal with these questions thoughtfully  i hope you dont think it wrong and dangerous for me to do so pray tell me  i dont believe that i am wrong in doing it yet it may be that i read them as an intellectual treat and prefer them to thoughtful books on other subjects because they deal with a study which i am a little more conversant with than with history science c  besides i do see that we have many of us very vague notions of the meaning of terms which we use and i see that i must be prepared i speak for myself to expect that a clergyman may not with impunity use a language wanting in definiteness and precision  it is possible that men do too passively receive hereditary and conventional opinions which never have a living reality to them  but this you know i do not confound with the humble submission to authoritative teaching given upon authority to supersede the necessity of every person investigating for himself the primary grounds of his religious convictions  it is worth noting how the bishop submits his reading to his fathers approval as when he was a young boy  alas no more such letters of comfort and counsel would be exchanged  this one could hardly have been received by that muchloved father  preparations for the voyage were going on but the dunedin the only vessel to be procured at best a carthorse to a racer compared with the southern cross was far from being in a satisfactory state as appears in a note of 3rd of may to the bishop of wellington  here we are still  the only vessel that i could make any arrangement about not yet returned and known to be in such a state that the pumps were going every two hours  i have not chartered her but only agreed with the owner a month ago nearly that i would take her at a certain sum per day subject to divers conditions about being caulked which is all she wants i have ascertained being provided with spare sails spars chronometer boat c and all agreement to be off unless by a certain day already past she was in a state satisfactory to mr kerr  but there is i fear none other and i am in a difficulty   of the same day is a letter to the rev stephen hawtrey   taurarua auckland may 6 1861  my dear mr hawtreyi was highly pleased to receive a note from you  though i never doubt of the hearty sympathy and cooperation of all eton friends how could you do so with such an annual subscription list yet it is very pleasant and more than pleasant to be reminded by word or by letter that prayers and wishes are being offered up for melanesia by many good men throughout the world  i should like to send a special appeal for a mission vessel by the next mail  we cannot get on without one  vessels built for freight are to the southern cross as a carthorse to a thoroughbred steed and we must have some vessel which can do the work quickly among the multitude of the isles and many other reasons there are which we seamen only perhaps can judge fully which make it quite essential to the carrying on this peculiar mission that we should have a vessel of a peculiar kind  tagalana from mota sugar loaf island in the banks archipelago is i think likely by gods great mercy to become the firstfruits of that cluster of islands unto christ  he is here for the third time and i have infinite comfort in seeing the earnestness of his character and the deep sense of what he was and what he is going to be so truly realised  he is now so unlike what still his people are so bright and open in manner and all who see him say what is come to the lad his manner and very appearance so changed  clothed thank god he is and in his right mind soon to sit if not already seated at the feet of christ  you may if you think fit let your thoughts centre more especially in him  he of all who have come into my hands absolutely stark naked and savage gives now the greatest ground for hope and thanksgiving  i shall dv think of all your dear friends assembled in your church and house on st barnabas day  may god bless and reward you all for your work of charity to melanesia  very sincerely yours  j c patteson missionary bishop  psi hope to baptize that dear boy tagalana on his own island in the course of the winter  i should wish to make the service as impressive as possible in the presence of as many islanders as i can bring to the spot under the shadow of a mighty banyan tree and above the sparkling waves of the great pacific   the dunedin was patched up into sailing with the new bishop for his cathedralthe banyan tree of mota  it carried him away to his work away from all knowledge of the blow that was preparing for him at home and thinking of the delight that was in store for his family in a visit from mrs selwyn who immediately after his consecration had returned home to spend a year in england on business  sir john pattesons happiness in his sons work and worth were far greater than those of the actual worker having none of the drawbacks that consciousness of weakness must necessarily excite  the joy this gave his heart may without exaggeration be deliberately said to have been full compensation for the loss of the presence so nobly sacrificed  on january 22 he had written to the bishop of new zealand   you write most kindly touching him dear fellow and truly i am to be envied qui natum haberem tali ingenio praeditum  not for a moment have i repented of giving my sanction to his going out to new zealand and i fully believe that god will prosper his work  i did not contemplate his becoming a bishop nor is that the circumstance which gives me the great satisfaction i feel  it is his devotion to so good a work and that he should have been found adequate to its performance whether as a bishop or as a priest is not of itself of so much importance  perhaps he may have been consecrated before i am writing this though i am puzzled as to the time  may god bless with the fullest success the labours of both of you in your high and christian works   there had for more than a year been cause of anxiety for sir johns health but it was not the disease that had then threatened which occasioned the following calmhearted letter to be written to his son   feniton court march 22 1861  my own dearest coleyi promised always to tell you the truth respecting myself and will do so  about a month ago on my rising from reading prayers the girls and the dawlish party who were here exclaimed that my voice was broken at which i laughed  whitby was in london but his partner happened to call and looking at my throat found it relaxed and recommended a mustard poultice on the front when we came to put it on we discovered that the glands of the throat were much swelled and in hard knots  whitby returned in two days and was much alarmed  he declared that it was serious and nothing but iodine could check it  i had been unable to take iodine under watson some years ago as it affected my head tremendously so he applied it outwardly by painting this painting did not reduce them and he strongly pressed my having london advice for he said that if not reduced and the swellings increased internally they would press on the windpipe and choke me it was somewhat a surgical matter  so on tuesday the 12th inst we went to london and i consulted paget  he entirely agreed with whitby and thought it very serious and ordered iodine internally at all hazards  i took it and by gods mercy it agreed with me  paget wished to talk over the case with watson and they met on the 16th saturday  they quite agreed and did not conceal from me that if iodine did not reduce the swellings and they should increase internally the result must be fatal  how soon or in what particular manner they could not tell it might even become cancerous  they did not wish me to stay in town but thought i was better here and paget knowing whitby has perfect confidence in his watching and will correspond with him if necessary  at present there is no reduction of the swellings  the iodine has certainly lessened the pains in my limbs but does not seem so to speak to determine to the throat but it may be there has been hardly time to say that it will not  my own impression is that it will not and that it is highly improbable that i shall last very long  i mean that i shall not see 1862 nor perhaps the summer or autumn of this year  i cannot tell why but this near prospect of death has not given me any severe shock as perhaps it ought to have done  it brings more than ever to my mind serious recollection of the sins of my youth and the shortcomings of my after life in thousands of instances  i have never been a hardened sinner but years ago if i did what was sin it smote me and i tried to repent yet there has always been in me a want of fervid love to god and to my blessed redeemer for his unspeakable love in suffering for my sins but it has been coldthat may have been the natural constitution of the man i cannot tellbut i never have placed my hopes of forgiveness and of blessedness hereafter in anything but in his merits and most undeserved goodness in offering me salvation if i have not thrown it away  but what shall i say  as the time approaches it may please him in his mercy to give me a warmer heart and a more vivid perception of all that he has done for me  if i were to say that i am not a sinner the truth would not be in me and if i am washed in his blood and cleansed it is not by any efforts or merits of my own but by his unlimited mercy and goodness  pray for me that when the time comes i may not for any fears of death fall from him  you know that as far as regards this world and its enjoyments save the love of my dear good children they have sate but lightly upon me for some time but it is not because we have nothing that we are unwilling to leave therefore we are prepared for that which is to come  perhaps it may please god to give me still a short time that i may try more strenuously to prepare myself  we shall never meet again in this world  oh may almighty god in his infinite mercy grant us to meet again in his kingdom through the merits of our blessed redeemer  oh my dearest coley what comfort i have had in youwhat delightful conversations we have had together and how thankful we ought to be to our gracious god for allowing it to be so and still not less thankful for the blessings of being watched and comforted and soothed by the dear girls and by that dear and good jem  all so good in their various ways and i so little worthy of themof francis  that will indeed humanly speaking be a terrible loss to his family for they want his fatherly care and will do so for years  not so with me and as i am in my seventysecond year it cannot be said that i am cut off prematurely but on the contrary fall like a fruit or a sheaf at its proper ripeness  oh that it may be so spiritually indeed   another letter followed the next month   feniton court april 24 1861  my own dearest coleyhow many more letters you may receive from me god only knows but as i think not many  the iodine fails altogether and has produced no effect on the swellings in my throat on the contrary they steadily increase though not rapidly doubtless they will have their own course and in some way or other deliver my soul from the burden of the flesh  oh may it by gods mercy be the soul of a faithful man  faith and love i think i have and have long had but i am not so sure that i have really repented for my past sins or only abandoned them when circumstances had removed almost the temptation to commit them  yet i do trust that my repentance has generally been sincere and though i may have fallen again that i may by gods grace have risen again  i have no assurance that i have fought the good fight like st paul and that henceforth there is laid up a crown of gold yet i have a full and firm hope that i am not beyond the pale of gods mercy and that i may have hold of the righteousness of christ and may be partaker of that happiness which he has purchased for his own by his atoning blood  no other hope have i and in all humility i from my heart feel that any apparent good that i may have done has been his work in me and not my own  may it please him that you and i my dear son may meet hereafter together with all those blessed ones who have already departed this life in his faith and fear in his kingdom above  my head aches occasionally and is not so clear as it used to be the next mail will bring us more definite news if indeed i am not myself removed before then i am afraid that you discern by what i have written that i am become stupid and though i could never write decently yet you will see that continued dull pain in the head and other pains in various parts have made me altogether heavy and stupid  i have had the kindest letters and messages from various quarters when it became known as it is always very soon that my health was in a precarious state one particularly from the bishop of lichfield all companions in old court kings you know which is very consoling  he says if not for such as you for whom did christ die  i will not go on in such strains for it is of no use  only do not despair of me my beloved son and believe me always  your loving father  j patteson   feniton court may 25 1861  o my own dearest coleyalmighty god be thanked that he has preserved my life to hear from you and others of your actual consecration as a missionary bishop of the holy catholic church and may he enable you by his grace and the powerful assistance of his spirit to bring to his faith and fear very many who have not known him and to keep and preserve in it many others who already profess and call themselves christians  i was too ill to be present at the whole service on sunday but i attended the holy sacrament and hope to do so tomorrow  we have with us our dear sarah selwyn who came on thursday she came in the most kind and affectionate spirit the first visit that she could make that she might if possible see me i will go and see him before he dies  what delight this has been to me you may easily imagine and what talk and what anecdotes we have had about you and all your circle for though your letters have all along let us in wonderfully into your daily life yet there were many things to be filled up which we have now seen more clearly and more perfectly recollect as long as our lives are spared  what at present intensely fills our hearts and minds is all that took place on st matthias day and the day or two before and after passages and circumstances there were which it is almost wonderful that you all could respectively bear some affecting one the more and some the other but the absorbing feeling that a great work was then done and the ardent trust and prayer that it might turn out to the glory of god and the good of mankind supported every one i have no doubt  it was about one of those days that i was first informed of the nature of the complaint which had just been discovered and which is bringing me gradually to the grave  trinity sundayi am just returned from receiving the holy sacrament  you will do so the same in a few hours and they may well be joined together and probably the last that you and i shall receive together in this world  my time is probably very short dear sarah will hereafter tell you more particulars of these few days  dear joan and fanny are watching me continually it is hard work for them continually and most uncertain but in my mind it cannot be very long  jem is here helping them continually but his wifes mother is grievously ill at a relations in gloucestershire and i will not have him withdrawn from her  i hope that next week she may be removed to jems new cottage next hyde park and then they joan and fanny will watch me and jem on a telegraph notice may come to me  if i dare express a hope it is that this state of things may not last long  but i have no desire to express any hope at all the matter is in the hands of a good god who will order all things as is best i would write more but i am under the serious impression that i shall be dead before this letter reaches you  may our almighty god three persons blessed for evermore grant that we may meet hereafter in a blessed eternity   one more letter was written   feniton court honiton june 12 1861  oh my dearest right reverend wellbeloved son how i thank god that it has pleased him to save my life until i heard of the actual fact of your being ordained and consecrated as i have said more than once since i heard of it  may it please him to prolong your life very many years and to enable you to fulfil all those purposes for which you have been now consecrated and that you may see the fruit of your labour of love before he calls you to his rest in heaven  but if not may you have laid such foundations for the spread of gods word throughout the countries committed to your charge that when it pleases god to summon you hence you may have a perfect consciousness of having devoted all your time and labour and so far as you are concerned have advanced all the works as fastly and as securely as it seemed fit to your great assister the holy spirit that they should be advanced  only conceive that an old judge of seventytwo cast out of his own work by infirmity should yet live to have a son in the holy office of bishop all men rejoicing around him and so indeed they do rejoice around me mingling their loving expressions at my illness and approaching death  i shall endeavour to write at intervals between this and july mail it tries me to write much at a time  your loving father  j patteson   the calm of these letters was the pervading spirit of feniton  with perfect cheerfulness did the aged judge await the summons aware that he carried the sentence of death within himself and that the manner of his summons would probably be in itself suddennamely one of the choking fits that increased in frequency  he lived on with his children and relations round him spending his time in his usual manner so far as his strength permittedbright kind sunny as ever and not withdrawing his interest from the cares and pleasures of others but glad to talk more deeply though still peacefully of his condition and his hopes  one thing only troubled him  once he said and with tears in his eyes to his beloved brotherinlaw sir john coleridge woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you adding to this effect alas  that this has been my lot without my deserts  it pains me now  but as this popularity had come of no selfseeking nor attempt to win applause it was a grief that was soon dispelled  perhaps if there was one strong wish it was to hear of his sons actually having been received into the order of bishops and that gratification was granted to him  the letters with the record of consecration arrived in time to be his whitsuntide joyjoy that he still participated in the congregation for though not able to be at church for the whole service he still was always present at the celebration of the holy communion  on the day the letters came there was great peace and a kind of awful joy on all the household  for many weeks past sir john had not attempted to read family prayers but on this evening he desired his daughters to let him do so  where in the prayer for missionaries he had always mentioned the absent member of this family he added in a clear tone especially for john coleridge patteson missionary bishop  that was the fathers one note of triumph the last time he ever led the household prayers  in a day or two mrs selwyn came to him and he wrote the following to the bishop of new zealand   feniton court may 24 1861  my very dear friendhere i am and i have with me your dear and good wife who arrived yesterday  she looks well and i trust is so she has arranged her visits so as to come to me as soon as possible i will go and see him before he die and i feel sensibly the kindness of it  what a mercy is it that my life should have been preserved to receive from my dear son coley and from you by letter the account of his having been consecrated by you as bishop of the true catholic church  there were accounts of that most impressive service which had i been present would have i fear sent me to the floor and you and coley must have had difficulty in holding up at those feeling statements of your having received him at my old hands  when you so received him it was known i was satisfied that his heart was really fixed on this missionary workthat he felt a call to it  i believe you know and i am sure god knows that i had not the most distant notion in my mind that it would lead to his becoming a bishop nor do i now rejoice in the result simply on account of the honour of the office but because my confidence in the honesty and sincerity of his then feelings has been justified and that it has pleased god to endow him with such abundant graces  may it please god that you should continue together in your respective governments in his church many years and that we may all meet together in his kingdom above  when i parted with him i did not expect to see his face on earth yet perhaps i hardly expected that our separation would be so soon though i am in my seventysecond year  but in february i discovered these swellings in my throat which humanly speaking could only be cured by iodine  iodine has failed and other attempts at a cure fail also and it is only a question of time when the soul will be delivered from the burthen of the flesh  so indeed it is with all human beings but it is one thing to know this as a general proposition and another to know that the particular minister of death has hold of you and that you are really only living from day to day  for all your many kindnesses to all of us and to my son i thank you from the very bottom of my soul and pray that we may meet hereafter through the merits and for the sake of our blessed mediator and redeemer jesus christ our lord that as we have striven on earth to be followers of him and his glory so we may be partakers of it in heaven  your loving friend  j patteson   the july mail was without a letter from the father  the end had come in the early morning of june 28 1861 with a briefer less painful struggle than had been thought probable and the great sound wise tender heart had ceased to beat  there is no need to dwell on the spontaneous honours that all of those who had ever been connected with him paid to the good old judge when he was laid beside his muchloved wife in feniton churchyard  bishop sumner of winchester the friend of his boyhood read the funeral service  his works do follow him and we turn to that work of his sons in which assuredly he had his part since one word of his would have turned aside the course that had brought such blessing on both had he not accepted the summons even as zebedee when he was left by the lake side while his sons became fishers of men  unknowing of the tidings in reserve for him the bishop was on his voyage following the usual course hearing at anaiteum that a frightful mortality had prevailed in many of these southern islands measles had been imported by a trader and had in many cases brought on dysentery and had swept away a third of mr geddies anaiteum flock  mr gordons letters had spoken of it as equally fatal in erromango and there were reports of the same as well as of famine and war in nengone  god will give me men in his time for could i be cut up into five pieces already i would be living at nengone lifu mai mota and bauro was the comment on this visit and this need of men inspired a letter to his uncle edward on a day dear to the etonian heart   schooner dunedin 60 tons  in sight of erromango new hebrides june 4 1861  my dear tutornaturally i think of eton and of you especially to day  i hope you have as fine a day coming on for the cricketmatch and for surley as i have here  thermometer 81° tanna and erromango with their rugged hilly outlines breaking the line of the bright sparkling horizon  i managed to charter the vessel for the voyage just in time to escape cold weather in new zealand  she is slow but sound the captain a teetotaller and crew respectable in all ways  so the voyage though lengthy is pleasant  i have some six or seven classes to take for they speak as many more languages and i get a little time for reading and writing but not much  i need not tell you how heavily this new responsibility presses on me as i see the islands opening and at present feel how very difficult it must be to obtain men to occupy this opening  true we have not to contend with subtle and highlyelaborated systems of false religion  it is the ignorantia purae negationis comparatively speaking in some of the islands yet generally there is a settled system of some kind observed among them and in the banks islands an extraordinarily developed religion which enters into every detail of social and domestic life and is mixed up with the daily life of every person in the archipelago  i think therefore that men are needed who have what i may call strong religious common sense to adapt christianity to the wants of the various nations that live in melanesia without compromising any truth of doctrine or principle of conductmen who can see in the midst of the errors and superstitions of a people whatever fragment of truth or symptom of a yearning after something better may exist among them and make that the point dappui upon which they may build up the structure of christian teaching  men moreover of industry they must be for it is useless to talk of picking up languages  of course in a few days a man may learn to talk superficially and inaccurately on a few subjects but to teach christianity a man must know the language well and this is learnt only by hard work  then again unless a man can dispense with what we ordinarily call comfort or luxuries to a great extent and knock about anywhere in melanesian huts he can hardly do much work in this mission  the climate is so warm that to my mind it quite supplies the place of the houses clothing and food of old days yet a man cannot accommodate himself to it all at once  i dont say that it came naturally to me five years ago as it does now when i feel at home anywhere and cease to think it odd to do things which i suppose you would think very extraordinary indeed  but most of allfor this makes all easymen are wanted who really do desire in their hearts to live for god and the world to come and who have really sought to sit very loosely to this world  the enjoyment and the happiness and the peace all come and that abundantly but there is a condition and the first rub is a hard one and lasts a good while  naturally buoyant spirits the gift of a merry heart are a great help for oftentimes a man may have to spend months without any white man within hundreds of miles and it is very depressing to live alone in the midst of heathenism  but there must be many many fellows pulling up to surley tonight who may be well able to pull together with one on the pacificyoung fellows whose enthusiasm is not mere excitement of animal spirits and whose pluck and courage are given them to stand the roughnesses such as they are of a missionary life  for dear uncle if you ever talk to any old pupil of yours about the work dont let him suppose that it is consistent with ease and absence of anxiety and work  when on shore at kohimarama we live very cosily as i think  some might say we have no society very simple fare c i dont think any man would really find it so but in the islands i dont wish to conceal from anyone that measured by the rule of the english gentlemans household there is a great difference  why should it however be measured by this standard  i can truly say that we have hitherto always had what is necessary for health and what does one need more though i like more as much as anyone  how you will wonder at the news of my consecration and indeed well you may  i would indeed that there were a dozen men out here under whom i was working if only they were such men as the primate would have chosen to the work  but it is done now and i know i must not shrink from it  never did i need the love and prayers of my dear relations and friends as i do now  already difficulties are rising up around me and i am so little fit to be a leader of work like this  dont forget dear tutor your old pupil who used to copy the dear bishops letters in your study from anaiteum erromango c and little thought that he would write from these islands to you himself the missionary bishop  with kind love to all  your loving old pupil and nephew  j c patteson missionary bishop   this thoughtful and beautiful letter was written in sight of erromango a sandalwood station whence a trader might be found to take charge of it  the ink was scarcely dry before the full cost of carrying the gospel among the heathen was brought before the writer not only houses and brethren must be given up but the yea and his own life also was now to be exemplified almost before his eyes  the erromaugo mission like that of anaiteum came from the scottish kirk  mr and mrs gordon as has been seen had been visited on every voyage of the southern cross during their three years residence there and there was a warm regard between them and the bishop  it was then a great shock to hear a nengone man call out from a sandalwood vessel lying in dillons bay that they had both been killed  it was but too true  the erromango people had been little inclined to listen to mr gordons warnings and he a young and eager man had told them that to persevere in their murders and idolatries would bring a judgment upon them  when therefore the scourge of sickness came as at anaiteum they connected him with it and it was plain from his diary that he had for some months known his life to be in danger but he had gone about them fearlessly like a brave man doing his best for the sick  on may 20 he was in a little wood putting up a house instead of one that had been blown down by a hurricane and he had sent his few faithful pupils to get grass for the thatch  nine natives from a village about three hours walk distant came to the house where his wife was and asked for him  she said he was in the little wood they went thither and while eight hid themselves in the bush one went forward and asked for some calico  mr gordon took a bit of charcoal and wrote on a bit of wood directions to his wife to give the bearer some cotton but the man insisted that he must come himself to give out some medicine for a sick man  mr gordon complied walking in front as far as the place where lay the ambush when the man struck him with a tomahawk on the spine and he fell with a loud scream while the others leaping out fell upon him with blows that must have destroyed life at once yelling and screaming over him  another went up to the house  mrs gordon had come out asking what the shouts meant  look there he said and as she turned her head he struck her between the shoulders and killed her as soon as she had fallen  another native had in the meantime rushed down the hill to the sandalwood station half a mile off on the beach and the trader arming his natives came up too late to do more than prevent the murderers from carrying off the bodies or destroying the house  the husband and wife were buried in the same grave the natives fenced it round and now on june 7 eighteen days after bishop patteson read the burial service over it with many solemn and anxious thoughts respecting the population now reduced to 2500 and in a very wild condition  at mai the bishop spent two hours the next day and brought away one old scholar and one new one  at tariko where he had been three years before with the primate the episcopal hat brought the greeting bishop as the people no doubt thought the wearer identical  of ambrym there is a characteristic sentence as we left the little rock pool where i had jumped ashore leaving for prudence sake the rest behind me in the boat one man raised his bow and drew it then unbent it then bent it again but apparently others were dissuading him from letting fly the arrow the boat was not ten yards off i dont know why he did so but we must try to effect more frequent landings  on june 12 mota was reached and the next morning the mission party landed warmly welcomed by the inhabitants  the house was found safely standing and nearly weatherproof  june 13ththis morning i put up the framework for another small house where i shall put wadrokala his childwife and many of our boxes  we had to carry up the timber first from the beach and it was rather hot work as also the carpentering as i chose a place for the house where no falling breadfruit or branches of trees would hurt it and the sun was so hot that it almost burnt my hand when i took up a handful of nails that had been lying for ten minutes in the sun  so our picnic life begins again and that favourably  i feel the enjoyment of the glorious view and climate and my dear lads tagalana and parenga from bauro are with me the rest in port patteson c coming over in the vessel tomorrow which i shall then discharge  i see that the people are very friendly they all speak of your breadfruit tree your property  the house had not been entered a keg of nails inside it not touched  tagalanas father is dead  his first words to me were oh that the word of god had come in old times to mota i should not then cry so much about him  yes it is true i know i must be thankful it is come now and i must remember that and try to help others who may die too before they believe it  yes i am quite your child now  yes one father for us all in heaven  you my father here  yes i stop always with you unless you send me away  they ask me with whom i shall live now i say with the bishop  how i was praising and rejoicing in my heart as the dear boy was speaking yes i am feeling calm again now  when people die at mota you know they make a great shouting but soon forget the dead person  but i am able to be quiet and calm now as you talk to me about god and jesus christ  yes he rose again  death is not the end  i know you said it is for those who repent and believe in christ the door to enter into life eternal  how different it all seems then  when you read this you will say thank god that i sent him out to melanesia with my blessing on his head  i too may see tagalana one day with him who is the father of us all  one soul won to christ as i hope and believe by his love and power and if in any degree by my ministry to god be the praise  the comfort sent home to the sisters with the letter respecting this voyage is   mota june 14 1861  now dear joan dont any of you think too much about the murder of mr and mrs gordon as if my life was exposed to the same kind of risk  certainly it is not endangered here  it may be true that at places where i am not known some sudden outbreak may occur but humanly speaking there are not many places that as yet i am able to visit where i realise the fact of any danger being run  yet it may happen that some poor fellow who has a good cause to think ill of white men or some mischievous badly disposed man may let fly a random arrow or spear some day  if so you will not so very much wonder nor be so very greatly grieved  every clergyman runs at least as great a risk among the smallpox and fevers of town parishes  think of uncle james in the cholera at thorverton  so with the dunedin dismissed bishop patteson mr pritt mr kerr and their pupils recommenced their residence at mota  the banks islanders returned to their homes and when the bishop came to aroa tagalanas native place three weeks lately the little fellow received him affectionately cooked yams fetched mats and was not ashamed before his own people to kneel down and join audibly in hymn and prayer  the people begged for wadrokala or some other teacher to be placed among them  the journal continues  on friday at 830 i started not quite knowing whither i should go but soon saw that i could fetch round the south end of vanua lava which was well  the sea when it comes through the passage between mota and valua is heavy but the boat had great way on her sailing very fast so that i could steer her well and we did not take very long crossing to the small reef islands  i passed between pakea and vanua lava dudley passage and then we had unexpectedly a very heavy sea a strong tide up  i did not like it but thank god all went well  one very heavy sea in particular i noticed which broke some twenty yards ahead and about the same distance astern of us while the exact part of it which came down upon us was only a black wall of water over which we rode lightly and dry  i think that it might have swamped us had it broken upon the boat  my boat is an open fouroared one 26 feet long and about five wide strong but light  she sails admirably with a common lug sail  i had one made last summer very large with two reefs so that i can reduce it to as small a sail as i please  by 4 or 5 pm i neared aruas in the bay on the west side of vanua lava the same crowd as usual on the beach but i did not haul the boat up  i had a grapnel and dropped it some fifty yards from the beach  somehow i did not much like the manner of some of the people they did not at night come into the ogamal or mens common eating and sleeping house as before and i overheard some few remarks which i did not quite likesomething about the unusual sickness being connected with this new teachingi could not be quite sure as i do not know the dialect of aruas  there were however several who were very friendly and the great majority were at least quiet and left us to ourselves  the next morning i started at about eight buying two small pigs for two hatchets and yams and taro and dried bread fruit for fishhooks  i gave one young man a piece of iron for his attention to us  as we pulled away one elderly man drew his bow and the women and children ran off into the bush here as everywhere almost in these islands growing quite thickly some twenty yards above highwater mark  the man did not let fly his arrow i cannot tell why this small demonstration took place  when an arrow was pointed at him it was bishop pattesons custom to look the archer full in the face with his bright smile and in many more cases than are here hinted at that look of cheery confidence and goodwill made the weapon drop  after a few more visits to the coasts of this archipelago the boat returned to mota where mr pritt and mr kerr had kept school every day besides getting the station into excellent order and beauty their presence at the headquarters left the bishop free to circulate in the villages sleeping in the ogamals where he could collect the men  they always seemed pleased and interested and their pugnacious habits were decidedly diminishing though their superstitious practices and observances were by no means dropped  the diary on july 24 thus speaks of the way of life which however was again telling on the health of the party  i am so accustomed to sleeping about anywhere that i take little or no account of thirty forty fifty naked fellows lying sitting sleeping round me  someone brings me a native mat someone else a bit of yam a third brings a cocoanut so i get my supper put down the mat like a very thin doormat on the earth roll up my coat for a pillow and make a very good night of it  i have had deafness in my right ear again for some days no pain with it but it is inconvenient  several of our lads have had attacks of fever and ague wadrokala and his child of a wife bum a bauro boy c  the island is not at all unhealthy but natives cannot be taught caution  i thank god am in robust health very weatherbeaten  i think my bishops dress would look quite out of keeping with such a face and pair of hands  there is much as usual in such cases to encourage and to humble us some few people seem to be in earnest  the great majority do their best to make me think they are listening  meanwhile much goes on in the island as of old  sunday july 28th 1145 ami have much anxiety just now  at this moment wadrokala is in an ague fit five or six others of my party kept going by quinine and port wine and one or other sickening almost daily  henry hrahuena of lifu i think dying from what i know noti think inflammation of the brain induced possibly by exposure to the sun though i have not seen him so exposed and it is a thing i am very careful about with them  i do what i can in following the directions of medical books but it is so hard to get a word from a native to explain symptoms c besides my ear is now like last year really painful and for two nights i have had little sleep and feel stupid and getting a wornout feeling  with all this i am conscious that it is but a temporary depression a day or two may bring out the bright colours again  henry may recover by gods mercy the boys become hearty again my ear get right  at present i feel that i must rub on as i can from hour to hour  if i find from experience that natives of melanesia taken to a different island however fertile dry and apparently healthy do seem to be affected by it i must modify my plans try as soon as possible to have more winter schools and what is of more consequence i must reconsider the whole question of native teachers if a great amount of sickness is to be the result of gathering scholars around me at an island i could do perhaps more single handed in health and with no one to look after than with twenty fellows of whom half are causing continual anxiety on the score of health  now were i alone i should be as brisk as a bee but i feel weighed down somewhat with the anxiety about all these fellows about me  i must balance considerations and think it out  it requires great attention  it is at times like these that i experience some trials usually my life is as you know singularly free from them  july 31sthenry died on sunday about 4 am  wadrokala is better the boys are all better  i have had much real pain and weariness from sleepless nights owing to the small tumour in my ear  what a sheet of paper for you to read  and yet it is not so sad either the boys were patient and good wadrokala takes his ague attacks like a man and about henry i had great comfort  he was about eighteen or nineteen as i suppose the son of the great enchanter in lifu in old timesthe hereditary high priest of lifu indeed  he was a simpleminded gentle good fellow not one probably who would have been able to take a distinct line as a teacher yet he might have done good service with a good teacher  we found that afternoon a slate on which he had written down some thoughts when first taken ill showing that he felt that he was sick unto death  very full of comfort were his written as well as his spoken words  on august 1 while the bauro scholars were writing answers to questions on the lords prayer a party of men and women arrived headed by a man with a native scarf over his shoulders  they had come to be taught bringing provisions with them and eating them men and women together a memorable infringement of one of the most unvarying customs of the banks inhabitants and from the conversation with them and with others bishop patteson found that the work of breaking down had been attained that of building up had to be begun they must learn that leaving off heathen practices was not the same thing as adopting the religion of christ and the kind of work which external influences had cut short in lifu had to be begun with them  soon i think the great difficulty must be met in mota of teaching the christians social and domestic life to people disposed to give up much of their old practices  this is the point at which i suppose most missions have broken down  it is a great blessing indeed to reach it but the building up of converts is the harder work  here for example a population of 1500 people at present they know all that is necessary for the cultivation of yams c they build houses sufficient for the purpose of their present life they are giving up fighting losingfaith in their old charms and contrivances for compassing the death of their enemies they will very likely soon be at peace throughout the whole island  well then they will be very idle talk infinite scandal indulge in any amount of gluttony professing to believe our religion their whole life will contradict that profession unless their whole social and domestic life be changed and a new character infused into them  it would be a great mistake to suppose that the english aspect of the christians social life is necessarily adapted to such races as these  the oriental tendencies of their minds the wholly different circumstances of their lives climate absence of all poverty or dependence upon others c will prevent them from ever becoming a little english community but not i trust their becoming a christian community but how shall i try to teach them to become industrious persevering honest tidy clean careful with children and all the rest of it what a different thing from just going about and teaching them the first principles of christianity  the second stage of a mission is the really difficult one  a few days after the foregoing observations were written hms cordelia a war steamer entered port patteson and captain hume himself came across by boat to mota to communicate to bishop patteson his instructions to offer him a cruise in the vessel render him any assistance in his power in the solomon islands and return him to any island he might desire  letters from the primate assumed that the proposal should be accepted it was an opportunity of taking home the bauro and grera boys moreover there was a quarrel between english and natives to be enquired into at ysabel island where the bishop could be useful as interpreter and as he could leave his two friends to carry on the school at mota he went on board and very good it was for him in the depressed state of health brought on by rude bed and board to be the guest on board a queens ship and under good medical care  for the cordelia had brought out the letters which gave the first intimation of his fathers state and without the privacy and freedom from toil and responsibility he could hardly have borne up under the blow  the first day was bad enough a long busy day on shore with just one letter read and the dull heavy sensation of an agony that was to come as soon as i could be alone to think arrangements had to be made and there was not one solitary moment till 9 pm in the cabin when this loving and beloved son could shut himself in kneel down and recover composure to open the two letters in his fathers hand  he wrote it allhis whole heartas of old to the father who had ever shared his inmost thoughts  it may be that as i write your blessed spirit at rest in paradise may know me more truly than ever you did on earth and yet the sorrow of knowing how bitter it is within may never be permitted to ruffle your everlasting peace  i may never see you on earth  all thought of such a joy is gone  i did really cling to it i see it now when most i thought i was quite content to wait for the hope of the great meeting  i will try to remember and to do what you say about all business matters  i will pray god to make me more desirous and more able to follow the holy example you leave behind  oh that the peace of god may be given to me also when i come to die though how may i dare to hope for such an end so full of faith and love and the patient waiting for christ  i must go on with my work  this very morning i was anxious passing shoal water with the captain and master beside me and appealing to me as pilot  i must try to be of some use in the ship  i must try to turn to good account among the islands this great opportunity probably elasticity of mind will come again now for very pain of body  oh how much more sorrow and heavy weight on my heart  i am quite worn out and weary  it seems as if the light were taken from me as if it was no longer possible to work away so cheerily when i no longer have you to write to about it all no longer your approval to seek your notice to obtain  i must go on writing to you my own dearest father even as i go on praying for you  it is a great comfort to me though i feel that in all human probability you are to be thought of now as one of the blessed drawn wholly within the veil  oh that we may all dwell together hereafter for his blessed sake who died for us  now more than ever your loving and dutiful son c  such another letter was written to his sister fanny but it is dated four days later when he was better in health and was somewhat recovered from the first shock besides which he felt his office of comforter when writing to her  so the letter is more cheerful and is a good deal taken up with the endeavour to assure the sisters of his acquiescence in whatever scheme of life they might adopt and willingness that if it were thought advisable feniton court should be sold  this is all cold and heartless he says but i must try and make my view pretty clear  towards the end occurs the following  last night my slight feverish attack over my ears comfortable with the feeling of health and ease returning i lay awake thought of dear uncle frank and then for a long time of dear mamma  how plainly i saw her face and dear dear uncle james and i wondered whether dear dear father was already among them in paradise  it is not often that i can fasten down my mind to think continuously upon those blessed ones i am too tired or too busy and this climate you know is enervating  but last night i was very happy and seemed to be very near them  the evening lesson set me off 1 john iii how wonderful it is  but all the evening i had been reading my book of prayers and meditations  do you know fan at times the thought comes upon me with a force almost overpowering that i am a bishop and that i must not shrink from believing that i am called to a special work  i dont think that i dwell morbidly on this but it is an awful thought  and then i feel just the same as of old and dont reach out more or aim more earnestly at amendment of life and strive after fresh degrees of enlightenment and holiness  but probably i have to learn the lesson which it may be only sickness will teach me of patient waiting that god will accomplish his own work in his own time  some of this is almost too sacred for publication and yet it is well that it should be seen how realising the communion of saints blessed the solitary man who had given up home  the next letter is to sir j t coleridge   hms cordelia september 11 1861  my dearest uncleit is now nearly five weeks since i learnt from my letters of march and april brought to me by this ship the very precarious state of my dear father  he has never missed a mail since we have been parted never once and he wrote as he always did both in march and april  i had read a letter from the good primate first because i had to make up my mind whether i could as i was desired take a cruise in this vessel and in his letter i heard of my dear fathers state  with what reverence i opened his letters  with what short earnest prayers to god that i might have strength supplied and resignation i had kept them till the last  all day at mota i had been too busy to read any but the primates letters  i had many matters to arrangeand it was not until night that i could quietly read my letters in the captains cabin  my dear fathers words seem to come to me like a voice from another world  i think from what he says and what they all say that already he has departed to be with christ  i think of him and my dear mother and those dear uncles james and frank so specially dear to me and others gone before  i think of all that he has been to me and yet how can i be unhappy  the great shock to me was long overpast it is easy for me to dwell on his gain rather than my loss yet how i shall miss his wise loving letters and all the unrestrained delights of our correspondence  it is not with me as with those dear sisters or with old jem theirs is the privilege of witnessing the beauty and holiness of his life to the end and theirs the sorrow of learning to live without him  yet i feel that the greatest perhaps of all the pleasures of this life is gone  how i did delight in writing to him and seeking his approval of what i was about  how i read and reread his letters entering so entirely into my feelings understanding me so well in my life so strangely different from what it used to be  well it should make me feel more than ever that i have but one thing to live forthe good if so it may please god of these melanesian islands  i cannot say for you will like to know my feelings that i felt so overwhelmed with this news as not to be able to go about my usual business  yet the rest on board the vessel has been very grateful to me  the quiet cheerfulness and briskness will all come again as i think and yet i think too that i shall be an older and more thoughtful man by reason of this  there has been reported a row at ysabel island one of the solomon group eighteen months ago  this vessel a screw steamer ten guns and a large pivot gun came to enquire with orders from the commodore of the station to call at mota and see me and request me to go with the vessel if i could find time to do so adding that the vessel was to take me to any island which i might wish to be returned to  now i have long wished to indoctrinate captains of menofwar with our notions of the right way to settle disputes between natives and traders  secondly i had a passage free with my solomon islanders and consequently all october and half november i may devote to working up carefully dv the banks and new hebrides group without being under the necessity of going down to the solomon islands  thirdly i had an opportunity of going further to the westward than i had ever been before and of seeing new ground fourthly the primate i found assumed that i should go  so here i am in great clover of course the change from mota to manofwar life being amusing enough  barring some illness slight attacks of fever i have enjoyed myself very much  the seeing ysabel island is a real gain  i had time to acquire some 200 words and phrases of the language which signify to me a great deal more  the language is a very remarkable one very polynesian yet in some respects distinguished from the polynesian and most closely related to melanesian dialects  i need not enter into all this  it is my business you know to work at such things and a word or two often tells me now a good deal of the secrets of a languagethe prominent forms affixes c c the way in which it is linked on to other dialects by peculiar terminations the law by which the transposition of vowels and consonants is governed in general  all these things soon come out so i am very sanguine about soon if i live seeing my way in preparing the way for future missionaries in the far west  but i must not forget that i have some islands to visit in the next month or two where the people are very wild so that i of all people have least reason to speculate about what i may hope to do a year hence  the real anxiety is in the making up my own mind whether or not i ought to lower the boat in such a sea way whether or not i ought to swim ashore among these fellows crowded there on the narrow beach c  when my mind is made up it is not so difficult then  but humanly speaking there are but few islands now where i realise the fact of there being any risk at very many i land with confidence  yet i could enumerate i dare say fiveandtwenty which we have not visited at all or not regularly and where i must be careful as also in visiting different parts of islands already known to us in part  poor poor people who can see them and not desire to make known to them the words of life  i may never forget the bishops words in the consecration serviceyour office is in the highest sense to preach the gospel to the poor and then his eye glanced over the row of melanesians sitting near me  how strange that i can write all this when one heavy sense of trouble is hanging vaguely over me  and yet you will be thankful that i can think as i trust heartily of my work and that my interest is in no way lessened  it ought to be increased  yet i scarce realise the fact of being a bishop though again it does not seem unnatural  i cant explain what i mean  i suppose the fact that i knew for so long before that it must come some day if i lived makes the difference now  i dont think however that your words will come true of my appearing in shovel hat c at heaths court some fine day  it is very improbable that i shall ever see the northern hemisphere unless i see it in the longitude of new guinea  i must try to send a few island shells to m b and co those little ones must not grow up and i am sure that you all do not suffer them to grow up without knowing something about old cousin coley tumbling about in a little ship albeit at present in a war steamer at the other end of the world  seriously dear uncle as they grow older it may be some help for them to hear of these poor melanesians and of our personal intercourse with them so to speak  i have but little hope of hearing if i return safe to new zealand at the end of november that this disastrous war is over  i fear that the original error has been overlaid by more recent events forgotten amongst them  the maori must suffer the country must suffer  confession of a fault in an individual is wrong in a state indeed the rights of the case are and perhaps must be unknown to people at a distance  we have no difficulty here in exposing the fallacies and duplicities of the authors of the war but we cant expect and i see that it must be so people in england to understand the many details  to begin with a man must know and that well maori customs their national feeling c  it is all known to one above and that is our only hope now  may he grant us peace and wisdom for the time to come  i have been reading helps again this voyage a worthy book and specially interesting to me  how much there is i shall be glad to read about  what an age it is  america how is that to end  india china japan africa  i have jowetts books and essays and reviews  how much i should like to talk with you and john in an evening at heaths court about all that such books reveal of intellectualism at home  one does feel that there is conventionalism and unreality in the hereditary passive acceptance of much that people think they believe  but how on jowetts system can we have positive teaching at all  can the thing denoted by entering into the mind of christ or st paul be substituted for teaching the catechism  not so writes my dear father in the depth of his humility and simplicity writing to me what a father could scarcely say to a son but our peculiar circumstances have brought this blessing to me that i think he has often so reamed out his heart to me in the warmth of his love to a son he was never again to see in the body that i know him better even than i should have done had i remained at home  so wonderful was my dearest fathers calmness when he wrote on the 24th of april that if he was alive to write again in may i think it not impossible that he may allude to these matters  if so what golden words to be treasured up by me  i have all his letters  you will see or have seen him laid by my dear mothers side  they dwell together now with him in paradise  goodbye my dearest uncle  should god spare your life my letters will be more frequent to you now  my kindest love to aunt  your affectionate and grateful nephew  j c patteson missionary bishop   there is little more record of this voyage  there was less heart and spirit than usual for the regular journalizing letter but the five weeks voyage had been most beneficial in restoring health and energy and it had one very important effect upon the mission for it was here that lieutenant capel tilly rn became so interested in the mission and its head as to undertake the charge of the future southern cross  the cordelia was about to return to england where after she was paid off mr tilly would watch over the building of the new vessel on a slightly larger scale than the first would bring her out to kohimarama and act as her captain  so great a boon as his assistance did much to cheer and encourage the bishop who was quite well again when he landed at mota on september 17 and found mr pritt convalescent after a touch of ague and mr kerr so ill as to be glad to avail himself of captain humes kind offer to take him back to auckland in the cordelia  probably all were acclimatised by this time for we hear of no more illness before the sea breeze with mr dudley came on the 10th of october to take the party off  he saysthe bishop and mr pritt both looked pale and worn  there were however signs in the island of a great advance in the state of things of the previous year  an admirable schoolroom had been built and in the open space cleared in front of it every evening some hundred people would gather the older ones chatting the younger ones being initiated in the mysteries of leapfrog wrestling and other english games until prayer time when all stood in a circle singing a mota hymn and the bishop prayed with and for them  that voyage was not a long one  we did not go to the solomon islands and the groups to the north but we worked back through the new hebrides carefully visiting them  mr dudley had brought letters that filled the bishops heart to overflowing and still it was to his father that he wrote it seems as if you had lived to see us all as it were fixed in our several positions and could now depart in peace according to his word  the agony and bitterness seem to have been met and struggled through as it were in those first days on board the cordelia  in this second letter there is infinite peace and thankfulness and so there still was when at norfolk island the tidings of the good old mans death met him as described in the ensuing letter   sea breeze one hundred miles southeast of norfolk island 8 am  my dearest sistersjoy and grief were strangely mingled together while i was on shore in norfolk island from 6 pm saturday to 8 pm sunday yesterday  i was sitting with mr nobbs benjamin dudley the only other person present when he said we have seen in our papers from sydney the news of the death of your revered father  he concluded that i must have known of it  how wonderful it seems to me that it did not come as a great shock i showed by my face naturally that i had not known before that god had taken him unto himself but i could answer quite calmly i thank god  do not be distressed at telling me suddenly as you see you have done inadvertently  i knew he could not live long  we all knew that he was only waiting for christ  and dear dear john and fan how merciful god has been  the last part of his letter to me of date june 25 only three days before his call came so that i know and praise god for it that he was spared protracted suffering  shall i desire or wish to be more sorry than i am  shall i try to make myself grieve and feel unhappy  oh no it is of gods great mercy that i still feel happy and thankful for i cannot doubt the depth of my love to him who has indeed been and that more than ever of late the one to whom i clung in the world  i could be quiet at night sleeping in mr nobbss house and yet i could not at once compose myself to think it all over as i desired to do  and then i had much to do and here was the joy mingling with the sorrow  for the norfolk island people have come to see how wise was the primates original plan and now they much desire to connect themselves more closely with the mission  mr and mrs nobbs desire their son edwin who was two years at the governors at sydney and is now eighteen and a half years old to be given wholly to us so said simon young of his boy fisher and so did three others  all spoke simply and without excitement but with deep feeling  i thought it right to say that they should remain at norfolk island at present that we all might prove them whether they were indeed bent upon this work that we might be able to trust that god had indeed called them  to the lads i said this is a disappointment i know but it is good for you to have to bear trials  you must take time to count the cost  it is no light thing to be called to the work of a teacher among the heathen  in giving up your present wish to go immediately you are obeying your parents and others older than yourselves and your cheerful obedience to them is the best evidence that you wish to act upon a sense of duty and not only from impulse but dont think i wish to discourage you  i thank him who has put the good desire into your hearts  prove yourselves now by special prayer and meditation  then came the happy blessed service the whole population present every confirmed person communicating my voice trembling at the fifth commandment and the end of the prayer for the church militant my heart very full and thankful  i preached to them extempore as one can preach to no other congregation from the lesson jesus gone to be the guest of a man that is a sinner the consequences that would result in us from his vouchsafing to tabernacle among us and as displayed in the parable of the pounds the use of gods gifts of health influence means then specifying the use of gods highest gifts of children to be trained to his glory quoting 1 samuel i 27 28 lent to the lord i spoke with an earnestness that felt strange to me at the time  simon young said afterwards my wife could not consent months ago to fishers going away but she has told me now that she consents she cant withhold him with the thought of holy hannah in her mind and i felt as if i might apply though not in the first sense the prophecy instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children  to add to all mr nobbs said i have quite altered my mind about the melanesian school i quite see that i was mistaken and the people are considering how to connect themselves closely with us  you may imagine dear joan that joy and grief made a strange yet not unhappy tumult in my mind  i came away at 3 pm the wind being very fair hoping to revisit them and by the bishop of tasmanias desire hold a confirmation in six months time  how i am longing to hear the last record of the three days intervening between june 25 and 28 you may well imagine already thank god four months have passed and you are recovering from the great shock  yours is a far harder trial than mine  may god comfort and bless us all and bring us to dwell with our dear parents in heaven for our blessed lords sake  your very loving brother  j c patteson   and this most touching account from within is supplemented by the following by mr dudley from without   he took it the tidings of his fathers death quite calmly evidently it had been long expected and prepared for  he was even cheerful in his quiet grave way  in the evening there was singing got up for him by some of the norfolk islanders in one of the large rooms of the old barracks  he enjoyed it and after it had gone on some time he thanked them in a few touching words that went home i am sure to the hearts of many of them and then we all knelt down and he prayed extempore  i wish i had kept the words of that prayer everyone was affected knowing what was then occupying his mind but we were still more so next morning at the service in church  his voice had that peculiarly low and sweet tone which always came into it when he was in great anxiety or sorrow but his appeal to the congregation was inspiring to the last degree  it was the twenty third sunday after trinity and the subject he took was from the second lesson the parable of the pounds in st luke xix and so pointed out the difficulties between the reception of a talent and the use of it  he showed that the fact of peoples children growing up as wild and careless as heathen was no proof that no grace had been bestowed upon them on the contrary in the baptized it was there but it had never been developed and then came the emphatic assertion the best way of employing our gifts of whatever kind children means positionis by lending them to the lord for his service and then a double blessing will be returned for that we give  hannah giving her child to the lord did she repent of it afterwards think you when she saw him serving the lord the one upright man of the house of israel  no doubt these words were founded on those heartfelt assurances which stirred his very soul within him that his own father had never for a moment regretted or mourned over the gift unto the lord which had indeed been costly but had been returned good measure pressed together and flowing over in blessing can i grieve and sorrow about my dear dear fathers blessed end are the words in a letter to myself written on the 19th  it further contained thanks for a photograph of hursley church spire and vicarage which had been taken one summer afternoon at the desire of dr moberly the present bishop of salisbury and of which i had begged a copy for him  i shall like the photograph of hursley vicarage and church the lawn and group upon it  but most shall i like to think that mr keble and i dare say dr moberly too pray for me and this mission  i need the prayers of all good people indeed i quote this sentence because it led to a correspondence with both mr keble and dr moberly which was equally prized by the holy and humble men of heart who wrote and received the letters   st andrews kohimarama november 20 1861  thank you my dearest sophy for your loving letters and all your love and devotion to him  i fear i do not write to those two dear sisters of mine as they and you all expect and wish  i long to pour it all out i get great relief in talking as at taurarua i can talk to the dear judge and lady martin  she met me with a warm loving kiss that was intended to be as homelike as possible and for a minute i could not speak and then said falteringly it has been all one great mercy to the end i have heard at norfolk island  but i feel it still pent up to a great extent and yet i have a great sense of relief  i fancy i almost hear sometimes the laboured breathing the sudden stopthe thanks be to god he has entered into his rest  what his letters are i cannot even fully say to another perhaps never fully realise myself  as i write the tears come for it needs but a little to bring them now though i suppose the world without thinks that i bear up and go on bravely  but when any little word or thought touches the feelings the sensitive rather than the intellectual part of me then i break down  and yet it seems to bring thoughts and hopes into more definite shape  how i read that magnificent last chapter of isaiah last sunday  i seemed to feel my whole heart glowing with wonder and exultation and praise  the world invisible may well be a reality to us whose dear ones there outnumber now those still in the flesh jems most beautiful most intensely affecting letter with all his thoughtfulness about the grave c fairly upset me  i let the judge and lady martin read some parts of it and they returned it saying it had quite overcome them  now all day i feel really as much as at those moments only the special circumstances give more expression at one time than at another to the inward state of mind  how i treasure up many many of his words and actions  what a history in these words all times of the day are alike to me now getting near i trust the time when it will be all day  those are the things that break me down  i see his dear face and hear him slowly and calmly saying such words of patient trust and faith and it is too much  oh that i might live as the son of such parents ought to live  and then i turn to the practical duties again and get lost in the unceasing languages and all the rest of it  now enoughbut i write what comes uppermost  your loving cousin  j c patteson   very soon after the return on the 6th december 1861 an ordination was held at st pauls auckland when the primate ordained two maori deacons and bishop patteson the rev benjamin dudley  sir william and lady martin spent part of this summer in the little cottage at kohimarama where the sailing master of the late southern cross had lived and again we have to thank her for a picture of life at st andrews  she says  the new settlement was then thought to be healthy and he and his boys alike rejoiced in the warmth of the sheltered bay after the keenness of the air at st  johns on higher ground  the place looked very pretty  the green fields and hawthorn hedges and the sleek cattle reminded one of england  as a strong contrast there was the white shelly beach and yellow sands  here the boys sunned themselves in play hours or fished on the rocks or cooked their fish at driftwood fires  on calm days one or two would skim across the blue water in their tiny canoes  one great charm of the place was the freedom and naturalness of the whole party  there was no attempt to force an overstrained piety on these wild fellows who showed their sincerity by coming with the bishop  by five in the morning all were astir and jokes and laughter and shrill unaccountable cries would rouse us up and go on all day save when school and chapel came to sober them  the bishop had not lost his eton tastes and only liked to see them play games and the little fat merryfaced lads were always on the lookout for a bit of fun with him  one evening a teadrinking was given in the hall in honour of us  the mota boys sung in twilight the story of the first arrival of the mission vessel and of their wonder at it  the air with a monotonous not unpleasing refrain reminded us of some old french canadian ditties  i remember well the excitement when the bishop sent up a fire balloon  it sailed slowly towards the sea and down rushed the whole melanesian party shrieking with delight after it  our dear friends own quarters were very tiny and a great contrast to his large airy room at st johns  he occupied a corner house in the quadrangle to be close to the boys  neither bedroom nor sittingroom was more than ten feet square  everything was orderly as was his wont  photographs of the faces and places he loved best hung on the walls  just by the door was his standing desk with folios and lexicons  a table covered with books and papers in divers languages and a chair or two completed his stock of furniture  the door stood open all day long in fine weather and the bishop was seldom alone  one or other of the boys would steal quietly in and sit down  they did not need to be amused nor did they interrupt his work  they were quite content to be near him and to get now and then a kind word or a pleasant smile  it was the habitual gentle sympathy and friendliness on his part that won the confidence of the wild timid people who had been brought up in an element of mistrust and which enabled them after a while to come and open their hearts to him  how vividly the whole scene comes back to me as i write  the bishops calm thoughtful face the dusky lads the whiteshelled square in front relieved by a mass of bright geraniums or gay creepers the little bedroom with its camp bed and medicine bottles and good books and too often in spite of our loving remonstrances an invalid shivering with ague or influenza in possession  we knew that this involved broken nights for him and a soft board and a rug for a couch  he was overtasking his powers during those years  he was at work generally from five am to eleven pm and this in a close atmosphere for both the schoolroom and his own house were ill ventilated  he would not spare time enough either for regular exercise  he had a horse and enjoyed riding but he grudged the time except when he had to come up to town on business or to take sunday services for the english in the country  it was very natural as he had all a students taste for quiet study yet could only indulge it by cutting off his own hours for relaxation  he was constantly called off during the day to attend to practical work teaching in school prescribing for and waiting on the sick weighing out medicines keeping the farm accounts besides the night classes in several languages  he was really never so happy as among his boys or his books  he had no liking for general society though his natural courteousness made him shrink from seeming ungracious  he did thoroughly enjoy a real talk with one or two friends at a time but even this he denied himself  fanny patteson had spent several days at hursley in the course of the winter and the vicar and mrs keble had greatly delighted in hearing her brothers letters  the following letter from mr keble was written as will be perceived immediately after hearing the account of the baptism of the dying child at mota   hursley february 19 1862  my dear bishop pattesoni seat myself down on a low chair between the pictures of your uncle and your metropolitan and that by command of your sister who is on a footstool in the corner opposite i to send two words she 200 or for aught i know 2000 to greet you on the other side of the world  we have the more right as your kind sisters have kept us well up to your missionary doings from time to time and we seem to be very often with you on board or in your islands i say we for my dear wife is more than half of me as you may well suppose in such sympathies and it seems to me that perhaps in the present state of your island or seawork you may have more time than byandby for thinking of one and another anyhow we trust that that may happen which we ask for every eveningthat we may be vouchsafed a part in the holy prayers which have been that day offered to the throne of grace in melanesia or elsewhere  i dont know whether i am right but i fancy you at times something between a hermit and a missionary  god grant you a double blessing and as you are a bishop besides you will breathe us a blessing in return for this such as it is  fannys visit has been as you know it would be most charming and genial to us old folks not that my wife ought to be so spoken of and i shall always think it so kind of her to have spared us the time when she had so much to do and so short a time to do it in but she seems like one going about with a bag of what bishop selwyn calls hopeseed and sowing it in everyplace yet when one comes to look close at it it all consists of memories chiefly you know of whom  i only wish i could rightly and truly treasure up all she has kindly told us of your dear father but it must be a special grace to remember and really understand such things  it will be a most peculiar satisfaction now that we have had her with us in this way to think of you all three together should gods providence allow the meeting of which we understand there is a hope  the last thing she has told us of is the baptism on st barnabas daythe first fruits of mota unto christ  what a thoughtwhat a subject for prayer and thanksgiving  god grant it may prove to you more than we can ask or think  ever yours my dear bishop   j k  dont trouble yourself to write but think of us   of course there was no obeying this postscript and the immediate reply was   my dear dear mr keblefew things have ever given me more real pleasure than the receipt of your letter by this mail  i never doubted your interest in new zealand and melanesia and your affection for me for my dear fathers sake  i felt quite sure that prayers were being offered up for us in many places and where more frequently than at hursley  even as on this day five years ago when i touched the reef at guadalcanar in the presence of three hundred armed and naked men i heard afterwards prayers were being uttered in the dead of your night by my dear old governess miss neill that god would have me in his safe keeping  but it is most pleasant most helpful to me to read your letter and to feel that i have a kind of right now to write to you as i hope i may do while i live fully and freely  i do not say a word concerning the idea some of you in england seem to take of my life here  it is very humbling to me as it ought to be to read such a letter from you  how different it is really  if my dear sisters do come out to me for a while which after their letters by this february mail seems less impossible than before they will soon see what i mean a missionarys life does not procure him any immunity from temptations nor from falling into them though thanks be to god it has indeed its rich and abundant blessings  it is a blessed thing to draw a little fellow only six months ago a wild little savage down upon ones knee and hear his first confession of his past life and his shy hesitating account of the words he uses when he prays to his newlyfound god and saviour these are rare moments but they do occur and if they dont why the duty is to work all the same  the intelligence of some of these lads and young men really surprises me  some with me now last october were utterly wild never had worn a stitch of clothing were familiar with every kind of vice  they now write an account of a scripture print or answer my ms questions without copy of course fairly and legibly in their books and read their own languageonly quite lately reduced to writingwith ease  what an encouragement  and this applies to i think the great majority of these islanders  one child i suppose some thirteen or fourteen years of age i baptized on christmas day  three days afterwards i married her to a young man who had been for some years with us  they are both natives of nengone one of the loyalty isles  i administered the holy eucharist to her last saturday and she is dying peacefully of consumption  what a blessed thing  this little one fresh from baptism with all church ministrations round her passing gently away to her eternal rest  she looks at me with her soft dark eyes and fondles my hand and says she is not unhappy  she has i verily believe the secret of real happiness in her heart  i must write more when at sea  i have very little time here  i hope by gods blessing to make a long round among my many islands this winter some i know must be approached with great caution your prayers will be offered for me and those with me i know and am greatly comforted by the knowledge of it  fanny tells me what you have said to her about supplying any deficit in the money required for our vessel  i feel as if this ought not in one sense to come upon you but how can i venture to speak to you on such matters  you know all that i think and feel about it  send me more your blessing  i feel cares and anxieties now  my kind love to mrs keble  j c patteson missionary bishop   two more notes followed in quick succession to hursley vicarage almost entirely upon the matter of the new southern cross which was being built under mr tillys eye  the two bishops were scrupulous about letting mr keble give more than a fair proportion towards the vessel which was not to cost more than £3000 though more roomy than her lamented predecessor  meantime the sea breeze was again to serve for the winter voyage   st barnabas day auckland 1862  my dear sistersthink of my being ashore and in a christian land on this day  so it is  we sail dv in six days as it may be this day week  the melanesians are very good and pretty well in health but we are all anxious to be in warm climates  i think that most matters are settled  primate and i have finished our accounts think of his wise stewardship  the endowment in land and money and no debts contracted  i hope that i leave nothing behind me to cause difficulty should anything happen  the primate and sir william martin are my executors melanesia as you would expect my heir  i may have forgotten many items personal reminiscences  ask for anything should anything happen  i see no reason to anticipate it humanly speaking but it is always well to think of such things  i am just going to the little taurarua chapel to our melanesian commemoration service with holy communion  oh if it should please god to grant us a meeting here  great blessings have been given me this summer in seeing the progress made by the scholars so great as to make me feel sober minded and almost fearful but that is wrong and faithless perhaps and yet surely the trials must come some day  god bless you all and keep you all safe from all harm  your loving brother  j c patteson bishop   friday june 27th 2 pmhow you are thinking of all that took place that last night on earth  he was taking his departure for a long voyage rather he was entering into the haven where he would be may god give us grace to follow his holy example his patient endurance of his many trials the greatest his constant trial of deafness  i think if the weather be fair that we shall go off tomorrow  oh if we do meet and spend it may be christmas together  28th 3 pmthe first anniversary of our dear fathers death  how you are all recalling what took place then  how full of thankfulness for his gain far outweighing the sorrow for our loss  and yet how you must feel it more than i do and yet i feel it deeply but the little fond memories of the last months and above all the looks and spoken words of love i cant altogether enter into them  his letters are all that letters can be more than any other letters can be but they are not the same thing in all ways  the primate has left us to hurry down the sailing master of the sea breeze  it was a very rough morning but is calm now boats passing and repassing between the shore and the schooner at anchor off kohimarama  the habit of writing journals was not at once resumed by bishop patteson when his father was not there to read them and the chance of seeing his sisters no doubt made him write less fully to them since they might be on the voyage when the letters arrived in england   thus the fullest record of the early part of the voyage is in a report which he drew up and printed in the form of a letter to the rev j keble  we chartered the sea breeze schooner in june last for four months she is a vessel of seventy tons register a little larger than the old southern cross and as well suited for our purpose as a vessel can be which is built to carry passengers in the ordinary way  no voyage can of course equal in importance those early expeditions of the primate when he sailed in his little schooner among seas unknown to islands never before visited or visited only by the sandalwood traders  but i never recollect myself so remarkable a voyage as this last  i do not mean that any new method was adopted in visiting islands or communicating with the natives  god gave to the bishop of new zealand wisdom to see and carry out from the first the plan which more and more approves itself as the best and only feasible plan for our peculiar work  but all through this voyage both in revisiting islands well known to us and in recommencing the work in other islands where amidst the multitude of the primates engagements it had been impossible to keep up our acquaintance with the people and in opening the way in islands now visited for the first time from the beginning to the end it pleased god to prosper us beyond all our utmost hopes  i was not only able to land on many places where as far as i know no white man had set foot before but to go inland to inspect the houses canoes c in crowded villages as at santa cruz or to sit for two hours alone amidst a throng of people as at pentecost island or to walk two and a half miles inland as at tariko or aspee  from no less than eight islands have we for the first time received young people for our school here and fiftyone melanesian men women and young lads are now with us gathered from twentyfour islands exclusive of the islands so long known to us of the loyalty group  when you remember that at santa cruz eg we had never landed before and that this voyage i was permitted to go ashore at seven different places in one day during which i saw about 1200 men that in all these islands the inhabitants are to look at wild naked armed with spears and clubs or bows and poisoned arrows that every mans hand as alas we find only too soon when we live among them is against his neighbour and scenes of violence and bloodshed amongst themselves of frequent occurrence and that throughout this voyage during which i landed between seventy and eighty times not one hand was lifted up against me not one sign of illwill exhibited you will see why i speak and think with real amazement and thankfulness of a voyage accompanied with results so wholly unexpected  i say results for the effecting a safe landing on an island and much more the receiving a native lad from it is in this sense a result that the great step has been made of commencing an acquaintance with the people  if i live to make another voyage i shall no longer go ashore there as a stranger  i know the names of some of the men i can by signs remind them of some little present made some little occurrence which took place we have already something in common and as far as they know me at all they know me as a friend  then some lad is given up to us the language learned and a real hold on the island obtained  the most distant point we reached was the large island ysabel in the solomon archipelago  from this island a lad has come away with us and we have also a native boy from an island not many miles distant from ysabel called anudha but marked in the charts though not correctly as florida  it would weary you if i wrote of all the numerous adventures and strange scenes which in such a voyage we of course experience  i will give you if i can an idea of what took place at some few islands to illustrate the general character of the voyage  one of the new hebrides islands near the middle of the group was discovered by cook and by him called three hills  the central part of it where we have longhad an acquaintance with the natives is called by them mai  some six years ago we landed there and two young men came away with us and spent the summer in new zealand their names were petere and laure the former was a local chief of some consequence  we took a peculiar interest in this island finding that a portion of the population consists of a tribe speaking a dialect of the great polynesian language of which another dialect is spoken in new zealand  every year we have had scholars from mai several of whom can read and write  we have landed there times without number slept ashore three or four times and are well known of course to the inhabitants  the other day i landed as usual among a crowd of old acquaintances painted and armed but of that i thought nothing  knowing them to be so friendly to us instead of landing alone i took two or three of our party to walk inland with me and off we started mr  dudley and wadrokala being left sitting in the boat which was as usual a short distance from the beach  we had walked about half a mile before i noticed something unusual in the manner of the people and i overheard them talking in a way that made me suspect that something had happened which they did not want me to know  petere had not made his appearance though in general the first to greet us and on my making enquiries for him i was told that he was not well  not long afterwards i overheard a man say that petere was dead and taking again some opportunity that offered itself for asking about him was told that he was dead that he had died of dysentery  i was grieved to hear this because i liked him personally and had expected help from him when the time came for commencing a mission station on the island  the distance from the beach to the village where petere lived is about one and a half mile and a large party had assembled before we reached it  there was a great lamentation and crying on our arrival during which i sat down on a large log of a tree  then came a pause and i spoke to the people telling them how sorry i was to hear of peteres death  there was something strange still about their manner which i could not quite make out and one of our party who was not used to the kind of thing did not like the looks of the people and the clubs and spears  at last one of them an old scholar of ours came forward and said the men here do not wish to deceive you they know that you loved petere and they will not hide the truth petere was killed by a man in a ship a white man who shot him in the forehead  of course i made minute enquiries as to the ship the number of masts how many people they saw whether there was anything remarkable about the appearance of any person on board c  the men standing round us were a good deal excited but the same story was told by them all  after a while i walked back to the beach no indication having been made of unfriendliness but i had not gone more than a quarter of a mile when three men rushed past me from behind and ran on to the beach  meanwhile mr dudley and wadrokala in the boat were rather uneasy at the manner of the people standing near them on the reef and they too suspected that something unusual had occurred presently they saw these three men rush out of the bush on to the beach and distribute kava leaves of the pepper plant among the people who at once changed their manner became quite friendly and soon dispersed  it was quite evident that a discussion had taken place on shore as to the treatment we were to receive and these men on the beach were awaiting the result of the discussion prepared to act accordingly  there was scarcely any danger in our case of their deciding to injure us because they knew us well but had we been strangers we should have been killed of course their practice being naturally enough to revenge the death of a countryman on the arrival of the next man who comes from what they suppose to be their enemies country  this story may show you that caution is necessary long after the time that a real friendship has commenced and been carried on  we never can tell what may have taken place during the intervals of our visits  i returned to the village with mr kerr and mr dudley and slept ashore thinking it right to restore mutual confidence at once and there was not the slightest risk in doing so  now let me tell you about an island called ambrym lying to the south of aurora and pentecost the two northernmost islands of the new hebrides group  ambrym is a grand island with a fine active volcano so active on this last occasion of our visiting it that we were covered and half blinded by the ashes the deck was thickly covered with them and the sea for miles strewed with floating cinders  we have repeatedly landed in different parts of the island but this time we visited an entirely new place  there was a considerable surf on the beach and i did not like the boat to go near the shore partly on that account but chiefly because our rule is not to let the boat approach too near the beach lest it should be hauled up on shore by the people and our retreat to the schooner cut off  so i beckoned to some men in a canoe for i could not speak a word of the language who paddled up to us and took me ashore  as i was wading to the beach an elderly man came forward from the crowd to the waters edge where he stood holding both his arms uplifted over his head  directly that i reached him he took my hand and put it round his neck and turned to walk up the beach  as i walked along with him through the throng of men more than three hundred in number my arm all the while round his neck i overheard a few words which gave me some slight clue as to the character of their language and a very few words go a long way on such occasions  we went inland some short distance passing through part of a large village till we came to a house with figures idols or not i hardly know placed at some height above the door  they pointed to these figures and repeated a name frequently not unlike the name of one of the gods of some of the islands further to the north then they struck the hollow tree which is their native drum and thronged close round me while i gave away a few fish hooks pieces of red braid c  i asked the names of some of the people and of objects about me trees birds c  i was particularly struck with two boys who kept close to me  after some time i made signs that i would return to the beach and we began to move away from the village but i was soon stopped by some men who brought me two small trees making signs that i should plant them  when i returned to the beach the two boys were still with me and i took their hands and walked on amidst the crowd  i did not imagine that they would come away with me and yet a faint hope of their doing so sprang up in my mind as i still found them holding my hands and even when i began to wade towards the boat still close by my side in the water  all this took place in the presence of several hundred natives who allowed these boys to place themselves in the boat and be taken on board the schooner  i was somewhat anxious about revisiting an island called tikopia once we were there five or six years ago  the island is small and the inhabitants probably not more than three hundred or four hundred they are polynesians men of very large stature rough in manner and not very easily managed  i landed there and waded across the reef among forty or fifty men  on the beach a large party assembled  i told them in a sort of polynesian patois that i wished to take away two lads from their island that i might learn their language and come back and teach them many things for their good  this they did not agree to  they said that some of the fullgrown men wished to go away with me but to this i in my turn could not agree  these great giants would be wholly unmanageable in our school at present  i went back to the edge of the reefabout three hundred yardsand got into the boat with two men we rowed off a little way and i attempted more quietly than the noisy crowd on shore would allow to explain to them my object in coming to them  after a while we pulled back to the reef and i waded ashore again but i could not induce them to let me take any one away who was at all eligible for the school still i was very thankful to have been able twice to land and remain half an hour or more on shore among the people  next year dv i may be able to see more of them and perhaps may obtain a scholar and so open the island  it is a place visited by whalers but they never land here and indeed the inhabitants are generally regarded as dangerous fellows to deal with so i was all the more glad to have made a successful visit  nothing could have been more delightful than the day i spent in making frequent landings on the north side of santa cruz  this island was visited by spaniards under the command of mendana nearly three hundred years ago  they attempted to found a colony there but after a short time were compelled by illness and the death of mendana and his successor to abandon their endeavour  it is apparently a very fertile island certainly a very populous one  the inhabitants are very ingenious wearing beautiful ornaments making good bags woven of grass stained with turmeric and fine mats  their arrows are elaborately carved and not less elaborately poisoned their canoes well made and kept in good order  we never before landed on this island but the primate long before i was in this part of the world and two or three times since had sailed and rowed into the bay at the northwest end called graciosa bay the fine harbour in which the spaniards anchored  i went ashore this last voyage in seven different places large crowds of men thronging down to the waters edge as i waded to the beach  they were exceedingly friendly allowed me to enter the houses sit down and inspect their mode of building them  they brought me food to eat and when i went out of the houses again let me examine the large seagoing canoes drawn up in line on the beach  i wrote down very many names and tried hard to induce some young people to come away with me but after we had pulled off some way their courage failed them and they swam back to the shore  two or three of the men took off little ornaments and gave them to me one bright pretty boy especially i remember who took off his shell necklace and put it round my neck making me understand partly by words but more by signs that he was afraid to come now but would do so if i returned as i said in eight or ten moons  large baskets of almonds were given me and other food also thrown into the boat  i made a poor return by giving some fishhooks and a tomahawk to the man whom i took to be the person of most consequence on shore the women came freely up to me among the crowd but they were afraid to venture down to the beach  now this is the island about which we have long felt a great difficulty as to the right way of obtaining any communication with the natives  this year why and how i cannot tell the way was opened beyond all expectation  i tried hard to get back from the solomon islands so as to revisit it again during the voyage but we could not get to the eastward as the tradewind blew constantly from that quarter  at lepers island i had just such another dayor rather two days were spent in making an almost complete visitation of the northern part of the islandthe people were everywhere most friendly and i am hoping to see them all again join us soon when some may be induced to  it would be the work of days to tell you all our adventures  how at malanta i picked two lads out of a party of thirtysix in a grand war canoe going on a fighting expeditionand very good fellows they are how we filled up our watercasks at aurora standing up to our necks in the clear cool stream rushing down from a cataract above with the natives assisting us in the most friendly manner how at santa maria which till this year we never visited without being shot at i walked for four or five hours far inland wherever i pleased meeting great crowds of men all armed and suspicious of each otherindeed actually fighting with each otherbut all friendly to me how at espiritu santo when i had just thrown off my coat and tightened my belt to swim ashore through something of a surf a canoe was launched and without more ado a nice lad got into our boat and came away with us without giving me the trouble of taking a swim at all how at florida island never before reached by us one out of some eighty men young and old standing all round me on the reef to my astonishment returned with me to the boat and without any opposition from the people quietly seated himself by my side and came away to the schooner how at pentecost island taroniara a lad whom the primate in old days had picked up in his canoe paddling against a strong head wind and kept him on board all night and sent him home with presents in the morning now came away with me but not without his bow and poisoned arrows of which i have taken safe possession how misial felt seasick and homesick for a day or two but upon being specially patronised by the cook soon declared that no place could compare with the galley of a mission vessel to the truth of which declaration the necessity of enlarging his scanty garments soon bore satisfactory testimony how at ysabel the young chief came on board with a white cockatoo instead of a hawk on his wrist which he presented to me with all the grace in the world and with an enquiry after his good friend captain hume of hms cordelia who had kindly taken me to this island in the winter of 1861  to this may be added some touches from the home letter of august 27 off vanikoro  i dont deny that i am thankful that the tikopia visit is well over the people are so very powerful and so independent and unmanageable that i always have felt anxious about visiting them  once we were there in 1856 and now again  i hope to keep on visiting them annually  sydney traders have been there but have never landed they trade at arms length from their boat and are well armed  it is a strange sensation sitting alone say 300 yards from the boat which of course cant be trusted in their hands among 200 or more of people really gigantic  no men have i ever seen so largehuge patagonian limbs and great heavy hands clutching up my little weak arms and shoulders  yet it is not a sensation of fear but simply of powerlessness and it makes one think as i do when among them of another power present to protect and defend  they perfectly understood my wish to bring away lads  fullgrown brobdignag men wished to come and some got into the boat who were not easily got out of it again  boys swam off wishing to come but the elder people prevented it swimming after them and dragging them back  it was a very rough blustering day but even on such a day the lee side of the island is a beautiful sight one mass of cocoa nut trees and the villages so snugly situated among the trees  just been up the rigging to get a good look at this great encircling reef at vanikoro  green water as smooth as glass inside the reef for a mile and then pretty villages but there is no passage through the reef it is a continuous breakwater  we are working up towards a part of the reef where i think there may be a passage  anyhow i am gaining a good local knowledge of this place and that saves time another year  the ten lads on board talk six languages not one of which do i know but as i get words and sentences from them i see how they will work in with the general character of the language of which i have several dialects  it is therefore not very difficult to get on some little way into all at once but i must not be disappointed if i find that other occupations take me away too much for my own pleasure from this particular branch of my work  a long letter to sir john t  coleridge gives another aspect of the voyage   sea breeze schooner off rennell island  therm  89° in shade lat 11° 40 long 160° 18 5  september 7 1862  my dear unclei can hardly keep awake for the unusually great heat  the wind is northerly and it is very light indeed we are almost becalmed so you will have a sleepy letter indeed over my book i was already nodding  i think it better to write to you though on a sunday than to sleep  what a compliment  but i shall grow more wakeful as i write  perhaps my real excuse for writing is that i feel today much oppressed with the thought of these great islands that i have been visiting and i am sadly disappointed in some of my scholars from san cristoval  leaving new zealand on june 20th i sailed to norfolk island where i held my first confirmation  by desire of the bishop of tasmania i act as bishop for the norfolk islanders  this was as you know a very solemn time for me sixteen dear children were confirmed  since that time i have visited very many islands with almost unequalled success as far as effecting landings opening communication and receiving native lads are concerned  i have on board natives from many places from which we have never received them before  many i have left with mr dudley and mr pritt on mota island at school but i have now twentyone speaking eleven languages  at many places where we had never landed i was received well  the state of things too in the banks islands is very encouraging what do you think of my having two married after their fashion couples on board from the solomon islands san cristoval and contrariete  this was effected with some difficulty  both the men are old scholars of course  i ought therefore to be most thankful and yet my heart is sad because after promises given by grariri and his wife parenga and kerearua all old scholars save mrs garm not one came away with me yesterday and i feel grieved at the loss of my dear boys who can read and write and might be taught so much now  it is all very faithless but i must tell it all to you for indeed i do not feel as if i had any right to expect it otherwise but in the moment of perceiving and confessing that it is very good for me i find out for the first time how much my heart was set upon having them  and then san cristoval sixty miles long with its villages and languages and malanta over eighty miles long and guadalcanar seventy  it is a silly thought or a vain human wish but i feel as if i longed to be in fifty or a hundred places at once  but god will send qualified men in good time  in the meanwhile for the work must be carried on mainly by native teachers gathered from each island as some fall off i must seek to gain others  even where lads are only two or even one year with mer and then apparently fall back to what they were before some good may be done the old teaching may return upon them some day and they may form a little nucleus for good though not now  as for openings for men of the right sort they abound  really if i were free to locate myself on an island instead of going about to all i hardly know to which of some four or five i ought to go  but it is of no use to have men who are not precisely the kind of men wanted  somehow one cant as yet learn to ask men to do things that one does oneself as a matter of course  it needs a course of training to get rid of conventional notions  i think that norfolk island may supply a few a very few fellows able to be of use and perhaps new zealand will do so and i have the advantage of seeing and knowing them  i dont think that i must expect men from england i cant pay them well and it is so very difficult to give a man on paper any idea of what his life will be in melanesia or kohimarama so very much that would be most hazardous to others has ceased to be so to me because i catch up some scrap of the language talked on the beach and habit has given an air of coolness and assurance  but this does not come all at once and you cannot talk about all this to others  i feel ashamed as i write it even to you  they bother me to put anecdotes of adventures into our report but i cannot  you know no one lands on these places but myself and it would be no good to tell stories merely to catch somebodys ear  it was easier to do so when the bishop and i went together but i am not training up anyone to be the visitor and so i dont wish anybody else to go with me besides mr pritt and mr dudley are bad swimmers and mr kerr not firstrate  my constant thought is by what means will god provide for the introduction of christianity into these islands and my constant prayer that he will reveal such means to me and give me grace to use them  what reality there is in such a work as this  what continual need of guidance and direction  i here see before me now an island stretching away twentyfive miles in length  last night i left one sixty miles long  i know that hundreds are living there ignorant of god wild men cannibals addicted to every vice  i know that christ died for them and that the message is for them too  how am i to deliver it  how find an entrance among them  how when i have learnt their language speak to them of religion so as not to introduce unnecessary obstacles to the reception of it nor compromise any of its commands  thank god i can fall back upon many solid points of comfort chiefest of all he sees and knows it all perfectly  he sees the islanders too and loves them how infinitely more than i can  he desires to save them  he is i trust sending me to them  he will bless honest endeavours to do his will among them  and then i think how it must all appear to angels and saints how differently they see these things  already to their eyes the light is breaking forth in melanesia and i take great comfort from this thought and remember that it does not matter whether it is in my time only i must work on  and then i think of the prayers of the church ascending continually for the conversion of the heathen and i know that many of you are praying specially for the heathen of melanesia  and so ones thoughts float out to india and china and japan and africa and the islands of the sea and the very vastness of the work raises ones thoughts to god as the only one by whom it must be done  now dear uncle i have written all this commonplace talk not regarding its dulness in your eyes but because i felt weary and also somewhat overwrought and sad and it has done me much good and given me a happy hour  we had our service on board this morning and the holy eucharist afterwards mr kerr two norfolk islanders a maori and a nengone man present  i ought not to be fainthearted  my kind love to aunt and mary  your affectionate and dutiful nephew  j c patteson missionary bishop   the climate of mota had again disagreed with mr dudley who was laid up with chronic rheumatism nearly all the time he was there and the bishop returned from his voyage very unwell but mr pritt happily was strong and active and the elder banks island scholars were very helpful both in working and teaching so that the schools went on prosperously and the custom of carrying weapons in mota was dropped  on november 7 the sea breeze was again in harbour and on the 15th after mature consideration was written this selfsacrificing letter   st andrews november 15 1862  my dearest sistersi returned from a voyage unusually interesting and prosperous on the 7th of this month absent just nineteen weeks we were in all on board seventyone  i found all your letters from april to august 25  how thankful i am to see and know what i never doubted the loving manner in which my first and later letters about new zealand were taken  how wise of you to perceive that in truth my judgment remained all through unaltered though my feelings were strongly moved indeed the good folk here begged me to reconsider my resolution thinking no doubt kindly for me that it would be so great a joy to me to see you  of course it would were there no other considerations that we already know and agree upon what joy so great on earth  but i feel sure that we are right  thank god that we can so speak think and act with increasing affection and trust in each other  the more i think of it the more i feel no it would not do  it would not be either what joan expects or what fan expects  they look at it in some ways alikeie in the matter of seeing me which both equally long to do  in some ways they regard it differently but it would not to one or the other be the thing they hope and wish for  they would both feel what yet they would not like to acknowledge disappointment  though therefore i could not help feeling often during the voyage what if i hear that they may be with me by christmas yet it was not exactly unwelcome to hear that you do not come  i recognised at once your reading of my letters as the right one and my feelings strong as they are give way to other considerations especially when from my many occupations i have very little time to indulge them  but for the thought of coming and your great love to me i thank you dear ones with all my heart  may god bless you for it  goodbye my dear sisters we are together in heart at all events  your loving brother j c p  the judgment had decided that the elder sister especially would suffer more from the rough life at kohimarama than her brother could bear that she should undergo when he could give her so little of his society as compensation without compromising his own decided principle that all must yield to the work  perhaps he hardly knew how much he betrayed of the longing even while deciding against its gratification but his sisters were wise enough to act on his judgment and not on their own impulse and the events of the next season proved that he had been right  to sir john coleridge he wrote   kohimarama november 15 1862  my dear unclei should indeed as you say delight to have a ramble in the old scenes and a good unburthening of thoughts conceived during the past seven or eight years  and yet you see i could not try the experiment of those dear good sisters of mine coming out  it would not have been what they expected and meant to come out to  i am little seen by any but melanesians and quite content that it should be so  i cant do what i want with them nor a tenth part of it as it is  i cannot write to you of this last voyagein many respects a most remarkable one indicating if i am not over hopeful a new stage in our mission work  many islands yielding scholars for the first time old scholars with but few exceptions steadfast and rapidly improving no less than fiftyseven melanesians here now from twentyfour islands exclusive of the loyalty islands and five bright pitcairners from twentyfour to sixteen helpful good conscientious lads  there are eight languages that i do not know besides all the rest yet i can see that they are all links in the great chain of dialects of the great pacific languageyet dialects very far removed sometimes from one another  i find it not very easy to comply with reasonable demands from men in europe who want to know about these things  if i had time and ability i think i should enjoy really going into philology  i get books sent me from people such as max muller grabalentz c and if i write to them at all it is useless to write anything but an attempt at classification of the dialects and that is difficult for there are so many and it takes so long to explain to another the grounds upon which i feel justified in connecting dialects and calling them cognate  it becomes an instinct almost i suppose with people in the trade  but i hardly know how far i ought to spend any time in such things elementary grammars for our own missionaries and teachers are useful and the time is well spent in writing them  hence it is that i do not write longer letters  oh how i enjoy writing unbusiness letters but i cant help itits part of my business now to write dull reportsie reports that i cant help making dull and all the rest of it  i cannot write about bishop mackenzie  mr pritt at 930 pm the night we landed put his head into my room and said bishop mackenzie is dead and i sat and sat on and knelt and could not take it all in  i cannot understand what the papers say of his modus operandi yet i know that it was an error of judgment if an error at all and there may be much which we do not know  so i suspend my opinion  in a letter to myself written by the same mail in reply to one in which i had begged him to consider what was the sight to a christian man of slaves driven off with heavy yokes on their necks and whether it did not justify armed interposition he replies with arguments that it is needless now to repeat but upholding the principle that the shepherd is shepherd to the cruel and erring as well as to the oppressed and ought not to use force  the opinion is given most humbly and tenderly for he had a great veneration for his brother missionary bishop  commenting on the fact that bishop selwyns speech at cambridge had made charles mackenzie a missionary and that he would gladly have hailed an invitation to the australasian field of labour the letter proceeds  how wonderful it is to reflect upon the events of the last few years  had he come out when i did to new zealand i might be now his missionary chaplain and yet it is well that there should be two missionary dioceses and without the right man for the african mission there might have been a difficulty in carrying out the plan  the chapel is not built yet for i have sixty mouths to feed and other buildings must be thought of for healths sake  but i have settled all that in my will  in a postscript is mentioned the arrival of some exquisite altar plate for the college chapel which had been offered by a lady who had also bountifully supplied with chronometers and nautical instruments the southern cross which was fast being built at southampton  the above letter was accompanied by one to dr moberly   st andrews college kohimarama nov 18 1862  my dear dr moberlythank you heartily for writing to me  it is a real help to me and to others also i think of my party to be in communication with those whom we have long respected and whose prayers we now more than ever earnestly ask  we returned on november 7 from a very remarkable voyage  i was nineteen weeks absent all but a day sailed far beyond our most distant island in my previous voyage landed nearly eighty times amidst often 300 and more natives naked armed c and on no less than thirty or forty places never trodden before as far as i know by the foot of a white man  not one arm was lifted up against me not one bow drawn or spear shaken  i think of it all quietly now with a sort of wondering thankfulness  from not less than eight islands we have now for the first time received native lads and not only are openings being thus made for us in many directions but the permanent training of our old scholars is going on most favourably so that by the blessing of god we hope at all events in the banks islands to carry on continuously the mission schools during the winter and summer also  we have spent the three last winters here but it would not be wise to run the risk of the damp hot climate in the summer  natives of the island must do this and thank god there are natives being raised up now to do it the enclosed translation of a note  it is but three or four years since the language was reduced to writing and here is a young man writing down his thoughts to me after a long talk about the question of his being baptized  four others there are soon by gods blessing to be baptized also sarawia from vanua lava tagalana from aroa pasvorang from eowa woleg from mota and others are pressing on taroniara from san cristoval kanambat from new caledonia c  i tell you their names for you will i know remember them in your prayers  will you kindly let mr keble see the enclosed note  it does not of course give much idea of the lads state of mind but he is thoroughly in earnest and as for his knowledge of his duty there can be no question there  he really knows his catechism  i have scarcely a minute to write by this mail  soon you will have i hope a sketch of our last voyage  we remember you all benefactors and benefactresses daily  thank you again for writing to me it humbles me as it ought to do to receive such a letter from you  very faithfully yours  j c patteson missionary bishop   these names deserve note sarawia the first to be ordained of the melanesian church and taroniara who was to share his bishops death  b as will be seen has had a far more chequered course tagalana is described in another letter as having the thoughtfulness of one who knows that he has the seeds of early death in him but he the living lectern at the consecration has lived to be the first deacon of his island of aroa  the ensuing is to the rev derwent coleridge at that time principal of st marks training college chelsea upon the question whether that institution would afford assistants   auckland new zealand nov 15 1862  my dear cousinyou will not be surprised i hope to hear from me i only wish i had written to you long ago  but until quite recently we could not speak with so much confidence concerning the melanesian mission and it is of little use to write vaguely on matters which i am anxious now to make known to you  the general plan of the mission you may get some notion of from the last years report which i send and possibly you may have heard or seen something about it in former years  this last voyage of nineteen weeks just concluded has determined me to write to you for the time is come when we want helpers indeed and i think that you will expect me naturally to turn to you  it is not only that very many islands throughout the south pacific from the loyalty islands on to the northwest as far as ysabel island in the solomon group are now yielding up scholars and affording openings for mission stations though this indeed is great matter for thankfulness but there is thank god a really working staff gathered round us from the banks archipelago which affords a definite field already partially occupied with a regular system at work in it and here young persons may receive the training most needed for them actually on a heathen island though soon not to be without some few christians amongst its population  now i can say to anyone willing and qualified to help me  in the six summer months there is the central school work in new zealand where now there are with me fiftyone melanesians from twentyfour islands speaking twentythree languages and in the six winter months there is a station regularly occupied on mota island where all the necessary experience of life in the islands can be acquired  i am not in any hurry for men  norfolk island has given me five young fellows from twentyone to sixteen years of age who already are very useful  one has been with me a year another four months they are given unreservedly into my hands and already are working well into our school taking the superintendence of our cooking eg off our hands with some help from us they will be very useful at once as helpers on mota doing much in the way of gardening putting up huts c which will free us for more teaching work c and they are being educated by us with an eye to their future employment dv as missionaries  i would not wish for better fellows their moral and religious conduct is really singularly good you know their circumstances and the character of the whole community  but i should be thankful byandby to have men equally willing to do anything yet better educated in respect of book knowledge  no one is ever asked to do what we are not willing to do and generally in the habit of doing ourselvescooking working c c  but the melanesian lads really do all this kind of work now  i have sixty mouths to fill here now and melanesian boys told out week by week do the whole of the cooking simple enough of course for us all with perfect punctuality  i dont think any particular taste for languages necessary at all  anyone who will work hard at it can learn the language of the particular class assigned to him earnest bright cheerful fellows without that notion of making sacrifices c perpetually occurring to their minds would be invaluable  you know the kind of men who have got rid of the conventional notion that more selfdenial is needed for a missionary than for a sailor or soldier who are sent anywhere and leave home and country for years and think nothing of it because they go on duty  alas we dont so read our ordination vows  a fellow with a healthy active tone of mind plenty of enterprise and some enthusiasm who makes the best of everything and above all does not think himself better than other people because he is engaged in mission workthat is the fellow we want  i assume of course the existence of sound religious principle as the greatest qualification of all  now if there be any young persons whom you could wish to see engaged in this mission now at st marks or if you know of any such and feel justified in speaking to them you will be doing a great kindness to me and i believe aiding materially in this work  i should not wish at all any young man to be pledged to anything as on my part i will not pledge myself to accept much less ordain any man of whom i have no personal knowledge  but let anyone really in earnest with a desire and intention as far as he is concerned to join the mission come to me about december or january in any year then he will live at the mission college till the end of april and can see for himself the mode of life at the central summer school in new zealand  then let him take a voyage with me see melanesians in their own homes stop for a while at motaeg make trial of the climate c c and then let me have my decisive talk with him  if he will not do for the work i must try and find other employment for him in some new zealand diocese or help to pay his passage home i dont think such a person as you would recommend would fail to make himself useful but i must say plainly that i would rather not have a man from england at all than be bound to accept a man who might not thoroughly and cordially work into the general system that we have adopted  we live together entirely all meals in common same cabin same hut and the general life and energy of us all would be damaged by the introduction of any one discordant element  you will probably say men wont go out on these terms and this is indeed probable yet if they are the right fellows for this worka work wholly anomalous unlike all other work that they have thought of in many respectsthey will think that what i say is reasonable and like the prospect all the better i think because they see that it means downright work in a cheery happy hopeful friendly spirit  a man who takes the sentimental view of coral islands and cocoa nuts of course is worse than useless a man possessed with the idea that he is making a sacrifice will never do and a man who thinks any kind of work beneath a gentleman will simply be in the way and be rather uncomfortable at seeing the bishop do what he thinks degrading to do himself  i write all this quite freely wishing to convey if possible some idea to you of the kind of men we need  and if the right fellow is moved by gods grace to come out what a welcome we will give him and how happy he will soon be in a work the abundant blessings of which none can know as we know them  there are three clergymen with me  mr pritt who came out with the bishop of nelson as his chaplain but who i am thankful to say is regularly part and parcel of the mission staff mr dudley ordained last year who for six years has been in the mission and has had the special advantage of being trained under the primates eye and mr kerr who was also ordained about ten months ago  i give 100 pounds to a clergyman when ordained increasing it 101 annually to a maximum of 150 pounds  but this depends upon subscriptions c  i could not pledge myself even to this except in the case of a man very highly recommended  but of this i will write more  again let me say that i do not want anyone yet not this year  i shall be off again dv in the beginning of may 1863 for six months and if then i find on my return dv in november letters from you either asking me to write with reference to any young man or informing me that one is on the way out that will be quite soon enough  i need not say i dont expect any such help so soon if at all  finally pray dont think that i underrate the great advantage of having such persons as st marks produces but i write guardedly my kind love to mrs derwent  affectionately yours  j c patteson missionary bishop   on the 29th of december after two pages of affectionate remarks on various family incidents the letter proceeds  we are having an extra scrubbing in preparation for our visitors on thursday who may wish to be with us on the occasion of the baptism of our six banks islanders and i am writing in the midst of it preferring to sit in the schoolroom to my own room which is very tiny and very hot  we have some eight only out of the fiftyone whom i am obliged to treat rather as an awkward squad not that they are too stupid to learn but that we cannot give them the individual attention that is necessary  they teach me their language but i cannot put them into any class where they could be regularly taughtindeed they are not young fellows whom i should bring again  they do the work of introducing us to their islands and of teaching us something of their language  so i continue to give them what little time i can the real strength of our force being given to those whom we hope to have here again  we are all on the qui vive about our beautiful vessel hoping to see it in about six or eight weeks  it will please god be for years the great means by which we may carry on the mission if we live and all the care that has been spent upon it has been well spent you may be sure  i dont want to appear as if i expected this to be done in one sense but it is only when i think of the personal interest shown in it that i suppose it right to thank people much  i dont want it to be thought of any more than you do as a gift to us particular missionaries  it is the church carrying on its own work  yet as you truly say private feelings and interests are not to be treated rudely and i do think it a very remarkable thing that some 2000 pounds should be raised by subscriptions especially when one knows that so very few people have an idea of the work that is being done  what a blessed new years rejoicing in hope here follows   kohimarama jan 1 1863  my dearest sistersthe first letter of the year to you  thank god for bringing us to see it  it is 1 pm and at 430 pm six dear children from twentytwo to fourteen are to be baptized everything in one sense is done how very little in the other and higher sense  may almighty god pour the fulness of his blessing upon them  i sit and look at them and my heart is too full for words they sit with me and bring their little notes with questions that they scarcely dare trust themselves to speak about  you will thank god for giving me such comfort such blessings and such dear children  how great a mercy it is  how unexpected  may god make me humble and patient through it all  what a sight it would be for you four hours hence  our party of sixtyone visitors from auckland the glorious day and the holy service for which all meet  i use proper psalms 89 96 126 145 and for lessons a few verses 2 kings v 915 and acts viii 359  after the third collect the primate may say a few words or i may do so and then i shall use our usual melanesian collect for many islands very briefly named and so conclude with the blessing  what this is to me you must try and realise that you may be partakers of my joy and thankfulness  to have christians about me to whom i can speak with a certainty of being understood to feel that we are all bound together in the blessed communion of the body of christ to know that angels on high are rejoicing and evil spirits being chased away that all the banks islands and all melanesia are experiencing as it were the first shock of a mighty earthquake that god who foresees the end may in his merciful providence be calling even these very children to bear his message to thousands of heathens is not it too much  ones heart is not large enough for it and confession of ones own unworthiness breaks off involuntarily into praise and glory  i know my dear sisters that this is most likely one of the great blessings that precede great trials  i cant expect or wish perhaps always to sail with a fair wind yet i try to remember that trial must come without on that account restraining myself from a deep taste of the present joy  i cant describe it  then we have now much that we ever can talk aboutdeep talk about mota and the other islands and the special temptations to which they must be exposed that now is the time when the devil will seek with all his might to have them and so hinder gods work in the land that they have been specially blest by god to be the first to desire to know his will and that they have heavy responsibilities  yes they say we see man does not know that his room is dirty and full of cobwebs while it is all dark and another man whose room is not half so dirty because the sun shines into it and shows the dirt thinks his room much worse than the other  that is like our hearts  it is worse now to be angry than it was to shoot a man a long time ago  but the more the sun shines in the more we shall find cobwebs and dirt long after we thought the room was clean yes we know what that means  we asked you what would help us to go on straight in the path now that we are entering at the gate  we said prayer love helping our countrymen  now we see besides watchfulness selfexamination and then you say we must at once look forward to being confirmed as the people you confirmed at norfolk island  then there is the very great thing the holy and the great the supper of the lord  so evening by evening and day by day we talk this being of course not called school being indeed my great relaxation for this is the time when they are like children with a father  i know i feel it so  dont take the above as a fair sample of our talk for the more solemn words we say about gods love christs intercession and the indwelling of the spirit i can hardly write down now  your loving brother  j c p  psfeast of the epiphany  those dear children were baptized on thursday  a most solemn interesting scene it was  thoroughly happy indeed was the bishop at this time  in a note of february 3 to the bishop of wellington he speaks of the orderly state of the college  mr  pritt has made a complete change in the melanesian school very properly through me not putting himself forward but talking with me suggesting accepting suggestions giving the benefit of his great knowledge of boys and the ways to educate them  all the punctuality order method c are owing to him and he is so bright and hearty thoroughly at ease with the boys and they with him  the same note announces two more recruitsmr john palmer a theological student at st johns and joseph atkin the only son of a settler in the neighbourhood who had also held a scholarship there  he had gained it in 1860 after being educated at the taranaki scotch school and the church of england grammar school at parnell and his abilities were highly thought of the bishop says  joe atkin you will be glad to hear has joined us on probation till next christmas but he is very unlikely to change his mind  he and his father have behaved in a very straightforward manner  i am not at all anxious to get fellows here in a hurry  the norfolk islanders eg are in need of training much more than our best melanesians less useful as teachers cooks even as examples  this will surprise you but it is so  i have long suspected that joe thought about joining us  he tells me you never would give me a chance to speak to you sir  quite true joe i wished the thought to work itself out in your own mind and then i thought it right to speak first to your father  i told him that i could offer but a small and that an uncertain salary should he be ordained five years hence and that he ought to think of that that there was nothing worldly in his wishing to secure a maintenance byandby for wife and child and that i much doubted my power to provide it  but this did not at all shake either his father or him  i have a great regard for the lad and i know you have  from that time forward reading with and talking with joe atkin was one of the chief solaces of the bishops life though at present the young man was only on trial and could not as yet fill the place of mr benjamin dudley who soon after the voyage married and returned to canterbury settlement  the loss was felt as appears in the following   kohimarama saturday 1 pm feb 7 1863  my dearest sistersi have a heavy cold so you must expect a stupid letter  i am off in an hour or two for a fortymile ride to take tomorrows services four among soldiers and settlers  the worst of it is that i have no chance of sleep at the end for the mosquitos near the river are intolerable  how jolly it would be nevertheless if you were here and strong enough to make a sort of picnic ride of it  i do it this way strap in front of the saddle a waterproof sheet with my silk gown prayerbook brush and comb razor and soap a clean tie and a couple of sea biscuits  then at about 3 pm off i go  about twenty miles or so bring me to papakura an ugly but good road most of the way  here there is an inn  i stop for an hour and a half give the horse a good feed and have my tea  at about 730 or 8 i start again and ride slowly along a good road this dry weather  the moon rises at 930 and by that time i shall be reaching the forest through which a good military road runs  this is the part of the road i should like to show you such a night as this promises to be  it will be beautiful  about 11 i reach a hut made of reeds on the very brink of the river tether the horse give him a feed which i carry with me from papakura light a fire taking matches inside the hut and try to smoke away mosquitos lie down in your plaid joando you remember giving it to meand get what sleep i can  tomorrow i work my way home again the fourth service being at papakura at 4 pm so i ought to be at kohimarama by 9 pm dead tired i expect  i think these long days tire me more than they did and i really do see not a few white hairs a dozen or so this is quite right and respectable  i am writing now because i am tired with this cold but chiefly because when i write only for the mail i send you such wretched scrawls just business letters or growls about something or other which i magnify into a grievance  but really dear joan and fan i do like much writing to you only it is so very seldom i can do so without leaving undone some regular part of the days work  i am quite aware that you want to know more details about my daily life and i really wish to supply them but then i am so weary when i get a chance of writing that i let my mind drift away with my pen instead of making some effort to write thoughtfully  how many things i should like to talk about and which i ought to write about bishops mackenzie and colenso the true view of what heathenism is church government the real way to hope to get at the mass of heathens at home the need of a different education in some respects for the clergy c  but i have already by the time i begin to write taken too much out of myself in other ways to grapple with such subjects and so i merely spin out a yarn about my own special difficulties and anxieties  dont mind my grumbling  i think that it is very ungrateful of me to do so when this year especially i am receiving such blessings it is partly because i am very much occupied working at high pressure partly because i do not check my foolish notions and let matters worry me  i dont justify it a bit nor must you suppose that because i am very busy just now i am really the worse for it the change to sea life will set me all to rights again and i feel that much work must be done in a little time and a wise man would take much more pains than i do to keep himself in a state fit to do it  i have told you about our manner of life here  up at 5 when i go round and pull the blankets not without many a joke off the sleeping boys many of the party are already up and washing  then just before prayers i go into the kitchen and see that all is ready for breakfast  prayers at 545 in english mota baura c beginning with a mota hymn and ending with the lords prayer in english  breakfast immediately after at our table mr pritt mr kerr and young atkin who has just joined us  at the teachers table five norfolk islanders edward a maori five girls and two of their husbands and the three girls being placed at this table because they are girls melanesians at the other three tables indiscriminately  there are four windows one at the north three at the east side  the school and chapel in one long modern building form the corresponding wing on the eastern side of my little room and the boys dormitories between  we are daily expecting the vessel though it will be a quick passage for her if she comes in the next ten days and then what a bustle  we send dudley and his wife away to canterbury for eight or nine months he is so weak as to make the change which i had urged him to try for some time past quite necessary  next sunday a confirmation at orehunga eight miles off back to auckland for catechising and baptism at 3 pm and evening service at 630 and never a word of either sermon written and all the school work  never mind a good growl to you is a fine restorative and really i get on very well somehow  well goodbye you dear sisters  your affectionate brother  j c p   on the last day of february came the new southern cross and two delightful notes announced it to the vicar of hursley and to myself in one envelope   st andrews feb 28 1863  my dear cousinthe southern cross arrived safely this morning thanks to god  what it is to us even you can hardly tell i know not how to pour out my thankfulness  she seems admirably adapted for the work  mr tillys report of her performance is most satisfactory safe fast steers well and very manageable  internal arrangements very good after cabin too luxurious but then that may be wanted for sick folk and as it is luxurious why i shall get a soft bed and take to it very kindly  pray let dear mr keble and dr moberly know at once how very happy and thankful i am for this blessing  i know all you good friends at home will try to picture to yourselves my delight as i jumped on board  the boys are of course wild with excitement  it is blowing very hard  last night when we were thinking of them it was an anxious night for them close on the coast  i have no time to write more  i thought of lady as i looked at the chronometers and instruments and of you all as i looked at the beautiful vessel slipping along through the water with scarce a stitch of canvas  i pray that she may be spared many years to the mission and that we may have grace to use her as she ought to be used to his glory  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson bishop  you know that you are daily remembered in our prayers  god bless you   1030 pm march 1 1863  my dear mr kebleone line though on sunday night to tell you of the safe arrival of the southern cross  you have a large share in her and she has a large share in your good wishes and prayers i am sure  solemn thoughts on this day an ordination sunday mingle with the joy at the coming of this messenger i trust of mercy and peace  i need not ask you to pray continually for us for i know you do so but indeed now is the time when we seem especially to need your prayers  the lads have no lack of intellectual capacity they not unfrequently surprise me  now is the time when they are in the receptive state and now especially any error on our part may give a wrong direction to the early faith of thousands  what an awful thought  we are their only teachers the only representatives of christianity among them  how inexpressibly solemn and fearful  this is the thought so perpetually present to me  the training of the future missionaries of melanesia is by gods providence placed in our hands  no wonder that i feel sometimes overwhelmed at the thought  but i know that if god gives me grace to become more simpleminded and humble he will order even this aright  you i know will pray more than ever for me  my kindest regards to mrs keble i hope she is better  your affectionate and grateful young friend  j c patteson missionary bishop   before the first joy of the arrival was over ere the southern cross could make her first voyage among the multitude of isles a great calamity had fallen upon st andrews  whether it was from the large numbers or the effect of the colder climate or from what cause could not be told but a frightful attack of dysentery fell upon the melanesians and for several weeks suffering and death prevailed among them  how bishop patteson tended them during this time can be better guessed than described  archdeacon lloyd who came to assist in the cares of the small party of clergy can find no words to express the devotion with which the bishop nursed them comforting and supporting them never shrinking from the most repulsive offices even bearing out the dead silently at night lest the others should see and be alarmed  still no mail except during the voyages had ever left new zealand without a despatch for home and time was snatched in the midst of all this distress for a greeting in the same beautiful clear minute hand as usual   hospital st andrews saturday night 9 pm march 22 1863  my dearest brother and sisteri write from the dining hall now our hospital with eleven melanesians lying round me in extremity of peril  i buried two today in one grave and i baptized another now dying by my side  god has been pleased in his wisdom and mercy to send upon us a terrible visitation a most virulent form of dysentery  since this day fortnight i have scarce slept night or day but by snatching an hour here and there others are working quite as hard and all the good points of our melanesian staff are brought out as you may suppose  the best medical men cannot suggest any remedy  all remedies have been tried and failed  every conceivable kind of treatment has been tried in vain  there are in the hall the hospital now at this moment eleveneleven more in the little quadrangle better but in as anxious a state as can be and two more not at all well  i have sent all the rest on board to be out of the way of contagion how we go on i scarce know my good friend mr lloyd is here giving great help he is well acquainted with sickness and a capital nurse  i have felt all along that it would be good for us to be in trouble we could not always sail with a fair wind i have often said so and god has sent the trial in the most merciful way  what is this to the falling away of our baptized scholars  but it is a pitiful sight  how wonderfully they bear the agony of it  no groaning  when i buried those two children today my heart was full i durst not think but could only pray and believe and trust in him  god bless you  your loving brother  j c p  o lord correct me but with judgment   on the 25th two more were dead and buried without time to make coffins for thirteen still hung between life and death while fresh cases were sent from on board ship  mr pritt and mr palmer cooked nourishing food and prepared ricewater unceasingly while the others tended the sick and the primate returned from a journey to give his effective aid  on the night of the 30th a fifth died unexpectedly having only been ill a week the only scholar from pentecost island one of these lads when all hope was over was wrapped in his white winding sheet carried into the chapel and there baptized by the bishop with choked voice and weeping eyes  over those who had not faith enough to justify him in baptizing them he said the following prayers as he laid them in their graves  sentences  psalms from the burial service  forasmuch as it hath pleased thee o almighty god to take from amongst us the souls of these two children committed to our charge we therefore commit their bodies to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust humbly commending to thy fatherly mercy these and all other thy children who know not thee whom thou knowest who art the father and lord of all things in heaven and earth to whom be all praise and glory with thy son jesus christ and the holy spirit for ever and ever  amen  we humbly beseech thee most merciful god to remember for good the inhabitants of the islands of melanesia and specially we pray god by the grave of these children for the dwellers in vanua lava and ambrym that thou wouldest cause the light of the gospel to shine m their hearts  give unto thy servants grace in their sight that we may go forth in peace and return if it be thy will in safety to the honour and glory of thy name through jesus christ our lord  o almighty god father of mercy we cry unto thee in our sorrow and distress most humbly confessing that we have most justly provoked thy wrath and heavy indignation  we know o lord that this is a dispensation of mercy a gift from thee to be used as all things may be used to thy glory  yet o lord suffer not our unworthiness to hinder thy work of mercy  o lord look down from heaven visit with thy tender compassion thy children lying under thy hand in grievous sufferings of body restore them if it be thy good pleasure to health and strength or if it be thy good will to take them out of this world receive them to thy tender mercies for his blessed sake who died for all men thy son our lord  lords prayer  grace  this was written down for use in great haste in the same spirit that breathes through the account of the next death the entry dated on coleridge pattesons thirtysixth birthday april 1 1863 which must be transcribed though much of the detail of this time of trial has been omitted  sosaman died at 9 am this daya dear lad one of the banks islanders about ten or twelve years old  as usual i was kneeling by him closing his eyes in death  i can see his poor mothers face now  what will she say to me she who knows not the christians life in death  yet to him the poor unbaptized child what is it to him what a revelation  yes the names he heard at our lips were names of real things and real persons  there is another world  there is a god a father a lord jesus christ a spirit of holiness a love and glory  so let us leave him o father in thy hands who knowest him who knew not thee on earth  thy mercies never fail  thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created  i washed him and laid him out as usual in a linen sheet  how white it looked  so much more simple and touching than the coffinthe form just discernible as it lay where five had lain before and then i knelt down in our little chapel and i thank god i could still bless and praise him in my heart  how is it that i dont pray more  i pray in one sense less than usualam not so long on my knees  i hope it is that i am so worn out and so very very much occupied in tending the sick and dying but i am not sure  anyhow i am sure that i am learning at terrible cost lessons which it may be god would have taught me more gently if i had ears to hear  i have not in all things depended upon him and perpetually sought help from him  oh that my unworthiness may not hinder his work of mercy  if i live the retrospect of this most solemn time will i hope be very useful  i wonder if i ever went through such acute mental suffering and yet mind i feel perfectly hardened at timesquite devoid of sensibility  he said in another letter that he felt that if he relaxed his self command for one moment he should entirely break down  to him writing to his beloved home was what speaking nay almost thinking would be in another man it gave an outlet to his feeling and security of sympathy  there was something in his spiritual nature that gave him the faculty of realising the communion of saints in its fullest sense both with those on earth and in paradise and above all with his heavenly father so that he seems as complete an example as ever lived of the reality of that privilege in which too often we only express our belief  sosamans was the last death  on a fragment of pink paper bearing the date of the next day it is declared that an alleviation in the worst symptoms had taken place and that the faces and eyes were less haggard  oh if it be gods will to grant us now a great deliverance all glory be to him  the deliverance was granted  the next mail brought tidings of gladness   st andrews april 17 1863  my dearest sistersyou know the calm yet weary feeling that succeeds to the period of intense anxiety and constant watchfulness six dear children are taken from us as you know already  some twentyone others have been very ill nigh unto death  two or three are still weak but doing well  all the rest are convalescent  oh i look at them to see the loving bright smile again on their poor wan faces  i dont mind breaking down now yet i have experienced no decided reaction only i am very indolent like one who for six weeks has not had his usual allowance of sleep  what abundant cause we have for thankfulness all the many hours that i spent in that atmosphere and yet not a whit the worse for it  what a sight it was  what scenes of suffering  there seemed to be no end to it and yet there was always strength for the immediate work in hand  tending twentyfour sick after hurrying back from burying two dear lads in one grave or with a body lying in its white sheet in the chapel and once after a breathless watch of two hours while they all slept the sleep of opium for we dared almost anything to obtain some rest stealing at dead of night across the room to the figure wrapped so strangely in its blanket and finding it cold and stiff while one dying lay close by  it has been a solemn time indeed  and now the brightness seems to be coming back  i have not yet ceased to think of the probable consequences but speaking somewhat hastily i do not think that this will much retard the work  i may have to use some extra caution in some placeseg one of the two first lads brought from ambrym is dead one lad the only one ever brought from the middle of whitsuntide island is dead i must be careful there  the other four came from mota matlavo vanua lava w side and guadalcanar for the six who died came from six islands  one dear lad edmund quintal sixteen or seventeen years old was for a while in a critical state  fisher young a little older was very unwell for three or four days  they came from norfolk island  the last six weeks have been very unhealthy  we had an unusually hot dry summerquite a drought the wells for example were never so tried  there was also an unusual continuance of northeast winds our sultry close wind  and when the dry weather broke up the rain and damp weather continued for many days  great sickness prevailed in auckland and the country generally  the norfolk islanders now four in numberedwin nobbs gilbert christian fisher young and edmund quintalhave behaved excellently  oh how different i was at their age  it is pleasant indeed to see them so very much improved they are so industrious so punctual so conscientious  the fact seems to be that they wanted just what i do hope the routine of our life has suppliedcareful supervision advice and when needed reproof  they had never had any training at all  but there was something betterreligious feelingto work on and the life here has by gods blessing developed the good in them  i am very hopeful about then now  not mind that any one of them has a notion of teaching but they are acquiring habits which will enable them to be good examples in all points of moral conduct to those of the melanesians who are not already like b c  the head work will come byandby i dare say  april 22the storm seems to have passed though one or two are still very weak  but there are no active symptoms of disease  how mercifully god has dealt with us i have been very seedy for a few days and am so still  in spite of two teeth taken out a fortnight ago my whole jaw has been paining me much heavy cold and i cant get good sleep by reason of the pain and i want sleep much  i think i must go to the dentist again  you see we hope to sail in ten days or so and i want to be well  we have just washed and scrubbed the hall thoroughly and once again it ceases to be our hospital  that looks bright does not it  you must let all friends know about us for i shall not be able to write to many and perhaps i shall not have time to write at all  in the midst of all this i have so much work about the management of the mission farm and property and the st johns college estate and educational prospects  the southern cross was at sea again on may 2 and approved herself entirely to her owners satisfaction  moreover another clergyman had come on board for a trial trip the rev robert codrington a fellow of wadham oxford who brought the university culture which was no small personal pleasure to bishop patteson in the companion of his labours  so that the staff consisted of mr pritt mr kerr mr codrington mr palmer and mr atkin besides mr tilly whose management of the vessel left the bishop free from cares whenever his knowledge of the coast was not needed  some of the results of his leisure on the outward voyage here appear  i am glad i have read the accounts which bishop mackenzies sister sent me  i know more about it now  work and anxiety and necessity for action all came upon them so rapidly that there was but little time for forming deliberate plans  i can well realise the finding oneself surrounded with a hundred poor creatures diseased and hungered the multitude of questions how to feed lodge and clothe them  how far it is right to sanction their mode of life c  one thing i am glad to notice that the bishop abstained from all attempts to convey religious instruction because he was not sufficiently acquainted with the language to know what ideas he might or might not be suggesting  that was wise and yet how unlike many hotheaded men who rush with unintentional irreverence into very dangerous experiments  i confess as you know that there seems to me far too cumbrous and expensive and talkative a method employed in england for raising supplies for that mission and columbia honolulu c  i never think of all that fuss of the four universities and all the meetings and speeches without some shame  but united action will come in the train of real synodical action and if i understand aright the last convocation of canterbury accepted all that we are trying for taking the right view in the question of provinces metropolitans position of colonial churches joint action of the church at large c extension of episcopate in england  oh thanks be to god for it all what a work for this branch of the catholic church  how can people sit quiet not give their all  i like very much vaughans work on the epistle to the romans  that is the book to teach young students how to read their greek testament  accurate scholarship no private notions imported into the greek text  i should like to hear mr keble speak about the law underlying the superstitions of heathenism the way to deal with the perversions of truth c  somehow i get to marvel at and love that first book of hooker more and more  it is wonderful  it goes to the bottom of the matter and then at times it gives one to see something of the divine wisdom of the bible as one never saw it before  but i fear that i seek too much after a knowledge and understanding of principles of action which are attainable by a scholar and man of real reasoning power but which i am not able to make of practical use having neither the brains nor the goodness  this is what i really mean  may 20thany really good book on the new testament especially dealing critically with the greek text i certainly wish to have i feel that the great neglect of us clergy is the neglect of the continual study most critically and closely of the grammatical meaning of the hebrew and greek texts  oh that in old days i had made myself a good scholar  oh that i did really know hebrew and greek well  what a blessing and delight it would be now  i fear that i shall never be a good hebrew scholar i cant make time for it but a decent greek scholar i hope to be  i work away but alas i for want of time only by fits and starts at grammars and such a book as vaughans epistle to the romans an excellent specimen of the way to give legitimate help to the student  trenchs books i delight in  the revision by five clergymen is an assistance  there was a review in the quarterly the other day on the greek testament very nearly an excellent one  the ordinary use of folio commentaries i dont wish to depreciate but i think it far less valuable than the diligent study for oneself with the best grammatical aids of the original text  i always assume an acquaintance with the true mind and spirit of the church of england as a substratum of interpretation  i like westcotts book on the introduction to the study of the gospels  oh why when i sat evening after evening with our dear father did i not ask him on all these points much more than i did  he did talk of such things  but i suppose it is partly the impulse given to such studies by the tendency of present religious thought  yet ought it not to have been always put forward at eton and oxford that the close study of the text of the bible is the first duty of a christian scholar  i never really thought of it till i came out here and then other occupations crowded upon me and so it was too late to make myself a scholar  alas  now i really think nothing is so great a relaxation tome as a good book by trench or vaughan or ellicott or dr pusey and i do enjoy it  not that i can keep up my attention for very long so as to make it profitable but even then it is delightful only i must go over it again and so it is perhaps time wasted  but i greatly miss the intimate friend with whom to fix what i read by conversation and communication of mutual difficulties in understanding passages  i dont often forget points on which the judge and i have had a talk but what i read by myself i read too quickly and forget  i want to fix it by subsequent discussion and enquiry with a competent friend  if i have intelligent young men to read with that will almost do it will easily help me to remember what i have read  it wont be suggestive like the judges conversation yet if one tries to teach conscientiously one does learn a great deal  i am puzzled as to books for my norfolk islanders  i should like much the conversations on the catechism are they published separately  shall i ask miss yonge to give me a copy  and the plain commentary would be useful too if which i doubt it is plain enough   southern cross may 9 1863  my dear joanyou ask me about qualifications which a man had better possess for this mission so perhaps i had better ask you to enquire of cousin derwent coleridge and of ernest hawkins for letters written to them some six months ago in which if i remember rightly i succeeded as well as i am likely to do now in describing the class of men i should like some day to have  i dare say they have not kept the letters i forgot that because although they took me some little time to write they may have chucked them away naturally enough still if they have them and can find them it may be worth while for you to keep a copy by you to show to any person who wishes for information  it is not necessary at all that a man should have a taste for languages or a faculty of acquiring them  what i want now is not a linguist but a welltrained schoolmaster of black boys and men who will also put his hand to any kind of worka kindly gentle cheerful earnest fellow who will make light of all little inconveniences such as necessarily attend sea life c who is so much of a gentleman that he can afford to do any kind of work without being haunted by the silly thought that it is beneath him not his business  that is the fellow for me  he would have to learn one language the language of the particular class given over to him and i think that a person of any moderate ability might soon do this with our teaching  if i could get him to take an interest in the general science of language and to go into philological points of course his work would be lighter and he would have soon the advantage of knowing dialects cognate to that which he must know  but that is not necessary  the real thing is to train a certain number of lads in habits of attention punctuality tidiness c to teach them also upon a plan which i should show him to read and write  the religious instruction i should take and the closer investigation of the language too unless he showed a capacity for going into the nicer points of structure c  but somehow a cut and dried teaching machine of a man however methodical and good and conscientious wont do  there must be a vivacity an activity of mind a brightness about the man so that a lesson shall never be mere drudgery in short there must be a real love in the heart for the scholars that is the qualification  one man and one only i hope to have some day who ought to be able to learn scraps at least of many languages but he will have a different work to do  no work can be considered to be satisfactorily carried on while it depends on the life of any one man  someone to take my place will come i hope some day  he would have to go round the islands with me and acquire a knowledge of the whole field of work the wading and swimming the mode of dealing with fellows on a first meeting c he will not only have one class to look after but he must learn the same kind of lesson that i learnt under the primate where to get such a man im sure i dont know  he must be of standing and ability to be acceptable to the others should i die c c  so we need not speculate about him and the truth is i am not in any hurry to get men from home  we are educating ourselves lads here who will very likely learn to do this kind of work fairly well  mr palmer will i hope be ordained at christmas  young atkin will be useful some day  byandby if i can get one or two really firstrate men it will indeed be a great thing  but who knows anything of me in england  i dont expect a really able man to come out to work with me  they will go to other parts of the world kept more before the notice of the public by committees and meetings and speeches c and indeed i am very thankful for it  i am not old nor wise enough to be at the head of a party of really able men  i must be more fit to lead before i can ask men to follow  of course i know that the work if i chose to speak out is second to none in interest and importance and that very little comparatively is known about it in england  but it is evidently far better that it should go quietly on without attracting much notice and that we all should remain unknown at all events at present  by andby when by gods blessing things are more ripe for definite departments of work and men can have distinct duties at once assigned to them and our mode of carrying on the mission has been fairly tested then it will be high time to think about firstrate men  and presumptuous and strange as it may seem for me to say it a man confessedly secondrate unfit to hold a position with the best stamp of english clergymen i had rather not have  i can get the material cheaper and made to my own hand out here  some men are dull though good others cant get away from their book life and the proprieties others are donnish others are fine gentlemen others are weak in health most have preconceived and many mistaken views about heathenism and the way to deal with it some would come out with the notion that england and english clergymen were born to set the colonies right  how few would say theres a young man for the bishop only a secondclass man no scholar not remarkable in any way but he has learnt his work in a good school and will go out to him with the purpose of seeing how he carries on the work and learning from him i dont expect men worth anything to say this  of course i dont and yet you know joan i cant take them on any other terms  no i prefer taking promising lads here and training them up not with any pledge that i will employ them in the mission but with the promise of giving them every chance of becoming qualified for it  the voyage was much shorter than had been intended and its history is best summed up here   southern cross kohimarama aug 6 1863  my dear cousinthis date from this place will surprise you  we returned yesterday after a short voyage of only three months  i had arranged my plans for a long voyage hoping to revisit all our known islands and that more than once  we sailed to norfolk island thence at once to mota  i spent two days there and left the rev l pritt in charge of the station mr palmer being with him and the four norfolk islanders and several old scholars  i spent a fortnight in the banks archipelago returning some scholars and taking away others from divers islands and then went back to mota bringing some sixteen or seventeen lads to the central school  i found them all pretty well the whole island at peace people moving about everywhere unarmed and a large school being gathered together  i went off again to the south the new hebrides group returning scholars who had been in new zealand purchasing yams for axes and iron c to supply the large number of scholars at mota  the season had been unfavourable and the crop of yams in some islands had almost failed  however in another fortnight i was again at mota with some six or seven tons of yams  i found things lamentably changed  a great mortality was going on dysentery and great prostration of strength from severe influenza  but of those not actually boarding at the station the state was very sad indeed  about twentyfive adults were dead already several of them regular attendants at school of whom we were very hopeful  i spent two days and a half in going about the island the wet incessant the ground steaming and reeking with vegetable exhalations  during those days twentyseven adults died fiftytwo in all and many many more were dying emaciated coughing fainting no constitutional vigour of body nor any mutton broth or beef tea or jellies or chickens or wine c  mr pritt did what he could and more than i thought could have been done but what could be done  how could nourishing food be supplied to dozens of invalids living miles off refusing to obey directions in a country which supplies no food to rally the strength of persons in illness  i decided to remove the whole party at once explaining to the people that we were not afraid to share with them the risk of dying but that if mr pritt and the others died there were no teachers left  i felt that our banks island scholars must be removed and that at once lest they should die  i could not send the vessel to the solomon islands without me for mr tilly was completely laid up and unable to move from rheumatic gout and no one else on board knows those languages  i could not leave the party at mota in the sickness and i could not well send the vessel to port patteson for a time for the danger was imminent  so i took them all away in all thirtynine  but now the vessel was full more than sixty on board and i had reckoned upon an empty vessel in the hot santa cruz and solomon island latitudes  moreover the weather was extraordinarily unfavourabledamp foul winds squalls calms unhealthy weather mr tilly was being greatly pulled down and everything seemed to point out that the voyage ought not to be long  i made my mind up took back the solomon island scholars and with heavy sea and baffling winds and one short gale sailed back to new zealand  how mysteriously our plans are overruled for good  i came back to hear of the war and to learn to be thankful for my small very young and very manageable party  thirtythree banks islanders the baptized party and select lads from their islands one new caledonian four ysabel lads constitute this summers melanesian school  dont be disappointed i was at first but i had the comfort of having really no alternative  i had indeed a great desire to make a thorough visitation of lepers island and santa cruz especially but the wind usually so fair was dead against me we had so to speak no trade winds and i had to give it up  it was certainly my duty to get to the south with my invalids as soon as i could and alter my plans which you know always are made with a view to divers modifications being rendered necessary  training the baptized scholars and putting into shape such knowledge as i have of melanesian tongues that made a good summer programme as i was obliged to content myself with a small party gathered from but few islands  concentration v diffusion i soon began to think a very good thing  well so it is and now i see great reason to be thankful  why do we not always give thanks whether we see the reason or not  the vessel behaves admirably  i have written to jem at length and he must be applied to for my account of her  pray tell mr keble all this  i have a most valuable letter from dr moberly a great delight and honour to me  it is very kind of him to write and his view of church matters is really invaluable no papers can give that which his letter gives and only he and a very few others could give an opinion which i so greatly value  he speaks hopefully of church matters in general and there are great reasons surely for thankfulness and hope  yet men such as he see far and wide and to their great hearts no very violent storms are caused by such things as sorely trouble others  he sees the presumption and weakness the vain transitory character of that phase of modern thought which bishop colenso represents and confidently expects its speedy disappearance  but it does try the earnest while it makes shipwreck of the frivolous and exercises the faith and humility of all  even a very poor scholar can see that his reasoning is most inconclusive and his reading superficial and inferences illogical  god bless you my dear cousin  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson missionary bishop   perhaps this is the fittest place to give mr tillys description of the bishop in his voyages  my acquaintance with the late bishop patteson began at port patteson in the banks islands in 1861  he went with us in hms cordelia to the solomon islands and after being together some two months we again left him at port patteson on our way back to auckland  during the time he was on board the cordelia it was arranged that i was to sail the new vessel the present southern cross then about to be built by the messrs wigram and the size internal arrangements c were told me by him  he did not trouble me with much detail referring me almost altogether to bishop selwyn and gave no written directions the little he said i carefully noted observing that he spoke as with a thorough knowledge of the subject so far as i could be a judge as to seagoing qualities capacity c and to the best of my recollection i found that while the vessel was building these few directions were the main ones to be kept in view  we entered auckland harbour from england early on the morning of february 28 1863 and hove to off the north head to wait for the bishop coming off from kohimarama before going up the harbour  it had been blowing hard outside the night before from the ne and there was still much wind and some sea even in the harbour  i was much struck by his appearance and manner  having to launch his boat through a surf at kohimarama beach he had only on a shirt and trousers and was of course drenched  he stepped on board more like a sailor than a clergyman and almost immediately made one or two sailorlike remarks about the vessel as if he understood her qualities as soon as he felt her in motion and he was quite right in what he said  before the building of the present vessel he had i am told navigated at different times to and from the islands of his capacity in this respect therefore others who knew him there can speak during the time i remained in the southern cross he never in any way to the best of my recollection interfered in the navigation or management of the vessel but i came to knowalmost at oncethat his general planning of a voyage knowledge of local courses and distances the method by which it could be done most quickly and advantageously and the time required to do it in were thorough and in fact i suppose that almost without knowing it in all this i was his pupil and to the last felt the comfort of his advice or assistance as eg when looking out together from aloft he has seen shoal water more quickly than myself or has decided whether certain doubtful appearances ahead were or were not sufficient to make us alter our course c and always speaking as no one who was what sailors call a landsman could have done  there was of course always a great deal of boat work much of it to be done with a loaded boat in a seaway requiring practical knowledge of such matters and i do not remember any accidents such as staving a boat on a reef swamping c in all those years and he invariably brought the boat out when it was easy for the vessel to pick her up a matter not sufficiently understood by many people  this was where mr atkins usefulness was conspicuous  mr atkin was a fearless boatman and the knowledge of boating he gained with us at sea was well supplemented when in auckland where he had a boat of his own which he managed in the most thorough manner auckland being at times a rough place for boating  he mr atkin pulled a good and strong oar and understood well how to manage a boat under sail much better in fact than many sailors who are not always distinguished in that respect  his energy and the amount of work he did himself were remarkable his manner was quiet and undemonstrative  he took all chargeit may in a manner be saidof the boys on board the vessel regulated everything concerning meals sleeping arrangements c how much food had to be bought for them at the different islands what trade ie hatchets beads c it was necessary to get before starting on a voyage calculated how long our supply of water would last and in fact did so much on board as left the master of the vessel little to do but navigate  with regard to the loss the mission has sustained in mr atkin speaking from my personal knowledge of his invaluable services on a voyage i can safely say there is no one here now fitted to take his place  he had always capital health at sea and was rarely seasick almost the only one of the party who did not suffer in that way  and his loss will be the more felt now as those who used to help in the boat are now otherwise employed as teachers c and as norfolk island is a bad place to learn boating there is great need of some one to take his place for a good boats crew is a necessity in this work as may be readily understood when the boat is away sometimes for the greater part of the day pulling and sailing from place to place  at those places where the bishop landed alone mr atkin gradually acquired the experience which made him so fit to look after the safety of the boat and crew  in this manner he next to the bishop became best known to the natives throughout the islands and was always looked for in fact at many places they two were perhaps only recognised or remembered  bishop patteson was hardly what could be called a good sailor in one sense of the word rough weather did not suit him and although i believe seldom if ever actually seasick he was now and then obliged to lie down the greater part of the day or during bad weather  he used to read and write a great deal on board and liked to take brisk walks up and down the deck talking to whoever happened to be there he was orderly and methodical on board liked to see things in their places and was most simple in all his habits  he always brought a good stock of books on board which we all made use of but very few clothes  the living on board was most simple much the same as the crew those in the cabin waiting on themselves carrying no steward until gradually boys used to volunteer to do the washing up c  school with all the boys was kept up when practicable but the bishop was always sitting about among them on the deck talking to one and another and having classes with him in the cabin  there were regular morning and evening native and english prayers  the sermons on sundays were specially adapted for the sailors and listened to with marked attention as indeed they well might be being so earnest simple and suitable  speaking for myself i used to look forward to the voyage as the time when i should have the privilege of being much with him for some months  while on shore at kohimarama i saw but comparatively little of him except at meals but during the voyage i saw of course a great deal of him and learned much from himlearned to admire his unselfishness and simplicity of mode of life and to respect his earnestness and abilities  his conversation on any subject was free and full and those on the few nights when quietly at anchor they could be enjoyed more will be long remembered  of his manner to melanesians others will no doubt say enough but i may be excused for mentioning one scene that very much struck me and of which i am now the only white one left who was present at it  we were paying a visit for the first time to an island andthe vessel being safe in the offingthe bishop asked me if i would go with them as he sometimes did on similar occasions  we pulled in to a small inner islet among a group where a number of say 200 natives were collected on the beach  seeing they looked as if friendly he waded on shore without hesitation and joined them the reception was friendly and after a time he walked with them along the beach we in the boat keeping near  after a while we took him into the boat again and lay off the beach a few yards to be clear of the throng and be able to get at the things he wanted to give them they coming about the boat in canoes and this is the fact i wished to notice viz the look on his face while the intercourse with them lasted  i was so struck with it quite involuntarily for i had no idea of watching for anything of the sort but it was one of such extreme gentleness and of yearning towards them  i never saw that look on his face again i suppose because no similar scene ever occurred again when i happened to be with him  it was enough in itself to evoke sympathy and as we pulled away though the channel was narrow and winding yet as the water was deep we discussed the possibility of the schooner being brought in there at some future time  i am quite aware of my inability to do justice to that side of the bishops character of which owing to the position in which i stood to him as master of the mission vessel i have been asked to say a few words  there are others who know far better than myself what his peculiar qualifications were  his conduct to me throughout the time was marked by an unvarying confidence of manner and kindliness in our everyday intercourse until gradually i came to think i understood the way in which he wished things done and acted in his absence with an assurance of doing his wishes so far as i could which i never had attained to before with anyone else and never shall again  and speaking still of my own experience i can safely say the love we grew to feel for him would draw such services from us if such were needed as no fear of anyones reproof or displeasure ever could do and perhaps this was the greatest privilege or lesson derived from our intercourse with him that love casteth out fear  tiros  capel tilly   auckland october 28 1872  this letter to mr derwent coleridge follows up the subject of the requisites for missionary work   southern cross kohimarama august 8 1863  my dear cousinthank you for a very kind letter which i found here on my return from a short three months voyage in melanesia  you will i am sure give me any help that you can and a young man trained under your eye would be surely of great use in this work  i must confess that i distrust greatly the method adopted still in some places of sending out men as catechists and missionaries simply because they appear to be zealous and anxious to engage in missionary work  a very few men well educated who will really try to understand what heathenism is and will seek by gods blessing to work honestly without prejudice and without an indiscriminating admiration for all their own national tastes and modes of thoughta few such men agreeing well together and cooperating heartily will probably be enabled to lay foundations for an enduring work  i do not at all wish to apply hastily for menfor any kind of mento fill up posts that i shall indeed be thankful to occupy with the right sort of men  i much prefer waiting till it may please god to put it into the head of some two or three more men to join the missionyears hence it may be  we need only a few i dont suppose that ten years hence i should if alive ever wish to have more than six or eight clergy because their work will be the training of young natives to be themselves teachers and i pray god missionaries in due time  i am so glad that you quite feel my wants and sympathise with me  it is difficult to give reasonsintelligible to you all at a distancefor everything that i may say and do because the circumstances of this mission are so very peculiar  but you know that i have always the primate to consult with as to principles and i must for want of a better course judge for myself as to the mode of working them out in detail  two plans are open for obtaining a supply of young men  first i may receive some few readytrained men who nevertheless will have to learn the particular lessons that only can be taught here on the spot  secondly i may have youths of say sixteen to eighteen years of age sent out from such a school as stephen hawtreys for example who will come with a good general knowledge of ordinary things and receive a special training from myself  i think too that new zealand will now and then supply an earnest activeminded young fellowwho will be a greek or latin scholar yet may find a useful niche in which he may be placed  at present i have means only to maintain one or two such persons and this because i am able to use the money my dear father left me for this purpose  indeed i have no other use for it  the money received on public account would not keep the mission in its present state and the expenditure ought to be increased by maintaining more scholars and teachers  i dont forget what you say about the philological part of my business  my difficulty is this mainly that it is next to impossible to secure a few hours of continuous leisure  you can have no idea of the amount of detail that i must attend to seeing everything almost and having moreover not a few new zealand matters to employ my time besides my melanesian work  i have i suppose a considerable amount of knowledge of melanesian tongues unknown by name to anyone else perhaps i quite feel that this ought not to die with me if anything should suddenly happen to me  i hoped this summer to put together something but now there is this maori war and an utterly unsettled state of things  i may have to leave new zealand with my melanesians almost any day  but i will do what i can and as soon as i can again i find it so hard to put on paper what i know  i could talk to a philologist and i fancy that i could tell him much that would interest him but i never wrote anything beyond a report in my life and it is labour and grief to me to write themi cant get on as a scribe at all  then for two or three years i have not been able to visit some islands whose language i know just enough of to see that they supply a valuable link in the great polynesian chain  one might almost get together all the disjecta membra and reconstruct the original polynesian tongue  but chiefly of course my information about melanesia may be interesting  i have begun by getting together numerals in forty quite unknown dialects  i will give at all events short skeleton grammars too of some  but we have no time why i have from five hundred to two thousand or more carefully ascertained words in each of several dialects and of course these ought to be in the hands of you all at home  i know that and have known it for years but how to do it without neglecting the daily necessary work  again the real genius of the language whatever it may be is learned when i can write down what i overhear boys saying when they are talking with perfect freedom and therefore idiomatically about sharks cocoanuts yams c  all translations must fail to represent a language adequately and most of all the translation into a heathen language of religious expressions  they have not the ideas and the language cannot be fairly seen in the early attempts to make it do an unaccustomed work  i remember more of you and my aunt than you suppose  even without the photograph which i am very glad to havethank you for it i could have found you and aunt out in a crowd  i cant say that i remember my own generation so well  thank you again for writing so kindly  always my dear cousin  affectionately yours  j c patteson missionary bishop   the next mail carried the reply to johannas sympathy with the troubles of the time of sickness in the early part of the year   august 28 1863  my dear joanvery full of comfort to have all your kind loving thoughts and words about our sickness  i know you thought and talked much about it and indeed it was a very heavy visitation viewed in one way though in another and i really cant analyze the reason why there was not only peace and calmness but eyen happiness  i suppose one may be quite sure one is receiving mercies and be thankful for them although one is all the time like a man in a dream  i can hardly think of it all as real  but i am sure that god was very very merciful to us  there was no difficulty anywhere about the making known the death of the lads to their relatives  i did not quite like the manner of the people at guadalcanar from which island poor porasi came and i could not get at the exact place from which taman came though i landed on the same island north and south of the beach from which i brought him  i do not at all think that any interruption of the work has been occasioned by it  it was very unfortunate that i could not last voyage make visits and long ones too as i had hoped to many islands where in the voyage before i had met with such remarkable tokens of goodwill especially lepers island and santa cruz but i think that if i can make a regular good round next time it may be all as well  i imagine that in a great many islands it would now take a good deal to shake their confidence in us  at the same time it was and is a matter of great regret that i did not at once follow up the openings of the former year and by returning again to the new hebrides and solomon islands as in the contemplated six months voyage i intended to do strengthen the good feeling now existing moreover many scholars who were here last year would have come again had i revisited them and picked them up again  but the mota sickness the weather and mr tillys illness made it more prudent to return by what is on the whole the shorter route ie to the west of new caledonia  you should have been with me when as i jumped on shore at mota i took parasklois father by the hand  that dear lad i baptized as he lay in his shroud in the chapel when the whole weight of the trial seemed as it were by a sudden revelation to manifest itself and thoroughly overwhelmed and unnerved me  i got through the service with the tears streaming down my cheeks and my voice half choked he was his fathers pride some seventeen years old  a girl ready chosen for him as his wife  it is all well bishop he died well i know you did all you could it is all well  he trembled all over and his face was wet with tears but he seemed strangely drawn to us and if he survives this present epidemic his sons death may be to him the means in gods hands of an eternal life  most touching is it not this entire confidence  at aruas the small island close to valua from which dear sosaman came it was just the same rather different at the west side of vanua lava where they did not behave so well and where as i heard afterwards there had been some talk of shooting me but nothing occurred while i was on shore with them to alarm me  at ambrym i landed with talsil joval from the same place had died a great crowd all friendly walked into the village and sat down speechifying by the principal man a presentation to me of a small pig but such confidence that this man came back with me on board where i gave him presents  i much wished to land at tamans place but could not do so though i tried twice without causing great delay  i could have brought away any number of scho1ars from almost any of these islands probably from all  i have great reason to regret not having revisited ambrym and other islands but i think that a year hence if alive i may feel that it is better as it is  these norfolk islanders four of them i take as my children for i cant fairly charge them except edwin nobbs to the mission and i wish to give norfolk island some help as it is really though not by letters patent part of my charge  edwin nobbs is a thoroughly good fellow and fisher young is coming on very well  now my dearest joan goodbye  my hats will come no doubt in good time my present chapeau is very seedy very limp and crooked and battered as near green as black almosta very good advertisement of the poverty of the mission  but if i go about picking up gold in australia i shall come out in silk cassock and all the paraphernaliavery episcopal indeed  your loving brother  j c patteson   herewith was a letter for dr moberly  st andrews college kohimarama august 29 1863  my dear dr moberlythank you for a very kind and most interesting letter written in may  i know that you can with difficulty find time to write at all and thank you all the more  if you knew the real value to us of such letters as you have now sent containing your impressions and opinions of things in general men books c you would be well rewarded for your trouble i assure you  to myself i must say to you such letters are invaluable they are a real help to me not only in that they supply information from a very good authority on many questions which i much desire to understand but even more because i rise up or kneel down after reading them and think to myself how little such men who so think of me really know me how different i ought to be and then it is another help to me to try and become by gods grace less unlike what you take me to be indeed you must forgive me for writing thus freely  i live very much alone as far as persons of the same language modes of thought c are concerned  i see but little strange as it may seem to you even of my dear primate  we are by land four or five miles apart and meet perhaps once or twice a month for a few minutes to transact some necessary business  his time is of course fully occupied and i never leave this place very seldom even this little quadrangle and when other work does not need immediate attention a state of things at which i have not arrived as yet there are always a dozen new languages to be taken up translations to be made c  so that when i read a letter which is full of just such matters as i think much of i naturally long to talk on paper freely with the writer were i in england i know scarcely any place to which i would go sooner than winchester hursley otterbourne and then i should doubtless talk as now i write freely  all that you write of the state of mind generally in england on religious questions is most deeply interesting  what a matter of thankfulness that you can say with all the sins and shortcomings that are amongst us there is an unmistakeable spreading of devotion and the wish to serve god rightly on the part of very many  then the church preferments have lately been good bishop ellicott one of your four coadjutors in the revision of the a v especially i know some part of his commentary and am very glad to find that you speak so very highly of it  what a contrast to be sure between such work as his and jowetts and stanleys  jowett actually avows a return to the old exploded theory of the inaccurate use of language in the greek testament  this must make men distrust him sooner or later as an interpreter of scripture  i thank you heartily for your offer of sending me bishop ellicotts commentary but i hardly like you to send me so valuable a gift  what if you substitute for it a copy of what you have written yourself not less valuable to me and less expensive to you  i hardly like to write to ask favours of such people as bishop ellicott i mean i have no right to do so yet i almost thought of asking him to send a copy of his commentaries to us for our library  i have ventured to write to dean trench and i am pretty sure that mr keble will send me his life of bishop wilson but pray act as you wish  i am very grateful to you for thinking of it at all and all such books whether yours or his will be used and valued i can undertake to say  my good friend kidding knows that i was alas no scholar at eton or oxford  i have sought to remedy this in some measure as far as the greek testament is concerned and there are some excellent books which help one much yet i can never make myself a good scholar i fear one among many penalties i pay for want of real industry in old days  miss yonge will hear from my sisters and you from her i have no doubt my very scanty account of a very uninteresting voyage  i see everywhere signs of a change really extraordinary in the last few years  i can tell no stories of sudden conversions striking effects c  but i know that in twenty thirty perhaps forty places where a year or two ago no white man could land without some little uncertainty as to his reception i can feel confident now of meeting with friends i can walk inlanda thing never dreamt of in old days sleep ashore put myself entirely into their hands and meet with a return of the confidence on their part  we have too more dialects talk or find interpreters in more places our object in coming to them is more generally knownand in mota and two or three other small islands of the banks group there is almost a system of instruction at work  the last voyage was a failure in that i could not visit many islands nor revisit some that i longed to land at for the second or third time  but i dont anticipate any difficulty in reestablishing d v all the old familiarity before long  no doubt it is all humanly speaking hazardous where so much seems to depend upon the personal acquaintance with the people  byandby i hope to have some young man of character and ability enough to allow of his being regarded as my probable successor who may always go with menot stop on any one islandbut learn the kind of work i have to do then when i no longer can do the work it will be taken up by a man already known to the various islanders  i have not touched on many points in your letter  again thank you for it it is very kind of you to write  i must send a line to dr eidding  i am my dear dr  moberly  yours very truly  j c patteson bishop   the next of the closely written sheets that every mail carried was chiefly occupied with the maori war and apostasy on which this is not the place to enter until the point where more personal reflections begin  how all this makes me ponder about my own special work i need not say  there is not the complication of an english colony it is true that makes a great difference  my own feeling is that one should teach positive truth the plain message of christianity not attacking prejudices  conviction as it finds its way into the heart by the truth recommending itself will do the work of casting out the old habits  i do not mean to say that the devil is not in a special way at work to deceive people to follow lying delusions  but all error is a perversion of truth it has its existence negatively only as being a negation of truth  but god is truth and therefore truth is   now this is practically to be put it seems to me in this way  error exists in the mind of man whom god has created as a perversion of truth his faculties are constructed to apprehend and rest satisfied with truth  but his faculties are corrupted and the devil supplies a false caricature of truth and deceives him to apprehend and rest satisfied with a lie  but inasmuch as his nature though damaged is not wholly ruined by the fall therefore it is still not only possible for him to recognise positive truth when presented to him but he will never rest satisfied with anything elsehe will be restless and uneasy till he has found it  it is because i feel that it is more natural to man to follow truth than error natural being understood to mean correspondent to the true nature that i believe the right thing is to address oneself to the principle in a man which can and will recognise truth  truth when recognised expels error  but why attack error without positively inculcating truth  i hope it does not bore you for me to write all this  but i wish you to learn all that may explain my way of dealing with these questions  the next day october 25 a headache gives the bishop a reason for indulging himself while waiting for his pupils in calling up and setting down a realisation of his sisters new home at st mary church where for the time he seems to go and live with them so vividly does he represent the place to himself  his first return to his own affairs is a vision that once more shows his unappeased craving for all appliances for glory and for beauty in the worship of god  i may some day have a connection with mary church marbles sometimes i have a visionbut i must live twenty years to see more than a visionof a small but exceedingly beautiful gothic chapel rich inside with marbles and stained glass and carved stalls and encaustic tiles and brass screen work  i have a feeling that a certain use of really good ornaments may be desirable and being on a very small scale it might be possible to make a very perfect thing some day  there is no notion of my indulging such a thought  it may come some day and most probably long after i am dead and gone  it would be very foolish to spend money upon more necessary things than a beautiful chapel at present when in fact i barely pay my way at all  and yet a really noble church is a wonderful instrument of education if we think only of the lower way of regarding it  well you have a grand church and it is pleasant to think of dear dear father having laid the stone and of cousin george  what would he say now to convocation and synods and the rapid progress of the organisation of the church  i think that what you say fan about my overvaluing the worlds opinion is very true  selfconsciousness and a very foolish sinful vanity always have been and are great sources of trial to me  how often i have longed for that simplicity and truthfulness of character that we saw so beautifully exemplified in our dear father  how often i think that it is very good for me that i am so wanting in all personal gifts  i should be intolerable  i tell you this not to foster such feelings by talking of them but because we wish to know and be known to each other as we are  it is a very easy thing to be a popular preacher here perhaps anywhere  you know that i never write a really good sermon but i carry off platitudes with a sort of earnest delivery tolerably clear voice and with all the prestige of being a selfdevoted missionary bishop  bless their hearts if they could see me sipping a delicious cup of coffee with some delightful book by my side and some of my lads sitting with me all of them really loving one and glad to do anything for one  a less selfconscious person could do what i can hardly do without danger  i see my name in a book or paper and then comes at once a struggle against some craving after praise  i think i know the fault but i dont say i struggle against it as i ought to do  it is very hard therefore for me to write naturally about work in which i am myself engaged  but i feel that a truthful account of what we see and hear ought to be given and yet i never speak about the mission without feeling that i have somehow conveyed a false impression   again there was a time of sickness  the weather alternated between keen cutting winds and stifling heat and there was much illness among the colonists as well as a recurrence of the dreadful disease of the former year among the scholars of st andrews though less severe and one boy died after fourteen days sickness while two pulled through with difficulty  in the midst came the ember week when mr palmer was ordained deacon and then the bishop collapsed under ague and spent the morning of christmas day in bed but was able to get up and move into chapel for the celebration and afterwards to go into hall and see the scholars eat their christmas dinner  in the letter he wrote in the latter part of the day he confessed that he felt older and less springy though as he added there was good reason for it in the heavy strain that there had been upon him throughout the year though his native scholars were all that he could desire  a few days holiday and change at the primates brought back spirits and strength but the question whether under any circumstances new zealand would be a safe residence for the great body of melanesian scholars was becoming doubtful and it seemed well to consider of some other locality  besides it was felt to be due to the supporters of the mission in australia to tell them personally how great had been the progress made since 1855 and accordingly on one of the first days of february bishop patteson embarked in a mail steamer for sydney but he was obliged to leave six of his lads in a very anxious state with a recurrence of dysentery  however the governor sir george grey had lent his place on the island of kawau thirty miles north of auckland to the party so that there was good hope that change would restore the sick  fancy me says the journal of february 6 on board a screw steamer 252 feet long with the best double cabin on board for my own single use the manager of the company being anxious to show me every attention eating away at all sorts of made dishes puddings c and lounging about just as i please on soft red velvet sofas and cushions  the rest and good living were the restorative he needed and in spite of anxiety about the patients at home he enjoyed and profited by it  on february 6 sydney was reached but the bishop sailed on at once for his farthest point  at melbourne on the 11th he quaintly declares after describing his kind reception i feel at present a stranger among strangers no new thing to me especially if they are black and begin by offering me cocoanut instead of bread and butter  this place looks too large for comfortlike a section of london busy bustling moneymaking  there are warm hearts somewhere amid the great stores and banks and shops i dare say  but you know it feels a little strange and especially as i think it not unlikely that a regular hearty church feeling may not be the rule of the place  still i am less shy than i was and with real gentlemen feel no difficulty in discussing points on which we differ  it is the vulgar uneducated fellow that beats me  the melanesians laugh as you may at it are naturally gentlemanly and courteous and wellbred  i never saw a gent in melanesia though not a few downright savages  i vastly prefer the savage  melbourne was however to be taken on the return and he went on to adelaide where bishop short and the clergy met him at the port and he was welcomed most heartily  the diocesan synod assembled to greet him and presented an address and there were daily services and meetings when great interest was excited and tangibly proved by the raising of about £250  he was perfectly astonished at the beauty and fertility of the place and the exceeding luxuriance of the fruit one bunch of grapes had been known to weigh fourteen pounds  as to the style of living with all ordinary english comforts and attendance he saysi feel almost like a fish out of water and yet i cant help enjoying it  one very easily resumes old luxurious habits and yet the thought of my dear boys sick as i fear some must be helps to keep me in a sober state of mind  on st matthews day he assisted at an ordination and on the 27th returned to melbourne for three weeks and thence to sydney  his time was so taken up that his letters are far more scanty and hurried than usual  i have been running no little risk of being spoilt and i dont say that i have come off uninjured  in melbourne i was told by the dean the bishop is in england and by judge pohlman an excellent good man that they remembered no occasion during the twentytwo years of sojourn before melbourne was more than a village when so much interest had been shown in christian work especially mission work this is a thing to be very thankful for  i felt it my duty to speak strongly to them on their own duties first to aborigines secondly to chinese of whom some 40000 live in victoria thirdly to melanesians  i did not aim only at getting money for melanesia i took much higher ground than that  but the absence of the ordinary nonsense about startling conversions rapid results c and the matteroffact unsentimental way of stating the facts of heathenism and the way to act upon it did no doubt produce a very remarkable effect  i need not tell you that i did pray for strength to make good use of such unexpected and very unusual opportunities  crowded meetings nothing before like it in melbourne or the provinces  i did not feel nervous much to my surprise i really wonder at it i had dreaded it much  it was a sight to see st georges hall crowded children sitting on the floor platform anywhere and very many adults about 500 besides  now you know my old vanity  thank god i dont think it followed me very much here  there was a strong sense of a grand opportunity and the need of grace to use it  the enthusiasm at victoria resulted in 350 pounds and pledges of future assistance and at sydney there was the like grand meeting the like address and hearty response and the churches of australia pledged themselves to bear the annual expenses of the voyages of the southern cross  a number of young clerks and officials too united in an arrangement by which she could be insured high as was the needful rate  the preaching and speeches produced an immense feeling and the after review of the expedition is thus recorded  as for my sermons in australia i found to my surprise that every minute was so occupied that i could not make time to write and as for doing so in new zealand before i started why i systematized and put into the printers hands in about four months grammars c more or less complete of seventeen languages working up eight or ten more in ms  i had to preach extempore for the most part i did not at all like it but what could i do  sermons and speeches followed like hailat least one sometimes two on weekdays and three on sundays  i preached on such points as i had often talked out with the primate and sir william and illustrated principles by an occasional statement of facts drawn from missionary experience  now old fan as you know the misery of selfconsciousness and conceit clings to me  i cant as dear old father could tell you what actually occurred without doing myself harm in the telling of it  it pleased god to make me able to say all through what i think it was good for people to hear  all meetings and services with a few very few exceptions from heavy rains c were crowded  i could not in a few minutes speak with any degree of completeness on subjects which for years had occupied my thoughts i was generally about an hour and a half occasionally longeri tried to be shorter but people were attentive and interested all through  at melbourne it was said that 1500 children at a meeting for them were present and 500 adults including many of the most educated people  all children included were as still as mice for an hour and a half except occasional cheers  but generally there was little excitement  i did not as you can suppose take the sensation line spoke very rapidly for i had no time to sparebut clearly and quietly sometimes gravely sometimes with exceeding earnestness and exposed sophistries and fallacies and errors about the incapacity of the black races c  there were times when i lost all sense of nervousness and self and only wished that 10000 people had been present for i felt that i was speaking out face to face plain simple words of truth  the effect at the time was no doubt very remarkable  the dean of melbourne eg said publicly that no such earnestness in religious matters had ever been exhibited there  the plan of mission work was simple practicable commended itself to hardheaded men of business many came to hear who had been disgusted with the usual sentiment alism and twaddle the absence of knowledge of human nature the amount of conventional prejudice c  they were induced to come by friends who represented that this was something quite different and these men went away convinced in many cases seconding resolutions and paying subscriptions  i said what was true that i was the mouthpiece of the bishop of new zealand that i could speak freely of the plan of the mission for it was not my plan c  how i was carried through it all i cant say i was unusually well looked and felt bright and really after a while enjoyed it though i was always glad when my share in the speechifying was over  yet i did feel it a blessing and a privilege to stand up there and speak out and i did speak out and told them their plain duties not appealing to feelings but aiming at convincing the judgment  i told 1500 people in church at sydney i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say  do you know fan i almost feel that if i live a few years i ought to write a book unless i can get the primate to do it  so much that is selfevident to us i now see to be quite unknown to many good educated men  i dont mean a silly book but a very simple statement of general principles of christian work showing the mode that must be adopted in dealing with men as partakers of a common nature coupled with the many modifications and adaptations to circumstances which equally require special gifts of discernment and wisdom from on high  then occasional narratives by way of illustration to clench the statement of principles might be introduced but i cant write what i might write if i chose folios of mere events without deducing from them some maxims for christian practice  the impression produced was deep and lasting at all the australian capitals including brisbane  a plan was even set on foot for transferring a part of the melanesian school to a little island not far from the coast of queensland in a much warmer climate than kohimarama where it was thought australian natives might be gathered in  here is the description of the place written a day or two after the return to new zealand   st andrews april 27 1864  my dear cousini returned on the 24th from australia  i visited the dioceses of adelaide melbourne sydney and brisbane everywhere i met with great encouragement and indeed i thank god that as i had hoped the special work of the mission became the means of exciting unusual interest in the work of the church generally  it was a great opportunity a great privilege in the crowded meetings to tell people face to face their duties to stand up as the apologist of the despised australian black and the chinese golddigger and the melanesian islander  all the primate had taught mewhat heathenism is how to deal with it the simple truisms about the common sin common redemption the capacity latent in every man because he is a man and not a fallen angel nor a brute beast the many conventional errors on mission rather ministerial workmany many things i spoke of very fully and frequently  i felt it was a great responsibility  how strange that i forgot all my nervous dread and only wished there could be thousands more present for i knew that i was speaking words of truth of hope and love and god did mercifully bless much that he enabled me to say and mens hearts were struck within them though indeed i made no effort to excite them  much may result from it  we may have a branch school on the sw of curtis island on the east coast of queensland healthy watered wooded with anchorage about 25° s latitude a fair wind to and from some of the islands to which place i could rapidly carry away sick persons  there i could convey two hundred or more scholars in the same time required to bring sixty to new zealand there yams can be grown there it may be gods will that a work may be commenced at length among the remnant that is left of the australian blacks  the latter consideration is very strongly urged upon me by the united voice of the australian churches by none more strongly than by the bishop of sydney  i dare to hope that the communion of the australian and new zealand churches will be much strengthened by the mission as a link what blessings what mercies  this will not involve an abandonment of st andrews but the work must expand  i think australia will supply near 1000 pounds a year perhaps more before long  to teach me that all is in his hands we have again had a visitation from dysentery  it has been very prevalent everywhere no medical men remember such a season  we have lost from consumption two and from dysentery six this year in fourteen months not less than fourteen more than in all the other years put together  marvellous to relate all our old baptized and confirmed scholars are spared to us  goodbye and god ever bless and keep you  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson bishop   one of these deaths was that of kareambat the little new caledonian confided to the bishop of new zealand by poor basset  he had been christened on the previous epiphany  no doubt this grief on coming home increased the effect of this year of trial  indeed even on the voyage there had been this admission somehow i dont feel right with all this holiday i have worked really very hard but change of work is the best holiday  i dont feel springy  i am not so young as i was thats the truth of it and this life is not likely to be a long one  yet when used up for this work absence of continual anxiety and more opportunity of relaxation may carry a man on without his being wholly useless  the maori war was a constant grief and anxiety to all the friends on shore and there was thus evidently much less elasticity left to meet the great shock that was preparing for the voyagers in the expedition of 1864  mr codrington was not of the party having been obliged to go to england to decide whether it was possible to give himself wholly to the mission and the staff therefore consisted of mr pritt mr kerr and mr palmer with mr joseph atkin whose journal his family have kindly put at my disposal  the endeavour was to start after the ascension day communion but things were not forward enough  may was not however very far advanced before the southern cross was at sea  on may 17 norfolk island was visited and edwin nobbs and fisher young had what proved to be their last sight of their home and friends  the plan was to go on to nengone and erromango take up the stores sent to the latter place from sydney drop the two clergymen at mota and after a stay there go to the new hebrides and then take up the party and if possible leave them to make experiment of curtis island while going to those santa cruz islands for which he always seems to have had such a yearning  i feel as usual he finishes the letter sent from norfolk island that no one can tell what may be the issue of such voyages  i pray and trust that god will mercifully reveal to me what i ought to do and give me grace and power to fulfil the same  i have now been for some time out of the way of this kind of work but i hope that all may be safely ordered for us  it is all in his hands and you all feel as i try to do that there should be no cause for anxiety or trouble  yet there are moments when one has such an overwhelming sense of ones sins and negligences provoking god to chastise one  i know that his merciful intention towards men must be accomplished and on the whole i rest thankfully in that and feel that he will not suffer my utter unworthiness to hinder his work of love and goodness  at mota mr atkins journal shows to what work a real helper needed to be trained  the missionhouse had lost its roof in a gale of wind  the epidemic that was raging last year did not seem to have continued long after with such violence some more of the people were dead but not very many  we took off all the mota boys and things that were wanted in three boatloads the last time leaving the bishop  there was fortunately very little surf and we got nothing wet but as the tide was high we had to carry the things over the coral reefs with the water a little above our knees  about an hour later we dropped anchor at vanua lava  on saturday morning i went ashore with the boat and got water for washing and sand for scrubbing decks and several tons of taro and yams discharged on board the vessel  then made another trip left all the boys on shore for a holiday and took off twelve or fourteen cwt of yams taro and cocoanuts  after dinner and washing up went to fetch boys back  where we bought the yams there was such a surf breaking that we could not haul the boat on the beach and we had to wade and carry them out  after we got on board we had a bathe  two of the solomon islanders distinguished themselves by jumping off the foreyard and diving under the ship  mr tilly and the mates had been stowing and the rest of us had been getting yams all day and if our friends could have seen us then haggardlooking and dirty singing choruses to nigger melodies how shocked they would have been  next thursday went across to mota took the bishop on board and sailed south as fast as possible  sunday morning we were at the entrance of the passage between ambrym and mallicolo without a breath of wind  we had service at 10 am and in the afternoon psalms and hymns and chants in the cabin the bishop doing most of the singing  june 6thon monday morning we landed at the old place at tariko we began to buy some yams  the bishop and william pasvorang went ashore and the rest of us stayed in the boat keeping her afloat and off the reefs  unfortunately the place where we landed was neutral ground between two tribes who both brought yams to the place to sell  one party said another was getting too many hatchets and two or three drew off and began shooting at the others  one man stood behind the bishop a few feet from him and fired away in the crowd with a will  the consternation and alarm of both parties were very ludicrous  some of each set were standing round the boat armed with bows and arrows but they were so frightened that they never seemed to think of using them but ran off as hard as they could scamper to the shallow water looking over their shoulders to see if the enemies arrows were after them  one arrow was fired at the bishop from the shore and one hit the boat just as we pushed off  the bishop himself says of this frayi was in the middle one man only remained by me crouching under the lee of the branch of the tree and shooting away from thence within a yard of me  i did not like to leave the steelyard and i had to detach it from the rope with which it was tied to the tree and the basket too was half full of yams and heavy so that it was some time before i got away and walked down the beach and waded to the boat shooting going on all round at the time no one shooting at me yet as they shot on both sides of me at each other i was thankful to get well out of it  i thought of him who preserves from the arrow that flieth by day as he has so mercifully preserved so many of us from the sickness now dont go and let this little affair be printed  at parama there was a friendly landing  at sopevi mr atkin says we could not find the landing place where the bishop two years ago found several people  we saw three or four on the shore  they were just the same colour as the dust from the volcano  what a wretched state they must be in  if they go to the neighbouringisles they will be killed as enemies and if they stay at home they are constantly suffocated by the ashes which seemed to have fallen lately to the depth of more than afoot  at mallicolo a landing place was found and an acquaintance begun by means of gifts of calico  at lepers island st barnabas day was celebrated by bringing off two boys but here again was peril  the bishop writes  the people though constantly fighting and cannibals and the rest of it are to me very attractive lightcoloured and some very handsome  as i sat on the beach with a crowd about me most of them suddenly jumped up and ran off  turning my head i saw a man from the boat they saw two men a few yards from me corning to me with club uplifted  i remained sitting and held out a few fishhooks to him but one or two men jumped up and seizing him by the waist forced him off  after a few minutes lest they should think i was suspicious of them i went back to the boat  i found out from the two young men who went away with me from another place just what i expected to hear viz that a poor fellow called moliteum was shot dead two months ago by a trader for stealing a bit of calico  the wonder was not that they wanted to avenge the death of their kinsman but that the others should have prevented it  how could they possibly know that i was not one of the wicked set  yet they did discriminate and here again always by the merciful providence of god the plan of going among the people unarmed and unsuspiciously has been seen to disarm their mistrust and to make them regard me as a friend  curtis island was inspected but there was no possibility of leaving a party to make experiment on it and then the southern cross sailed for the santa cruz cluster that group whose spanish name was so remarkable a foreboding of what they were destined to become to that small party of christian explorers  young atkin made no entry in his diary of those days and could never bear to speak of them and yet from that time forward his mind was fully made up to cast in his lot with the mission  it was on august 15 that the first disaster at these islands took place  not till the 27th could the bishopon his sister fannys birthdaybegin a letter to her cheering himself most touchingly with the thought of the peace at home and then he broke off half way and could not continue for some days  my dearest fanyou remember the old happy anniversaries of your birthdaythe feniton partythe assembly of relationsthe regular years festivity  no doubt this anniversary brings as much true happiness the assurance of a more abiding joy the consciousness of deeper and truer sympathy  you are i hope to pass the day cheerfully and brightly with perhaps   and  about you anyhow i shall think of you as possibly all together the remnant of the old family gathering on a calm autumn day with lovely south devon scenery around you  the day comes to me in the midst of one of the deepest sorrows i have ever knownperhaps i have never felt such sorrowperhaps i have never been so mercifully supported under it  it is a good and profitable sorrow i trust for me it has made so much in me reveal itself as hollow worldly selfish vainglorious  it has i hope helped to strip away the veil and may be by gods blessing the beginning of more earnest lifelong repentance and preparation for death  on august 15 i was at santa cruz  you know that i had a very remarkable day there three years ago  i felt very anxious to renew acquaintance with the people who are very numerous and strong  i went off in the boat with atkin twenty pearce twentythree or twentyfour years old edwin nobbs fisher young and hunt christian the last three norfolk islanders  atkin edwin and fisher have been with me for two or three yearsall young fellows of great promise fisher perhaps the dearest of all to me about eighteen and oh so good so thoroughly truthful conscientious and unselfish  i landed at two places among many people and after a while came back as usual to the boat  all seemed pleasant and hopeful  at the third place i landed amidst a great crowd waded over the broad reef partially uncovered at low water went into a house sat down for some time then returned among a great crowd to the boat and got into it  i had some difficulty in detaching the hands of some men swimming in the water  well when the boat was about fifteen yards from the reef on which crowds were standing they began why i know not to shoot at us another letter adds 300 or 400 people on the reef and five or six canoes being round us they began to shoot at usi had not shipped the rudder so i held it up hoping it might shield off any arrows that came straight the boat being end on and the stern having been backed into the reef was nearest to them  when i looked round after a minute providentially indeed for the boat was being pulled right into a small bay on the reef and would have grounded i saw pearce lying between the thwarts with the long shaft of an arrow in his chest edwin nobbs with an arrow as it seemed in his left eye many arrows flying close to us from many quarters  suddenly fisher young pulling the stroke oar gave a faint scream he was shot through the left wrist  not a word was spoken only my pull port oars pull on steadily  once dear edwin with the fragment of the arrow sticking in his cheek and the blood streaming down called out thinking even then more of me than of himself look out sir close to you  but indeed on all sides they were close to us  how we any of us escaped i cant tell fisher and edward pulled on atkin had taken pearces oar hunt pulled the fourth oar  by gods mercy no one else was hit but the canoes chased us to the schooner in about twenty minutes we were on board the people in the canoes round the vessel seeing the wounded paddled off as hard as they could expecting of course that we should take vengeance on them but i dont at all think that they were cognisant of the attack on shore   several letters were written about this adventure but i have thought it better to put them together every word being bishop pattesons own because such a scene is better realised thus than by reading several descriptions for the most part identical  what a scene it is  the palmclad island the reef and sea full of the blacks the storm of long arrows through the air the four youths pulling bravely and steadily and their bishop standing over them trying to ward off the blows with the rudder and gazing with the deep eyes and steadfast smile that had caused many a weapon to fall harmless  pearce it should be observed was a volunteer for the mission then on a trialtrip  there was an even more trying time to come on board  the bishop continues  i drew out the arrow from pearces chest a slanting wound not going in very deep running under the skin yet of apparently almost fatal character to an ignorant person like myself five inches were actually inside him  the arrow struck him almost in the centre of the chest and in the direction of the right breast  there was no effusion of blood he breathed with great difficulty groaning and making a kind of hollow sound was perfectly composed gave me directions and messages in case of his death  i put on a poultice and bandage and leaving him in charge of some one went to fisher the wrist was shot through but the upper part of the arrow broken off and deep down bleeding profuse of which i was glad i cut deeply though fearing much to cut an artery but i could not extract the wooden arrowhead  at length getting a firm hold of the projecting point of the arrow on the lower side of his wrist i pulled it through it came out clean  the pain was very great he trembled and shivered we gave him brandy and he recovered  i poulticed the wound and went to edwin  atkin had got out the splinter from his wound the arrow went in near the eye and came out by the cheekbone it was well syringed and the flow of blood had been copious from the first  the arrows were not boneheaded and not poisoned but i well knew that lockjaw was to be dreaded edwins was not much more than a flesh wound  fishers being in the wrist frightened me more their patience and quiet composure and calm resignation were indeed a strength and comfort to us all  this was on monday august 15  all seemed doing well for a day or two i kept on poultices gave light nourishing food c  but on saturday morning fisher said to me i cant make out what makes my jaws feel so stiff  then my heart sank down within me and i prayed earnestly earnestly to god  i talked to the dear dear lad of his danger night and day we prayed and read  a dear guileless spirit indeed  i never saw in so young a person such a thorough conscientiousness as for two years i witnessed in his daily life and i had long not only loved but respected him  we had calm weather and could not get on  by saturday the jaws were tightlocked  then more intense grew the pain the agony the whole body rigid like a bar of iron  oh how i blessed god who carried me through that day and night  how good he was in his very agonies in his fearful spasms thanking god praying pressing my hand when i prayed and comforted him with holy words of scripture  none but a welldisciplined humble simple christian could so have borne his sufferings the habit of obedience and faith and patience the childlike unhesitating trust in gods love and fatherly care supported him now  he never for a moment lost his hold upon god what a lesson it was it calmed us all  it almost awed me to see in so young a lad so great an instance of gods infinite power so great a work of good perfected in one young enough to have been confirmed by me  at 1 am monday i moved from his side to my couch only three yards off  of course we were all i need not say in the after cabin  he said faintly kiss me  i am very glad that i was doing my duty  tell my father that i was in the path of duty and he will be so glad  poor santa cruz people  ah my dear boy you will do more for their conversion by your death than ever we shall by our lives  and as i lay down almost convulsed with sobs though not audible he said so mr tilly afterwards told me poor bishop how full his heart was of love and peace and thoughts of heaven oh what love he said  the last night when i left him for an hour or two at 1 am only to lie down in my clothes by his side he said faintly his body being then rigid as a bar of iron kiss me bishop  at 4 am he started as if from a trance he had been wandering a good deal but all his words even then were of things pure and holy  his eyes met mine and i saw the consciousness gradually coming back into them  they never stop singing there sir do theyfor his thoughts were with the angels in heaven then after a short time the last terrible struggle and then he fell asleep  and remember all this in the midst of that most agonizing it may be of all forms of death  at 4 am he was hardly conscious not fully conscious there were same fearful spasms we fanned him and bathed his head and occasionally got a drop or two of weak brandy or wine and water down  then came the last struggle oh how i thanked god when his head at length fell back or rather his whole body for it was without joint on my arm long drawn sighs with still sadder contraction of feature succeeded and while i said the commendatory prayer he passed away  the same day we anchored in port patteson and buried him in a quiet spot near the place where the primate and i first landed years ago it seems a consecration of the place that the body of that dear child should be resting there  some six years ago when mrs selwyn stopped at norfolk island she singled him out as the boy of special promise  for two or three years he had been with me and my affection flowed out naturally to him  god had tried him by the two sicknesses at kohimarama and at mota and by his whole family returning to pitcairn  i saw that he had left all for this work  he had become most useful and oh how we shall miss him  but about five days after this august 22 edwins jaws began to stiffen  for nine or ten days there was suspense so hard to bear some symptoms were not so bad it did not assume so acute a form i thought he ought to be carried through it  he was older about twentyone six feet high a strong handsome young man the pride of norfolk island the destined helper and successor had god so willed of his father the present clergyman  the same faith the same patience the same endurance of suffering  on friday september 2 i administered the holy communion to him and pearce  he could scarce swallow the tiniest crumb  he was often delirious yet not one word but spoke of things holy and pure almost continually in prayer  he was in the place where fisher had died the best part of the cabin for an invalid  sunday came he could take no nourishment stomach and back in much pain a succession of violent spasms at about 1030 am but his body never became quite rigid  the death struggle at 1 am september 5 was very terrible three of us could scarcely hold him  then he sank back on my arm and his spirit passed away as i commended his soul to god  then all motionless  after some minutes i said the first prayer in the burial service then performed the last offices then had a solemn talk with pearce and knelt down i know not how long  we buried him at sea  all this time we were making very slow progress indeed the voyage has been very remarkable in all respects pearce seems to be doing very well so that i am very hopeful about him  the temperature now is only 72 degrees and i imagine that his constitution is less liable to that particular disease  yet punctured wounds are always dangerous on this account  patience and trust in god the same belief in his goodness and love that he orders all things for our good that this is but a proof of his merciful dealing with us such comforts god has graciously not withheld  i never felt so utterly broken down when i thought and think of the earthly side of it all never perhaps so much realised the comfort and power of his presence when i have had grace to dwell upon the heavenly and abiding side of it  i do with my better part heartily and humbly thank him that he has so early taken these dear ones by a straight and short path to their everlasting home  i think of them with blessed saints our own dear ones in paradise and in the midst of my tears i bless and praise god  but dear fan fisher most of all supplied to me the absence of earthly relations and friends  he was my boy i loved him as i think i never loved any one else  i dont mean more than you all but in a different way not as one loves another of equal age but as a parent loves a child  i can hardly think of my little room at kohimarama without him  i long for the sight of his dear face the sound of his voice  it was my delight to teach him and he was clever and so thoughtful and industrious  i know it is good that my affections should be weaned from all things earthly  i try to be thankful i think i am thankful really time too will do much gods grace much more  i only wonder how i have borne it all  in the multitude of the sorrows that i had in my heart thy comforts have refreshed my soul  mr tilly has been and is full of sympathy and is indeed a great aid  he too has a heavy loss in these two dear ones  and now i must land at norfolk island in the face of the population crowding the little pier  mr nobbs will be there and the brothers and sisters of edwin and the uncles and aunts of fisher  yet god will comfort them they have been called to the high privilege of being counted worthy to suffer for their saviors sake however much i may reproach myself with want of caution and of prayer for guidance and this is a bitter thought they were in the simple discharge of their duty  their intention and wish were to aid in bringing to those poor people the gospel of christ  it has pleased god that in the execution of this great purpose they should have met with their deaths  surely there is matter for comfort here  i cant write all this over again  i have written at some length to jem also put the two letters together and you will be able to realise it somewhat  this is a joint letter to you and joan  it was begun on your birthday and it has been written with a heavy dull weight of sorrow on my heart yet not unrelieved by the blessed consciousness of being drawn as i humbly trust nearer to our most merciful father in heaven if only by the very impossibility of finding help elsewhere it has not been a time without its own peculiar happiness  how much of the bible seemed endued with new powers of comfort how true it is that they who seek find  i sought the lord and he heard me the closing chapters of the gospels 2 corinthians and how many other parts of the new testament were blessings indeed  jeremy taylors life of christ and holy living and dying thomas a kempis most of all of course the prayerbook and such solemn holy memories of our dear parents and uncles such blessed hopes of reunion death brought so near the longing if only not unprepared for the life to come i could not be unhappy  yet i could not sustain such a frame of mind long and then when i sank to the level of earthly thoughts then came the weary heartache and the daily routine of work was so distasteful and i felt sorely tempted to indulge the luxury of grief  but thanks be to god it is not altogether an unhealthy sorrow and i can rest in the full assurance that all this is working out gods purposes of love and mercy to us allmelanesians pitcairners and all and that i needed the discipline i know full well  your loving brother  j c p   it was not possible to touch at norfolk island each attempt was baffled by the winds and on september 16 the southern cross anchored at kohimarama and a sad little note was sent up to the primate with the announcement of the deaths and losses  in spite of the comfort which as this note said patteson felt in the innocence of their lives and the constancy of their faith unto the death the fate of these two youths coming at the close of a year of unusual trial which as he had already said had diminished his elasticity had a lasting effect  it seemed to take away his youthful buoyancy and marked lines of care on his face that never were effaced  the first letter after his return begins by showing how full his heart was of these his children   kohimarama sunday september 18 1864  my dearest fani must try to write without again making my whole letter full of dear edwin and fisher  that my heart is full of them you can well believe  these last five weeks have taught me that my reading of the bible was perhaps more intellectual and perhaps more theological than devotional to a dangerous extent probably anyhow i craved for it as a revelation not only of truth but of comfort and support in heavy sorrow  it may be that when the sorrow does not press so heavily the bible cannot speak so wonderfully in that particular way of which i am writing and it is right to read it theologically also  but yet it should always be read with a view to some practical result and so often there is not a special though many general points which may make our reading at once practical  then comes the real trial and then comes the wondrous power of gods word to help and strengthen  now it helps me to know where i am to learn how others manage to see where they are  all that you say about selfconsciousness c cant i understand it  ah when i saw the guileless pure spirit of those two dear fellows ever brightening more and more for now two years  i had respected them as much as i loved them  i used to think yes we must become such as they we too must seek and pray for the mind of a little child  and surely the contemplation of god is the best cure  how admirable jeremy taylor is on those points  oh that he had not overlaid it all with such superabundant ornamentation of style and rhetoric  but it is the manner of the age  many persons i suppose get over it perhaps like it but i long for the same thoughts the same tenderness and truthfulness and faithful searching words with a clear simple not unimaginative diction  yet his book is a great heritage  newman has a sermon on contemplation or meditation i forget which and my copy is on board  but i do hope that by praying for humility with contemplation of gods majesty and love and our saviors humility and meekness some improvement may be mercifully vouchsafed to me  to dwell on his humiliation his patience that he should seek for heavenly aids accept the ministration of an angel strengthening him how full of mystery and awe and yet written for us  and yet we are proud and selfjustified and vainglorious  the archbishop of york in aids to faith on the death of christ has some most solemn and deep remarks on the lords agony  i dont know that it could ever be quite consistent with reverence to speak on what is there suggested  yet if i could hear mr keble and dr pusey say prayerfully talking together on that great mystery i should feel that it might be very profitable  but he must be a very humble man who should dare to speak on it  yet read it fan it cannot harm you it is very awful it is fully meant that he was sinless without spot undefiled through all  it makes the mystery of sin and of what it cost to redeem our souls more awful than ever  and then surely to the contemplation of god and the necessary contrast of our own weakness and misery we add the thought of our approaching death we anticipate the hours the days it may be the weeks and months even the years of weariness pain sleeplessness thirst distaste for food murmuring thoughts evil spirits haunting us impatient longings after rest for which we are not yet prepared the thousand trials discomforts sadnesses of sicknessyes it must come in some shape and is it to come as a friend or an enemy to snatch us from what we love and enjoy or to open the gates of paradise  i humbly thank god that while i dare not be sure that i am not mistaken and suppose that if ready to go i should be taken the thought of death at a distance is the thought of rest and peace of more blessed communion with gods saints holy angels and the lord yet i dare not feel that if death was close at hand it might not be far otherwise  how often the christian year and all true divinity helps up here  why indulge in such speculations  seek to prepare for death by dying daily  oh that blessed text be not distracted worry not yourselves about the morrow for the morrow shall c  how it does carry one through the day  bear everything as sent from god for your good by way of chastisement or of proving you  puseys sermon on patience newmans on a particular providence guarding so wisely against abuse as against neglect of the doctrine  how much to comfort and guide one and then most of all the continual use of the prayerbook  do you often use the prayer at the end of the evening service for charles the martyr  leave out from great deepteach us to number and substitute pride for splendour leave out according to blessed martyr  in the primates case it is a prayer full of meaning and it may have a meaning for us all  once more the love of approbation is right and good but then it must be the love of the approbation of god and of good men  here as everywhere we abuse his gift and it is a false teaching which bids us suppress the human instinct which god implanted in us but a true leading which bids us direct and use it to its appointed and legitimate use  on this general subject read if you have not read them and you cant read them too often butlers sermons you know the great butler  i think you will easily get an analysis of them such as mills analysis of pearson on the creed which will help you if you want it  analyse them for yourself if you like and send me out your analysis to look at  there is any amount of fundamental teaching there and the imprimatur of thousands of good men to assure us of it  i think as i have written to joan that if i were with you after the first few days my chiefest delight would be in reading and talking over our reading of good books  edwin and fisher were beginning to understand thoughtful books and how i did delight in reading with them interspersing a little pitcairn remark here and there  ah never more never more  but they dont want books now all is clear now they live where there is no night in the glory of god and of the lamb resting in paradise anticipating the full consummation of the life of the resurrection  thanks be to god and it may not be longbut i must not indulge such thoughts  i feel better but at times this sad affliction weighs me down much and business of all kinds seems almost to multiply  yet there are many many comforts and kindest sympathy  your loving brother  j c p   just at this time heavy sorrow fell upon bishop hobhouse of nelson and the little council of friends at auckland decided that bishop patteson should go at once to do his best to assist and comfort him and bring him back to auckland  there was a quiet time of wholesome rest at nelson and the effects appeared in numerous letters and in the thinking out of many matters on paper to his sisters  oh how i think with such everincreasing love of dear fisher and edwin  how i praised god for them on all saints day  but i dont expect to recover spring and elasticity yet awhile  i dont think i shall ever feel so young again  really it is curious that the number of white hairs is notably increased in these few weeks though it is silly to talk about it  dont mention it and i feel very tired and indolent  no wonder i seem to go softly  but i am unusually happy down in the depths only the surface troubled  i hope that it is not fancy only that makes the shortness and uncertainty of this life a ground of comfort and joy  perhaps it is indeed i think it is very much a mere cowardly indolent shirking of work  did i say i thought i might some day write a book  it will be some day indeed  it seems funny enough to think of such a thing  the fact is it is much easier to me to speak than to write  i think i could learn with a good deal of leisure and trouble to write intelligibly but not without it  i am so diffusive and wanting in close condensed habits of thought  how often i go off in a multitude of words and really say nothing worthy to be remembered  how i should enjoy indeed a day or two at hursley with mr and mrs keble  a line from him now and then if he can find time would be a great delight to me but i know that he thinks and prays and that is indeed a great happiness  oh the blessing of such thoughts as all saints day bringsand now more dear than ever every day bringspatriarchs prophets apostles martyrs and every spirit made perfect in the faith of christ as an old liturgy says  and the collects in the burial service  how full how simple and soothing how full of calm holy tender blessed hopes and anticipations  so you think the large adelaide photograph very sad  i really dont remember it i fancy i thought it a very fair likeness  but you know that i have a heavy lumpy dull look except when talkingindeed then too for aught i knowand this may be mistaken for a sad look when it is only a dull stupid one  you cant get a nice picture out of an ugly face so its no use trying but you are not looking for that kind of thing  you want to see how far the face is any index of the character and life and work  i dont think it odd that i should look careworn  i have enough to make me so  and yet if i were with you now brightened up by being with you you would say how well he looks  and you would think i had any amount of work in me as you saw me riding or walking or holding services  and then i had to a very considerable extent got over that silly shyness which was a great trial and drawback to me of old and sadly prevented me from enjoying the society of people at oxford especially which would have done me much good  but without all these bodily defects i should have been even more vain and so i can see the blessing and mercy now though how many times i have indulged murmuring rebellious thoughts  perhaps i shall live ten or twenty years and look back and say i recollect how in 64 i really almost thought i should not last long but dont fancy that i am morbidly cherishing such fancies  only i like you all to know me as i am changing in feeling from time to time  there is quite enough to account for it all  a few days later he returned to auckland and thence wrote to me a letter on the pros and cons of a move from new zealand  the sight of ships and the town he had ceased to think of great importance and older scholars had ceased to care for it and there was much at that time to recommend curtis island to his mind  the want of breadfruit was the chief disadvantage he then saw in it but he still looked to keeping up kohimarama for a good many years to come  i cannot describe how tender and considerate he was of feelings he thought i might possibly have of disappointment that st andrews was not a successful experiment as far as health was concerned evidently fearing that i had set my hopes on that individual venture and that my feelings might be hurt if it had to be deserted  the next letters are a good deal occupied with the troubles incident to the judgment upon essays and reviews  he took a view as has been seen such as might be expected of the delicate refining metaphysical mind thinking out points for itself and weighing the possible value of every word and differed from those who were in the midst of the contest and felt some form of resistance and protest needful  he was strongly averse to agitation on the subject and at the same time grieved to find himself for the first time to his own knowledge not accepting the policy of those whom he so much respected though the only difference in his mind from theirs was as to the manner of the maintenance of the truth and the immediate danger of error going uncondemneda point on which his remote life perhaps hardly enabled him to judge  all these long letters and more which were either in the same tone or too domestic to be published prove the leisure caused by having an unusually small collection of pupils and happily all in fair health but with christmas came a new idea or rather an old one renewed  instead of only going to norfolk island on sufferance from the pitcairn committee and by commission from the bishop of tasmania a regular request was made by sir john young the governor of australia that the pitcairners might be taken under his supervision so that as far as government was concerned the opposition was withdrawn which had hindered his original establishment there though still curtis island remained in the ascendency in the schemes of this summer  the ensuing is a reply to sir john coleridges letter written after hearing of the attack at santa cruz   kohimarama march 3 1865  my dearest unclemany many thanks for your letter so full of comfort and advice  i need not tell you that the last budget of letters revived again most vividly not only the actual scene at santa cruz but all the searchings of heart that followed it  i believe that we are all agreed on the main point  enough ground has been opened for the present  codrington was right in saying that the object of late has been to fill up gaps  but some of the most hazardous places to visit lie nearest to the south eg some of the new hebrides c south of the banks islands  my notion is that i ought to be content even to pass by alas some places where i had some hold when i had reason to feel great distrust of the generally kind intentions of the people that is a dark sentence but you know my meaning  in short there are very few places where i can feel humanly speaking secure against this kind of thing  it is always in the power of even one mischievous fellow to do mischief  and if the feeling of the majority might be in my favour yet there being no way of expressing public opinion no one cares to take an active part in preventing mischief  it is not worth his while to get into a squabble and risk his own life  but i shall be dv very cautious  i dare say i was becoming presumptuous one among the many faults that are so discernible  it is dear uncle hard to see a wild heathen party on the beach and not try to get at them  it seems so sad to leave them  but i know that i ought to be prudent even for my own sake for i quite suppose that humanly speaking my life is of consequence for a few years more and i can hardly bear the thought of bringing the boats crew dear good volunteers into danger  young atkin the only son of my neighbour behaved admirably at santa cruz and is very staunch  but his parents have but him and one daughter and i am bound to be careful indeed  but dont think me careless if we get into another scrape  there is scarcely one island where i can fully depend upon immunity from all risk  there was no need to talk so much about it all before  as to curtis island i need not say that i have no wish indeed to take australian work in hand  i made it most clear as i thought that the object of a site on curtis island was the melanesian and not the australian mission  i offered only to incorporate australian blacks if proper specimens could be obtained into our school regarding in fact east australia as another melanesian island  this would only have involved the learning a language or two and might have been of some use  i did not make any pledge  but i confess that i think some such plan as this one only feasible one  i dont see that the attempts at mission work are made on the most hopeful plan  but i have written to the brisbane authorities urging them to appropriate large reserves for the natives  i tell them that it is useless for them to give me a few acres and think they are doing a mission work if they civilize the native races off their own lands in short i almost despair of doing anything for blacks living on the same land with whites  even here in new zealand the distrust now shown to us all to our religion even is the result in very great measure of the insolent covetous behaviour exhibited by the great majority of the white people to the maori  who stops in australia to think whether the land which he wants for his sheep is the hunting ground of native people or not  i confess that while i cant bear to despair and leave these poor souls uncared for i cant propose any scheme but one and who will work that  if indeed one or two men could be found to go and live with a tribe moving as they move and really identifying himself with their interests  but where are such men and where is a tribe not already exasperated by injurious treatment  it was the statement for our mode of action which commended itself so much to people in australia that they urged me to try and do something  but i answered as i have now written and when at one meeting in sydney i was asked whether i would take australians into my school i said yes if i can get the genuine wild man uncontaminated by contact with the white man  i cant in justice to our melanesian scholars take the poor wretched black whose intercourse with white men has rendered him a far more hopeless subject to deal with than the downright ferocious yet not ungenerous savage  if was the answer you can get them i will pay for them  indeed dear uncle i dont want more but less work on my hands yet as i look around i see as far as i can judge so great a want of that prudence and knowledge and calm foresight that the primate has shown so remarkably that i declare i do think his plan is almost the only reasonable one for dealing with black races  alas you cant put hearty love for strangers into mens hearts by paying them salaries  i think that in two or three years i may if i live have some preparatory branch school at curtis island  if it should clearly succeed then i think in time the migration from new zealand might take place  i do not think two schools in two different countries would answer  we want the old scholars to help us in working the school we cant do without them and the old scholars cant be trained without the younger ones the material on whom their teaching and training faculties must be exercised  you all know how deeply i feel about dear mr keble  thank god we have as yet no dysentery  i baptized last week a lad dying of consumption  there are many blessings as all clergymen know in having death scenes so constantly about one and the having to do everything for these dear fellows makes one love them so  your affectionate and dutiful nephew  j c p   the above sentence refers to the paralytic attack mr keble had on november 30 1864  nevertheless almost at that very time he was writing thus   penzance march 7 1865  my dear and more than dear bishopit would be vain for me to write to you if i pretended to do more than just express my hearts wish that i could say something of the doings and sufferings which now for years past we of course associate with your name so as to encourage and support you in your present manifold distress  but especially for reasons known only to myself i must leave that altogether to him who helps his own to do and suffer  one thing only i would say that to us at our great distance it looks as if the sanguis martyrum were being to you as the semen ecclesiae and you know how such things were hailed in the time of st cyprian  may it please god before long to give you some visible earnest of this sure blessing but i suppose that if it tarry it may be the greater when it comes  our troubles as a church though of a different kind are not small  the great point with me is lest if in our anxiety to keep things together we should be sinfully conniving at what is done against the faith and so bringing a judgment upon ourselves  i do not for a moment think that by anything which has yet been done or permitted our being as a church is compromised though things look alarmingly as if it might be before long but i fear that her wellbeing is more and more being damaged by our entire and conscious surrender of the disciplinary part of our trust and that if we are apathetic in such things we may forfeit our charter  there is no doubt i fear that personal unbelief is spreading but i trust that a deeper faith is spreading also it is at oxford eg pusey and moberly c against the rationalists and other tempters  as to the question of the bible being not only containing the word i had no scruples in signing that declaration  one thought which helped me was the use made in the new testament of the old which is such as to show that we are not competent judges as to what passages convey deep moral or religious meanings or no  another that in every instance where one had the means of ascertaining so far as i have known the bible difficulty has come right therefore it is reasonable to conclude that so it would be in all the rest if we knew the right reading and the right interpretation of the words  and as to what are called the divine and human elements i have seemed to help myself with the thought that the divine adoption if so be of the human words warrants their truthfulness as a mans signature makes a letter his own but whether this is relevant i doubt  my wife and i are both on the sick list and i must now only add that we never forget you  ever yours  j k   nothing has hitherto been said of this term at st andrews so here is an extract from a letter to one of the cousinhood who had proposed a plan which has since been carried out extensively and with good effect  the difficulty about scholars appropriated to certain places or parishes is this i cannot be sure of the same persons remaining with me  some sickness in an island some panic some death of a relative some war or some inability on my part from bad weather or accident to visit an island may at any time lose me a scholar perhaps he may be the very one that has been appropriated to some one and what am i to say then  this year we have but thirtyeight melanesians we ought to have sixty  but after dear edwin and fishers wounds i could not delay but hurried southwards passing by islands with old scholars ready to come away  this was sad work but what could i do  i will gladly assign to the best of my power scholars whom i think likely to remain with me to various places or persons but pray make them understand that their scholar may not always be forthcoming anyhow their alms would go to the support of some melanesian who would be their scholar as it were for the time being  you would perhaps feel interested in knowing that the gospel of st luke has been printed in the mota language to a great extent by our scholars and that george sarawia is printing now the acts composing it and doing presswork and all  young wogale about thirteen prints very fairly and sent off 250 copies of a prayer which the bishop of nelson wanted for distribution of which everything was done by him entirely  they both began to learn about last november  when morning school is over at 10 am all hands dons and all are expected to give their time to the mission till 1245  mr pritt is general overlooker which does not mean doing nothing himself of domestic work kitchen garden farm dairy c  you know that we have no servants  mr palmer prints and teaches printing  atkin works at whatever may be going on and has a large share of work to get ready for me and to read with me greek testament 12 to 1245 greek and latin from 2 to 3  so all the lads are busy at outdoor work from 10 to 1245 and i assure you under mr pritts management we begin to achieve considerable results in our farm and garden work  we are already economising our expenditure greatly by keeping our own cows for which we grow food a good deal artificial and baking our own bread  we sell some of our butter and have a grand supply of milk for our scholars perhaps the very best kind of food for them  if we can manage to carry on a winters school here with some ten or twelve of the lads left under mr pritts charge while i go off with the rest i really think that the industrial department may become something considerable  it is an essential part of the system for we must begin with teaching habits of order punctuality c in respect of those things with which they have already some acquaintance  no melanesian can understand why he is to sit spelling away at a black board and he is not like a child of four or five years old he must be taught through his power of reasoning and perceiving the meaning of things  secondly we can gradually invest the more advanced scholars with responsible duties  there are the head cooks in the various weeks the heads of departments in garden work c c  as these lads and men are being trained we hope to teach others and as we want them to teach industry decency cleanliness punctuality to be and to teach others to be honest and careful and thoughtful so we find all these lessons are learnt more in the industrial work than in the mere book work though that is not neglected  indeed school in the restricted sense of the word is going on for four or four and a half hours a day  the main difficulty remains of retaining our hold upon boys  oh that i could live permanently in twenty islands at once  but i cant do so even in one and all the letterwriting and accounts and worst of all the necessity for being trustee for matters not a bit connected with melanesia because there is no one else interferes sadly with my time  i think i could work away with the languages c and really do something with these fellows but i never get a chance  i never have two days together which i can spend exclusively at melanesian work  and i ought to have nothing whatever to distract me  twenty languages calling for arrangement and comparison causes confusion enough  these interruptions made the kohimarama life trying  as for correspondence says the birthday despatch to fanny why this mail my letters to victoria alone are twelve let alone sydney brisbane adelaide tasmania new zealand and england  then three sermons a week occasional services reading up for a most difficult session of general synod with really innumerable interruptions from persons of all kinds  sometimes i do feel tempted to long for curtis island merely to get away from new zealand  i feel as if i should never do anything here  everything is in arrears  i turn out of a morning and really dont know what to take up first  then just as i am in the middle of a letter as yesterday down comes some donkey to take up a quarter of an hour lucky if not an hour with idle nonsense then in the afternoon an invasion of visitors which is worst of all that fatal invention of calling  however i never call on anyone and it is understood now and people dont expect it  i have not even been to government house for more than a year  there a good explosion does one good  but why must idle people interfere with busy men  i used to make it up by sitting up and getting up very early indeed but somehow i feel fit for nothing but sleeping and eating now  after an absence of three weeks at the general synod at christchurch the bishop took up such of his party as were to return and sailed home leaving those whom he thought able to brave the winter with mr and mrs pritt on one of the first days of june  the first visit was one to the bereaved family at norfolk island whence a brief note to his brother on the 9th begins  nothing can be more comforting to me than the loving patient spirit of these dear people  poor mr and mrs nobbs and all the brothers and sisters so good and so full of kindness to me  it was very trying when i first met them yesterday  they came and kissed me and then poor things fairly gave way and then i began to talk quietly about edwin and fisher and they became calm and we knelt and prayed together  after landing the bishop at mota the others crossed to port patteson where they found fisher youngs grave carefully tended kept clear of weeds and with a fence round it  after establishing mr palmer at the station at mota the bishop reembarked for santa maria where at the northeastcock sparrow point as some one had appropriately called itthe boat was always shot at but at a village called lakona the people were friendly and five scholars had come from thence so the bishop ventured on landing for the night and a very unpleasant night it wasthe barrack hut was thronged with natives and when the heat was insufferable and he tried to leave it two of his former scholars advised him strongly to remain within  it was bad weather too and there was some difficulty in fetching him off and he was thankful that the wet had hindered more than 300 or 400 natives from collecting there was no possibility of speaking to them quietly for the sight of the boat suggested trading and they flocked round as he was fetched off half a dozen swimming out and begging to go to new zealand  he took three old scholars and one new one and sent the others off with fishhooks telling them that if they would not behave at lakona as he liked he would not do as they liked  however no arrows were shot  then while the southern cross with mr tilly and mr atkin went on to land the solomon island scholars the work at mota was resumed in full force  it seems well worth while to dwell on the successive steps in the conversion of this place and the following letter shows the state of things in the season of 1865   mota july 4 1865  my dearest sisters and brotheri must write a joint letter for all with little notes if i have anything more special for anyone of you  i wish you could see this place  the old hut is queer enough certainly quite open on one side and nearly so on another but it is weathertight in the middle with forms to sit on and a table or two like a kitchen table on which i read and write by day and sleep by night  last night we killed five lizards they get on the roof and drop down and bite pretty severely so seeing these running all about we made a raid upon them poor things  the great banyan tree is as grand as ever a magnificent tree a forest in itself and the view of the sea under its great branches and of the islands of matlavo and valua is beautiful  at daylight i turn off my table and dress not elaboratelya flannel shirt old trousers and shoes then a yam or two is roasted on the embers and the coffee made and fancy the luxury here in mota delicious goats milk with it  then the morning passes in reading writing and somewhat desultory talking with people but you cant expect punctuality and great attention  then at one a bit of biscuit and cheese as long as the latter lasts  mr palmer made some bread yesterday  then generally a walk to meet people at different villages and talk to them trying to get them to ask me questions and i try to question them  then at 6 pm a teaation viz yam and coffee and perhaps a crab or two or a bit of bacon or some good thing or other  but i forgot this morning we ate a bit of our first fullgrown and fully ripe mota pineapple i brought some two years ago as large and fine as any specimens i remember in hothouses  if you mention all these luxuries we shall have no more subscriptions but you may add that there is as yet no other pine apple though our oranges lemons citrons guavas c are coming on  anyone living here permanently might make a beautiful place indeed but it becomes sadly overgrown in our absence and many things we plant are destroyed by pigs c  then after teaa large party always witnessing that ceremonythere is an hour or so spent in speaking again to the people and then i read a little with wadrokala and carry  then mr palmer and i read a chapter of vaughan on the revelation then prayers and so to bed it seems as if little was donecertain talks with people sometimes many sometimes few yet on the whole i hope an increased acquaintance with our teaching  you can well understand that the consciousness of sin and the need of a redeemer may be talked about but cannot be stated so as to make one feel that one has stated it in the most judicious and attractive manner  of course it is the work of gods spirit to work this conviction in the heart  but it is very hard so to speak of it as to give if you can understand me the heathen man a fair chance of accepting what you say  forgetfulness of god ingratitude to the giver of life health food ignorance of the creator and the world to come of the resurrection and life everlasting are all so many proofs to us of a fallen and depraved state  but the heathen man recognises some outward acts as more or less wrong there he stops  yes we dont fight now nor quarrel nor steal so much as we used to do  we are all right now  are you  i never taught you to think so  you tell me that you believe that the son of god came down from heaven  what did he come for  what is the meaning of what you say that he died for us  it is the continual prayer and effort of the christian minister everywhere that god would deepen in his own heart the sense of sin and create it in the mind of the heathen  and then the imperfect medium of a language very far from thoroughly known  it is by continual prayer the intercession of christ the power of the spirit we well know that the work must be carried on  how one does understand it  the darkness seems so thick the present visible world so wholly engrosses the thoughts and yet you see there are many signs of progress even here in changed habits to some extent in the case of our scholars real grounds of hope for the future one seems to be doing nothing yet surely if no change be wrought what right have we to expect it  it is not that i looked for results but that i seek to be taught how to teach better  the collect for the first sunday after epiphany is wonderful  it requires a considerable effort to continually try to present to oneself the state of the heathen mind to select illustrations c suitable to his case  and then his language has never been used by him to set forth these new ideas there are no words which convey the ideas of repentance sin heartfelt confession faith c  how can there be when these ideas dont exist yet somehow the language by degrees is made the exponent of such ideas just as all religious ideas are expressed in english by words now used in their second intention which once meant very different and less elevated ideas  i find everywhere the greatest willingness to listen  everywhere i take my pick of boys and now for any length of time  that is the result of eleven scholars remaining now in new zealand  everyone seems to wish to come  i think i shall take away five or six young girls to be taught at kohimarama to become by and by wives for scholars  else the christian lad will have to live with a heathen girl  but all this if carried out properly would need a large number of scholars from only one island  at curtis island indeed should it answer and supply plenty of food we might hope to have a school some day of 300 or 400 and then thirty or forty from each island could be educated at once but it cant be so in new zealand and a good school on an island before a certain number are trained to teach could not i think be managed successfully  i feel that i must concentrate more than hitherto  i must ascertaini have to some extent ascertainedthe central spots upon which i must chiefly work  this is not an easy thing nevertheless to find out and it has taken years  then using them as centres i must also find out how far already the dialect of that spot may extend how far the people of the place have connections visiting acquaintances c elsewhere and to use the influence of that place to its fullest extent  many islands would thus fall under one centre and thus i think we may work  my mind is so continually day and night i may say working on these points that i dare say i fill up my letters with nothing else  but writing on these points helps me to see my way   on july 7 an expedition to aroa seems to have overtired bishop patteson and a slight attack of fever and ague came on  one of his aunts had provided him with a cork bed where after he had exerted himself to talk to his many visitors he lay not uncomfortably  he was not equal to going to a feast where he hoped to have met a large concourse and after a day of illness was taken back to mota in the bottom of the boat but in another week more revived and went on with his journal moralising on the books he had been reading while laid up  i looked quite through bishop mackenzies life  what a beautiful story it is what a truthful simple earnest character and that persuasiveness that only real humility and selfforgetfulness and thoughtfulness can give  then his early desire to be useful his cambridge life the clear way in which he was being led on all through  it is very beautiful as an illustration of the best kind of help that god bestows on his children  here was one so evidently moulded and fashioned by him and that willingly for so it must be and his life was just as it should be almost as perfect perhaps as a life can be  what if his work failed on the shire  first his work has not failed to begin with for aught we know and secondly his example is stimulating work everywhere  i shall indeed value his thomas a kempis  a copy sent home from the zambesi stained with the water of the shire and sent to the bishop by miss mackenzie  the ship returned with tidings that the more important scholars would be ready to come back after a short holiday with their friends and the bishop embarked again on the 29th  at mai he landed and slept ashore when little petere the son of the young man whose death had so nearly been revenged on the bishop a boy of eight years old did the honours as became a young chief and announced i am going to new zealand with you  no one made any attempt to prevent him but the old scholars did not show themselves helpful and only one of them besides three more new ones came away  the natives were personally friendly but there was no sign of fighting being lessened among them  at whitsuntide there was a brisk trade in yams but no scholars were brought away the parents would not part with any young enough to be likely to be satisfactory pupils nor would the one last years scholar come  here intelligence was received that a twomasted ship had been at lepers island a quarrel had taken place and some natives had been shot  it was therefore decided that it would not be safe to land but as the vessel sailed along the coast numerous canoes came out bringing boars tusks for sale  three boys who had been taken on a cruise of six weeks the year before eagerly came on board and thirty or forty more  all the parents were averse to letting them go and only two ended by being brought away itole a young gentleman of fourteen or so slim and slight with a waist like a wasp owing to a cincture worn night and day and his hair in ringlets white with corallime his friend a little older a tall neatlimbed fellow not dark and with little of the negro in his features  a letter to me was written during this cruise from which i give an extract  it was a great delight to me to receive a letter from mr keble by the february mail from england  how kind of him to write to me and his words are such a help and encouragement  i dare say i shall see merivales lectures soon  nothing can well be so wonderful as a proof of gods hand controlling and arranging all the course of history to those who need it as a subject for adoration and praise to those who need not such proof than the vast preparation made for the coming of christ and the spreading of the gospel  to popularise this the right way and bring it home to the thought of many who have not time nor inclination for much reading must be a good work  i suppose that all good church histories deal with that part of the subject it is natural for the mere philosopher to do so  and think how the early alexandrian teachers used the religious yearnings of the east to draw men to the recognition of their wants supplied and satisfied only in christianity  often it is the point dappui that the missionary must seek for  there is an element of faith in superstition we must fasten on that and not rudely destroy the superstition lest with it we destroy the principle of faith in things and beings unseen  i often think that to shake a mans faith in his old belief however wrong it may be before one can substitute something true and right is to say the least a dangerous experiment  but positive truth wins its way without controversy while error has no positive existence and there is a craving for truth deep down in the heathen heart  do you remember that grand passage of hooker where he says that he cannot stand to oppose all the sophisms of romanism only that he will place against it a structure of truth before which as dagon before the ark error will be dashed in fragments  in our work and so i suppose in a sunday school one must think out each step anticipate each probable result before one states anything  it is of course full of the highest interest  cant you fancy a party of twenty or thirty dark naked fellows when having learnt to talk freely to them i question them about their breakfast and cocoanut trees their yams and taro and bananas c who gave them to you  can you make them grow  why you like me and thank me because i give you a few hatchets and you have never thought of thanking him all these long years  it is true but we didnt think  but will you think if i tell you about him  he gave them rain from heaven and fruitful seasons  how it takes one back to the old thoughts the true philosophy of religion  sometimes i lie awake and think if jowett and others could see these things  and yet if it is not presumptuous in me to say so i do think that this work needs men who can think out principle and supply any thoughtful scholar or enquirer with some good reason for urging this or that change in the manners and observances of the people  often as i think of it i feel how greatly the church needs schools for missionaries to be prepared not only in greek and latin and manual work but in the mode of regarding heathenism  it is not a moments work to habitually ask oneself why feel indignant  how can he or she know better  it is not always easy to be patient and to remember the position which the heathen man occupies and the point of view from which he must needs regard everything brought before him  thank you for maclears book  it is a clear statement of the leading facts that one wishes to know a valuable addition to our library  you know no doubt a book which i like much neanders light in dark places  i shall remember about miss mackenzies memoir of that good mrs robertson  i wonder that men are not found to help mr robertson here as you know the climate as in central africa is our difficulty  i think sometimes i make too much of it but really i dont see how a man is to stand many months of it  but i cant help thinking and hoping that if that difficulty did not exist i could see my way to saying now a missionary is wanted for these four or five or six islands one for each and a younger man as fellowhelper to that missionary and they would be forthcoming  yet doubtless i dont estimate fairly the difficulties and hardships as they appear to the man who has never left england and is not used to knocking about  i should have felt the same years ago but for the thought of being with the primate at least i suppose so  well i have written a very dull letter but the place from which it comes will give it some interest  i really think that not mota only but the banks islands are in a hopeful state  next year dv mr palmer will try the experiment of stopping here for eight or ten months  i almost dare to hope that a few years may make great changes  yet it seems as if nothing were done in comparison with what remains to be done  sarah sarawias wife pronounced that as she was always ill at home she would risk the new zealand winter two more married pairs came and four little maidens to be bred up under mrs pritt girls from twelve to eight years old of whom sarah was quite able to take charge  there was the usual proportion of lads from various islands but the most troublesome member of the community seems to have been wadrokalas three years old daughter  i have daily to get wadrokala and carry to prevent their child from being a nuisance to everybody but this might have been a difficulty had she been white  this large party had to be taken to the solomon isles to complete the party sailing in company with the curacoa the commodores ship when the local knowledge and accurate surveying done by mr tilly and mr kerr proved very valuable and sir william wiseman gave most kind and willing assistance  since his short interview with the bishop off norfolk island he had been cruising in the new hebrides  there some of the frequent outrages of the traders had made the people savage and suspicious and one of the missionaries of the london missionary society living at tanna had been threatened driven away across the island and his property destroyed  he had appealed for protection as a british subject and sir william wiseman had no choice but to comply so after warning had been sent to the tribe chiefly concerned to quit their village it was shelled and burnt  no one seems to have been hurt and it was hoped that this would teach the natives to respect their ministerwhether to love his instruction was another question  this would not have been worth mentioning had not a letter from on board the curacoa spoken of chastising a village for attacking a missionary  it went the round of the english papers and some at once concluded that the missionary could be no other than the bishop articles were published with the usual disgusting allusions to the temptation presented by a plump missionary and also observing with more justice that british subjects had no right to run into extraordinary peril and appeal to their flag for protection  every friend or relative of bishop patteson knew how preposterous the supposition was and his brother took pains to contradict the rumour as a matter of fact as his letters soon proved he was not only not in company with the curacoa at the time but had no knowledge either of the outrage or the chastisement till sir william wiseman mentioned it to him when they were together at sydney  at ysabel or mahya the party was made up to sixty seven married couples and seven unmarried girls among them  the female population was stowed away at night in the after cabins with arrangements quite satisfactory to them as they were quite consistent with propriety but which would somewhat startle unaccustomed folk  the curapoa stood in the offing while sta cruz was visited or rather while the southern cross approached for the bishop thought it better not to risk landing but numerous canoes came off and all the curiosities were bought which were offered in hopes of reestablishing a friendly relation  there was reason to think the people of this group more than usually attached to the soil and very shy and distrustful owing perhaps to the memories left by the spaniards  thence the southern cross sailed across for an inspection of curtis island and again with a favourable impression but the brisbane parliament had just been prorogued everyone was taking holiday and the bishop therefore gave up his visit to that place and sent the vessel straight home to auckland with her cargo of souls while he returned to sydney to carry on the same work as in the former year here one great delight and refreshment to him was a visit to mr and mrs mort at their beautiful home at greenoaks  what a delight it must have been to find himself in a church built by his host himself one of the most beautiful things i have seen holds about 500 people stained glass carved stalls stone work cperfect and the house full of firstrate works of art bronzes carvings c was pleasant to the eyes that had been so enthusiastic in italy and germany and had so long fasted from all beauty but that of nature in one special type  the friends there were such as to give life and spirit to all these external charms and this was a very pleasant resting place in his life  to sir john coleridge he writes  i am having a real holiday  this place greenoaks the really magnificent place of my good friends mr and mrs mort is lovely the view of the harbour with its landlocked bays multitude of vessels wooded heights c is not to be surpassed and somehow i dont disrelish handsome rooms and furniture and pictures and statues and endless real works of art in really good taste  one slips into these ways very readily  i must take care i am not spoilt  everyone from the governor downwards lays himself out to make my visit pleasant  they work me hard on sundays and week days but it is a continual round of i dont deny to me pleasurable occupation  kindly people asked to meet me and the conversation always turned to pleasant and useful subjects church government principles of mission work c  these colonies unfortunate in many ways are fortunate in having governors and others in high position who are good men and the class of people among whom my time is spent might me judice hold its position among the best english society  i am very intimate with some few families drop in and set the young ladies down to play beethoven and mendelssohn and it is a nice change and refreshes me  from sydney the bishop went to adelaide and melbourne and these five weeks in australia obtained about 800 pounds for the mission the bishop of sydney had hoped to raise more but there had been two years of terrible drought and destruction of cattle and money was not abundant  the plan of sending australian blacks to be educated with the melanesians was still entertained but he had not much hope of this being useful to the tribes though it might be to the individuals and none of them ever were sent to him  but what had a more important effect on the mission was a conference between sir william wiseman and sir john young the governor of new south wales resulting in an offer from the latter of a grant of land on norfolk island for the mission for the sake of the benefit to the pitcairners at the same time the commodore offered him a passage in the curacoa back to auckland touching at norfolk island by the way  the plan was carried out and brought him home in time for christmas to find all and prosperous under mr pritt at st andrews  his mind was nearly made up on the expedience of a change to a place which was likely to suit both english and tropical constitutions alike and he hoped to make the experiment the ensuing winter with mr palmer and a small body of scholars     chapter x  the episcopate at kohimarama  1866    the removal of his muchloved correspondent did not long withhold the outpouring of bishop pattesons heart to his family while his work was going on at the college according to his own definition of education which was given about this time in a speech at st johns education consists in teaching people to bear responsibilities and laying the responsibilities on them as they are able to bear them  meanwhile he wrote as follows to miss mackenzie on receiving the book she had promised to send him as a relic of her brother   january 1 1866  my dear miss mackenziei have this evening received your brothers thomas a kempis and your letter  i valued the letter much as a true faithful record of one whom may god grant that i may know hereafter if indeed i may be enabled to follow him as he followed christ  and as for the former what can i say but i hope that the thought of your dear brother may help me to read that holy book in something of the spirit in which he read and meditated on it  it seems to bring me very near to him in thought  send me one of his autographs to paste into it  i dont like to cut out the one i have in the long letter to the scottish episcopal church which you kindly sent me  i found too in one of mr codringtons boxes a small sextant for me which being packed with the thomas a kempis i think may have been your brothers  do you really mean this for me too  if so i shall value it scarcely less than the book  indeed i think that divided as i am from all relations and home influences and affections i cling all the more to such means as i may still enjoy of keeping up associations  i like to have my fathers watchchain in use and to write on his old desk  i remember my inkstand in our drawingroom in london  so i value much these memorials of the first missionary bishop of the church of england in modern days at all events and night by night as i read a few lines in his book and think of him it brings me i hope nearer in spirit to him and to others who like him have done their duty well and now rest in christ  we are pretty well now jan 20 but one very promising lad sank last week in low fever a good truthful lad he was and as i baptized him at midnight shortly before he died i felt the great blessing of being able with a very clear conscience to minister to him that holy sacrament and so he passed away to dwell i trust with his lord  what a revelation to that spirit in its escape from the body  but i must not write on  with many thanks once again for these highly valued memorials of your brother  i remain my dear miss mackenzie  very truly yours  j c patteson   the sandalwood referred to in the following letter was the brothers gift to a church all saints babbicombe in which his sisters were deeply interested and of which their little nephew laid the first stone   st matthias day  my dearest sistersyou are thinking of me today i know but you hardly know that in an hour or two i hope the primate will ride down and baptize nine of our melanesian scholars  the last few weeks have been a happy though of course an anxious time and now today the great event of their lives is to take place may god grant that the rest of their lives may be like this beginning  we avoid all fuss  i dont like anyone being here but the primate and mrs selwyn yet i think some dozen more may come though i dont like it  i need not say that making a scene on such occasions is to my mind very objectionable  i could much prefer being quite alone i have translated some appropriate psalms but the 2nd and 57th they hardly know as yet quite well so our service will be psalms 96 97 114 1st lesson 2 kings v 915 magnificat 2nd lesson acts viii 512 and the baptismal service  henry tagalana reads the first and george sarawia the second lesson  then will come my quiet evening as i trust a close of an eventful day  i have your english letters of december with the news of johnny laying the stone  i am thankful that that good work is begun  sir john young writes to me that i can have a gift of 100 acres at norfolk island with permission to buy more  i think that all being well i shall certainly try it with a small party next summer the main body of scholars being still brought to kohimarama  the sandalwood is not yet gone  but my dear joan the altar of sandalwood  if it is to be solid and not veneered why £50 would not buy it at erromango  it sells in sydney for about £70 a ton and it is very heavy wood  however i will send some of the largest planks i ever saw of the wood and it is now well seasoned  it cost me £14 merely to work it into a very simple lectern so hard is the grain  what has become of the old eton stamp of men  have you any in england  i must not run the risk of the mission being swamped by wellintentioned but untaught men  we must have gentlemen of white colour or else i must rely wholly as i always meant to do chiefly on my black gentlemen and many of them are thorough gentlemen in feeling and conduct albeit they dont wear shoes  it was a most impressive service  the dear primate looking worn and somewhat aged very full of feeling the two most advanced george and henry in their surplices reading the lessons the nine candidates looking so reverent and grave yet not without self possession  as he signed each one with the sign of the cross his left hand resting on the head of each the history of the mission rushed into my mind the fruit of the little seed be sowed when eight years ago he thought it wisest not to go ashore at mota and now more than twenty christians of the banks islands serve god with prayers night and day  what would you have thought if you could have been there  our little chapel looked nice with the red hangings and sandalwood lectern  then we had a quiet cup of tea and the old and new baptized party had a quiet talk with me till 830 when i sent them away  and then after an hour i was alone  that i should have been already five years a bishop and how much to think of and grieve over something too to be thankful for  perhaps after all dear edwin and fisher stand out most clearly from all the many scenes and circumstances  and now what is to come  this move to norfolk island  or what something you say perhaps in time showing the governor that the melanesians are not so very wild  but it is another governor and so far from the melanesians being wild it is expressly on the ground that the example of the school will be beneficial that i am asked to go  tell all who may care to know it about our st matthias day i must give myself the pleasure of writing one line to mr keble  i wont write many lest i weary him dear good man  i like to look at his picture and have stuck the photograph of mr and mrs keble which charlotte yonge sent me into the side of it  how i value his prayers and thoughts for us all  your loving brother  j c p  psno terms of full communion between the home and the colonial church can be matter of parliamentary legislation  it is the one faith one lord that binds us together and as for regulating the question of colonially ordained clergy ministering in english dioceses you had better equalise your own church law first for dealing with an incumbent and a curate   auckland tuesday in holy week  my dear unclei have long owed you a letter but i have not written because i have had an unusual time of distraction  now all my things being on board the  southern cross i am detained by a foul wind  we can do nothing till it changes and i am not sorry to have a few quiet hours though the thought of a more than usually serious separation from the dear primate and mrs selwyn sir william and lady martin hangs over my head rather gloomily  still i am convinced as far as i can be of such matters that this move to norfolk island is good for the mission on the whole  it has its drawbacks as all plans have but the balance is decidedly in favour of norfolk island as against new zealand  i have given reasons at length for this opinion in letters to joan and fan and also i think to charlotte yonge who certainly deserves to know all my thoughts about it  but i may shortly state some of them in case you may not have heard them because i should like this step to approve itself to your mind  1  norfolk island is 600 miles hearer to melanesian islands than auckland and not only nearer in actual distance but the 600 miles from norfolk island to auckland are the cold and boisterous miles that must be passed at the extremities of the voyages with no intervening lands to call at and obtain a change for our large party on board  2  the difficulty usually is to get westward when sailing from new zealand by the north cape of new zealand because the prevalent winds are from the west  so that usually the passage to norfolk island is a longone  3  new zealand is much to the east of norfolk island and to go from the loyalty new hebrides banks and santa cruz groups to new zealand it is necessary to make a long stretch out to the ne the trades blowing from about se by e standing down to s on the other tack  but norfolk island is almost due s of other those groups  4  i cannot come back from the islands during my winter voyage to new zealand it is too distant the coast is dangerous in the winter season and the cold too great for a party of scholars first coming from the tropics  but i can go backwards and forwards through the islands and norfolk island during the five winter months  it is not wise to sail about in the summer hurricanes being prevalent then  5  as i can only make one return from the islands to new zealand in the year i can only have a school consisting of say sixty melanesians brought in the very crowded vessel  say thirty left in new zealand for the winter and i dare not attempt to leave many for so much care is needed in the cold season  but in norfolk island i can have a school of any number because i can make separate voyages thither from the banks and solomon islands c each time bringing a party of sixty if i think fit  6  the productions of norfolk island include the yam taro caladium esculentum sweet potato sugarcane banana almond orange pineapple coffee maize  only cocoanut and breadfruit are wanting that natives of melanesia care much about  7  there is no necessity for so violent a contrast as there must be in new zealand between the life with us and in their homes in respect of dress food and houses  light clothing and an improved style of native house and more cleanly way of eating their foodnot of cooking it for they are cleanly already in thatmay be adopted and more easily perpetuated in their own homes than the heavy clothing necessary here and the different style of houses and more english food  this is very important because with any abrupt change of the outer man there is sometimes a more very more natural abandonment of the inner thoughts and disposition and character  just as men so often lose selfrespect when they take to the bush life or children who pray by their own little bedside alone leave off praying in long chamber the outward circumstances being altered  i have for years thought that we seek in our missions a great deal too much to make english christians of our converts  we consciously and unanimously assume english christianity as something distinct i mean from the doctrines of the church of england to be necessary much as so many people assume the relation of church and state in england to be the typical and normal condition of the church which should be everywhere reproduced  evidently the heathen man is not treated fairly if we encumber our message with unnecessary requirements  the ancient church had its selection of fundamentalsa kind of simple and limited expansion of the apostles creed for doctrine and apostolic practice for discipline  notoriously the eastern and western mind misunderstood one another the speculative east and the practical west could not be made to think after the same fashion  the church of christ has room for both  now any one can see what mistakes we have made in india  few men think themselves into the state of the eastern mind feel the difficulties of the asiatic and divine the way in which christianity should be presented to him  we seek to denationalise these races as far as i can see whereas we ought surely to change as little as possibleonly what is clearly incompatible with the simplest form of christian teaching and practice  i dont mean that we are to compromise truth but to study the native character and not present the truth in an unnecessarily unattractive form  dont we overlay it a good deal with human traditions and still more often take it for granted that what suits us must be necessary for them and vice versa  so many of our missionaries are not accustomed not taught to think of these things  they grow up with certain modes of thought hereditary notions and they seek to reproduce these no respect being had to the utterly dissimilar character and circumstances of the heathen  i think much about all this  sir william martin and i have much talk about it and the strong practical mind of the primate i hope would keep me straight if i was disposed to theorise which i dont think is the case  but christianity is the religion for humanity at large  it takes in all shades and diversities of character race c  the substratum of it is so to say inordinate and coextensive with the substratum of humanityall men must receive that  each set of men must also receive many thing of secondary yet of very great importance for them but in this class there will be differences according to the characteristic differences of men throughout the world  i cant explain myself fully but dear uncle i think there is something in what i am trying to say  i want to see more discrimination more sense of the due proportion the relative importance of the various parts which make up the sum of extra teaching  there is so great want of order in the methods so often adopted want of arrangement and proper sequence and subordination of one to another  the heathen man will assume some arbitrary dictate of a missionary to be of equal authority and importance with a moral command of god unless you take care  of course the missionary ought not to attempt to impose any arbitrary rule at all but many missionaries do and usually justify such conduct on the ground of their exceptional position  but one must go much further  if i tell a man just beginning to listen two or three points of christian faith or two or three rules of christian life without any orderly connection i shall but puzzle him  take eg our english sunday i am far from wishing to change the greater part of the method of observing it in england  i hope the melanesian christians may learn to keep holy the lords day  but am i to begin my teaching of a wild solomon islander at that end when he has not learned the evil of breaking habitually the sixth seventh and eighth commandments  i notice continually the tendency of the teaching of the very men who denounce forms to produce formation  it is nearest to the native mind it generates hypocrisy and mere outward observance of certain rules which during the few years that the people remain docile on their first acceptance of the new teaching they are content to submit to  i see the great difficulty of making out all this  it necessitates the leaving so very much to the discretion of the pioneer  ergo the missionary must not be the man who is not good enough for ordinary work in england but the men whom england even does not produce in large numbers with some power of dealing with these questions  it is much better and safer to have a regular wellknown rule to act by but i dont see how you can give me eg precise directions it seems to me that you must use great care in selecting your man and then trust him fully  i hope it is not an excess of selfconceit and selfreliance which makes me pass by rather lightly i confess some of the advice that very wellintentioned people occasionally volunteer to missionaries i have had dgr the primate and sir william martins men who know what heathenism is and the latter of whom has deeply studied the character of the various races of the world  i mean that when some one said do you really mean to place those savage melanesians among the immaculate pitcairners the natural answer seemed to me to be i am not aware that you ever saw either a pitcairner or a melanesian  i thought it rather impertinent  the truth is that the great proportion of our melanesian scholars in our school ie not standing alone but helped by the discipline of the school are quite competent to set an example to the average pitcairners  but this i mark only as an illustration of my meaning occasionally i hear of some book or sermon or speech in which sound views as i venture to call them are propounded on these points  always your loving and grateful nephew  j c patteson   the next letter was called forth by my sorrowful communication of the shattered state of both my dear friends of whom one at the very time that my cousin wrote was already gone to his rest having been mercifully spared the loneliness and grief we had feared for him   st andrews april 24 1866  my dear cousini write a line at once in reply to a letter of january 29 for i see that a great sorrow is hanging over you is perhaps already fallen on you and i would fain say my word of sympathy possibly of comfort  one perhaps of the great blessings that a person in my position enjoys is that he must perforce see through the present gloom occasioned by loss of present companionship on to the joy beyond  i hear of the death of dear uncle and friends and even of that loving and holy father of mine and somehow it seems all peace and calmness and joy  it would not be so were i in england to actually experience the sense of loss to see the vacant seat and miss the wellknown voice but it is as i see a great and most blessed alleviation to the loss of their society here below  you feel that when those loving hearts at hursley can no longer be a stay and comfort to you here you will have a sense almost of desolation pressing on you  you must we all have many trials and some sorrows and i suppose hursley has always been to you a city of refuge and house of rest  but i think the anticipation is harder than the reality  for him but how can i speak of such as he is  why should we feel anxiety surely he is just the man upon whom we should expect some special suffering which is but some special mark of love and may we not say in such a case of approbation  some special aid to a very close conformity to the mind and character of christ to be sent in special love and mercy  i always seem to think that in the case of good men the suffering is the sure earnest of special nearness to god  it surelyif one may dare so to speak and the case of job warrants it and the great passage simon simon satan hath desired to have you allis true that god is glorified in the endurance of sufferings which he lays upon the saints  and if dear mr keble must suffer this last blow as all through his life he has felt the care of the churches pressing sorely on him and has even had to comfort the weary and guide the wayward and to endure disappointment and to restrain the over zealotish and reprove the thoughtless and bear in his bosom the infirmities of many peoplewhy must we be unhappy about him and why mourn for ourselves  god forbid  it is only one mark of the cross stamped upon him only one more draught of the cup of the lacking measures of the afflictions of christ  but you must more than i know and feel all this and it is only in attempting to put before your eyes your own thoughts that i have written this  for indeed i do sympathise with you and i think how to me who knew him so little yet yield to no one in deep reverence and love for him his departure would be almost what the passing away of one of those who had seen the lord must have been to those of old time yet our time is not so very long now and may be short and we have had this blessed example for a long time and there is on all accounts far more cause for joy than for sorrow  you must not think me unkind to miss mackenzie because i have written to fan to say that my letters and anecdotes are not to be fishes to swim in her net  it may be unwise in me to write all that kind of thing but it does such an infinity of harm by its reflex action upon us who are engaged in this work  and i can write brotherly letters if they are to be treated as public property  i could not trust my own brother to make extracts from my letters  no one in england can be a judge of the mischief that the letters occasion printed contrary to my wish by friends  we in the mission think them so infinitely absurd onesided exaggerated c though we dont mean to make them so when we write them  we are all well thank god except a good fellow called walter hotaswol from matlavo saddle island who is in a decline  he has had two bad haemorrhages but he is patient simpleminded quite content to die and not doubting at all his fathers love and his saviours merits so i cannot grieve for him though he was the one humanly speaking to have led the way in his home  you know that i sympathise with all your anxieties about church matters  parliamentary legislation would be the greatest evil of all  all your troubles only show that synodical action and i believe with the laity in the synod is the only cure for these troubles  god bless you my dear cousin  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   to the sisters he wrote at the same time  i hear from miss yonge that mrs keble is very illdying  but as i wrote to her why should such things grieve us  he will soon rejoin her and so it is all peace and comfort  he was seventyfive i think last st marks day and i began a letter to him but it was not fair to him to give him the trouble of reading it and i tore it up  he knows without it how i do love and revere him and i cannot pluck up courage to ask for some little book which he has used that there may be a sort of odour of sanctity about it just as bishop mackenzies thomas a kempis with him on the zambesi is on my table now   before going forth with this lonely watcher upon his voyage the description of this seasons work with his scholars must be given from a report which he brought himself to write for the eton association  after saying how his efforts were directed to the forming a number of native clergy in time to work among their own people he continueswhen uncivilised races come into contact with civilised men they must either be condemned to a hopeless position of inferiority or they must be raised out of their state of ignorance and vice by appealing to those powers within them which god intended them to use and the use of which will place them by his blessing in the possession of whatever good things may be denoted by the words religion and civilisation  either we may say to our melanesian scholars you cant expect to be like us you must not suppose that you can ever cease to be dependent on us you must be content always to do as you are told by us to be like children as in malice so in knowledge you can never be missionaries you may become assistant teachers to english missionaries whom you must implicitly obey you must do work which it would not be our place to do you must occupy all the lower and meaner offices of our societyor if we do not say this and indeed no one would be likely to say it yet we may show by our treatment of our scholars that we think and mean it  or we may say what was eg said to a class of nineteen scholars who were reading acts ix  did our lord tell saul all that he was to do  no  what not even when he appeared to him in that wonderful way from heaven  no  what did the lord say to him  that he was to go into damascus and there it would be told him what he was to do  what means did the lord use to tell saul what he was to do  he sent a man to tell him  who was he  ananias  do we know much about him  no only that he was sent with a message to saul to tell him the lords will concerning him and to baptize him  what means did the lord employ to make his will known to saul  he sent a disciple to tell him did he tell him himself immediately  no he sent a man to tell him  mention another instance of gods working in the same way recorded in the acts  the case of cornelius who was told by the angel to send for peter  the angel then was not sent to tell cornelius the way of salvation  no god sent peter to do that  jesus christ began to do the same thing when he was on earth did he not even while he was himself teaching and working miracles  yes he sent the twelve apostles and the seventy disciples  but what is the greatest instance of all the greatest proof to us that god chooses to declare his will through man to man   god sent his own son to become man  could he not have converted the whole world in a moment to the obedience of faith by some other way  yes  but what did he in his wisdom choose to do  he sent his son to be born of the virgin mary to become man and to walk on this earth as a real man and to teach men and to die for men  what does jesus christ call us men  his brethren who is our mediator  the man christ jesus  what means does god employ to make his will known to us  he uses men to teach men  can they do this by themselves  no but god makes them able  how have you heard the gospel  because god sent you to us  and now listen  how are all your people still in ignorance to hear it  what have i often told you about that  whereupon the scholars looked shy and some said softly we must teach them  yes indeed you must  and so the lesson ended with questioning them on the great duty and privilege of prayer for gods holy spirit to give them both the will and the power to do the work to which god is calling them  so we constantly tell them god has already been very merciful to you in that he has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light  he has enabled you to receive the knowledge of his will and to understand your relations to him  he has taught you to believe in him to pray to him to hope for salvation through the merits of his sons death and resurrection  he has made you feel something of the power of his love and has taught you the duty of loving him and serving your brother  he calls upon you now to rouse yourself to a sense of your true position to use the gifts which he has given you to his glory and the good of your brethren  dont suppose that you are unable to do this  you are unable to do it as you were unable to believe and love him by yourselves but he gives you strength for this very purpose that you may be able to do it  you can do it through christ who strengtheneth you  our fathers were not more able to teach their people once than you to teach your people now  we make no distinction whatever between english and melanesian members of the mission as such  no melanesian is excluded from any office of trust  no classification is made of higher and lower kinds of work of work befitting a white man and work befitting a black man  english and melanesian scholars or teachers work together in the school printingoffice dairy kitchen farm  the senior clergyman of the mission labours most of all with his own hands at the work which is sometimes described as menial work and it is contrary to the fundamental principle of the mission that anyone should connect with the idea of white man the right to fag a black boy  young men and lads come to us and say let me do that  i cant write the languages or do many things you or mr pritt or mr palmer do so let me scrub your floor or brush your shoes or fetch some water  and of course we let them do so for the doing it is accompanied by no feeling of degradation in their minds they have seen us always doing these things and not requiring them to do them as if it were the natural work for them because they are black and not proper for us because we are white  last night a young man sitting by the fire said to the bishop they want you to stop with them in my land  i wish with all my heart i could  yes i know you must go to so many places  but they are different in your land now  oh yes they dont fight now as they used to do they dont go about armed now  well that is a thing to be thankful for  what is the reason of it do you think   why they know about you and see you now and then and henry tagalana talked to them and i talked a little to them and they asked me about our ways here and they want to learn  well there are now five of you from your island and you must try hard to learn that you may teach them for remember you must do it if god spares your life  during the year 1865 a great advance was made in the industrial department of our work  about seventeen acres of land were taken in hand and worked by mr pritt with the melanesian lads  we have our own dairy of thirteen cows and besides supplying the whole mission party numbering in all seventyseven persons with abundance of milk we sell considerable quantities of butter  we grow of course our own potatoes and vegetables and maize c for our cows  the farm and dairy work affords another opportunity for teaching our young people to acquire habits of industry  cooking farm gardening dairywork setting out the table c were all honourable occupations and of great importance in teaching punctuality and regularity and the various arts and decencies of life to the youths who were in time to implant good habits in their native homes  their natural docility made them peculiarly easy to manage and train while in hand the real difficulty was that their life was so entirely different from their home that there was no guessing how deep the training went and on every voyage some fishes slipped through the meshes of the net though some returned again and others never dropped from their bishops hands  but he was becoming anxious to spare some of his scholars the trial of a return to native life and as the season had been healthy he ventured on leaving twentyseven pupils at st andrews with mr and mrs pritt among them george and sarah sarawia  after trinity sunday may 27 the southern cross sailed and the outward voyage gave leisure for the following letter to prof max muller explaining why he could not make his knowledge of languages of more benefit to philology while thus absorbed in practical work   southern cross off norfolk ireland june 6 1866  my dear friendi am about to tire your patience heavily  for i must find you some reasons for doing so little in making known these melanesian dialects and that will be wearisome for you to read and secondly i cannot put down clearly and consecutively what i want to say  i have so very little time for thinking out and working at any one subject continuously that my whole habit of mind becomes i fear inaccurate and desultory  i have so very many and so very different occupations and so much anxiety and so many interruptions as the friction that attends the working of a new and somewhat untried machine  you know that we are few in number indeed codrington being absent i have but two clergymen with me and two young men who may be ordained byandby  besides had i the twenty troublesome men whom you wish to banish into these regions what use would they or any men be until they had learnt their work  and it must fall to me to teach them and that takes again much of my time so that as a matter of fact there are many things that i must do even when all is going on smoothly and should sickness come then of course my days and nights are spent in nursing poor lads to whom no one else can talk cheering up poor fellows seized with sudden nervous terror giving food to those who will take it from no one else c  then the whole management of the mission must fall upon me though i am most thankful to say that for some time mr pritt has relieved me from the charge of all domestic and industrial works  he does everything of that kind and does it admirably so that our institution really is a wellordered industrial school in which kitchen work dairy work farm work printing clothes making and mending c are all carried on without the necessity of having any foreign importation of servants who would be sure to do harm both by their ideas as to perquisites  stealing in the minds of our melanesians and by introducing the idea of paid labour whereas now we all work together and no one counts any work degrading and still less does any one qua white consider himself entitled to fag a melanesian  mr tilly rn has also quite relieved me from my duties as skipper and i have no trouble about marine stores shipping seamen navigating the vessel now  i cannot be too thankful for this it saves me time anxiety and worry yet much remains that i must do which is not connected with peculiar work directly  i cant refuse the bishop of new zealand when he presses me for want of a better man to be trustee of properties and to engage in managing the few educational institutions we have  i cant refuse to take some share in english clerical work while on shore indeed in 1865 my good friend archdeacon lloyd being ill i took his parish one and a half hour distant from kohimarama the most important parish in auckland for some three months not slacking my melanesian work though i could only avoid going back by hard application and could make no progress  then i must attend our general synod and all these questions concerning the colonial churches take some time to master and yet i must know what is going on  then i must carry on all the correspondence of the mission  i am always writing letters  every £5 from any part of new zealand or australia i must acknowledge and everyone wants information anecdotes c which it vexes my soul to have to supply but who else can do it  then i keep all the accounts very complicated as you would say if you saw my big ledger  and i dont like to be altogether behindhand in the knowledge of theological questions and people sometimes write to me and their letters need to be answered carefully  besides take my actual time spent in teaching  shall i give you a day at kohimarama  i get in the full summer months an hour for reading by being dressed at 530 am  at 530 i see the lads washing c 7 am breakfast all together in hall 730 chapel 8930 school 9301230 industrial work  during this time i have generally half an hour with mr pritt about business matters and proof sheets are brought me yet i get a little time for preparing lessons  1245 short service in chapel 1 dinner 23 greek testament with english young men 34 classics with ditto 5 tea 630 evening chapel 7830 evening school with divers classes in rotation or with candidates for baptism or confirmation 8309 special instruction to more advanced scholars only a few  910 school with two other english lay assistants  add to all this visitors interrupting me from 45 correspondence accounts trustee business sermons nursing sick boys and all the many daily unexpected little troubles that must be smoothed down and questions inquired into and boys conduct investigated and what becomes of linguistics  so much for my excuse for my small progress in languages  dont think all this egotistical it is necessary to make you understand my position  if i had spare time leisure for working at any special work perhaps eleven years of this kind of life have unfitted me for steady sustained thought  and you know well i bring but slender natural qualifications to the task  a tolerably true ear and good memory for words and now something of the instinctive insight into new tongues but that is chiefly from continual practice  but when i attempt to systematise i find endless ramifications of cognate dialects rushing through my brain by their very multitude overwhelming me and though i see the affinities and can make practical use of them i dont know how to state them on paper where to begin how to put another person in my position  again for observation of the rapid changes in these dialects i have not much opportunity  for no one in melanesia can be my informant  it is not easy where so many dialects must be known for practical purposes for the introductory part of mission work to talk to some wild naked old fellow and to make him understand what i am anxious to ascertain  it is a matter that has no interest for him he never thought of it he doesnt know my meaning what have we in common  how can i rouse him from his utter indifference even if i know his language so well as to talk easily not to a scholar of my own but to an elderly man with none but native ideas in his head  all that i can do is to learn many dialects of a given archipelago present their existing varieties and so work back to the original language  this to some extent has been done in the banks group and in the eastern part of the solomon isles  but directly i get so far as this i am recalled to the practical necessity of using the knowledge of the several dialects rather to make known gods truth to the heathen than to inform literati of the process of dialectic variation  dont mistake me my dear friend or suspect me of silly sentimentalism  but you can easily understand what it is to feel god has given to me only of all christian men the power of speaking to this or that nation and moreover that is the work he has sent me to do  often i dont deny i should like the other better  it is very pleasant to shirk my evening class eg  and spend the time with sir william martin discussing some point of melanesian philosophy  but then my dear lads have lost two hours of christian instruction and that wont do  i dont need to be urged to do more in working out their languages i am quite aware of the duty of doing all that i can in that way and i wish to do it but there are only twentyfour hours in the day and night together  i feel that it is a part of my special work for each grammar and dictionary that i can write opens out the language to some other than myself  but i am now apologising rather for my fragmentary way of writing what i do write by saying that what i find enough with my help given in school to enable one of my party to learn a dialect i am almost obliged to regard as a measure of the time that i ought to spend on it  another thing i have no outline provided for me which i can fill up  my own clear impression is that to attempt to follow the analogy of our complicated greek and latin grammars would not only involve certain failure but would mislead people altogether  i dont want to be hunting after a melanesian paulopostfuturum  i had rather say all men qua men think and have a power of expressing their thoughts  they have wants and express them  they use many different forms of speech in making that statement if we look superficially at the matter not so if we look into it and so on  then discarding the ordinary arrangement of grammars explain the mode of thought the peculiar method of thinking upon matters of common interest in the mind of the melanesian as exhibited in his language  an englishman says when i get there it will be night  but a pacific islander says i am there it is night  the one says go on it will soon be dark  the other go on it has become already night anyone sees that the one possesses the power of realising the future as present or past the other now whatever it may have been once does not exercise such power  a companion calls me at 530 am with the words eke me gong veto hullo it is night already he means why we ought to be off we shall never reach the end of our journey before dark  but how neatly and prettily he expresses his thought  i assure you civilised languages for common conversational purposes needed by travellers c are clumsy contrivances  of course you know all this a hundred times better than i do  i only illustrate my idea of a grammar as a means of teaching others the form of the mould in which the melanesians mind is cast  i think i ought to go farther and seek for certain categories under which thought may be classified so to say and beginning with the very simplest work on to the more complicated powers  but i havent the head to do this and suppose that i did make such a framework how am i to fill it in so as to be intelligible to outsiders  for practical purposes i give numerals personal possessive and demonstrative pronouns the mode of qualifying nouns eg some languages interpose a monosyllable between the substantive and adjective others do not  the words used as it is called as prepositions and adverbs the mode of changing a neuter verb into a transitive or causative verb usually by a word prefixed which means do or make eg die dodie dotothedeath him  then i teach orally how the intonation accentuation pause in the utterance gesticulation supply the place of stops marks of interrogation c  then giving certain nouns verbs c make my english pupils construct sentences then give them a vocabulary and genuine native stories not translations at all least of all of religious books which contain very few native ideas but stories of sharks cocoa nuts canoes fights c  this is the apparatus  this gives but little idea of a melanesian dialect to you  i know it and am anxious to do more  this last season i have had some three or four months during which i determined that i must refuse to take so much english work c  i sat and growled in my den and of course rather vexed people and perhaps for which i should be most heartily grieved my dear friend and leader the bishop of new zealand  but i stuck to my work  i wrote about a dozen papers of phrases in as many dialects to show the mode of expressing in those dialects what we express by adverbs and prepositions c  this is of course the difficult part of a language for a stranger to find out  i also printed three and have three more nearly finished in ms vocabularies of about 600 words with a true native sehdia on each word  the mere writing for much was written twice over took a long time  and there is this gained by these vocabularies for practical purposes these are with more exceptions it is true than i intended the words which crop up most readily in a melanesian mind  much time i have wasted and would fain save others from wasting in trying to form a melanesian mind into a given direction into which it ought as i supposed to have travelled but which nevertheless it refused to follow  just ten years experience has of course taught me a good deal of the minds of these races and when i catch a new fellow as wild as a hawk and set to work at a new language it is a great gain to have even partially worked out the problem what words shall i try to get from this fellow  now i go straight to my mark or rather i am enabling i hope my young friends with me to do so for of course i have learnt to do so myself more or less for some time past  many words may surprise you and many alterations i should make in any revision i know a vast number of words not used in these vocabularies in some languages i daresay five times the number but i had a special reason for writing only these  the rest must come if i live byandby  of course these languages are very poor in respect of words belonging to civilised and literary and religious life but exceedingly rich in all that pertains to the needs and habits of men circumstanced as they are  i draw naturally this inference dont be in any hurry to translate and dont attempt to use words as assumed equivalents of abstract ideas  dont devise modes of expression unknown to the language as at present in use  they cant understand and therefore dont use words to express definitions  but as everywhere our lord gives us the model  a certain lawyer asked him for a definition of his neighbour but he gave no definition only he spoke a simple and touching parable  so teach not a technical word but an actual thing  why do i write all this to you it is wasting your time  but i prose ona sheet follows on the structure of the languages  well i have inflicted a volume on you  we are almost becalmed after a weary fortnight of heavy weather in which we have been knocked about in every direction in our tight little 90ton schooner and my head is hardly steady yet so excuse a long letter or rather long chatty set of desultory remarks from  your old affectionate friend  j c patteson   a little scene from mr atkins journal shows how he had learnt to talk to natives  he went ashore with the bishop and some others at sesaki for yams  it has been by far the pleasantest day of the kind that i have seen here  the people are beginning to understand that they can do no better than trade fairly with us and today they on the whole behaved very well  a very big fellow had been ringing all the changes between commanding and entreating me to give him a hatchet i was holding the trade bag  when he found it was no use he said i was a bad man and never gave anything  i said yes i was  he said the bishops were very good men they gave liberally  he had better go and ask the bishop for something for he was a good man though i was not  after landing mr palmer at mota the vessel went onto the solomon isles reaching bauro on the 27th  about 830 in the evening the boat was lowered and the party pulled towards the village which was the home of taroniara in a fine clear moonlit night by the fires which people had lit for the people on shore and directed by taroniara himself to the opening in the reef they landed in the midst of a group of dark figures some standing in a brook some by the side under a large spreading tree round a fire fed by dry cocoanut leaves and in the background were tall cocoa nuts with their gracefully drooping plumes and the moon behind shining through them made the shade seem darker and deeper as the flashing crests of the surf breaking on the reef made the heaving sea beyond look murkier  it was a sight worth going a long way to see so says mr atkins journal  the next sight was however still more curious  the bishop relented so far towards the net as to write an account of it on purpose for it  ysabel island is like almost all the rest divided among many small communities of warlike habits  and some years previously the people of mahaga the place with which he was best acquainted had laid an ambush for those of hogirano killed a good many and cutting off their heads had placed them in a row upon stones and danced round them in a victorious suit of whitecoral lime  however a more powerful tribe not long after came down upon mahaga and fearfully avenged the massacre of hogirano  all were slain who could not escape into the bush and when the few survivors after days and nights of hunger ventured back they found the dwellings burnt the fruit trees cut down the yam and taro grounds devastated and more than a hundred headless bodies of their kindred lying scattered about  this outrage had led to the erection of places of refuge in the tops of trees and bishop patteson who had three mahagan scholars went ashore with the hope of passing the night in one of these wonderful places where the people always slept though by day they lived in the ordinary open bamboo huts  after landing in a mangrove swamp and wading through deep mud he found that the mahaga people had removed from their old site and had built a strong fortification near the sea and close above so as to be reached by ladders resting on the wall were six large tree houses  it had been raining heavily for a day or two and the paths were so deep in mud that the bed of a watercourse was found preferable to them  the bush had been cleared for some distance before the steep rocky mound where the village stood surrounded by a high wall of stones in which one narrow entrance was left approached by a fallen trunk of a tree lying over a hollow  the huts were made of bamboo canes and the floors raised above the ground were nearly covered with mats and a kind of basket work  the treehouses six in number were upon the tops of trees of great height 50 feet round at the base and all branches cleared off till near the summit where two or three grew out at right angles something after the manner of an italian stone pine  from the top of the wall the ladder that led to one of these houses was 60 feet long but it was not quite upright and the tree was growing at some little distance from the bottom of the rock and the distance by a plumb line from the floor of the verandah to the ground on the lower side of the tree was 94 feet  the floor of the house which is made first was 23 feet long and about 11 broad a narrow verandah is left at each end and the inside length of the house is 18 feet the breadth 10 feet the height to the ridge pole 6 feet the floor was of bamboo matted the roof and sides of palmleaf thatch  the ladders were remarkable contrivances a pole in the centre from 4 to 6 inches in diameter to which were lashed by vines cross pieces of wood about two feet long  to steady these and hold on by were double shrouds of supplejacks  the rungs of the ladder were at unequal distances 42 upon the 50 feet ladder  the bishop and pasvorang who had gone ashore together beheld men women and children running up and down these ladders and walking about the bare branches trusting entirely to their feet and not touching with their hands  the bishop in his wet slippery shoes did not think it right to run the risk of an accident and though pasvorang who was as much at home as a sailor among the ropes of the southern cross made the ascent he came down saying i was so afraid my legs shook  dont you go going aloft is nothing to it but the people could not understand any dread and when the bishop said i cant go up there  i am neither bird nor bat and i have no wings if i fall they thought him joking  at the same time he saw a woman with a load on her back quietly walking up a ladder to another tree not indeed so lofty as that pasvorang had tried but as if it were the most natural thing in the world and without attempting to catch hold with her hands  at night says the bishop as i lay ignominiously on the ground in a hut i heard the songs of the women aloft as voices from the clouds while the loud croaking of the frogs the shrill noise of countless cicadas the scream of cockatoos and parrots the cries of birds of many kinds and the not unreasonable fear of scorpions all combined to keep me awake  solemn thoughts pass through the mind at such times and from time to time i spoke to the people who were sleeping in the hut with me  it rained heavily in the night and i was not sorry to find myself at 7 am on board the schooner  the next day was spent in doing the honours of the ship a crowd on board all day and on july 2 the bishop landed again with mr atkin and mounted up to this wonderful nest where all these measurements were made  it proved much more agreeable to look at from below than to inhabit the low steaming bamboo hutsthe crowds the dirt the squalling of babiesyou cant sit or stand or touch anything that is not grimy and sooty and muddy  it is silly to let these things really affect one only that it now seems rather to knock me up after such a day and night i am very tired come back to our little ship as to a palace wash and sit down on a clean if not a soft stool and am free for a little while from continual noise and the necessity of making talk in an imperfectly known language  it is really curious to see how in some way our civilised mode of life unfits one for living among these races  it is not to be denied that the want of such occupations as we are employed in is a large cause of their troubles  what are they to do during the long hours of night and on wet pouring days  they cant read they cant see in their huts to do any work making baskets c  they must lie about talking scandal and acquiring listless indolent habits  then comes a wild reaction  the younger people like excitement as much as our young men like hunting fishing shooting c  how can they get this  why they must quarrel and fight and so they pass their time it does seem almost impossible to do much for people so circumstanced yet it was much the same in mota and elsewhere where things are altered for the better  it was bad and trying weather and it was well to have only two old banks islanders on board besides three ysabel lads  the bishop had plenty of time for writing and for the first time in his life pronounced himself forward with that report which was always on his mind  he goes on i read a good deal but i dont say that my mind is very active all the time and i have some schooling  yet it is not easy to do very much mental work  i think that i feel the heat more than i used to do but that may be only my fancy  you meantime are i hope enjoying fine summer weather  certainly it must be a charming place that you have close to that grand church and grand scenery  i think my idea of a cosy home is rather that of a cottage in the isle of wight or better still a house near such a cathedral as wells in one of the cottages close to the clear streams that wind through and about the cathedral precincts  but i can form no real notions about such things  only i am pretty sure that there is little happiness without real hard work  i do long sometimes for a glorious cathedral service for the old chants anthems not for functions and processions c  i have read freemans pamphlet on ritual  with interest he really knows what he writes about and has one great object and a worthy one the restoration of the universal practice of weekly communion as the special sunday service that all our preachifying is a wide departure from the very idea of worship is selfevident when it is made more than a necessary part of the religious observance of the lords day and catechising is worth far more than preaching in the technical sense of the word  a first visit was paid to savo where numerous canoes came out to meet them one a kind of state galley with the stem and stern twelve feet high inlaid with motherofpearl and ornamented with white shells most likely the ovum or poached egg and containing the chief men of the island  the people spoke the ysabel language and the place seemed promising  some little time was spent in beating up to bauro where the bishop again landed at taroniaras village and slept in his hut which was as disagreeable as all such places weresuch a night always disturbs me for a time throws everything out of regular working order but it always pays the people like it and it shows a confidence in them which helps us on  i was disappointed though in the morning when taroniara declined to come with me to this place  my people say why do you go awaythe old stupid way of getting out of an engagement  however two others came to this place which was a hut in the village of wango which the bishop had hired for ten days for the rent of a hatchet  a very sufficient rent too you would say if you could see the place  i can only stand upright under the ridge pole the whole of the oblong is made of bamboo with a good roof that kept out a heavy shower last night  there is a fresh stream of water within fifteen yards where i bathed at 9 pm yesterday and as i managed to get rid of strangers by 830 it was not so difficult to manage a shift into a clean and dry sleeping shirt and then lying down on aunt williams corkbed my old travelling companion i slept very fairly  people about the hut at earliest dawn and the day seems long the sustained effort of talking the heat the crowd and the many little things that should not but do operate as an annoyance all tire one very much  but i hope that by degrees i may get opportunities of talking about the matter that i come to talk about  just now the trading with the vessel which is detained here by the weather and surprise at my halfdozen books c prevent any attention being paid to anything else  7 pmthe vessel went off at 1030 am  i felt for a little while rather forlorn and a little sinking at the heart  you see i confess it all how silly  cant i after so many years bear to be left in one sense alone  i read a little of you know what book and then found the feeling pass entirely away  but more than that the extreme friendliness of the people the real kindness was pleasant to me  one man brought his child the child of us two bishop  another man these cocoanut trees are the property of us two remember  a third when you want yams dont you buy them tell me  but far better still  many times already today have i spoken to the people they have so far listened that they say take this boy and this boy and this boy  we see now why you dont want big men we see now that you cant stop here long what for you wish for lads whom you may teach we see that you want them for a long time  keep these lads two years  yes two or three or four  byandby you will understand more and more my reason  then came the talks that you too may experience when dealing with some neglected child in london or it may be in the country but which under the cocoanut tree with dark naked men have a special impressiveness  it was the old lesson of the eternal and universal father who has not left himself without witness in that he gives us all rain from heaven c and of our ingratitude and his love of his coming down to point out the way of life and of his death and rising again of another world resurrection and judgment  all interrupted now and then by exclamations of surprise laughter or by some one beginning to talk about something that jarred sadly on ones ear and yet was but natural  but i do hope that a week may pass not unprofitably  in one sense i shall no doubt be glad when it is over but i think that it may by gods great goodness be a preparation for something more to come  last night my little hired hut being crowded as usual they all cried out at once numu earthquake  i should not the least have known that anything had occurred  i said i thought it was a pig pushing against the bamboo wall of the hut  they say that they have no serious shocks but very many slight ones  crocodiles they have too but they say none in this stream  july 22ndit is 9 pm the pleasantest time in one sense of my twentyfour hours for there are only two people with me in the hut  my arrangements are somewhat simple but i am very comfortable delicious bathes i have in the stream yams and fish are no bad fare and i have some biscuit and essence of coffee and a few books and am perfectly well  the mode of life has become almost natural to me i am on capital terms with the people and even the babies are no longer afraid of me  old and young men and women boys and girls about me of course all day and small presents of yams fish bananas almonds show the friendliness of the people when properly treated  but the bunches of skulls remain slung up in the large canoe houses and they can be wild enough when they are excited  the home diary continues on the 26thi am expecting the schooner and shall be glad to get off if it arrives today for it is very fine  i dont think i could do any good by staying a few days more so i might as well be on my way to santa cruz  if i were here for good of course i should be busy about many things that it would be useless to attempt now eg what good would it be to induce halfadozen boys to learn a when i should be gone before they could learn b  so i content myself with making friends with the people observing their ways and talking to them as i can  it is hot now at 830 am  what will it be at 2 pm  but i may perhaps be able to say something to cheer me up  one of the trials of this kind of thing is that one seems to be doing nothing  simply i am here  hardly in one hour out of the twentyfour am i sure to be speaking of religion  yet the being here is something the gaining the confidence and goodwill of the people  then comes the thought who is to carry this on  and yet i dare not ask men to come for i am certain they would after all my pains find something different from what they expect  my death would very likely bring out some better men for the work with energy and constructive power and executive genius all of which guided by divine wisdom seem to be so much wanted  but just now i dont see what would become of a large part of the work if i died  i am leaving books somewhat more in order but it is one thing to have a book to help one in acquiring a language quite another to speak it freely and to be personally known to the people who speak it  11th sunday after trinityoff anudha island 4 pm  thermometer 88° in the empty cabin everyone being on deck  well dear old joan and fan refreshed bywhat do you think  o feast of guildhall and bristol mayors  who would dream of turtle soup on board the southern cross in these unknown seas  tell it not to missionary societies  let no platform orator divulge the great secret of the luxurious selfindulgent life of the missionary bishop  what nuts for the pall mall gazette  how would all subscriptions cease and denunciations be launched upon my devoted head because good mr tilly bought at san cristoval for the price of one tenpenny hatchet a little turtle a veritable turtle with green fat and all the rest of it upon which we have made today a most regal feast indeed  but seriously  there has been much to make me hopeful and something to disappoint me since i last wrote  the two days at santa cruz were hopefulmr atkin says that the natives came on board with readiness and stole with equal readiness but this was all in a friendly wayand a small island named piteni was visited and judged likely to prove a means of reaching the larger isle  the disappointment is not here mentioned unless it was the missing some of the ysabel scholars and bringing away only three but this mattered the less as the banks island party which as forming a nucleus was far more important was now considerable  sixtytwo scholars were the present freight including nine little girls between eight and twelve mostly betrothed to old pupils  at malanta a new village called saa was visited  the harbour was a wall of coral with the surf breaking upon it but a large canoe showed the only accessible place and this was exposed to the whole swell of the pacific  the natives writes mr atkin held the boat in water up to their knees but the seas that broke thirty yards outside washed over their shoulders and sometimes their heads  we might have taken away half the people of the village and had no trouble in getting two nice looking little boys  about 320 miles from norfolk island one of these little boys wate playing fell overboard we were going ten knots at the time right before the wind it was a quarter of an hour before we picked him up as it took five minutes to stop the vessel and ten to get to him  wate seemed all the better for his ducking this little wate became mr atkins especial child his godson and devoted follower  on october 2 norfolk island was reached and there a wooden house having been conveyed thither by hms falcon mr palmer and fifteen scholars were placed to spend the winter  the pitcairners welcomed the mission but were displeased at the government assuming a right to dispose of the land which they had fancied entirely their own  one of the letters written separate from the journal during this voyage gives a commission for photographs from the best devotional prints for the benefit chiefly of his young colonial staffi have not the heart to send for my lionardo da vinci he says that much valued engraving purchased at florence and he wishes for no modern ones save ary scheffers christis consolator mentioning a few of his special favourites to be procured if possible  for the melanesians pictures of ships fishes and if possible tropical vegetation was all the art yet needed and beads red and blue but dull ones none not exactly like the samples would be of any use it is no good sending out any fancy articles such as you would give english children  toys for savages are all the fancies of those who manufacture such toys for sale  of course any manufacturer who wishes to give presents of knives tools hatchets c would do a great benefit but then the knives must be really strong and sharp  i have concluded the letters of the island voyage before giving those written on the homeward transit from norfolk island whither the falcon had conveyed the letters telling of the departure of both mr and mrs keble  the first written under this impulse was of course to sir john coleridge the oldest friend   at sea near norfolk island october 3 1866  my dear dear unclehow can i thank you enough for telling me so much of dear saintly mr keble and his wife  he has been for my dear father and mothers sakes very loving to me and actually wrote me two short letters one after his seizure which i treasure  how i had grown to reverence and love him more and more you can easily believe and yesterday at norfolk island whither some letters had been sent i read with a very full heart of the peaceful close of such a holy life  and i do love to think too of you and him if i may speak freely of such as you and the weight attached to all you say and do you two i mean in your several occupations seems at all events one hopeful sign among not a few gloomy ones  i suppose you and mr keble little estimated the influence which even a casual word or sentence of yours exercises upon a man of my age predisposed it is true to hearken with attention and reverence  is it possible that fifty years hence any similar event should there be such which should so stir the heart of the country as you say about mr kebles death might stimulate people to raise large sums for the endowment of a church about to be or already separated from the state  i cant avoid feeling as if god may be permitting the extension of the colonial churches partly and in a secondary sense that so the ground may be travelled over on a small scale before the church at home may be thrown in like manner upon its own resources  the alliance is a very precarious one surely and depends upon the solemn adherence to a fiction  it is extraordinary that some colonial bishops should seek to reproduce the state of things which is of course peculiar to england the produce of certain historical events and which can have no resemblance whatever to the circumstances of our colonies  the mail closes just after our arrival and i am very busy at first coming on shore with such a party  goodbye for the present my dear dear uncle  your loving and grateful nephew j c p   to me the condolence was   october 6 1866  and so my dear cousin the blow has fallen upon you and dear mr and mrs keble have passed away to their eternal rest  i found letters at norfolk island on october 2 not my april letters which will tell me most about him but my may budget  how very touching the account is which my uncle john sends me of dear mrs keble so thankful that he was taken first so desirous to go yet so content to stay  and how merciful it has all been  such a calm holy close to the saintly life  may god bless and support all you who feel the bereavement  even i feel that i would fain look for one more letter from him but we have his christian year and other books  is it not wonderful that all the wisdom and love and beauty of the christian year to say nothing of the exquisite and matured poetry should have been given to him so early in life  why as i gather the book was finished in the year 1825 though not published till 1827  he wrote it when he was only 33 years old and for 45 years he lived after he was capable of such a work  surely such a union of extreme learning wisdom and scholarship with humility and purity of heart and life has very seldom been found  everyone wishes to say something to everyone else of one so dear to all and no one can say what each and all feel  we ought indeed to be thankful who not only have in common with all men his books but the memory of what he was personally to us  the change must needs be a great one to you  i do feel much for you indeed  but you will bear it bravely and many duties and the will and power to discharge them occupy the mind and the elasticity comes back again after a time  i know nothing of the keble family not even how they were related to him so that my interest in hursley is connected with him only  yet it will always be a hallowed spot in the memory of english churchmen  you will hear the various rumours as to who is to write his life c  let me know what is worth knowing about it  kohimarama  anchored on october 8 after an absence of exactly six weeks all well on board and ashore  thanks be to god for so many mercies  the mail is gone and alas all my letters and newspapers were sent off a few days since in the brisk to norfolk island  we passed each other  they did not expect me back so soon so i have no late news and have no time to read newspapers  may god bless you my dear cousin  your affectionate cousin j c patteson   in spite of this deep veneration for mr keble and for his teachings bishop patteson did not embrace to the full the doctrine which had been maintained in eucharistic adoration and which he rightly perceived to lie at the root of the whole ritualistic question  his conclusions had been formed upon the teachings of the elder anglican divines and his predilections for the externals of worship upon the most reverent and beautiful forms to which he had been accustomed before he left home  after an all saints communion the following letter was written   all saints day 1866  my dear cousinyou know why i write to you on this day  the communion of saints becomes ever a more and more real thing to us as holy and saintly servants of god pass beyond the veil as also we learn to know and love more and more our dear fellowlabourers and fellowpilgrims still among us in the flesh  such a day as this brings thanks be to god many calm peaceful memories with it  of how many we may both think humbly and thankfully whose trials and sorrows are over for ever whose earthly work is done who dwell now in paradise and see his face and calmly wait for the great consummation  to you the sense of personal loss must be nowit will always bemixed up with the true spirit of thankfulness and joy but remember that as they greatly helped you so you in no slight measure have received from god power to help others a trust which i verily believe you are faithfully discharging and that the brightness of the christian life must be not lost sight of in our dealings with others would we really seek to set forth the attractiveness of religion  i dont mean that i miss this element in any of your writings rather i am thankful to you because you teach so well how happiness and joy are the portion of the christian in the midst of so much that the world counts sorrow and loss  but i think that depression of mind rapidly communicates itself and you must be aware that you are through your books stamping your mind on many people  do you mind my saying all this to you only i would fain say anything that at such a time may if only for a minute help to keep the bright side before you  the spirit of patience did seem so to rest upon him and his dear saintly wife  the motto of the christian year seemed to be inwoven into his life and character  i suppose he so well knew the insignificance of what to us mortals in our own generation seems so great that he had learned to view eternal truths in the light of him who is eternal  he fought manfully for the true eternal issues and everything else fell into its subordinate place is not one continually struck with his keen sense of the proportion of things he wastes no time nor strength in the accidents of religion much that he liked and valued he never taught as essential or even mentioned lest it might interfere with essentials  oh that his calm wise judgment his spiritual discernment may be poured out on many earnest men who i cant help thinking lack that instinct which divinely guided the early church in the selection of fundamentals  we must all grieve to see earnest zealous men almost injuring the good cause and placing its best and wisest champions in an unnecessarily difficult position because they do not see what i suppose mr keble did see so very clearly  i know that these questions present themselves somewhat differently to those situated severally as you and we are  but it is i suppose by freely interchanging amongst ourselves thoughts that the general balance is best preserved  pray when you have time write freely to me on such matters if you think it may be of use to do so  the church everywhere ought to guard and teach and practise what is essential  in nonessentials i suppose the rule is clear  i will eat no meat c  and now goodbye my dear cousin and may god ever bless and comfort you  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   sir william and lady martin had just paid their last visit to kohimarama and here is the final record by lady martins hand of the pleasant days there spent  one more visit we paid to our dear friend in november 1866 a few months before he left kohimarama for norfolk island  he invited my dear husband specially for the purpose of working together at hebrew with the aid of the lights they thought our languages throw on its grammatical structure  the bishop was very happy and bright  he was in his new house a great improvement upon the stuffy quarters in the quad  his sitting room was large and lofty and had french windows which opened on a little verandah facing the sea  the mission party were most cooperative and would not let the bishop come into school during the three weeks of our stay so he had a working holiday which he thoroughly enjoyed  the weather was lovely the boys were all well and there was no drawback to the happiness of that time  at seven the chapel bell rang and we walked across with him to the pretty little chapel  the prayers and hymn were in mota the latter a translation by the bishop of the hymn now that the daylight fills the sky  the boys all responded heartily and were reverent in demeanour  after breakfast the two wise men worked steadily till nearly one  we were not allowed to dine in hall as the weather was very warm and we inveigled the bishop to stay out and be our host  a quaint little procession of demurelooking little maidens brought our dinner over  they were grave and full of responsibility till some word from bisop would light up their faces with shy smiles  what pleasant walks we had together before evening chapel under the wooded cliffs or through the green fields  mr pritt had by this time brought the mission farm into excellent working order by the aid of the elder lads alone  abundance of good milk and butter the latter getting ready sale in town and of vegetables  his gifts too in schoolkeeping were invaluable  i wish i could recall some of the conversations with our dear friend  a favourite topic was concerning the best modes of bringing the doctrines of the christian religion clearly and fully within the comprehension of the converts  some of their papers written after being taught by him showed that they did apprehend them in a thoughtful intelligent way  at halfpast six we had a short service again in mota in chapel and then we rarely saw our dear friend till nine  he would not neglect any of his night classes  at halfpast nine the english workers gathered together in the bishops room for prayers and for a little friendly chat  curiously enough the conversation i most distinctly remember was one with him as we rode up one saturday from kohimarama to st johns college  i got him to describe the game of tennis and he warmed up and told me of games he had played at  how that cheery talk came to mind as i drove down the same road last year just after fine weather had come  it was the same season and the hedges on each side of the narrow lane were fragrant as then with may and sweet briar     chapter xi  st barnabas college norfolk island  18671869    a new phase of coleridge pattesons life was beginning with the year 1867 when he was in full preparation for the last of his many changes of home namely that to norfolk island isolating him finally from those who had become almost as near kindred to him and devoting him even more exclusively to his one great work  no doubt the separation from ordinary society was a relief and the freedom from calls to irregular clerical duty at auckland was an immense gain but the lack of the close intercourse with the inner circle of his friends was often felt and was enhanced by the lack of postal communication with norfolk island so that instead of security of home tidings by every mail letters and parcels could only be transmitted by chance vessels touching at that inaccessible island where there was no harbour for even the southern cross to lie  but the welfare of the mission and the possible benefit to the pitcairners outweighed everything  it is with some difficulty that the subject of this latter people is approached  they have long been the romance of all interested in missionary effort and precious has been the belief that so innocent and pious a community existed on the face of the earth  and it is quite true that when they are viewed as the offspring of english mutineers and heathen tahitians trained by a repentant old sailor they are wonderful in many respects and their attractive manners and manifest piety are sure to strike their occasional visitors who have seldom stayed long enough to penetrate below the surface  but it has been their great disadvantage never to have had a much higher standard of religion morals civilisation or industry set before them than they had been able to evolve for themselves and it is a law of nature that what is not progressive must be retrograde the gentle tahitian nature has entirely mastered the english turbulence so that there is genuine absence of violence there is no dishonesty and drunkenness was then impossible there is also a general habit of religious observance but not including self restraint as a duty while the reaction of all the enthusiastic admiration expressed for this interesting people has gendered a self complacency that makes them the harder to deal with  parental authority seems to be entirely wanting among them the young people grow up unrestrained and the standard of morality and purity seems to be pretty much what it is in a neglected english parish but as before said without the drunkenness and lawlessness and with a universal custom of churchgoing and a great desire not to expose their fault to the eyes of strangers  the fertile soil to people of so few wants and with no trade prevents the necessity of exertion and the dolce far niente prevails universally  the government buildings have fallen into entire ruin and the breed of cattle has been allowed to become worthless for want of care  the dwellings are uncleanly and the people so undisciplined that only their native gentleness would make their present selfgovernment possible and it is a great problem how to deal with them  the english party who were to take up their abode on norfolk island consisted of the bishop the rev mr palmer who was there already mr atkin and mr brooke  the rev r codrington was on his way from england with mr bice a young student from st augustines canterbury but mr and mrs pritt had received an appointment at the waikato and left the mission  the next letter to myself tells something of the plans   january 29 1867  my dear cousini enclose a note to miss mackenzie thanking her for her book about mrs robertson  it does one good to read about such a couple  i almost feel as if i should like to write a line to the good man  there was the real genuine love for the people the secret of course of all missionary success the consideration for them the power of sympathy of seeing with the eyes of others and putting oneself into their position  many a time have i thought yes thats all right thats the true spirit thats the real thing  oh that men could be trained to act in that way  it seems as if mere common sense would enable societies and men to see that it must be so  and yet how sadly we mismanage men and misuse opportunities  men should be made to understand that they cannot receive training for this special mission work except on the spot at the institution the aim should be to give them a thorough grounding in greek and latin the elements of divinity leaving out all talk about experiences and all that can minister to spiritual pride and delude men into the idea that the desire as they suppose to be missionaries implies that they are one whit better than the baker and shoemaker next door  the german system is very different  the moravians dont handle their young candidates after this fashion  now mr robertson and his good wife refresh one by the reality and simplicity of their life the simplemindedness the absence of all cant and formalism  i mean the formal observance of a certain set of views about the sabbath about going to parties about reading books c the formal utterance of an accepted phraseology  would that there were hundreds such  would that his and her example might stir the hearts of many young people women as well as men well i like all that helps me to know him and her in the book and am much obliged to miss mackenzie for it  we have had a trying month unusually damp close weather and influenza has been prevalent  many boys had it one little fellow died  he was very delirious at last and as he lay day and night on my bed we had often to hold him  but one night he was calm and sensible and with henry tagalanas help i obtained from him such a simple answer or two to our questions that i felt justified in baptizing him  he was about ten years old i suppose one of our youngest  last saturday at 1245 am he passed away into what light and peace and knowledge and calm rest in his saviours bosom we humbly trust  god be praised for all his mercies  it was touching indeed to hear henry speaking to his little friend  he spoke so as to make me feel very hopeful about his work as a teacher being blessed his whole heart on his lips and in his voice and manner and expression of face  but my dear cousin often i think that i need more than ever your prayers that i may have the blessing for which we pray in our collect for the first sunday after epiphany grace to use the present opportunities aright  my time may be short we are very few in number now the young english and melanesian teachers ought to be completely trained that so by gods blessing the work may not come to nought  codringtons coming ought to be a great gain in this way a rightminded man of age and experience may well be regarded as invaluable indeed  i so often feel that i am distracted by multitudinous occupations and cant think and act out my method of dealing with the elder ones so as to use them aright  so many things distractsocial domestic industrial matters and general superintendence and my time is of course always given to anyone who wants it  the change to norfolk island too brings many anxious thoughts and cares and the state of the people there will be an additional cause of anxiety  i think that we shall move en masse in april or may making two or three trips in the schooner  palmer has sixteen now with him there  i shall perhaps leave ten more for the winter school and then go on to the islands and return dv in october not to new zealand but to norfolk island though as it is the year of the meeting of the general synod ie february 1868 i shall have to be in new zealand during that summer  you shall have full information of all my and our movements as soon as i know myself precisely the plan  and now goodbye my dear cousin and may god ever bless and keep you  i think much of you and of how you must miss dear mr keble  your affectionate cousin  j c p   sunday february 10 1867  my dear old fanno time to write at length  we are pretty well but coughs and colds abound and i am a little anxious about one nice lad lelenga but he is not very seriously ill  i have of course occasional difficulties as who has not irregularities not dgr of very serious nature yet calling for reproof a certain proportion of the boys and a large proportion of the girls careless and of course like boys and girls such as you know of in devonshire not free from mischief  indeed it is a matter for great thankfulness that as far as we know no immorality has taken place with fifteen young girls in the school  we take of course all precautions rooms are carefully locked at night  still really evilminded young persons could doubtless get into mischief if they were determined to do so  only today i spoke severely not on this point but on account of some proof of want of real modesty and purity of feeling  but how can i be surprised at that  all schoolmasters work is anxious work  it is even more so than the ordinary clergymans work because you are parent and schoolmaster at once  you may suppose that as time approaches for codrington and bice to arrive and for our move to norfolk island i am somewhat anxious and have very much to do  indeed the norfolk island people do sadly want help  your affectionate brother  j c p  p syou may tell your boys at night school if you think it well that no melanesian i ever had here would be so ungentlemanly as to throw stones or make a row when a lady was present   st matthias day 1867  my dearest joan and fanthe beginning of the seventh year of my bishops life  how quickly the time has gone and a good deal seems to have taken place and yet though some experience has been gained but little sense have i of real improvement in my own self of pressing onwards and daily struggles against faults  but for some persons it is dangerous to talk of such things and i am such a person  it would tend to make me unreal and my words would be unreal and soon my thoughts and life would become unreal too  i am conscious of very very much that is very wrong and would astonish many of even those who know me best but i must use this consciousness and not talk about it any more  i am in harness again for english work  how can i refuse  i am writing now between two english services  indeed no adequate provision is made here for married clergymen with families £300 a year is starvation at present prices  men cant live on it and who can work vigorously with the thought ever present to him when i die what of my wife and family  what is to be done  i solve the difficulty in melanesian work by saying use melanesians  i tell people plainly i dont want white men  i sum it all up thus they cost about ten times as much as the melanesian literally and but a very small proportion do the work as well  i was amused at some things in your december letters  how things do unintentionally get exaggerated  i went up into the treehouse by a very good ladder of bamboos and supplejacks quite as easily as one goes up the rigging of a ship and my ten days at bauro were spent among a people whose language i know and where my life was as safe and everybody was as disposed to be friendly as if i had been in your house at weston  but of course it is all missionary hardships and trials  i dont mean that you talk in this way  our first instalment of scholars with messrs atkin and brooke will go off dv about march 21  then my house is taken down the boys who now live in it having been sent off and on the schooners return about april 15 another set of things books houses c  probably a third trip will be necessary and then about may 5 or 6 i hope to go it will be somewhat trying at the end  but i bargain for all this which of course constitutes my hardest and most trying business  the special mission work as most people would regard it is as nothing in comparison  goodbye and god bless you  your loving brother  j c p   on march 5 mr codrington safely arrived bringing with him mr bice the boon to the bishop was immense both in relief from care and in the companionship for which he had henceforth to depend entirely on his own staff  the machinery of the routine had been so well set in order by mr pritt that it could be continued without him and though there was no english woman to superintend the girls it was hoped that sarah sarawia had been prepared by mrs pritt to be an efficient matron   kohimarama march 23 1867  my dear cousinour last new zealand season for it may be our last draws near its close  on monday only two days hence the southern cross sails weather permitting with our first instalment  mr palmer has got his house up and they must stow themselves away in it three whites and fortyfive blacks the best way they can  the vessel takes besides 14000 feet of timber 6000 shingles for roofing and boxes of books c c without end  i hope she may be here again to take me and the remaining goods live and inanimate in about eighteen or twenty days  i cant tell whether i am more likely to spend my easter in new zealand or norfolk island  i see that in many ways the place is good for us  the first expense is heavy  i have spent about £1000 already sinking some of my private money in the fencing building c but very soon the cost of all the commissariat exclusive of the stores for the voyage and a little english food for the whites will be provided  palmer has abundance of sweet potatoes which have been planted in ground prepared by our lads since last october  the yam crop is coming on well fish are always abundant  i think that in twelve months time we ought to provide ourselves with almost everything in the island  the ship and the clergymens stipends and certain extras will always need subscriptions but we ought at once to feed ourselves and soon to export wool potatoes corn maize i mean c  i never forget about the idea of a chapel  at present the norfolk island chapel will be only a wing of my house which will consist of two rooms for myself a spare room for a sick lad or two and a large dormitory which if need be can be turned into a hospital and the other end a wing in the chapel 42 x 18 feet quite large enough for eighty or more people  the entrance from without and again a private door from my sitting room  all is very simple in the plan it seem almost selfish having it thus as a part of my dwelling house but it will be such a comfort so convenient for confirmation and baptism and holy communion classes and so nice for me  some ladies in melbourne give a velvet altar cloth lady s in sydney gives all the white linen our communion plate you know is very handsome some day joan must send me a solid block of devonshire serpentine for my font such a one as there is at alfington or butterfield might now devise even a better  but i think though i have not thought enough yet that in the diocese of norfolk island and in the islands the running stream of living water and the catechumens going down into it is the right mode of administering the holy sacrament  the lectern and the small prayerdesk are of sandalwood from erromango  it will be far more like a church than anything the pitcairners have ever seen  perhaps next christmasbut much may take place before theni may ordain palmer priest atkin and brooke deacons and there may be a goodly attendance of melanesian communicants and candidates for baptism  if so what a day of hope to look forward to  and then i think i see the day of dear george sarawias ordination drawing nigh if god grant him health and perseverance  he is indeed and so are others younger than he all that i could desire  so my dear cousin see what blessings i have how small our trials are  they may yet come but it is now just twelve years exactly twelve years on monday since i saw my fathers and sisters faces and how little have those years been marked with sorrows  my lot is cast in a good land indeed  i read and hear of others such as that noble central african band and i wonder how men can go through it all  it comes to me as from a distance not as to one who has experienced such things  we know nothing of war or famine or deadly fever and we seem now to have a settled plan of work one of the greatest comforts of all but while i write thus brightly i dont forget that a little thing humanly speaking may cause great reverses delays and failures  i am very glad you understand my unwillingness to write and still more to print over much about our proceedings  i do speak pretty freely in new zealand and australia from whence i profess and mean to draw our supplies  accurate information is all very well but to convey an idea of our life and work is quite beyond my powers  still everything that helps the ordinary men and women of england to look out into the world a bit and see that the gospel is a power of god is good  and now goodbye my dear cousin  may god bless and keep you  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   on lady day the bishop wrote to his sisters  this day twelve years ago i saw your faces for the last time and so i told mary atkin my good young friends only sister as we stood on the beach just now watching the southern cross carrying away her only brother and some forty other people to norfolk island  the first detachment is therefore gone i hope that we the rest will follow in about sixteen or eighteen days  i think back over these twelve years  on the whole how smoothly and easily they have passed with me  less of sorrow and anxiety than was crowded into one short year of bishop mackenzies life  i have been reading mr rowleys book on the university mission to central africa and am glad to have read it  they were indeed fine gallant fellows full of faith and courage and endurance  as i write some dozen boys are on the roof knocking away the shingles ie the wooden tiles of roofing a carpenter is taking down all that needs some more skilled handiwork  in a week the house will all be tied up in bundles of boarding battens about 14000 or 15000 feet of timber in all  yesterday i was with the primate i went up indeed on monday afternoon as the southern cross sailed with thirtyone melanesians at 11 am and i could get away  it was rather a sad day  i was resigning trusts and it made the departure from new zealand appear very real  april 1stmy fortieth birthday  it brings solemn thoughts  last night i had to take the service at st pauls and as i came back i thought of many things and principally of how very different i ought to be from what i am  all are well here at kohimarama  my house knocked down and arrangements going on the place leased to mr atkin joe atkins father my trusts resigned accounts almost made up many letters written business matters arranged   in a few days more the last remnant of st andrews was broken up and the first letter to the bishop of new zealand was written from norfolk island before the close of the month   st barnabas mission school april 29 1867  my dear primatewe had a fair wind all the way and having shortened sail during all friday so as not to reach norfolk island in the night made the lead at 5 am on saturday morning  but a sad casualty occurred we lost a poor fellow overboard one of the seamen  he ought not to have been lost and i blame myself  he was under the davits of the boat doing something and the rope by which he was holding parted the lifebuoy almost knocked him as he passed the quarter of the vessel and i instead of jumping overboard and shouting to the melanesians to do the same rushed to the falls  the boat was on the spot where his cap was floating within two and a half minutes of the time he fell into the sea but he was gone  fisher in the hurry tore his nail by letting the falls run through his hand too fast  i was binding it up the boat making for the poor fellow faster than any swimmer could have done  how it was that he did not lay hold of the buoy or sank so soon i cant say the great mistake was not jumping overboard at once  this is a gloomy beginning and made us all feel very sad  he was not married and was a wellbehaved man  it was blowing fresh on saturday but we anchored under nepean island and by hard work cleared the vessel by 5 pm all worked hard and all the things were landed safely  palmer with the cart and boys was on the pier and the things were carted and carried into the store as they arrived  i came on shore about 5 found all well and hearty the people very friendly nothing in their manner to indicate any change of feeling  i walked up to our place  it is indeed a beautiful spot  palmer has worked with a will  i was surprised to see what was done  some three and a half acres of fine kumaras maize yams growing well a yam of ten pounds weight smooth and altogether melanesian just taken up not quite ripe so the boys say they will grow much bigger abundant supply of water though the summer has been dry  much of the timber has been carted up more has been stacked at the top of the hill  this was carried by the boys and will be carted along the pine avenue a good deal is still near the pines but properly stacked  i see nothing anywhere thrown about even here not a chip to be seen all buried or burnt and the place quite neat though unfinished  1  house on the plan of my old house just taken down by gray but much larger  2  kitchen of good size  3  two raupo outhouses  4  cowshed  i find it quite assumed here that the question is settled about our property here but i have not thought it desirable to talk expressly about it  they talk about school doctor and other public arrangements as usual  it seems that it was on st barnabas day that after holy communion we walked up here last year and chose the site of the house  the people have of their own accord taken to call the place st barnabas and as this suits the eton feeling also and you and others never liked st andrews dont you think we may adopt the new name  miss yonge wont mind i am sure  i could not resist telling the people that you and mrs selwyn might come for a short time in september next to see them and they are really delighted and so shall we be i can tell you indeed  your affectionate  j c patteson   the time for the island voyage was fully come and after a very brief stay in the new abode the bishop sailed again for mota where the old house was found may 8 in a very dilapidated condition and vigorous mending with branches was needed before a corner could be patched up for him to sleep on his table during a pouring wet night having first supped on a cup of tea and a hot yam the latter brought from the clubhouse by one of his faithful adherents after which an hour and a halfs reading of lightfoot on the epistle to the galatians made him forget every discomfort  there had however been a renewal of fighting of late and at a village called tasmate a man named natungoe had ten days previously been shot in the breast with a poisoned arrow and was beginning to show those first deadly symptoms of tetanus  he had been a well conducted fellow though he had hitherto shown indifference to the new teaching and it had not been in a private quarrel that he was wounded but in a sudden attack on his village by some enemies when a feast was going on  on that first evening when the bishop went to see him it was plain that far more of the recent instruction had taken root in him than had been supposed  he showed himself thoroughly ready to listen and manifested a good deal of simple faith  he said he had no resentment against the person who had shot him and that he did wish to know and think about the world to come  he accepted at once the story of gods love shown in sending jesus to die for us and he seemed to have some apprehension of what god must be and of what we arehow unlike him how unable to make ourselves fit to be with him he certainly spoke of jesus as of a living person close by him willing and able to help him  he of his own accord made a little prayer to him help me wake me make my heart light take away the darkness  i wish for you i want to go to you i dont want to think about this world  early the next morning the bishop went again taking george sarawia with him  the man said i have been thinking of what you said  i have been calling on the saviour i vaesu all night  the bishop spoke long to him and left sarawia with him speaking and praying quietly and earnestly  meanwhile continues the diary  i went to the men in the village and spoke at length to them yes god will not cast out those who turn to him when they are called but you must not suppose that it is told us anywhere that he will save those who care nothing about him through their years of health and only think about him and the world to come when this world is already passing away  how utterly unable one feels to say or do the right thing and the words fall so flat and dull upon careless ears  every day for ten days the poor sufferer natungoe was visited and he listened with evident faith and comprehension  on may 15 the entry is  i was so satisfied with his expressions of faith in the saviour of his hope of living with him he spoke so clearly of his belief in jesus having been sent from the great creator and father of all to lead us back to him and to cleanse us from sin which had kept us from our father by his death for us he was so evidently convinced of the truth of our lords resurrection and of the resurrection of us all at the last daythat i felt that i ought to baptize him  i had already spoken to him of baptism and he seemed to understand that first he must believe that the water is the sign of an inward cleansing and that it has no magical efficacy but that all depended on his having faith in the promise and power of god and second that jesus had commanded those who wished to believe and love him to be baptized  the expression nan ive maroo i vaesu i wish for the saviour had been frequently used by him and i baptized him by the name of maroovaesu a name instantly substituted for his old name natungoe by those present  i have seen him again today he cannot recover and at times the tetanus spasms are severe but it is nothing like dear fishers case he can still eat and speak women sit around holding him and a few people sit or lie about in the hut  it looks all misery and degradation of the lowest kind but there is a blessed change as i trust for him  on sunday the 19th the last agony had come  he lay on a mat on the ground in the middle of the village terribly racked by convulsions but still able in the intervals to speak intelligibly and to express his full hope that he was going to his saviour and that his pain would soon be over and he would be at rest with him listening earnestly to the bishops prayers  he died that night  in the meantime the bishop had not neglected the attacking party of them one had been killed outright and two more were recovering from their wounds and it was necessary to act as pacificator  meanwhile i think how very little religion has to do directly with keeping things quiet in england for example men would avenge themselves and steal and kill were it not for the law which is indeed an indirect result of religion but religion simply does not produce the effect ie men are not generally religious in england or mota  i have maines book of ancient law among the halfdozen books i have brought on shore and it is extremely interesting to read here  how he read wrote or did anything is the marvel with the hut constantly crowded by men who had nothing to do but gather round in suffocating numbers to stare at his pen travelling over the paper they have done so a hundred times before he writes actually under the oppression but anything to pass an hour lazily  it is useless to talk about it and one must humour them or they will think i am vexed with them  the scholars neatly clothed with orderly and industrious habits were no small contrast but i miss as yet the link between them and the resident heathen people  i trust and pray that george and others may ere long supply it  but it is very difficult to know how to help them to change their mode of life  very much even if they did accept christianity must go on as before  their daily occupations include work in the small gardens cooking c and this need not be changed  then as to clothing  i must be very careful lest they should think that wearing clothes is christianity  yet certain domestic changes are necessary for a christian life seems to need certain material arrangements for decency and propriety  there ought to be partition screens in the hut for example and some clothing is desirable no doubt  a resident missionary now could do a good deal towards showing the people why certain customs c are incompatible with a christian life  his daily teaching would show how christ acted and taught and how inconsistent such and such practices must be with the profession of faith in him  but regulations imposed from without i rather dread they produce so often an unreasoning obedience for a little while only  the rules for the new life should be very few and very simple and carefully explained  love to god and man explained and illustrated as the consequence of some elementary knowledge of gods love to us shown of course prominently in the giving his own son to us  there is no lack of power to understand simple teaching a fair proportion of adults take it in very fairly  i was rather surprised on friday evening some sixty or seventy being present to find that a few men answered really rather well questions which brought out the meaning of some of our saviours names  the saviour  the saving his people  not all men  and why not all men  and from what poverty sickness c here below  from their sins  what is sin  all that god has forbidden  what has he forbidden  why  because he grudges us anything  why do you forbid a child to taste vangarpal poison c  c  the way the mediator the redeemer the resurrection the atoner the word  some eight days teaching had preceded this but i dare say there are ten or fifteen people here now not our scholars who can really answer on these points so as to make it clear that they understand something about the teaching involved in these names  of course i had carefully worked out the best way to accept these names and ideas in mota and the illustrations c from their customs made me think that to some extent they understood this teaching  of course the personal feeling is as pleasant as can be and i think there is something more a real belief that our religion and our habits are good and that some day they will be accepted here  a considerable number of people are leading very respectable lives on the whole  but i see that we must try to spend more time here george sarawia is being accepted to some extent as one whom they are to regard as a teacher  he has a fair amount of influence  but in this little spot among about 1500 people local jealousies and old animosities are so rife that the stranger unconnected with any one of them has so far a better chance of being accepted by all but then comes on the other hand his perfect knowledge and our comparative ignorance of the language and customs of the people  we want to combine both for a while till the native teacher and clergyman is fully established in his true position  it is a curious thing that the solomon islanders from the southeast part of that group should have dropped so much behind the banks islanders  i knew their language before i knew the language of mota they were so to say my favourites  but we cant as yet make any impression upon them  the loyalty islanders have been suffered to drop out and so it is that all our leading scholars all who set good examples and are made responsible for various duties are with the sole exception of soro from mai island new hebrides from the banks group  consequently their language is the lingua franca of the schoolnot that we made it so or wished it rather than any other to be so indeed bauro is easier and so are some others but so it is  it is an excellent thing for any melanesian soon acquires another melanesian language however different the vocabulary may be their ideas and thoughts and many of their customs are similar the mode of life is similar and their mode of expressing themselves similar  they think in the same way and therefore speak in the same way  their mode of life is natural ours is highly artificial  we are the creatures of a troublesome civilisation to an extent that one realises here  when i go ashore for five weeks though i could carry all my luggage yet it must comprise a coffeepot sugar biscuits a cork bed some tins of preserved meat candles books and my hut has a table and a stool and i have a cup saucer plate knife fork and spoon  my good friend george who i think is on the whole better dressed than i am and who has adopted several of our signs of civilisation finds the food cooking and many of the ways of the island natural and congenial and would find them so throughout the pacific  may 2lstthe morning and evening school here is very nice  i doubt if i am simple enough in my teaching  i think i teach too much at a time there is so much to be taught and i am so impatient i dont go slowly enough though i do travel over the same ground very often  some few certainly do take in a good deal  a very hot day after much rain  this morning we took down our old wooden hut that was put up here by us six years ago  parts of it are useless for in our absence the rain damaged it a good deal  i mean to take it across to arau henry tagalanas little island for there even in very wet weather there is little fear of ague the soil being light and sandy  it would be a great thing to escape from the rich soil and luxuriant vegetation in the wet months if any one of us spent a long time here  it was hot work but soon over  it only took about two and a half hours to take down and stack all the planks rafters c  two fellows worked well and some others looked on and helped now and then  i have had some pleasant occupation for an hour or so each day in clearing away the bush which in one year grows up surprisingly here many lemon citron and orange trees that we planted some years ago cocoanut trees also were almost some quite overgrown quite hidden and our place looked and was quite small and close but one or two hours for a few days spent in clearing have made a great difference  i have planted out about twentyfive lemon suckers and as many pineapples for our old ones were growing everywhere in thick clumps and i have to thin them out  yesterday was a great day we cut down two large trees round one of which i had carelessly planted orange lemon and cocoanut trees so that we did not know how to fell it so as to avoid crushing some fine young trees but the tree took the matter into its own hands for it was hollow in the centre and fell suddenly so that the fellows holding the rope could not guide it and it fell at right angles to the direction we had chosen but right between all the trees without seriously hurting one  it quite reminds me of old treecutting days at feniton only here i see no oaks nor elms nor beeches nor firs only breadfruit trees and almond trees and many fruitbearing treesoranges c and guavas and custardapplesgrowing up all being introduced by us and the two gigantic banyan trees north and south of my little place  it is so very pretty  i dont trouble myself much about cooking  my little canteen is capital and i can make myself all sorts of good things if i choose to take the trouble and some days i do so  i bake a little bread now and then and natter myself it is uncommonly good and one four pound tin of bloxlands preserved meat from queensland has already lasted me twelve days and there is about half of it remaining  he reckons each pound well soaked and cooked to be equal to three pounds and i think he is right  a very little of this with a bit of yam deliciously cooked and brought to me each day as a present by some one from their cooking ovens makes a capital dinner  then i have some rice and sugar for breakfast a biscuit and coffee and a bit of breadfruit perhaps and all the little delicacies are here salt pepper mustard even to a bottle of picklesso i am pretty well off i think  i find that the white ant or an insect like it is here  the plates of our old hut are quite rotten the outside still untouched all within like tinder  they call the insect vanoa it is not found in new zealand but it is a sad nuisance in australia  i do not read much here this time so much of every day is taken up with talking to the people about me  that is all right and i generally can turn the talk to something that i wish them to hear so it is all in the way of business here  and i am glad to say that my school and conversations and lessons need some careful preparation i have spent some time in drawing up for myself a little scheme of teaching for people in the state of my friends here  i ought of course to have done it long ago and it is a poor thing now  i cannot take a real pleasure in teaching and so i do it badly  i am always almost always glad when school is over though sometimes i get much interested myself though not often able to interest others  i am reading some hebrew nearly every day and lightfoot on the galatians tylers researches into the early history of mankind dollingers first ages of the church and ecce homo  i tried maines ancient law but it is too tough for the tropics unless i chance to feel very fresh  i generally get an hour in the evening if i am sleeping at home  may 23rdi suppose anyone who has lived in a dirty irish village pigs fowls and children equally noisy and filthy and the parents wild ignorant and impulsivemay have some notion of this kind of thing  you never get a true account much less a true illustration of the real thing  did you happen to see a ridiculous engraving on one of the s p gr sheets some years ago supposed to be me taking two ambrym boys to the boat  footnote no such engraving can be found by the s p gr  it was probably put forth in some other publication  now it is much better not to draw at all than to draw something which can only mislead people  if ambrym boys really looked like those two little fellows and if the boat with bland looking white men could quietly be pulled to the beach and if i in a respectable dress could go to and from the boat and the shore why the third stage of mission work has been reached already  i dont suppose you can picture to yourselves the real state of things in this and in many of these islands and therefore the great difficulty there is in getting them out of their present social or unsocial state  to follow christian teaching out in detail to carry it out from the school into the hut into the actual daily life of the dirty naked women and still dirtier though not more naked children to get the men really to abandon old ways from a sense of responsibility and duty and love to god this of course comes very slowly  i am writing very lazily being indeed tired with heat and mosquitos  the sun is very hot again today  i have no thermometer here but it feels as if it ought to be 90° in the shade  may 25thgeorge sarawia spent yesterday here and has just gone to his village  he and i had a good deal of conversation  i copied out for him the plan of teaching drawn up from books already printed in their language  he speaks encouragingly and is certainly recognised as one who is intended to be the teacher here  no one is surprised that he should be treated by me in a very different way from anyone else with a complete confidence and a mutual understanding of each other  he is a thoroughly good simpleminded fellow and i hope by gods blessing he may do much good  he told me that b wants to come with me again but i cannot take him  as we have been living properly and for the sake of the head school and our character in the eyes of the people here i cannot take him until he shows proof of a real desire to do his duty  i am very sorry for it  i have all the old feeling about him and he is so quick and intelligent but he allows himself again and again to be overcome by temptation hard i dare say to withstand but this conduct does disqualify him for being chosen to go with us  i am leaving behind some good but dull boys for i cant make room as yet for them and i must not take an ill conducted fellow because he is quick and clever  he has some sort of influence in the place from his quickness and from his having acquired a good deal of riches while with us  he says nothing according to sarawia for or against our teaching  meanwhile he lives much like a somewhat civilised native  poor fellow  i sent a message to him by george that if he wished to see me i should be very willing to have a talk with him  yesterday we made some sago  a tree is cut down in its proper stage of growth just when it begins to flower  the pith is pulled and torn into shreds and fibres then the juice is squeezed out so as to allow it to run or drip into some vessel while water is poured on the pith by some one assisting the performer  the grounds as say of coffee remain at the bottom when the water is poured off and an hour of such a sun as we had yesterday dries and hardens the sago it is then fit for use  i suppose that it took an hour and a half to prepare about a slopbasin full of the dried hard sago  i have not used it vet  we brought tapioca here some years ago and they used it in the same way and they had abundance of arrowroot  on monday i will make some if all is well  any fellow is willing to help for a few beads or fishhooks and they do all the heavy work the fetching water c  i never saw anything like the pigeons in the great banyan tree close by  they eat its berries and i really think there are at times more than a hundred at once in it  had i a gun here i think i might have brought down three or four at a shot yesterday sitting shot of course but then i should shoot for the pot  palmer had his gun here last year and shot as many as he wanted at any time  the bats at night are innumerable they too eat the banyan berries but chiefly the ripening breadfruit  the cats we brought here have nearly cleared the place of the small rats which used to abound here but lizards abound in this hut because it is not continually smoke dried  last night i think some of the people here heard some rather new notions to them about the true relation of man and woman parent and child c  they said as they do often say every word is true how foolish we are  but how to get any of them to start on a new course is the question  ascension day may 30ththere is a good deal of discussion going on now among the people  i hear of it not only from our old scholars but from some of the men  i have been speaking day by day more earnestly to the people always reading here and there verses of the gospels or the acts or paraphrasing some passage so that they may have the actual words in which the message is recorded  they say this is a heavy a weighty word and they are talking as they say night after night about it  some few and they elderly men say let us talk only about our customs here  others say no no let us try to think out the meaning of what he said  a few come and ask me questions only a few not many are in earnest and all are shy  many every night meet in robert pantatuns house twentyfive or thirty and ask him all manner of questions and he reads a little  they end with prayer  they have many strange customs and superstitious observances peculiar to this group  they have curious clubs confraternities with secret rites of initiation  the candidate for admission pays pigs and native money and after many days seclusion in a secret place is with great ceremony recognised as a member  no woman and none of the uninitiated may know anything of these things  in every village there is a sala goro a place for cooking which only those who have gazed at the sacred symbol may frequent  food cooked there may not be eaten by one uninitiated or by women or children  the path to the sala goro is never trodden by any woman or matanomorous eye closed  when any ceremony is going on the whole of the precincts of the sala goro are sacred  at no time dare any woman eat with any man no husband with his wife no father with his daughter as soon as she is no longer a child  of course such a system can be used by us in two ways  i say you have your method of assembling together and you observe certain customs in so doing so do we but yours is an exclusive and selfish system your secret societies are like our clubs with their entrance fees c  but christs society has its sacred rite of admission and other mysteries too and it is for all who wish to belong to it  he recognises no distinction of male or female bond or free  some of the elder men are becoming suspicious of me  i tell them plainly that whatever there may be in their customs incompatible with the great law of love to god and man must come to nought  you beat and terrify matanomorous in order to make them give that you may get pigs and native money from them  such conduct is all wrong for if you beat or frighten a youth or man you certainly cant love him  at the same time i cant tell how far this goes  if there were a real ceremony of an idol or prayer to it of course it would be comparatively easy to act in the matter but the ceremony consists in sticking a curious sort of mitre pointed and worked with hair on the head of the candidate and covering his body with a sort of jack inthe green wicker work of leaves c and they joke and laugh about it and attach apparently no religious significance to it whatever  i think it has the evil which attends all secret societies that it tends to produce invidious distinctions and castes  an instinct impels men to form themselves into associations but then christ has satisfied that instinct legitimately in the church  christianity does meet a human instinct as eg the lords supper whatever higher and deeper feelings it may have has this simple but most significant meaning to the primitive convert of feasting as a child with his brethren and sisters at the fathers board  the significance of this to people living as more than half the human beings in the world are living still is such as we have lost the power of conceiving the lords supper has so long had so to say other meanings for many of us  yet to be admitted a member of gods family and then solemnly at stated times to use this privilege of membership strengthening the tie and familiarising oneself more and more with the customs of that heavenly family this surely is a very great deal of what human instinct as exhibited in almost universal customs requires  there are depths for those who can dive into them but i really think that in some of these theological questions we view the matter solely from our state of civilisation and thought and forget the multitudes of uneducated rude unrefined people to whom all below the simple meaning is unmeaning  may i not say to robert pantatun christ you know gave his body and blood for us on the cross he gives them to you now for all purposes of saving you and strengthening your spiritual life while you eat and drink as an adopted child at your fathers table  it is the keeping alive the consciousness of the relation of all children to god through christ that is needed so much  and with these actual sights before me and you have them among you in the hundreds of thousands of poor ignorant creatures i almost wonder that men should spend so much time in refining upon points which never can have a practical meaning for any persons not trained to habits of accurate thought and unusual devotion  but here i am very likely wrong and committing the very fault of generalizing from my own particular position  june 4thi was greatly pleased on friday evening last which george sarawia spent here with me to hear from him that he had been talking with the banks islanders at norfolk island and on board ship about a plan which he now proposed to me  i had indeed thought of it but scarcely saw my way  it is a new proof of his real earnestness and of his seeking the good of his people here  the plan is this  g s  bishop we have been talking together about your buying some land here near your present place where we all can live together where we can let the people see what our mode of life is what our customs are which we have learnt from you  j c p  capital george but are you all willing to give up your living in villages among your own particular relations   g s  yes we all agreed about it  you see sir if we live scattered about we are not strong enough to hold our ground and some of the younger ones fall back into their old ways  the temptations are great and what can be expected of one or two boys among eighty or ninety heathen people  j c p  of course you know what i think about it  it is the very thing i have always longed for  i did have a general school here as you know  g s  yes but things are different now  people are making enquiries  many young fellows want to understand our teaching and follow it  if we have a good large place of our own there we can carry on our own mode of living without interfering with other people  j g p  yes and so we can actually in the midst of them let them see a christian village where none of the strange practices which are inconsistent with christianity will be allowed and where the comforts and advantages of our customs may be actually seen  g s  byandby it will be a large village and many will wish to live there and not from many parts of mota only  well i have told you i suppose of the fertility of this island and how it is far more than sufficient to supply the wants of the people  food is wasted on all sides  this very day i have plucked ten large breadfruits and might have plucked forty now nearly ripe simply that the bats may not get them  i gave them away as i cant eat more than a third part of one at a meal  so i went with george on saturday and we chose such a beautiful property between veverao and maligo i dare say about ten acres then i spoke to the people here explaining my wishes and motives today we have been over it with a large party that all might be done publicly and everybody might hear and know  the land belongs to sixteen different owners the cocoanut trees breadfruit almond and other fruittrees are bought separately  they all agree indeed as they have abundance of space of spare land just as good all about and they will get a good stock of hatchets pigs c from me for this land there is not much doubt about that  but it is pleasant to hear some of them say no no that is mine and my sons and he is your boy  you can have that for nothing  i shant take it it is safer to buy but it is pleasant to see the kind feeling  if it be gods will to prosper this undertaking we should begin next year with about fifteen of our own scholars and a goodly number of halfscholars viz those who are now our regular scholars here but have not been taken to new zealand  fencing clearing c could go on rapidly  many would help and small payments of beads and fishhooks can always secure a mans services  i should build the houses with the material of the island save only windows but adopt of course a different shape and style for them the idea would be to have everything native fashion but improved so as to be clearly suitable for the wants of people sufficiently civilised  all that a christian finds helpful and expedient we ought to have but to adopt english notions and habits would defeat my object  the people could not adopt them there would be no teaching for them  i want to be able to say well you see there is nothing to prevent you from having this and that and your doing this and that  we must have some simple rules about cleanliness working hours c but all that is already familiar to those who have been with us at kohimarama and norfolk island  above all i rejoice in the thought that the people understand that very soon this plan is to be worked by george sarawia  he is to be the so to say head of the christian village  i shall be a kind of visitor  palmer will of course be wanted at first but must avoid the fault of letting the people our own pupils as well as others become dependent upon us the paraguay mission produced docile goodnatured fags for the missionaries but the natives had learnt no selfrespect manliness nor positive strength of character  they fought well and showed pluck when the missionaries armed them but they seem to have had no power of perpetuating their newlylearnt customs without the continual guidance of the missionaries  it may be that such supervision is necessary but i do not think it is so and i should be sorry to think it is so  as usual the mota climate told on the health of the party there was general influenza and the bishop had a swelling under his left arm but on whitsunday the southern cross which had been to set down the solomon islanders returned and carried him off  vanua lava was touched at and a stone carved by john adams put up at fisher youngs grave which was found as before well kept in order  then the round of the new hebrides was made but new volunteers were refused or told to wait ten moons as it was an object to spend the first season in the new locality with tried scholars  at the grand island miscalled lepers the bishop slept ashore for the first time and so also at whitsuntide  at espiritu santo much friendliness was shown and a man would not take a present mr atkin offered because he had nothing to pay for it  santa cruz as usual was disappointing as mr atkin says the only word in their mouths the only thought in their heads was iron they clamoured for this and would not listen moreover their own pronunciation of their language was very indistinct owing to their teeth being destroyed by the use of the betelnut so that they all spoke like a man with a hot potato in his mouth  so again we leave this fine island without any advance as far as we can see having been made  i may live to think these islanders very wild and their speech very difficult yet i know no more of them now than i did years ago  yet i hope that some unforeseen means for entering in among them may be given some day  their time is to come sooner or later when he knows it to be the right time  savo was then touched at and the bishop slept ashore at florida and left mr brooke there to the hospitality of three old scholars for a few days by way of making a beginning  the observations on the plan show a strange sense of ageing at only forty  he speaks the language fairly and his visit will i hope do good of course he will be tired and will enjoy the quiet of the schooner after it  i know what that is pretty well and it takes something to make one prefer the little vessel at sea to any kind of shore life however he has youth and cheery spirits at command and that makes life on an island  a man whose tastes naturally are for books c rather than for small talk and who cant take much interest in the very trifling matters that engage the attention of these poor fellows such a man finds it very tiring indeed sometimes when a merry bright goodnatured fellow would amuse himself and the natives too  in these introductory visits scarcely anything is done or said that resembles mission work as invented in stories and described by the very vivid imagination of sensational writers  the crowd is great the noise greater the heat the dirt the inquisitiveness the endless repetition of the same questions and remarks the continual requests for a fishhook for beads cthis is somewhat unlike the interesting pictures in a missionary magazine of an amiable individual very correctly got up in a white tie and black tailed coat and a group of very attentive decentlyclothed and nicely washed natives  they are wild with excitement not to hear the good news but to hear how the trading went on how many axes did they sell  how many bits of iron  you say why do you trade at all  answer in the first visits that we make we should at once alienate all the goodwill of the people from us unless we so far complied with their desire to get iron tools or to trade more or less with them  as soon as i can i give presents to three or four leading men and then let the buying curiosities be carried on by the crew and others but not to trade at all would be equivalent to giving up hope of establishing any intercourse with the people  but in new islands and upon our first visits if we do get a chance of saying something amid the uproar what can we say about religion that will be intelligible to men whose language has never been used to express any thought of ours that we long to communicate and whose minds are preoccupied by the visit of the vessel and the longing for our articles of trade  sometimes we do try to say a few words sometimes we do a little better we get a hearing some persons listen with some interest but usually if we can merely explain that we dont come to trade though we trade to please them that we wish to take lads and teach them we are obliged to be satisfied  teach them teach them what think the natives  why one old hatchet would outweigh in their minds all that boy or man can gain from any teaching  what appreciable value can reading writing wearing clothes c have in their eyes  so we must in first visits of which i am now thinking be thankful that we can in safety sleep on shore at all and regard the merely making friends with the people as a small beginning of mission work  poor fellows they think it very strange  as you lie down in the dark and try to sleep you presently feel hands stroking your arms and legs and feeling you about to make sure that the stranger has the same allowance of arms and legs that they have and you overhear such quaint remarks as you lie still afraid to let them know that you are awake lest they should oblige you to begin talking over again the same things that you have already said twenty times  mr brooke stayed four days at florida and came away with three former pupils and four new ones one of them grown up a relative of the leading man of the island  taroniara was the only bauro scholar brought away this time but so many were taken from mota that the whole party numbered thirtyseven seven of them girls all betrothed to one or other of the lads  the entire colony at st barnabas including english was thus raised to seventy when the southern cross returned thither in august  on the 23rd bishop patteson writes  i wish you could see this place and the view from this room  i have only got into it within this hour  the carpenters are just out of it  you know that i left palmer here about eleven months ago on the return from that island voyage  he had sixteen lads with him of whom eleven were good stout fellows  he did work wonderfully  the place i chose for the site of the station is about three miles from the settlementthe town as the people call it  if you have a map of the island you will see longridge on the western part of it  follow on the principal road which goes on beyond longridge in a n and nw direction and about a mile beyond longridge is our station  the top of mount pitt is nearly opposite our houses of which two are now habitable though not finished  the third which is the house at kohimarama which i had for one year and in which sir w and lady martin spent ten days will be begun on monday next i hope  the labour of getting all these things from new zealand and then landing them for there is no harbour and then carting them up here for there are no really good horses here but the two i bought and sent down was very considerable  palmer and his boys worked admirably  he was industrious indeed  he and they lived at first in a little cottage about threequarters of a mile from our place ie about a quarter of a mile from longridge  during the first month while they had no cart or horses as yet for i had to send them down from auckland they fenced in some lands the wire for which i had bought at sydney and a manofwar brought it hither planted yams which grow excellently such a crop never was seen here and sweet potatoes melons vegetables c  meanwhile the timber for the houses was being sent as i had opportunity a large quantity having been already taken to norfolk island in a manofwar  luckily timber was selling very cheap at auckland  after this first month palmer set to work at house building  he built entirely by himself save the chimney and some part of the shingling wooden roofing  as yet no rooms have any ceiling or lining they might by innocent people be thought to resemble barns but they are weatherproof strong and answer all present purposes the verandah about 8 feet broad is another great room really  i am still buying and sending down bricks timber c  two auckland carpenters thoroughly steady men left norfolk island about three weeks after we left it for the melanesian islands  they have been putting up my special building  we have no doors like hall doors as all the rooms open with glass doors on to the verandah and they are the doors for going in and out  comprenezvous  the ground slopes away from these two houses for some 200 yards or more to a little stream and this slope is all covered with sweet potatoes and vegetables and codrington and palmer have planted any number of trees bushes flowers c  everything grows and grows luxuriantly such soil such a climate  byandby i shall have i hope such myrtles and azaleas kalmias and crotons and pineapples and almond trees bananas and tree ferns and magnolias and camellias c all in the open air  the ground slopes up beyond the little stream a beautiful wooded bank wooded with many kinds of trees and bushes large norfolk island pines cattle and sheep stray about  oh how very pretty it is  and then beyond and above this first slope the eye travels along the slopes of the pitt to its summit about 1000 feet a pretty little hill  it is indeed a calm peaceful scene away from noise and bustle plenty of pleasant sounds of merry boys working in the gardens and employing themselves in divers ways  the prospect is d gr a very happy one  it is some pleasure to work here where the land gives her increase indeed  all seem very happy and well pleased with the place  i dont see how it can be otherwise and yet to the young people there may be something attractive in society  but the young ones must occasionally go to auckland or sydney or whithersoever they please for a two or three months holiday  for me what can i desire more than this place affords  more than half of each year spent here if i live and quietly with any amount of work uninterrupted work time for quiet reading and thought  this room of mine in which i now am sitting is magnifique my dear joan seriously a very good room you see it will be full of boys and girls and i must have in it many things not books only for the general use of all here so that i determined to make it a nice place at once  this room then nicely lined looking rather like a wooden box it is true but clean and airy is 22 feet x 14 feet 6 in and the wall plates 9 feet 6 in high the ceiling coved a little so as to be nearly 14 feet high in the centre  what do you think of that for a room  it has a fireplace and wide verandah which is nearly 6 feet above the ground so that i am high and dry and have all the better view too quite a grand flight of stepsa broad ladderup into my house  the mahaga lads and i call it my treehouse  then i have one great luxury  i thought i would have it and it is so nice  my room opens into the chapel by red baize swinging doors my private entrance for there is a regular porch where the rest go in  service at 7 am and 8 pm  but it is always open boys come in of a morning to say their private prayers for sleeping together in one room they have little privacy there  and i can go in at all hours soon it will become a sacred spot to us  it is really like a chapel  august 27thyour birthday my dear old fan  god bless you and grant you all true happiness and the sense of being led onwards to the eternal peace and joy above  the parting here is a long one and likely to be a parting for good as far as this world is concerned  last night was the coldest night that they have had during the whole winter the thermometer touched 43°codrington has regular registering thermometers so you see what a charming climate this is for us  palmer was here all the summer and he says that the heat though great as marked by thermometer was never trying relaxing and unfitting for work as at kohimarama  thus began the first period of the residence in norfolk island where mr codringtons account of the way of life shall supplement the above  when the bishop returned in august 1867 our party consisted of himself mr palmer in deacons orders and myself mr atkin and mr brooke already experienced in the work and mr bice who had with myself lately arrived from england  the whole number of melanesians was about sixty among the eldest of these the most intelligent and advanced of the few then baptized george henry b robert and edward  there were then i think thirteen baptized and two communicants  to this elder class the bishop as far as i can recollect devoted the greater part of his time  he said that now for the first time he was able without interruption to set to work to teach them and he certainly made great progress in those months  i remember that every evening they used to sit in chapel after prayers and consider what difficulty or question they should propound to him and he would come in after a time and after hearing the question discuss the subject discourse upon it and end with prayer  they were at the time i remember much impressed by this and those who were the most advanced took in a great deal of an elevated strain of doctrine which no doubt passed over the heads of the greater number but not without stirring up their hearts  it became a regular custom on the evening before the communion sunday ie every other sunday to give the communicants instruction and preparation after the chapel service  at this time there was no sunday sermon in chapel  the bishop used to say that the preaching was done in the school but much of his school was of a hortatory kind in the chapel and often without taking off the surplice  at this time i should add that he used from time to time to have other boys with him to school and particularly solomon islanders whose languages he alone could generally speak  he had also a good deal with him the second set of eight banks islanders who were by this time recognised catechumens  there were other occupations of the bishops time besides his school with melanesians  the hour from 12 to 1 was devoted to instruction given to the two young men one from new zealand and one a son of mr nobbs who were working with the mission and on alternate days to the younger members of the mission who were being prepared for ordination  the reading with the younger clergy continued to be to the last one of the most regular and most fruitful of the bishops engagements the education which mr atkin had for many years received from the bishop had set him considerably above the average of young english clergy not only in scholarship and information but also in habits of literary industry  the bishop with his own great interest in hebrew enjoyed very much his hebrew reading with mr atkin and mr bice  the bishop also began as soon as he could to pay attention to the teaching of the young norfolk islanders  he preached very often in their church and went down on wednesdays to take a class of candidates for confirmation  he said and i believe with truth that he wasted a great deal of time in preparing his lessons with the candidates for ordination or younger clergy that is he looked up the subject in some book and read on and on till he had gone far beyond the point in search of which he started and had no time left to take up the other points which belonged to the subject he had in view  i should say he was always a desultory scholar reading very much and to very great purpose but being led continually from one subject or one book to another long before coming to an end of the first  he was always so dissatisfied with what he did that whereas there are remaining several beginnings of one or two pages on one subject or another there is no paper of his which is more than a fragmentthat is in english  there is one series of notes on the catechism in mota complete  in those days i was not myself able to converse sufficiently in mota to learn much from the elder boys about the teaching they were receiving but it was evident that they were much impressed and stirred up they spent much time with their books by themselves and one could not fail to form a high estimate of the work that was going on  now they say they never had school like that before or since  the bishop was in fact luxuriating in the unbroken opportunity of pouring out instruction to intelligent and interested scholars  i think it was altogether a happy time to him he enjoyed the solitude the advantages of the move to the island were apparent in the school work and were anticipated in the farm and the hope of doing something for the pitcairn people which i believe had much to do with fixing the mission here was fresh  this judgment is thoroughly borne out by the bishops own letter to his sisters of october 27 wherein it appears how considerable an element of his enjoyment and comfort was mr codringtons own companionship partly as a link with the younger members of the little community  do i feel doubtful about an early communion service codrington when i broach the matter takes it up more eagerly almost than i do and then i leave him to talk with the others who could hardly differ from me on such a point if they wished to do so but will speak freely to him  not that mind i am aware of there being anything like a feeling of distance between me and them but necessarily they must just feel that i am forty and their bishop and so i might perhaps influence them too much which would be undesirable  then i can talk with him on matters which of course have special interest for me for somehow i find that i scarcely ever read or think on any points which do not concern directly my work as clergyman or languagemonger  it is very seldom that i touch a book which is not a commentary on the bible or a theological treatise scarcely ever and of course one likes to talk about those things of which ones mind is full  that made the talks with the judge so delightful  now young people of course have their heads full as i used to have mine of other things and so my talk would be dull and heavy to them  no doubt if you had me at home you would find that i am pretty full of thoughts on some points but not very well able to express myself and to put my thoughts into shape  it is partly want of habit because except as one speaks somewhat dictatorially to pupils i do not arrange my ideas by conversing with othersto a great extent from want of inclination ie indolence and also i have not the brains to think out a really difficult subject  i am amused occasionally to see what a false estimate others form of me in that way  you see it has pleased god to give me one faculty in rather an unusual degree that of learning languages but in every other respect my abilities are very moderate indeed  distance exaggerates of course and i get credit with some folks for what if i had it would simply be a gift and no virtue in me but i attain anything i work at with very considerable labour and my mind moves very sluggishly and i am often very dull and stupid  you may judge therefore of the great advantage of having a bright cheery intelligent wellinformed man among us without whom every meal would be heavy and silent and we should by my fault get into a mechanical grind  as for your own worthy brother i dont think i knew what rest meant till i got here  i work in one sense as hard as before ie from early morn till 10 pm with perhaps the intermission of a hour and a half for exercise besides the twenty minutes for each of the three meals and did my eyes allow it i could go on devouring books much later  but then i am not interrupted and distracted by the endless occupation of the new zealand life  oh how utterly distasteful to me were all those trustee meetings those english duties of all kinds and most of all those invasions of kohimarama by persons for whom i could get up no interest  i am not defending these idiosyncrasies as if they were all right but stating what i felt and what i feel  i am indeed very happy here i trust not less useful in my way  school of course flourishes  you would be surprised at the subjects that i and my first class work at  no lack of brains perhaps i can express it briefly by saying that i have felt for a year or more the need of giving them the gospel of st john  because they were ready thank god for those marvellous discourses and arguments in that blessed gospel following upon the record of miracles wrought or events that happened  of course the knowledge of the facts must come first but there was always in school with meeither they have it as a natural gift or my teaching takes naturally that linea tendency to go deeper than the mere apprehension of a fact a miracle wrought or a statement made  the moral meaning of the miracle the principle involved in the less important expression of it or particular manifestation of it these points always of late i am able to talk about as to intelligent and interested listeners  i have these last six weeks been translating st john it is nearly done  think fan of reading as i did last night to a class of fifteen melanesian christians the very words of st john vi for the first time in their ears  they had heard me paraphrase much of it at different times  i dont notice these things unless as now i chance to write about them  after 6 pm chapel i remain with some of the lads the first class of boys men and women every night and in addition the second class every other night not on the nights when i have had them from 7 to 8  i used to catechise them at first starting the subject myself  now i rejoice to say half goes very quickly in answering questions of which they bring me plenty  then at about 850 or 9 i leave them alone in the chapel which opens as you know into my sittingroom and there they stay till past 10 talking over points among themselves often two or three coming in to me bishop we cant quite make out this  what do they know and ask  well take such a subject as the second psalm and they will answer you if you ask them about prophecy and the prophetic state  test them as to the idea they form of a spiritual vision of something seen but not with the fleshly eye and they will say yes our minds have that power of seeing things  i speak of mota it is far off but as i speak of it i see my father and my mother and the whole place  my mind has travelled to it in an instant  i am there  yes i see  so david so moses so st peter on the housetop so st paul caught up into the third heaven so with his mind  but was it like one of our dreams  yes and noyes because they were hardly like wakingmen  no because it was a real true vision which god made them see  ask them about the object of prophecy and they will say in quaint expression it is true what is tantamount to thisit was not only a prediction of things to come but a chief means of keeping before the minds of the jews the knowledge of gods true character as the moral governor of their nation and gradually the knowledge was given of his being the lord and ruler of all men  the prophet was the teacher of the present generation as well as the utterer of truths that when fulfilled in after ages would teach future ages  i mention these fragmentary sentiments merely to show you how i can carry these fellows into a region where something more than memory must be exercised  the recurrence of the same principles upon which god deals with us is an illustration of what i mean eg the redemption out of egypt from the captivity and the redemption involve the same principle  so the principle of mediation runs through the bible the prophet priest king c  then go into the particular psalm ask the meaning of the words anointed prophet priest king how our lord discharged and discharges these offices  what was the decree  the anointed is his son  this day have i begotten thee the eternal generationthe birth from the grave  his continual intercession  take up psalm cx the priest the priest for ever not after the order of aaron  go into the aaronical priesthood sacrifices the idea of sacrifice the mosaic ritual its fulfilment the principle of obedience as a consequence of faith common to old and new testaments as indeed gods moral law is unchangeable but the object of faith clearly revealed in the new testament for the first time c c  christs mediatorial reign his annihilation of all opposition in the appointed time the practical lesson the wrath of the lamb  often you would find that pupils who can be taught these things seem and are very ignorant of much simpler things but they have no knowledge of books as you are aware and my object is to teach them pretty fully those matters which are really of the greatest importance while i may fill up the intervening spaces some day if i live  to spend such energy as they and i have upon the details of jewish history eg would be unwise  the great lessons must be taught as eg st paul in 1 cor x uses jewish history  october 15 i finished my last chapter of st johns gospel in the mota language we have also a good many of the collects and gospels translated and some printed  what is better than to follow the churchs selection of passages of scripture and then to teach them devotionally in connection with the collects  brooke works away hard at his singing class in the afternoon  we sing the venite magnificat nunc dimittis c in parts to single and double chants my old favourite jacobs for the venite also a fine chant of g elveys  they dont sing at all well but nevertheless though apt to get flat and without good voices there is a certain body of sound and i like it  brooke plays the harmonium nicely  the norfolk island people two or three only have been here at evening service and are extremely struck with the reverence of the melanesians  i work away with my confirmation class liking them personally but finding no indication of their having been taught to think in the least  it is a relief to get back to the melanesians  the visit of the bishop of new zealand which had been hoped for had been prevented by the invitation to attend the synod of the church held at lambeth in the autumn of 1867 and instead of himself welcoming his friends bishop patteson was picturing them to himself staying with his sisters at torquay and joining in the consecration services of the church of all saints at babbicombe where the altar stood fragrant with the sandal wood of the pacific isles  the letters sent off by an opportunity in november were to family and friends both in england  the one to his sister joanna narrates one of those incidents that touched the bishop most deeply  on friday last we had such a very very solemn service in our little chapel  walter hotaswol from matlavo island is dyinghe has long been dying i may sayof consumption  for two winters past he has remained with us rather than in his own island as he well knew that without good food and care he would sink at once  years ago he was baptized and after much time spent in preparation tuesday at 730 am was the day when we met in chapel  walter leant back in a chair  the whole service was in the mota language and i administered the holy communion to eleven of our melanesian scholars and last of all to him  three others i trust i may receive to holy communion sunday next  is not this a blessed thing  i think of it with thankfulness and fear  my old text comes into my mindyour heart shall fear and be enlarged  i think there is good hope that i may baptize soon seven or eight catechumens  the letter to bishop selwyn despatched by the same vessel on november 16 gives the first hint of that labour traffic which soon became the chief obstacle to the mission  after describing an interview with an american captain he continuesreports are rife of a semilegalised slavetrading between the south sea islands and new caledonia and the white settlers in fiji  i have made a little move in the matter  i wrote to a wesleyan missionary in fiji ovalau who sent me some books  i am told that government sanctions natives being brought upon agreement to work for pay c and passage home in two years  we know the impossibility of making contracts with new hebrides or solomon natives  it is a mere sham an evasion of some law passed i dare say without any dishonourable intention to procure colonial labour  if necessary i will go to fiji or anywhere to obtain information  but i saw a letter in a sydney paper which spoke strongly and properly of the necessity of the most stringent rules to prevent the white settlers from injuring the coloured men  so first loomed the cloud that was to become so fatal a darkening of the hopes of the mission all the more sad because it was caused by christian men or men who ought to have been christian  it will be seen however that bishop patteson did not indiscriminately set his face against all employment of natives  occupation and training in civilised customs were the very things he desired for them but the whole question lay in the manner of the thing  however to him as yet it was but a report and this advent and christmas of 1867 were a very happy time  a letter to me describes the crowning joy   norfolk island christmas day 1867  my dear cousinone line to you today of christmas feelings and blessings  indeed you are daily in my thoughts and prayers  you would have rejoiced could you have seen us last sunday or this morning at 7 am  our fourteen melanesian communicants so reverent and apparently earnest  on sunday i ordained mr palmer priest mr atkin and mr brooke deacons  the service was a solemn one in the norfolk island church the people joining heartily in the first ordination they had seen codringtons sermon excellent the singing good and thoroughly congregational and the whole body of confirmed persons remaining to receive the holy communion  our own little chapel is very well decorated codrington again the leader with fronds of treeferns arums and lilies emmanuel god amemina with us in large letters over the altar  and now 930pm they are practising christmas hymns in mota for our 11 am service  then we have a regular feast and make the day a really memorable one for them  the change from the old to the new state of things as far as our banks islanders are concerned is indeed most thankworthy  i feel that there is great probability of george sarawias ordination before long  this next year he will be left alone as far as we whites are concerned at mota and i shall be able to judge i hope of his fitness for carrying on the work there  if it be gods will to give him health of body and the will and power to serve him then he ought to be ordained  he is an excellent fellow thoughtful sensible and my right hand among the melanesians for years  his wife sara irotaviro a nice gentle creature with now a fine little boy some seven months old  she is not at all equal to george in intelligence and is more native in habits c  but i think that she will do her best  you know i have long felt that there is almost harm done by trying to make these islanders like english people  all that is needful for decency and propriety in the arrangement of houses in dress c we must get them to adopt but they are to be melanesian not english christians  we are so far removed from them in matters not at all necessarily connected with christianity that unless we can denationalise ourselves and eliminate all that belongs to us as english and not as christians we cannot be to them what a well instructed fellowcountryman may be  he is nearer to them  they understand him  he brings the teaching to them in a practical and intelligible form  i hope and pray that dear old george may be the first of such a band of fellowworkers  othershenry tagalana who is i suppose about eighteen fisher pantatun about twentyone edward wogale georges own brother about sixteen robert pantatun about eighteenare excellent all that i could wish and many younger ones are coming up  they stay with us voluntarily two or three years now without any going home and the little ones read and write surprisingly well they come to me very often and say  bishop i wish to stop here again this winter  they come for help of the best kind  they have their little printed private prayers but some are not content with this  marosgagalo came last week with a slip of paper  well maros what is it  he is a shy little fellow who has been crippled with rheumatism  please write me my prayer  and as my room opens into the chapel and they are told to use that at all times their sleepingrooms not allowing much privacy i know how they habitually come into it early at 5 am and late at night for their private prayers  you cannot go into the chapel between 5 and 630 am  without seeing two or three kneeling about in different corners  as for their intelligence i ought to find time to send you a full account of them translations of their answers papers c but you must be content to know that i am sure they can reason well upon facts and statements that they are the first class quite able to understand all the simpler theological teaching which you would expect communicants and i pray future clergymen to understand  of some six or seven i can thus speak with great confidence but i think that the little fellows may be better educated still for they are with us before they have so much leeway to make upjolly little fellows bright and sharp  the whole of the third banks island class eight of them have been with me for eighteen months and they have all volunteered to stay for eighteen months more  they ought to know a great deal at the end of that time then they will go home almost to a certainty only for two or three months and come back again for another long spell  all this is hopeful and we have much to be thankful for indeed but i see no immediate prospect of anything like this in the other islands at present  we know very many of the islanders and more or less of their languages we have scholars who read and write and stop here with us and who are learning a good deal individually but i have as yet no sense of any hold gained upon the people generally we are good friends they like us trust young people with us but they dont understand our object in coming among them properly  the trade and the excitement of our visit has a good deal to do with their willingness to receive us and to give us children and young men  they behave very well when here and their people treat us well when we are with them  but as yet i see no religious feeling no apprehension of the reality of the teaching they know in one sense and they answer questions about the meaning of the creed c but they would soon fall again into heathen ways and their people show no disposition to abandon heathen ways  in all this there is nothing to surprise or discourage us  it must be slow work carried on without observation amidst many failures and losses and disappointments  if i wished to attribute to secondary causes any of the results we notice i might say that our having lived at mota two or three months each year has had a great deal to do with the difference between the banks and the other islanders  it may be that could we manage to live in bauro or anudha or mahaga or whitsuntide or lepers island or espiritu santo we might see soon some such change take place as we notice in mota but all that is uncertain and such thoughts are useless  we must indeed live in those other islands as soon as we can but it is hard to find men able to do so and only a few of the islands are ripe for the attempt  i feel often like a horse going his regular rounds almost mechanically  every part of the day is occupied and i am too tired at night to think freshly  so that i am often like one in a dream and scarcely realise what i am about  then comes a time when i wish to write eg as to you now about the mission and it seems so hard to myself to see my way and so impossible to make others see what is in my mind about it  sometimes i think these banks islanders may be evangelists beyond the limits of their own islands  so many of the natives of other islands live here with them and speak the language of mota and then they have so much more in common with them than with us and the climate and food and mode of life generally are familiar to them alike  i think this may come to pass some day i feel almost sure that i had better work on with promising islanders than attempt to train up english boys of which i once thought  i am more and more confirmed in my belief that what one wants is a few rightminded welleducated english clergymen and then for all the rest trust to native agency  when i think of mr robertson and such men and think how they work on it encourages me  and so where do i hear of men who have so many comforts so great immunity from hardship and danger as we enjoy  this is nothing to the case of a london parish  fanny has sent me out my old engravings which i like to look at once more although there is only one really good one among them and yet i dont like to think of her no longer having them  i have also a nice selection of photographs just sent out among which the cartoons from hampton court are especially good  that grand figure of st paul at athens which raphael copied from masaccios fresco always was a favourite of mine  i feel at home here more so than in any place since i left england but i hope that i may be able to spend longer intervals in the islands than the mere sixteen or eighteen weeks of the voyage if i have still my health and strength  but i think sometimes that i cant last always i unconsciously leave off doing things and wake up to find that i am shirking work  holy innocents dayi dont think i have sufficiently considered your feelings in suffering the change of name in the mission school that took place and i am rather troubled about it  i came back from the last voyage to find that as i had selected a site for the buildings on st barnabas day which was by a coincidence the day i spent here on my outward voyage in 1866 the people had all named the place st barnabas  then came the thought of the meetings on st barnabas and the appropriateness of the missionary apostles name and i without thinking enough about it acquiesced in the change of name  i should have consulted younot that you will feel yourself injured i well know but for all that i ought to have done it  it was the more due to you because you wont claim any right to be consulted  i am really sorry for it and somewhat troubled in mind footnote he need not have been sorry  i give this to show his kind scrupulous consideration but i like everyone else could not help feeling that it was more fitting that the germ of a missionary theological college should not bear a name even in allusion to a work of fiction  the occasional notices of mr and mrs keble in your letters and the full account of him and her as their end drew nigh is very touching  how much how very much there is that i should like to ask him now  how i could sit at his feet and listen to him  these are great subjects that i have neither time nor brains to deal with and there is no one here who can give me all the help i want  i think a good deal about ritualism more about union most about the eucharistic question but i need some one with whom to talk out these matters  when i have worked out the mind of hooker bull waterland c and read freemans principles and puseys books and mr kebles c then i want to think it out with the aid of a really wellread man  it is clearly better not to view such holy subjects in connection with controversy but then comes the thoughthow is christendom to be united when this diversity exists on so great a point  and then one must know what the diversity really amounts to and then the study becomes a very laborious and intricate enquiry into the ecclesiastical literature of centuries  curiously enough i am still waiting for the book i so much want mr kebles book on eucharistic adoration  i had a copy of course but i lent it to some one  i lose a good many books in that way  the extraordinary change in the last thirty years will of course mark this time hereafter as one of the most noticeable periods in the history of the church indeed one cant fail to see it which is not always the case with persons living in the time of great events  the bold outspoken conduct of earnest men the searching deeply into principles the comparative rejection of conventionalities local prejudices exclusive forms of thought and practice must strike everyone  but one misses the guiding restraining handthe man in the church corresponding to the duke at one time in the state the authority  one thing i do think that the being conversant only with thoughtful educated christians may result in a person ignoring the simpler idea of the eucharist which does not in the least divest it of its mysterious character but rather recognising the mystery seeks for no solution of it  how can i teach my fifteen melanesian communicants the points which i suppose an advanced ritualist would regard as most essential  but i can give them the actual words of some of the ancient really ancient liturgies and teach them what christ said and st paul said and the church of england says and bid them acquiesce in the mystery  yet i would fain know more  i quite long for a talk with mr keble  predisposed on every account to think that he must be right i am not sure that i know what he held to be the truth nor am i quite sure that i would see it without much explanation but to these holy men so much is revealed that one has no right to expect to know what he held was in him at all events combined with all that a man may have of humility and learning and eagerness for union with god   this letter was sent with these   norfolk island december 16 1867  my dear mr atkinthe pacific arrived on friday after a quick passage  all our things came safely  she leaves tomorrow for sydney and we are in a great hurry  for 1 we have three mails all at once and i have my full share of letters public and private and 2 we have had last week our first fall of rain for some three and a half months and we are doing our best to plant kumaras c which grow here wonderfully if only they get anything like a fair chance  joe as usual is foremost at all work fencing wellsinking c and he proves the truth of the old saying that the head does not suffer by the work of the hand  his knowledge of scripture truth of what i may fairly call the beginning of theological studies gives me great comfort  i am quite sure that in all essentials in all which by gods blessing tends to qualify a man for teaching faithfully and with sufficient learning and knowledge of the word of god he is above the average of candidates for ordination in england  i dont say that he would pass the kind of examination before an english bishop so well as a great manythey insist a good deal on technical points of historical knowledge cbut in all things really essentialin his clear perception of the unity of the teaching of the bible in his knowledge of the greek testament in his reading with me the articles prayer book c i am convinced that he is well fitted to do his work well and truly  we have had more than one talk on deeper matters still on inward feelings and thoughts on prayer and the devotional study of gods word and divinity in general  i feel the greatest possible thankfulness and happiness as i think of his ordination and of what by the grace of god he may become to very many both heathens and christians if his life be spared  once again my dear friends i thank you for giving him to this work  he is the greatest conceivable comfort and help to me  i always feel when he is walking or working with others that there is one on whose steadiness and strong sense of duty i can always rely may god bless him with his richest blessings  on sunday next dv we shall not forget you as i well know your thoughts and prayers will be with us and we sing before jehovahs awful throne to the old hundredth 2nd no 144 of the hymnal after third collect and before sermon 3rd no 143 after sermon 4th no 19 after litany 5th veni creator to all saints  the ordination will be in the norfolk island church my kind regards to mrs atkin and mary  always my dear friend very truly yours  j c patteson   december 16 1867  my dear miss mackenzieyour brothers pedometer reached me safely three days ago  i feel most truly unworthy to receive such gifts  i have now his sextant his pedometer and most precious of all his thomas a kempis they ought to help me to think more of him and his holy example  your letter commenting on the published life makes me know him pretty well  he was one to love and honour indeed the thorough humility and truthfulness the singlemindedness of the man the simple sense of duty and unwearied patience energy and gentlenessindeed you must love to dwell on the memory of such a brother and look forward with hope and joy to the reunion  we are fast settling ourselves into our headquarters here  our buildings already sufficient to house eighty or one hundred melanesians  we are fencing planting c c vigorously and the soil here repays our labours well  the yam and sweet potatoes grow excellently and the banana orange lemon and nearly all semi tropical fruits and vegetables  i think that our commissariat expenditure will soon be very small and we ought to have an export before long  two things seem to be pretty clear that there is no lack of capacity in the melanesian and no probability of any large supply of english teachers and clergymen even if it were desirable to work the mission with foreign rather than native clergymen  my own mind is and has long been in favour of the native pastorate but it needs much time to work up to such a result  all our party are well in health save one good fellow walter hotaswol who is dying of consumption in faith and hope  better he says to die here with a bright heart than to live in my own land with a dark one  it is a solemn ember week for us  i remain dear miss mackenzie very truly yours  j c patteson  i quite agree with you that you cannot educate tropical and semi tropical people in england and you dont want to make them english christians you know   walters history is here completed   january 22 1868  my dear cousini write you a line i have not time for more in addition to my other epistle to tell you that i purpose to baptize on sunday next eight melanesian youths and one girl  you will i know thank god for this  indeed i hope though i say it with a kind of trembling and wonder that a succession of scholars is now regularly established from the banks islands  these nine are being closely followed by some ten or twelve more younger than they averaging from seven to eleven years who all read and write and know the elements of christian teaching but you should see them bright merry little fellows and the girls too full of play and fun  yet so docile and obedient and goodtempered  they all volunteer to stay here again this winter though they have not been at home since they first left it in july and august 1866  they have a generation of christiansi mean one of our generationssome two dozen or more to help them they have not the brunt of the battle to bear like dear george and henry and others and because either here or there they will be living with christians i need not i think subject them to a probation  next year dv they may be baptized and so the ranks are being filled up  i would call the girl charlotte were she a favourite of mine but i wait in hopes that a nicer girl though this one is good and nice too may be baptized by your and mrs kebles name  you may well believe that my heart and mind are very full of this  may god grant that they may continue his for ever  i confirm on the same day fourteen norfolk islanders  walter hotaswol from matlavo the southern part of saddle island died on the evening of the epiphany a true epiphany to him i trust he was remarkably gentle and innocent for one born in a heathen land his confession very fully made to me before his first communion was very touching simply given and thank god he had been wonderfully kept from the sins of heathenism  with us his life for years was blameless  he died almost without pain after many weeks of lingering in consumption i verily believe in full faith in his saviour and his god  during his last illness and for a short time before he actually took to his bed he frequently received the holy communion  and very remarkable were his words to me the day after his first communion  i was sitting by him when he said apropos of nothing very good  what is very good walter  the lords supper  why do you think so  i cant talk about it  i feel it here touching his heart i dont feel as i did  but you have long believed in him  yes but i feel different from that i dont feel afraid for death my heart is calm me masur kal of a calm following a gale  his look was very earnest as he added i do believe that i am going to him  presently bishop  well  last nightno the night before i received the lords supper i saw a man standing there a tanum liana a man of rank or authority  he said your breath is bad i will give you a new breath  yes  i thought it meant i will give you a new life  i thought it must be jesus  he was weak but not wandering  yes better to die here with a bright heart than to live in my old home with a dark one  january 28ththe nine young christians were baptized on sunday evening a very touching and solemn service it was very full of comfort  it may be that now in full swing of work i am too sanguine but i try to be soberminded thankful and hopeful  i try i sayit is not easy  god bless you my dear cousin and as i pray for you so i know you pray for us  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   a long letter to james patteson which was begun a few days later goes into the mans retrospect of the boys career   march 3rdi think often of your boys  jack in two or three years will be old enough for school and i suppose it must make you anxious sometimes  i look back on my early days and see so much so very much to regret and grieve over such loss of opportunities idleness c that i think much of the way to make lessons attractive to boys and girls  i think a good deal may be done simply by the lessons being given by the persons the children love most and hence where it can be done the mother first and the father too if he can are the best people  they know the ways of the child they can take it at the right times  of course at first it is the memory not the reasoning power that must be brought into exercise young children must learn by heart learn miles which they cant understand or understand but very imperfectly  i think i forget this sometimes and talk to my young melanesians as i should to older persons  but i feel almost sure that children can follow a simple lively account of the meaning and reasons of things much more than one is apt to fancy  and i dont know how anything can be really learnt that is not understood  a great secret of success here is an easy and accurate use of illustrationparabolic teaching  every day of my life i groan over the sad loss i daily experience in not having been grounded properly in latin and greek  i have gone on with my education in these things more than many persons but i can never be a good scholar i dont know what i would not give to have been well taught as a boy  and then at eton any little taste one might have had for languages c was never called out  my fault again but i cant help thinking that it was partly because the reason of a rule was never explained  who ever taught in school the difference between an aorist and a perfect eg  and at college i was never taught it because it was assumed that i knew it  i know that at ten fifteen or twenty i should not in any case have gone into languages as i do now  but i might have learnt a good deal i think  a thoroughly good preparatory school is i dare say very difficult to find  i would make a great point i think to send a boy to a good one not to cram him or make a prig of him but simply to give him the advantage which will make his whole career in life different from what it will be if his opening days pass by unimproved  cool of me jem to write all this but i think of this boy and my boyish days and what i might have been and am not  i was always shallow learned things imperfectly thought i knew a thing when i knew scarce any part of it scrawling off commonplace verses at eton and unfortunately getting sent up for them  i had a character which passed at school and at home for that of a fair scholar  thence came my disgrace at being turned out of the select my bad examination for the balliol scholarship my taking only a second c  nothing was really known  pretty quick in seizing upon a superficial view of a matter i had little patience or deter mination to thoroughly master it  the fault follows me through life i shall never i fear be really accurate and able to think out a matter fully  the same fault i see in my inner life  but it is not right to talk perhaps too much of that only i know that i get credit for much that i dont do and for qualities which i dont possess this is simple truth not false humility  some gifts i have which i thank god i have been now taught to employ with more or less of poverty in the service   the vessel that took away the above despatches brought the tidings of new zealands beloved primate being appointed to the see of lichfield  it was another great wrench to the affectionate heart as will be seen in this filial reply to the intelligence   2nd sunday in lent 10 pm  my dear dear bishopi dont think i ever quite felt till now what you have been to me for many a long year  indeed i do thank god that i have been taught to know and dearly love you and much i reproach myself not now for the first time that i have been wilful and pained you much sometimes by choosing for myself when i ought to have followed your choice  i could say much but i cant say it now and you dont desire it  you know what i think and feel  your letter of the 3rd reached me last night  i dont yet realise what it is to me but i think much more still of those dear people at taurarua  it is perfectly clear to my mind that you could not have acted otherwise  i dont grudge you to the mother church one atom  i write at this time because i think you may possibly be soon beginning your first ordination service in your cathedral  it was almost my first thought when i began to think quietly after our 8 pm prayers  and i pray for those whom you may be leading to their work as so often you have laid your hands on me  i understand bishop andrewes greek text now  what it must have been to you and still is  this move to norfolk island does make a great difference no doubt and full well i know that your prayers will be around us and that you will do all that mortal man can do for us and for the islands indeed you must not trouble yourself about me too much  i shall often need you often sadly miss you a just return for having undervalued the blessing of your presence  but i do feel that it is right  i humbly pray and trust that gods blessing may be on us all and that a portion of your spirit may be with us  more than ever affectionately yours  j c patteson   the tidings had come simultaneously with the history of the consecration of all saints babbicombe for indeed the bishop and mrs selwyn were staying with joanna and fanny patteson for the octave services when the first offer arrived  so that the two mails whose contents were transported together to norfolk island contained matter almost overwhelming for the brother and friend and he had only one day in which to write his answers  to the sisters the assurance is only be quite comforted about me and then again no i dont grudge him one bit  there is no room for small personal considerations when these great issues are at stake  i dont think i quite know yet what it is to me  i cant look at his photograph with quite dry eyes yet  but i dont feel at all sad or unhappy  you know the separation if god in his mercy spare me at last cant be long and his prayers are always around us and he is with us in spirit continually and then it will be such joy and delight to me to watch his work  i think with such thankfulness of the last holy week the last easter sunday spent wholly with him  i think too and that sadly enough of having pained him sometimes by being selfwilled and doing just what he has not done viz chosen for myself when i ought to have followed him  do you remember when on the morning of mammas death we came into the study where uncle and aunt frank were and our dear father in his great faith and resignation said with broken voice i thank god who spared her to me so long  surely i may with far greater ease say i thank god for the blessing for now thirteen years of his example and loving care of me  had he been taken away by death we must have borne it and we can bear this now by his grace  the thought engrossed him most completely  it is plain in all his letters that it was quite an effort to turn his mind to anything but the approaching change  his primate had truly been a father in god to him  his affections had wound themselves about him and mrs selwyn and the society that they formed together with sir william and lady martin had become the next thing to his home and family above all the loneliness of sole responsibility was not complete while the primate was near to be consulted  there had been an almost visible loss of youth and playfulness ever since the voyages had been made without the leader often literally at the helm and though bishop patteson had followed his own judgment in two decided points the removal to norfolk island and the use of mota language instead of english and did not repent having done so yet still the being left with none to whom to look up as an authority was a heavy trial and strain on mind and body and brought on another stage in that premature age that the climate and constant toil were bringing upon him when most men are still in the fulness of their strength  the next letter spoke the trouble that was to mark the early part of the year 1868 as one of sickness and sorrow   our two ambrym boys are coming out and i am hopeful as to some more decided connection with the north face of the island  mahaga lads very promising but at present banks islanders much ahead of the rest  indeed of some of them i may say that while they have no knowledge of many things that an english lad ought to know yet they have a very fair share of intelligence concentrated on the most important subject and know a good deal about it  they think  then follows a working out of one of the difficult questions that always beset missionaries respecting the heathen notionsor no notionsabout wedlock  speaking of the persons concerned the journal continues  they were not able to understandand how can a man and woman or rather a girl and boy understandwhat we understand by marriage they always saw men and women exchanging husbands and wives when they pleased and grew up in the midst of such ideas and practices so that there never was a regular contract nor a regularly well conceived and clearlyunderstood notion of living together till death us do part in their minds  you will say and yet they were baptized  yes but i did not know so much about heathen ways then and besides read st paul to the corinthians and see how the idea of sanctity of marriage and of chastity in general is about the last idea that the heathen mind comprehends  long after the heathen know that to break the sixth eighth even the ninth and tenth commandments is wrong and can understand and practically recognise it to be so the seventh is a puzzle to them  at the best they only believe it because we say that it is a commandment of god  look at the canons of the early church on the question look how luther sanctioned the polygamy the double marriage of the landgrave of hesse  so that although now thank god our scholars understand more of what is meant by living with a woman and the relation of husband and wife is not altogether strange to them yet it was not so at first and is not likely to be so with any but our welltrained scholars for a long time   norfolk island march 26 1868  my dearest sistershow you are thinking of me this anniversary  thirteen years since i saw your dear faces and his face  oh how thankful i am that it is so long ago  it was very hard to bear for a long long time  last night as i lay awake i thought of that last sunday the words i said in church how absurdly consequential they seem to me now the walk home calling to see c l parting with the vicar and m the last eveninghearts too full to say what was in them the sitting up at night and writing notes  and then black monday  well i look back now and see that it was very hard at first and i dont deny that i found the mere bodily roughnesses very trying at first but that has long past  my present mode of life is agreeable to me altogether now  servants and company would be a very great bore indeed  so even in smaller ways you see i have all that i can desire  i always try to remember that i may miss these things and specially miss you if it should please god to send any heavy sickness upon me i dare say i should be very impatient and need kind soothing nurses but i must hope for the best  just now we have some anxiety  there has been and is a bad typhoid fever among the pitcairners want of cleanliness no sewerage or very bad draining crowded rooms no ventilation the large drain choked up a dry season so that the swampy ground near the settlement has been dry these are secondary causes  for two months it has been going on  i never anticipated such a disease here  but the fever is bad  last night two died both young women of about twenty  two one a married man of thirty with five children the other a girl of twelve had died before  i have been backwards and forwards but no one else of the party  the poor people like to see me  for three weeks i have felt some anxiety about four or five of our lads and they have been with me in my room  i dont like the symptoms of one or two of them  but it is not yet a clear case of the fever   easter evedear sisters once more i write out of a sick hospital this typhoid fever strongly marked as described in dr watsons books grayes edition of hoopers vade mecum and as a very solemn lesson of lent and holy week seven pitcairners have died for many weeks the disease did not touch us we established a regular quarantine and used all precautions  we had i think none of the predisposing causes of fever at our place  it is high welldrained clean no dirt near excellent water and an abundant supply of it but i suppose the whole air is impregnated with it  anyhow the fever is here  april 23rdmy house consists you know of chapel my rooms and hospital  this is the abode of the sick and suspected  the hospital is a large lofty wellventilated room a partition 6 feet high only divides it into two on one side are the sick on the other side sleep those who are sickening  as yet twenty have been in my quarters  of these seven are now in codringtons house halfway between hospital and ordinary school life  they are convalescents real convalescents  you know how much socalled convalescents need care in recovering from fever but these seven have had the fever very slightly indeed thank god the type of the disease is much less severe than it was at first  one lad of about sixteen hofe from ysabel island died last friday morning the fever came on him with power from the first  he was very delirious for some days restless sleepless then comatose  the symptoms are so very clearly marked and my books are so clear in detail of treatment that we dont feel much difficulty now about the treatment and the nursery and hospital work we are pretty well used to  barasu from ysabel island who was near dying on thursday week a fortnight ago today has hovered between life and death  i baptized him at 9 pm on holy thursday the anniversary of mr kebles death  john keble rather presumptuous to give such a name but i thought he would not have been named here by it for many hours  he is now sitting by the hospital fire  i have just fed him with some rice and milk and he is well enough to ask for a bit of sweet potato which he cannot yet hold nor guide his hand to his mouth he has had the regular fever and is now thank god becoming convalescent  no other patient is at present in a dangerous state all have the fever signs more or less doubtful  no one is at present in a precarious state  it has been very severe in the town and there are many cases yet  partly it is owing to the utter ignorance or neglect of the most ordinary rules of caution and nursing children and men and women all lie on the ground together in the fever or out of it  the contagion fastens upon one after another in isaac christians house the mother and five children were all at one time in a dangerous state wandering delirious comatose  yet the mortality has been small  only seven have died some few are still very ill yet the character of the fever is less severe now we had some sharp hospital work for a few days and nights all the accompaniments of the decay of our frail bodies  now we have a respite  codrington palmer and i take the nursing better that the younger ones always more liable to take fever should be kept out of contagion to no one but i have gone among the sick in town or to town at all  we are all quite well  beef tea chicken broth mutton broth wine brandy milk to any extent rice cpalmer manufactures all  the pitcairners most improvident people are short of all necessary stores  i give what i can but i must be stingy as i tell them for i never anticipated an attack of typhus here  they will i trust learn a lesson from it and not provoke a recurrence of it by going on in their old ways  i dont deny that at times i have been a good deal depressed about holy week and easter week was the worst time  things are much brighter now though i fully expect that several others perhaps many others will yet have the attack but i trust and fancy it may be only in a modified form  we have regular chapel and school but the school is a mild affair now i who am only in bed from 1230 or 1 to 5 and in the hospital all day cannot be very bright in school  i just open a little bit of my red baize door into chapel so that the sick in my room join in the service  nice is it not  this will greatly unsettle plans for the voyage  the southern cross is expected here about may 10 but i cant leave any sick that may want my care then and i cant take back to the islands any that are only just convalescent or indeed any of the apparently healthy who may yet have the seeds of the fever in them  it would be fearful if it broke out on the islands  i must run no risk of that so i think that very likely i may keep the whole party here another year and make myself a short visitation  i suppose that the bishop will come to new zealand and i must try to meet him i should like to see his face once more but if he doesnt come or if i cant by reason of this sickness go to meet himwell i shall be spared the parting if i dont have the joy of the meeting and these things are not now what they once were  april 28thbarasu john keble died this morning as i read the commendatory prayer by his side  he had a relapse some five days ago how we cannot say he was always watched day and night  i had much comfort in him he was a dear lad and our most hopeful ysabel scholar  his peaceful death for it was very peaceful at the last may work more than his life would have done some twenty others convalescent or ailing or sick  at this moment another comes to say that he feels out of sorts you know that sensation and how ones heart seems to stop for a minute and then one tries to look and speak cheerfully  april 29thi read the service over another child today son of james and priscilla quintall the second child they have lost within a few days and priscilla herself is lying ill of the fever  poor people i did what little i could to comfort them the poor fellow is laid up too with a bad foot a great many others are very ill some young ones especially  may 5thjemima young sent for me yesterday morning  i was with her the day before and she was very ill  i reached the room at 1145 and she died at noon  jemima young had been particularly bright pleasant and helpful when mrs selwyn was on the island  may 7ththe sick ones doing pretty well  you must not think it is all gloom far from it there is much to cheer and comfort us  the hearty cooperation of these excellent fellowworkers is such a support and is brought out at such times  we are going on with divers works but not very vigorously just now we are sawing the timber for our large hall the building still to be put up and then our arrangements will be complete for the present  then our fencing goes on  we have one large field of some ninety or one hundred acres enclosed the sea and a stream bounding two sides and two other fields of about forty and twenty acres  i have good cart mares and one cart horse a riding mare which i bought of mr pritt and atkin has one also eleven cows and as many calves poultry sadly destroyed by wild cats and pigs and two breeding sows and a flock of fifty wellbred sheep imported  these cost me £4 10s a head i hope they are the progenitors of a fine flock the ram cost £12  we have plenty of work and must go on fencing and subdividing our fields  most of the land is wooded but a considerable quantity can easily be cleared  indeed 200 or 300 acres are clear now of all but some smaller stuff that can easily be removed  a thick couchgrass covers all  it is not so nutritious as the ordinary english grasses but cattle sheep and horses like it only a larger quantity is needed by each animal  it gives trouble when one wants to break it up it is such a network of roots but once out of the ground and the soil clear and it will grow anything our crops of sweet potatoes are excellent  the ordinary potato does very well too and maize vegetables of all sorts many fruit trees all the semitropical things capitally guavas by the thousand and very soon i hope oranges lemons now by thousands melons almost a weed bananas abundant byandby coffee sugarcane pineapples these last but small arrowroot of excellent quality  violets from my bed and mignonette from palmers scent my room at this minute the gardeners codrington palmer and atkin are so kind in making me tidy devising little arrangements for my little plot of ground and my comfort and pleasure generally  well that is a nice little chat with you  now it is past 8 pm and the mutton broth for clement and mary is come  i must feed my chicks  excellent patients they are as good as can be  they dont make the fuss that i did in my low fever when i was so savage with your doves that would go on cooing at my window dont you remember  my dear bishop will be touched by the confidence in him shown by his late diocesan synod in entrusting to him the nomination of his successor  it was clearly the right thing to do  as for me no one who knows anything about it or me would dream of removing me from melanesia as long as i have health and strength and still less of putting me into another diocese  when i break down or give up it will not be to hold any other office as i think  may 8thall going on pretty well thank god  mary is weak but i think better did not wander last night  clement with strong typhoid symptoms yet at all events not worse  but he is a very powerful thickset fellow not a good subject for fever  i feel that i am beginning to recover my interest in things in general books c  for two months i was entirely occupied with hospital work and with visiting daily the sick pitcairners and i was weary and somewhat worn out  now i am better in mind and body some spring in me again  this may be to fit me for more trials in store but i think that the sunshine has come again  there were however two more deathsthe twins of mwerlau  clement died on the 24th of may the other brother richard followed him a fortnight later  they were about seventeen strong and thickset clement had made considerable progress during his two years of training and had been a communicant since christmas  before passing to the other topics with which as the bishop said he could again be occupied here is mr codringtons account of this period of trouble  a great break in the first year was caused by the visitation of typhus fever in the earlier part of 1868  this disease brought as i always believed by infection from a vessel that touched here first attacked a norfolk islander who did not live in the town  he was ill in the middle of february others of the pitcairn people soon after the bishop began at once to visit the sick very diligently and continued to visit them throughout though after a time our own hospital was full  our first case was on the llth of march and our last convalescents did not go out until near the end of june  for some time there was hard work to be done with nursing the sick  the bishop had the anxiety and the charge of medically treating the sick mr nobbs as always was most kind in giving the benefit of his experience but he was too fully occupied with the care of his own flock to be able to help us much  it was agreed as soon as we saw the disease was among us that the three elder members of the mission should alone come into communication with the sick  we kept watch in turns but the bishop insisted on taking a double share ie he allowed us only to take regular watches in the night undertaking the whole of the days work except during the afternoon when he was away with the pitcairn people  he seemed quite at home in the hospital almost always cheerful always very tender and generally very decided as to what was to be done  he was fond of doctoring read a good deal of medical books and knew a good deal of medical practice but the weight of such a responsibility as belonged to the charge of many patients in a fever of this kind was certainly heavy upon him the daily visit to the pitcairn people on foot or on horseback was no doubt a relief though hard work in itself  of the four lads we lost two twins had been some time christened one was baptized before his death the first who died had not been long with the mission  it is characteristic of bishop patteson that i never heard him say a word that i remember of religion to one of the sick  on such things he would not unless he was obliged speak except with the patient alone  before the sickness was quite over the southern cross arrived for the winter voyage  the danger of carrying infection to the islands could not be incurred and the vessel was sent back to auckland for a time  the letters she carried back refer again to the growing anxiety about the labour traffic  may 6thi am corresponding with a wesleyan missionary in ovalau fiji on a matter that you may see mentioned some day in the papers a very questionable practice of importing from the southern new hebrides principally tanna natives to work on the cotton plantations of white settlers in fiji  it is all as i am assured under the regulation of the consul at ovalau and managed properly but i feel almost sure that there is or will be injuries done to the natives who i am sure are taken away under false pretences the traders dont know the tannese language and have no means of making the people understand any terms and to talk of any contract is absurd  yet a large number of tanna men living on really well conducted plantations owned by good men might lead to a nucleus of christian tannese  so says mr m  true say i if  you can find the good planters and wellconducted plantations  mr m assures me that they the wesleyan missionaries are watching the whole thing carefully  he writes well and sensibly on the whole and kindly asks me to visit his place and judge for myself  tanna is in the hands of the nova scotia presbyteriansmr greddie inglis and others but the adjacent islands we have always visited and considered ours and of course a plague of this kind soon spreads  my letter to mr attwood on the matter was read by sir john young and commodore lambert and they expressed a warm interest in the matter  mr m says that they think it would be well to accept some rule of conduct in the matter from the commodore which is i think likely to do good  by the 15th of june the glad intelligence was received that the hospital had been empty for a fortnight and the house that was to have been carried to mota was put up for the married couples for whom it afforded separate sleeping rooms though the large room was in common  two weddings were preparing and b and his wife had become reconciled  we may hope that this time it is not a case of two children then unbaptized living together heathen fashion obeying mere passion ignorant of true love but a sober somewhat sad reunion of two clever and fairlyeducated grownup people knowing much of life and its sad experience understanding what they are about and trying to begin again with prayer to god and purposes of a good life  this time of convalescence was a time of great progress  a deep impression had been made on many and there was a strong spirit of enquiry among them  the bishop then began a custom of preaching to his black scholars alone after the midday service dismissing his five or six white companions after prayers because he felt he could speak more freely and go more straight to the hearts of his converts and catechumens if he had no other audience  the other inhabitants of the island suffered long after the st barnabas scholars were free and deaths continued  it was impossible to enforce on such an undisciplined race the needful attention to cleanliness or even care of the sick the healthy were not kept apart nor was the food properly prepared for the sick  it was impossible to stir or convince the easygoing tropical nature and there was no authority to enforce sanitary measures so the fever smouldered on taking first one then another victim and causing entire separation from st barnabas except as far as the bishop was concerned  meantime a house was being put up to receive mr palmers intended wife the daughter of that mr ashwell who had shared in the disastrous voyage when the southern cross had been wrecked  she had been brought up to mission work and was likely to be valuable among the young girls  after this announcement the bishop continues  my mind is now made up to take the great step of ordaining dear george sarawia for nine years my pupil and for the last three or four my friend and helper  codrington is only surprised that he is not ordained already  humanly speaking there can be no doubt of his steadfastness  he is indeed a thoroughly good conscientious man humble without servility friendly and at his ease without any forwardness and he has a large share of good sense and clear judgment  moreover he has long held a recognised position with all here and in new zealand and for the last two years the mota people and the neighbouring islanders have quite regarded him as one whom they recognise as their leader and teacher one of our own race yet not like usdifferent he knows and does what we cant do and dont know  they quite look upon him as free from all the difficulties which attend a mans position as inheriting feuds animosities c  he goes anywhere when the island may be in a disturbed state no one would hurt him he is no partisan in their eyes a man of other habits and thoughts and character a teacher of all  i think oh with such feelings of thankfulness and hope too of the first melanesian clergyman  i should almost like to take him to auckland that the bishop might ordain him but he ought to be ordained here in the presence of the melanesians and in the hasty confusion of the few weeks in new zealand george would be at a sad loss what to do and the month of october is cold and raw  but you may get this just in time to think of his ordination and how you will pray for him  his wife sara is a weakly body but good and she and i are and always have been great friends  she has plenty of good sense  their one child simon born in norfolk island some fourteen months ago is a very nicelooking child and healthy enough  meantime the spirit of enquiry and faith was makingmarked progress mr codrington says the stir in the hearts and minds of those already christened might be called a revival and the enquiring and earnest spirit of many more seemed to be working towards conversions during this time there might be seen on the cliff or under the trees in the afternoon or on sundays little groups gathered round some of the elder christians enquiring and getting help  it was the work that george evidently was enabled to do in this way that convinced everyone that the time had quite come for his ordination  it is worth mentioning that the boys from one island and one individual in particular were much influenced by the last conversations of the first christian who died here walter hotaswol who had told his friends to be sure that all the bishop had told them was true  this quickening and its results are further described in the ensuing letter wherein is mention of the bauro man taroniara the most remarkable of the present conversions and destined three years after to die with the bishop and mr atkin   june 20 9 pm 1868  my dear sistersyou know how i am thinking of him today  seven years ago  i think that he seems more and more present to my mind than ever  how grateful it is to me to find the dear bishop ever recurring to him in his sermons c but indeed we all have the great blessing and responsibility of being his children  the thought of meeting him again if god be so merciful comes over me sometimes in an almost overpowering way i quite seem to see and feel as if kneeling by his side before the great glory and even then thinking almost most of him  and then so many others toomamma uncle james frank c and you dear joan think of your dear mother  it seems almost too much  and then the mind goes on to think of the saints of god in every generation from one of the last gathered in dear mr keble to the very first and as we realise the fact that we may by gods wonderful mercy be companions though far beneath the feet of patriarchs and apostles and martyrs and even see him as he isit is too great for thought and yet thank god it is truth  my heart is full too of other blessed thoughts  there seems to be a stirring of heart among our present set of scholars the younger ones i mean they come into my room after evening chapel and school one or two at a time but very shy sit silent and at last say very softly bishop i wish to stop here for good  why  i do wish to be good to learn to be like george and henry and the rest  this morning i baptized charlotte and joanna  charlotte will be married to fisher on wednesday when benjamin and marion will also be married  oh what blessings are these  i spoke earnestly of the service in my preachment  taroniara from san cristoval said to me the other night bishop why is it that now i think as i never thought before  i cant tell quite what i think  you know i used to be willing to learn but i was easily led away on my own island but i think that i shall never wish again to listen to anything but the word of god  i know i may be wrong but i think i shall never be inclined to listen to anything said to me by my people to keep me from you and from this teaching i feel quite different i like and wish for things i never really used to care for i dont care for what i used to like and live for what is it  what do you think it is  i thinkbut it is so mava greati think it is the spirit of god in my heart  as for the mota and matlavo fellows and the girls too they have now good examples before them and one and all wish to stop here as long as i please  and that being so the return to their homes not being a return to purely heathen islands i trust that they may soon be baptized  so my heart is full of thankfulness and wonder and awe  all this time i write with a full sense of the uncertainty of this and every human work  i know the bishop is preaching on failures and i try to think he is preaching to me  july 2nd 8 ammy dear sisters what a day we had yesterday so full of happiness and thankfulness  it was the weddingday of fisher and charlotte benjamin and marion  the chapel was so prettily dressed up by mr codrington and mr bice under whose instructions some of the lads made evergreen ornaments c large white arums and red flowers also  at 7 am morning prayers as usual  at 930 the wedding  all the melanesians in their places in chapel and as we came into the chapel from my room the 100th psalm was chanted capitally  mr codrington said he never was present at so thoroughly devotional a wedding  it was a really solemn religious service  then i gave good presents to everyone in the school even the smallest boys came in for a knife beads c  then cricket for the day was beautifully fine though it is midwinter  and all sorts of fun we had  then a capital dinner puddings c  then cricket running races running in sacks all for prizes then a great tea 7 pm chapel then native dances by a great bonfire  then at 10 pm hot coffee and biscuits then my little speech presenting all our good wishes to the married couples and such cheering i hope it may be well remembered  the deeper feeling of it all is bearing fruit already lads and young men from the solomon islands say we begin to see what is meant by a man and woman living together the solemnity of the service struck them much  the bridegrooms wore their sunday dresses nice tidy trousers of dark tweed crimean shirt collar and tie and blue serge coat  the brides white jackets trimmed with a bit of red white collar and blue skirts  all the answers quietly and reverently made the whole congregation answering amen to the word of blessing in an unmistakeable way  the 67th psalm was chanted of course  my plan is to have psalms with reading and singing to suit each day regarded as commemorative of the great facts and doctrines so that every week we read in chapel about forty psalms and sing about twelve hymns  these are pretty well known by heart and form already a very considerable stock of scriptural reference  the resurrection and the gift of the spirit the nativity manifestation betrayal ascension crucifixion burial with the doctrines connected with them come in this way every week before their minds  i translated psalms chosen with reference to this plan and wrote hymns c in the same way  i wish you could have been with us yesterday  it was really a strikingly solemn service  then our fortnightly 7 am communions our daily 7 am and 7 pm services our baptisms yes and our burials too all are so quiet and there is so much reverence  you see that they have never learnt bad habits  a melanesian scholar wouldnt understand how one could pray in any other posture than kneeling  the evening catechumen classes so happy  and then the dear fellows at their private prayers  the chapel is always open you know and in the early morning and late evening little knots of three and four or eight and ten are kneeling about quietly saying their prayers the sick ladsdear clement and richard who diedas long as they could move knelt up in hospital to say their prayers and all but quite the new comers did the same  it was touching to see them weak and in much pain yet i did not of course tell them that they might as well pray as they lay on their rugs  better for them even if it did a little exhaust them  it is no mere formal observance of a rule for there never has been any rule about it  i have given them short simple prayers and they first learn to kneel down with me here in my room or with codrington in his room c  but i merely said long ago at kohimarama you know you can always go into the chapel whenever you like  sometimes i do wish you could see them but then unless you could talk with them and indeed unless you knew the melanesian mind and nature you couldnt estimate these things rightly  but never did i feel so hopeful though my old text is ever in my mind isaiah lx 5 thine heart shall fear and be enlarged thats exactly it  july 18thtomorrow i baptize taroniara of san cristoval a young man full of promise  he has a wife and little girl of about four years old  he may become by gods blessing the teacher of the people of his island  from a letter of the same date to myself i add the further particulars about one who was to teach by his death instead of his life and for whom the name of the first martyr was chosen  he has been with me for some years always good and amiable but too goodnatured too weak so that he did not take a distinct line with his people  he is a person of some consequence in his neighbourhood now he gives all the proofs that can well be given of real sincerity he wonders himself as he contrasts his present with his former thoughts  i feel humanly speaking quite convinced that he is thoroughly in earnest  his wife and little child are in the islands how foolish of me not to have listened to you and brought them here at once  then we could stop here for good  but he will return with them all being well or without them if anything has happened to them and i see in him as i hope and pray the pioneer for san cristoval at last  resuming the home letter  the language of mota now is beginning to be a very fair channel for communicating accurate theological teaching  we have of course to a large extent made it so by assigning deeper meanings to existing words we have introduced very few words  this is the case in every language  on sunday night if you had been here and been able to understand my teaching on st john vi to the communicants you would have been surprised i think something of hookers fifth book was being readily taken in by several of those present  an old testament history they dont learn merely as certain events  they quickly take up the meaning the real connection  i use the sunday teaching or work them at all events on that plan  well you mustnt say too much of the bright side of the picture  it is so easy to misunderstand  the time has been bad for our lambing  we have thirtyfive lambs looking well and have lost i think nine  yesterday a great event occurred  one of the cartmares foaled great was the satisfaction of the melanesians at the little filly  calves are becoming too common as we have now fourteen or fifteen cows and five more are owing to us for goods which the people take in exchangenot money which would not suit them as well  we have fenced in plenty of grass and i dont want to pay any more for keep  of course we use a good deal of salt beef on shore here as well as seek to supply the southern cross on her voyages  it is pleasant to walk about and see the farm and gardens thriving all being well we shall have some 300 bananas next year lots of sugarcanes many fruit trees are being planted pineapples coffee c guavas grow here like weeds  i dont care for these things but the others do and of course the scholars rejoice in them  i think of the islands and see them in my waking dreams and it seems as if nothing was done  but i think again of what it was only a very short time ago and oh i do feel thankful indeed and amazed and almost fearful  i should like much if i am alive and well to see my way to spending more of my time on the islands  but the careful training of picked scholars for future missionaries is i am sure the most important part of our work though it must be combined as much as possible with residence in the islands  if i could feel that the school was well able to get on without me i would be off to the islands for a good spell  on the other hand i feel most strongly that my chief business is to make such provision as i may for the multiplication of native missionaries and the future permanent development and extension of the mission and to do this our best scholars must be carefully trained and then we may hope to secure a competent staff of native clergymen for the islands  mind i am not disposed to act in a hasty way  only i dont mean to let conventional notions about an english clergyman hinder my providing melanesian islands with a melanesian ministry  these scholars of ours know very much more and i imagine possess qualifications of all kinds for their work in melanesia greater than the majority of the missionaries in the old missionary times  how many men did good work who could hardly read only repeat a few portions of the servicebook c  i need not say that we wish to educate them up to the maximum point of usefulness for their practical work  but given earnestness and steadfastness of character a fair amount of teaching power and a sound knowledge of fundamental truths of the church services and the meaning and spirit of the prayerbook and we may surely trust that by gods grace they may execute the office of the ministry to the glory of god and the edification of the church  they have now in mota in print st luke the acts soon will have st john which is all ready the prayerbook save some of the psalms and a few other small portions  and in ms they have a kind of manual of the catechism abstract of the books of the old testament papers on prophecy c c  all this work once done in mota is without very much labour to be transferred into bauro mahaga mara c c as i hope but that is in the future  in the birthday letter to his sister fanny his chilly nature confesses that august cold was making itself felt and it was becoming time for him to make a journey to the settled world both on account of a small tumour under his eyelid and of the state of his teeth  moreover no letters from home had reached him since the 2nd of march  but he writes on the 7th of september to his brother  this does not a bit distress me  i like the freedom from all external excitement  it gives me uninterrupted time from my own work and the world does not suffer from my ignorance of its proceedings  how you exist with all the abominations of daily papers i cant imagine  your life in england seems to be one whirl and bustle with no real time for quiet thought and patient meditation c  and yet men do think and do great things and it doesnt wear them out soon either  witness bishops and judges c living to eighty and even ninety in our own days  i like quiet and rest and no railroads and no daily posts and above all no visitors mere consumers of time mere idlers and producers of idleness  so without any post and nothing but a cart on wheels save a wheelbarrow and no visitors and no shops i get on very happily and contentedly  the life here is to me i must confess luxurious because i have what i like great punctuality early hours regular school work regular reading very simple living the three daily meals in hall take about seventy minutes all put together and so little time is lost and then the climate is delightful  too cold now but then i ought to be in the islands the thermometer has been as low as 56° in my room and i am standing in my room and writing now with my great coat on the thermometer being 67°  you know that i am not cut out for society never was at my ease in it and am glad to be out of it  i am seldom at my ease except among melanesians they and my books are my best companions  i never feel the very slightest desire for the old life  you know how i should like to see you dear ones andothers by name but i couldnt stand more than a week in england if i could transplant myself there in five minutes  i dont think this augurs any want of affection but i have grown into this life i couldnt change it without a most unpleasant wrench  the letter was at this point when the southern cross arrived on september 10 to carry off the bishop and mr palmer the one to the general synod and to take leave of his most loved and venerated friend the other to fetch his bride  he arrived on the 18th of the month looking ill and much worn and even depressed more so than lady martin had ever seen him for the coming parting pressed heavily upon him  the eye and teeth were operated upon without loss of time and successfully but this with the cold of the voyage made him in his own word shaky and it was well that he was a guest at taurarua with lady martin to take care of him feed him on food not solid and prevent him on the ensuing sunday from taking more than one of the three services which had been at once proffered to him  it was no small plunge from the calm of st barnabas  we agree said lady martin in a note within his envelope that we cannot attempt to write letters just now  we are in a whirl mental and bodily one bit of blue sky has just shown itself viz  that coley may possibly stay on with us for a week or two after the selwyns have left us  this really is proeter spem and i mean to think that it will come to pass  but in all this bustle he found time to enclose a kind little note to me showing his sympathy with the sorrow of that summer in my mothers illness   auckland  october 3 1868  i add one line my dear cousin to assure you of my prayers being offered for you now more especially when a heavy trial is upon you and a deep sorrow awaiting you  may god comfort and bless you perhaps the full experience of such anxiety and the pressure of a constant weight may in his good providence qualify you more than ever to help others by words put into your mouth out of your own heartfelt troubles  yet in whatever form the sorrow comes there is the blessing of knowing that she is only being mysteriously prepared for the life of the world to come  there is no real sorrow where there is no remorse nor misery for the falling away of those we love  you have i dare say known as i have some who have the bitterness of seeing children turn out badly and this is the sorrow that breaks one down  it was during these spring days of october that last sunday before the final parting that being hindered by pouring rain from going with the primate who was holding a farewell service with the sick at the hospital bishop patteson said the prayers in the private chapel after these were ended lady martin says he spoke a few words to us  he spoke of our lord standing on the shore of the lake after his resurrection and he carried us and i think himself too out of the heaviness of sorrow into a region of peace and joy where all conflict and partings and sin shall cease for ever  it was not only what he said but the tones of his musical voice and expression of peace on his own face that hushed us into a great calm  one clergyman who was present told sir william martin that he had never known anything so wonderful  the words were like those of an inspired man  three days after our dear friends sailed  i will not dwell on the last service at st pauls church when more than four hundred persons received the holy communion where were four bishops administering in the body of the church and the transepts but in the chancel the primate and his beloved son in the faith were partaking together for the last time of the bread of life  from the church we accompanied our beloved friends to the ship and drove back on a cold dry evening a forlorn party to the desolate house  but from that time dear bishop patteson roused himself from his natural depression for to whom could the loss be greater than to him and set himself to cheer and comfort us all  how gentle and sympathising he was  he let me give him nourishing things even winewhich he had long refused to takebecause i told him mrs selwyn wished him to have it  many hearts were drooping and he no longer shrank from society but went about from one to another in the kindest manner  i do not know how we could have got on without him he loved to talk of the bishop  in his humility he seemed to feel as if any power of usefulness in himself had been gained from him  it was like him to think of our auckland poor at this time  they would so miss the bishop and mrs selwyn  he prayed me to draw £50 a year for the next year or two to be spent in any way i should think best and he put it as a gift from his dear father who would have wished that money of his invested here should be used in part for the good of the townspeople  this did not include his subscriptions to the orphan home and other charities  to make his very liberal gifts in time of need in the name of his father was his favourite custom as his former fellowlabourer the rev b t dudley found when a case of distress in his own parish in the canterbury settlement called forth this ready assistance  perhaps the young church of new zealand has never known so memorable or so sorrowful a day as that which took from her her first bishop a day truly to be likened to that when the ephesians parted with their apostle at miletus  the history of this parting bishop patteson had himself to read on saturday october 17 the twentyseventh anniversary of bishop selwyns consecration  it was at the celebration preceding the last meeting of the synod when collect epistle and gospel were taken from the order for the consecration of bishops and as the latter sayshe has always told me to officiate with him and i had by his desire to read acts xx for the epistle i did read it without a breakdown but it was hard work  then followed the sunday before described by lady martin and on tuesday the 20th that service in st marysthe parting feast  then writes the younger bishop the crowded streets and wharf for all business was suspended public offices and shops shut no power of moving about the wharf horses taken from the carriage provided for the occasion as a mixed crowd of english and maoris drew them to the wharf  then choking words and stifled efforts to say god bless you and so we parted  it is the end of a long chapter  i feel as if my master was taken from my head  ah well they are gone and we will try to do what we can  i feel rather nohow and cant yet settle down to anything  but to the other sister on the same day comes an exhortation not to be alarmed if friends report him as not up to the mark  how could it be otherwise at such a time  for truly it was the last great shock his affections sustained  in itself it might not be all that the quitting home and family had been but not only was there the difference between going and being left behind but youth with its spirit of enterprise and compensation was past and he was in a state to feel the pain of the separation almost more intensely than when he had walked from the door at feniton and gathered his last primrose at his mothers grave  before leaving auckland the bishop married the rev john palmer to miss ashwell and while they remained for a short time in new zealand he returned for the ember week   st thomas norfolk island december 21 1868  my dear cousini must write you a few lines not as yet in answer to your very interesting letter about mr keble and about ritualism c but about our great event of yesterday  george sarawia was ordained deacon in our little chapel in the presence of fiftyfive melanesians and a few norfolk islanders  with him charles bice a very excellent man from st augustines was ordained deacon also  he has uncommon gifts of making himself thoroughly at home with the melanesians  it comes natural to him there is no effort nothing to overcome apparently and they of course like him greatly  he speaks the language of mota the lingua franca here you know  but what am i to say of george that you cannot imagine for yourself it was in the year 1857 that the bishop and i first saw him at vanua lava island  he has been with us now ten years i can truly say that he has never given me any uneasiness  he is not the cleverest of our scholars but no one possesses the confidence of us all in the same degree  true he is the oldest of the party he can hardly be less than twentysix years old for he had been married a year when first we saw him but it is his character rather than his age which gives him his position  for a long time he has been our link with the melanesians themselves whenever there was something to be done by one of themselves rather than by us strangers  somehow the other scholars get into a way of recognising him as the a 1 of the place and so also in mota and the neighbouring islands his character and reputation are well known  the people expect him to be a teacher among them they all know that he is a person of weight  the day was warm and fine  at 720 am we had the morning service chanting the 2nd psalm  i read isa xlii 512 for the first lesson and 1 tim iii 813 for the second and the collect in the ordination service before the prayer of st chrysostom  mr codrington as usual read the prayers to the end of the third collect after which we sang our sunday hymn  at 11 am we began the ordination service  one epiphany hymn my short sermon then mr codrington presented the candidates speaking mota for one and english for the other  the whole service was in mota except that i questioned bice and he answered in english and i used the english words of ordination in his case  george was questioned and answered in mota and then bice in english question by question  mr nobbs was here and a few of the people mr atkin mr brooke so we made a goodly little party of seven in our clerical supper  what our thoughts were you can guess as we ordained the first melanesian clergyman  how full of thankfulness of awe of wonderment the fulfilment of so much the pledge of it if it be gods will of so much more  and not a little of anxiety tooyet the words of comfort are many and it does not need much faith with so evident a proof of gods love and power and faithfulness before our very eyes to trust george in his hands  the closing stanzas of the ordination hymn in the christian year comforted me as i read them at night but i had peace and comfort thank god all through  others too are pressing on  i could say with truth to them in the evening in the chapel this is the beginning only the beginning the first fruit  many blossoms there are already  i know that gods spirit is working in the hearts of some of you  follow that holy guidance i pray always that you may be kept in the right way and that you may be enabled to point it out to others and to guide them in it  and yet no words can express what the recoil of the wave heathenism is but when the enemy shall come in like a flood and it has indeed its own glorious word of promise  it is like one who was once a drunkard and has left off drinking and then once more tastes the old deadly poison and becomes mad for drink or like the wild furious struggles as i suppose of poor penitents in penitentiaries when it seems as if the devil must whirl them back into sin  you know we see things which look like possession a black cloud settling down upon the soul overwhelming all the hopeful signs for a time  and then when i have my quiet talk with such an one and only very few and they not the best among us he will say i cant tell i didnt mean it  it was not i  what was it  and i say it was the devil seeking to devour you to drag you back into the old evil dark ways  it is awful fearful  then you must gird your loins and pray the more and remember that you are christs that you belong to him that you are gods child that satan has no right to claim you now  resist him in this name in the strength of the spirit whom christ has sent to us from the father and he will flee from you  it is of course the same more or less with us all but it comes out in a shape which gives it terrible reality and earnestness  only think then more than ever of them and of me and pray that the spirit of the lord may lift up a standard against the enemy  at times we do seem to realise that it is a downright personal struggle for life or death  there the writer paused and the next date is  christmas day 1868  my dearest sisterswhat a happy happy day  at 125 am i was awoke by a party of some twenty melanesians headed by mr bice singing christmas carols at my bedroom door  it is a glass window opening on to the verandah  how delightful it was  i had gone to bed with the book of praise by my side and mr kebles hymn in my mind and now the mota versions already familiar to us of the angels song and of the light to lighten the gentiles sung too by some of our heathen scholars took up as it were the strain  their voices sounded so fresh and clear in the still midnight the perfectly clear sky the calm moon the warm genial climate  i lay awake afterwards thinking on the blessed change wrought in their minds thinking of my happy happy lot of how utterly undeserved it was and is and as is natural losing myself in thoughts of gods wonderful goodness and mercy and love  then at 445 am i got up a little later perhaps than usual codrington and brooke were very soon at work finishing the decorations in the chapel branches of norfolk island pines divers evergreens pomegranates and oleanders and lilies in handfuls and large snowwhite arums on the altartable arums above and below lilies and evergreens  oleanders and pomegranates marked the chancel arch  the rugs looked very handsome the whole floor at the east end is covered with a red baize or drugget to match the curtains  7 am holy communion  six clergymen in surplices and fifteen other communicants  at 10 am a short very bright joyful service the regular morning prayers psalms xcv xix cx  all chanted  proper lessons two christmas hymns  then games cricket prisoners base running races  beef pork plumpuddings  now we shall soon have evening chapel a great deal of singing a few short words from me then a happy merry innocent evening native dances coffee biscuit and snapdragons to finish with  if you had been here today you would indeed have been filled with surprise and thankfulness and hope  there is i do think a great deal to show that these scholars of ours so connect religion with all that is cheerful and happy  there is nothing as i think sanctimonious about them  they say we are so happy here  how different from our lands  and i think i can truly say that this is not from want of seriousness in those of an age to be serious  i pour this out to you in my happy daywords of hope and joy and thankfulness  but remember that i feel that all this should make me thoughtful as well as hopeful  how can i say but what sorrow and trial may even now be on their way hither  but i thank god oh i do thank him for his great love and mercy and i do not think it wrong to give my feelings of joy some utterance  with this year the eucharist was administered weekly the melanesians still attending fortnightly but it proved to have been a true foreboding that a sorrow was on its way  january 8tha very joyful christmas but a sad epiphany  u dearer to me than ever has i now hear from him been putting himself in the way of temptation  i had noticed that he was not like himself and spoke to him and warned him  i told him that if he wished to be married at once i was quite willing to marry him but he said they were too young and yet he was always thinking of the young fiancee  alas he had too often as he says put himself in the way of temptation with his eyes open and he fell  he was frightened terrified bewildered  alas it is our first great sorrow of the kind for he was a communicant of nearly three years standing  yet i have much comfort  i can have no doubt 1st that a fall was necessary i believe fully  his own words not suggested by me were i tempted god often and he let me fall i dont mean he was the cause of it it is of course only my fault but i think i see that i might have gone on getting more and more careless and wandering further and further from him unless i had been startled and frightened  and then he burst out oh dont send me away for ever  i know i have made the young ones stumble and destroyed the happiness of our settlement here  i know i must not be with you all in chapel and school and hall  i know i cant teach any more i know that and i am miserable miserable  but dont tell me i must go away for ever  i cant bear it   i did manage to answer almost coldly for i felt that if i once let loose my longing desire to let him see my real feeling i could not restrain myself at all  who wishes to send you away u  it is not me whom you have displeased and injured  i know  it is terrible  but i think of the prodigal son  oh i do long to go back  oh do tell me that he loves me still  poor dear fellow i thought i must leave him to bear his burthen for a time  we prayed together and i left him or rather sent him away from my room but he could neither eat nor sleep  the next day his whole manner look everything made one sure humanly speaking that he was indeed truly penitent and then when i began to speak words of comfort of gods tender love and compassion and told him how to think of the lords gentle pity when he appeared first to the magdalene and peter and when i took his hand in the old loving way poor fellow he broke down more than ever and cried like a child  ah it is very sad but i do think he will be a better more steadfast man he has learnt his weakness and where to find strength as he never had before  and the effect on the school is remarkable  that there should be so much tenderness of conscience and apprehension of the guilt of impurity among the children of the heathen in among many brought up in familiarity with sin is a matter for much thankfulness  to this may well be added an extract from joseph atkins journal showing his likemindedness both in thoughtfulness and charity  i feel quite sure that we must be prepared for many such cases  the whole associations and training of the early lives of these people must influence them as long as they live  the thought of what my mother and sister would think never occur to them as any influence for good and although this may be said to be a low motive for doing right it is a very powerful one and it is more tangible because it is lower  the bishop in speaking of it today told the boys that they ought not to do right to please him but because it was right to please god but i cant help thinking that pleasing the bishop may and can help the other very much  is it not right for a child to do right to please its parents and for older children too to be helped by the thought that they are pleasing those they love and honour  we had a council today of all the church members to talk about how u was to be treated  for himself poor fellow i should think kindness would be harder to bear than neglect  mr codrington says on this occasion all the male communicants went together to some little distance where a group of boulders under the pines gave a convenient seat  the bishop set out the case and asked what was the opinion of the elder boys as to the treatment of the offender  they were left alone to consider and when we came back they gave their judgment that he should not eat in the hall at what may be called the high table that he should not teach in school and should not come into chapel  this was of course what was intended but the weight of the sentence so given was greater with the school and a wholesome lesson given to the judges  how soon the bishops severity which never covered his pity gave way to his affection for one of his oldest and dearest pupils and his tenderness for the penitent and how he took a large share of blame upon himself just where it was not due can well be understood by all who knew him  there was soon a brighter day  on january 25 writes mr atkin  we had a great day  in the morning some who were baptized last summer were confirmed and at night there were baptized three girls and thirteen boys  most of them were quite little fellows  i dont think any of us will easily forget their grave and sober but not shy looks as one by one they stepped up to the bishop  i think that all understood and meant what they said that baptism was no mere form with them but a real solemn compact  all who were in my class nine or the sunday morning school were baptized in the evening while we were standing round the font i thought of you at home and half wished that you could have seen us there  i was witness for my son wate he was called joseph so that i shall lose my name that i have kept so long  joseph wate the little malanta boy was always viewed by the atkin family as a kind of child and kept up a correspondence with his godfathers sister mother mary as he called her  on the same day the bishop wrote to judge pohlman  my very dear friendi must not let our correspondence drop and the less likely it seems to be that we may meet the more i must seek to retain your friendship by letting you know not only the facts that occur here but my thoughts and hopes and fears about them  then after mentioning the recent transgression the letter continues respecting the youth  his fright and terror his misery and deep sorrow and i do believe godly repentance make me say that he is still as i trust one of our best scholars  but it is very sad  for three weeks he did not come even into chapel with us  he not only acquiesced but wished that it should be so  last saturday evening he was readmitted without any using of fine names  i did as a matter of fact do what was the practice of the early christians and is recognised in our ash wednesday service now it was very desirable that great notice should be taken of the commission of an act which it is hard for a heathen to understand to be an act of sin and the effect upon the whole school of the sad and serious way in which this offence was regarded has been very good  in the circumstances it is so easy to see how the discipline of the early church was not an artificial but a necessary system though by degrees elaborated in a more complicated manner  but i find not seldom that common sense dictates some course which afterwards i come across in bingham or some such writer described as a usage of the early christians  in our english nineteenth century life such practices could hardly be reintroduced with benefit  yet something which might mark open offences with the censure of the christian body is clearly desirable when you can have it and of course with us there is no difficulty whatever  i cannot be surprised however deeply grieved at this sad occurrence and though it is no comfort to think how many english persons would think nothing of this and certainly not show the deep compunction and sorrow which this poor fellow shows yet as a matter of fact how few young englishmen are there who would think such an act as this young melanesian thinks it to be a grievous sin against god and matter for continual sorrow and humiliation  so i do rejoice that he is sorrowing after a godly sort  in other respects there is a very hopeful promising appearance just now  we number seven clergymen including myself  we have a very efficient band of melanesian teachers and could at this moment work a school of 150 scholars  george sarawia will dv start with a little company of christian friends at his own island  the scholars from all the different islands fraternise excellently well and in many cases the older and more advanced have their regular chums by private arrangement among themselves whom they help and to whose islands they are quite prepared to be sent if i think fit so to arrange and i really do believe that from the banks islands we may send out missionaries to many of the melanesian islands as from samoa and karotonga they have gone out to the islands of the eastern pacific  humanly speaking i see no difficulty in our drawing into our central school here any number of natives that we can support from the new hebrides banks and solomon islands and i trust soon from the santa cruz islands also  here must be the principal work the training up missionaries and steadfast christian men and women not of ability sufficient to become themselves missionaries but necessary to strengthen the hands of their more gifted countrymen  this training must be carried on here but with it must be combined a frequent visitation and as lengthened sojourns in the islands as possible  the next winter we hope that the rev j atkin will be some time at san cristoval the rev c h brooke at florida the rev j palmer at mota  but i am more than ever convinced that the chiefest part of our work is to consist in training up melanesian clergymen and educating them up to the point of faithfully reproducing our simple teaching  we must hope to see native selfsupporting melanesian churches not weak indolent melanesians dependent always on an english missionary but steadfast thoughtful men and women retaining the characteristics of their race so far as they can be sanctified by the word of god in prayer and not force useless imitations of english modes of thought and nineteenth century civilisation  it is sometimes a consequence of our national selfconceit sometimes of want of thought that no consideration is shown to the characteristic native way of regarding things  but christianity is a universal religion and assimilates and interpolates into its system all that is capable of regeneration and sanctification anywhere  before long i hope to get something more respectable in the way of a report printed and circulated  it seems unreasonable to say so but really i have very little time that i can spare from directly melanesian work what with school translations working out languages and thank god the many many hours spent in quiet interviews with melanesians of all ages and islands who come to have private talks with me and to tell me of their thoughts and feelings these are happy hours indeed  i must end  always my dear friend affectionately and sincerely yours  j c patteson   the readmission thus mentioned was by the imposition of hands when the penitent was again received and his conduct ever since has proved his repentance true  february brought mr and mrs palmer to their new home and carried away mr codrington for a holiday  the budget of letters sent by this opportunity contained a remarkable one from young atkin  like master like scholar   february 24 1869  my dear motheryou must not think about my coming back i may have to do it but if i do it will seem like giving up the object of my life  i did not enter upon this work with any enthusiasm and it is perhaps partly from that cause that i am now so attached to it that little short of necessity would take me away my own choice i think never  i know it is much harder for you than for me  i wish i could lighten it to you but it cannot be  it is a great deal more self denial for you to spare me to come away than for me to come away you must think like david i will not offer unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing  if you willingly give him what you prize most however worthless the gift may be he will prize it for the willingness with which it is given  if it had been of my own choosing that i came away i should often blame myself for having made a selfish choice in not taking harder and more irksome work nearer home but it came to me without choosing  i can only be thankful that god has been so good to me   well might the bishop write to the father i thank you in my heart for joes promise  how exactly his own spirit in simple unconscious selfabnegation and thorough devotion to the work  how it chimes in with this written on the selfsame morning to the bishop of lichfield   st matthias day 645 am 1869  my dear bishopyou do not doubt that i think continually of you yet i like you to have a line from me today  we are just going into chapel altering our usual service today that we may receive the holy communion with special remembrance of my consecration and special prayer for a blessing on the mission  there is much to be thankful for indeed much also that may well make the retrospect of the last eight years a somewhat sad and painful one as far as i am myself concerned  it does seem wonderful that good on the whole is done  but everything is wonderful and full of mystery  it is rather mean of me i fear to get out of nearly all troubles by being here  yet it seems to me very clear that the special work of the mission is carried on more conveniently one doesnt like to say more successfully here and my presence or absence is of no consequence when general questions are under discussion  your very affectionate  j c patteson   the same mail brought a letter to miss mackenzie with much valuable matter on mission work   february 26 1869  dear miss mackenziei have just read your letter to me of april 1867 which i acknowledged rather than answered long ago  i cant answer it as it deserves to be answered now  i think i have already written about thirtyfive letters to go by this mail and my usual work seldom leaves me a spare hour  but i am truly thankful for the hopes that seem to show themselves through the mists in places where all christian men must feel so strong an interest  i do hope to hear that the new bishopric may soon be founded on which mr robertson and you and others have so set your hearts  that good man  i often think of him and hope soon to send him through you £10 from our melanesian offertory  you know we have thank god thirtynine baptized melanesians here of whom fifteen are communicants and one george sarawia a clergyman  he was ordained on december 20  there are many little works usually going ons which i dont consider it fair to reckon among the regular industrial work of the mission i pay the young men and lads and boys small sums for such things and i think it right to teach the elder ones the use of money by giving them allowances out of which they buy their clothing c when necessary all under certain regulations  i say this that you may know that our weekly offertory is not a sham  no one knows what they give or whether they give or not  a melanesian takes the offertory bason and they give or not as they please  i take care that such moneys as are due to them shall be given in 3d 4d and 6d pieces  last year our offertory rather exceeded £40 and it is out of this that my brother will now pay you £10 for the mackenzie fund  i write all this because you will like to think that some of this little offertory comes bond fide from melanesians  you take me to mean i hope that christianity is the religion for mankind at large capable of dealing with the spiritual and bodily needs of man everywhere  it is easy for us now to say that some of the early english missions without thinking at all about it in all probability sought to impose an english line of thought and religion on indians and africans  even english dress was thought to be almost essential and english habits c were regarded as part of the education of persons converted through the agency of english missions  all this seems to be burdening the message of the gospel with unnecessary difficulties  the teacher everywhere in england or out of it must learn to discriminate between essentials and nonessentials  it seems to me selfevident that the native scholar must be educated up to the highest point that is possible and that unless one is humanly speaking quite sure that he can and will reproduce faithfully the simple teaching he has received he ought not to teach much less to be ordained  all our elder lads and girls here teach the younger ones and we know what they teach  their notes of our lessons are brought to me books full of them and there i see what they know for if they can write down a plain account of facts and doctrines that is a good test of their having taken in the teaching  george sarawias little essay on the doctrine of the communion is to me perfectly satisfactory  it was written without my knowledge  i found it in one of his many notebooks accidentally  as for civilisation they all live entirely with us and every melanesian in the place men and women boys and girls three times a day take their places with all of us in hall and use their knives and forks plates cups and saucers or for the passage ones pannikins just as we do  george and two others speaking for themselves and their wives have just written out among other things in a list which i told them to make out plates cups saucers knives forks spoons tubs saucepans kettles soap towels domestic things for washing ironing c  the common presents that our elder scholars take or send to their friends include large iron pots for cooking clothing c  they build improved houses and ask for small windows c to put in them boxes carpet bags for their clothes small writing desks notebooks ink pens  they keep their best clothes very carefully and on sundays and great days look highly respectable  and for years we know no instance of a baptized melanesian throwing aside his clothing when taking his holiday at home  as far as i can see my way to any rule in the matter it is this all that is necessary to secure decency propriety cleanliness health c must be provided for them  this at once involves alteration of the houses divisions partitions  people who can read and write and cut out and sew clothes must have light in their houses  this involves a change of the shape and structure of the hut  they cant sit in clean clothes on a dirty floor and they cant write or eat out of plates and use cups c without tables or benches and as they dont want to spend ten hours in sleep or idle talk they must have lamps for cocoanut and almond oil  these people are not taught to adopt these habits by word of mouth they live with us and do as we do  two young married women are sitting in my room now  i didnt call them in nor tell them what to do  we didnt quite understand what you said last night  well i have written it outthere it is  they took as usual the ms sat down just as you or anyone would do at the table to read it and are now making their short notes of it  anyone comes in and out at any time when not at school chapel or work just as they please  we each have our own sittingroom which is in this sense public property and of course they fall into our ways  there is perhaps no such thing as teaching civilisation by word of command nor religion either  the sine qua non for the missionary religious and moral character assumed to existis the living with his scholars as children of his own  and the aim is to lift them up not by words but by the daily life to the sense of their capacity for becoming by gods grace all that we are and i pray god a great deal more not as literary men or scholars but as christian men and women better suited than we are for work among their own people they shall be saved even as we  they have a strong sense of and acquiescence in their own inferiority  if we treat them as inferiors they will always remain in that position of inferiority  but christ humbled himself and became the servant and minister that he might make us children of god and exalt us  it is surely very simple but if we do thus live among them they must necessarily accept and adopt some of our habits  our lord led the life of a poor man but he raised his disciples to the highest pitch of excellence by his life his words and his spirit the highest that man could receive and follow  the analogy is surely a true one  and exclusiveness all the pride of race must disappear before such considerations  but it is not the less true that he did not make very small demands upon his disciples and teach them and us that it needs but little care and toil and preparation to be a christian and a teacher of christianity  the direct contrary to this is the truth  the teachers duty is to be always leading on his pupils to higher conceptions of their work in life and to a more diligent performance of it  how can he do this if he himself acquiesces in a very imperfect knowledge and practice of his duty  and yet the mass of mediaeval missionaries could perhaps scarce read  that may be true but that was not an excellence but a defect and the mass of the gentry and nobility could not do so much they did a great work then  it does not follow that we are to imitate their ignorance when we can have knowledge  but i am wasting your time and mine  yours very truly  j c patteson  psgeorge and his wife and child charles and his wife benjamin and his wife will live together at mota on some land i have bought a good wooden house is to be put up by us this winter dv with one large room for common use school c and three small bedrooms opening on to a verandah  one small bedroom at the other end which any one two or three of us english folks can occupy when at mota  i dare say first and last this house will cost seventy or eighty pounds  then we hope to have everything that can be sown and planted with profit in a tropical climate firstclass breed of pigs poultry c so that all the people may see that such things are not neglected  these things will be given away freelysettings of eggs young sows seeds plants young trees c  all this involves expense quite rightly too and after all i dare say that dear old george will cost about a sixth or an eighth of what we english clergymen think necessary  i dare say £25 per annum will cover his expenses   on easter sunday the penitent was readmitted to the lords table  a happy letter followed   easter tuesday 1869  my dearest sistersanother opportunity of writing  i will only say a word about two things  first our easter and the holy week preceding it secondly how full my mind has been of mr keble on his two anniversaries holy thursday and march 29  and i have read much of the christian year and the two letters i had from him i have read again and looked at the picture of him and felt helped by the memory of his holy saintly life and i dared to think that it might be that by gods great mercy in christ i might yet know him and other blessed saints in the life to come  our holy week was a calm solemn season  all the services have long been in print  day by day in school and chapel we followed the holy services and acts of each day taking ellicotts historical lectures as a guide  each evening i had my short sermonet and we sought to deepen the impressions made evidently upon our scholars by whatever could make it a real matter of life and death to them and us  then came good friday and easter eve during which the melanesians with mr brooke were busily engaged in decorating the chapel with fronds of tree ferns bamboo arums and oleander blossoms  then at 7 am on easter morning thirty of ustwentyone thank god being melanesiansmet in chapel for the true easter feast  then at 11 am how we chanted psalms ii cxiii cxiv and hymn and the old easter hallelujah hymn to the old tune with mota words then at 7 pm psalms cxviii cxlviii to joyful chants and singing easter and other hymns  so yesterday and so today  the short communion service in the morning with hymn and in the evening we chant psalm cxviii and sing out our easter hymn  ah well it makes my heart very full  it is the season of refreshing perhaps before more trails  dear u was with us again on easter morn a truly repentant young man i verily believe feeling deeply what in our country districts is often not counted a sin at all to be a foul offence against his father and saviour and sanctifier  six were there for their first communion among them honest old stephen taroniara the first and only communicant of all the solomon islesof all the world west of mota or east of any of the bishop of labuans communicants  think of that  what a blessing  what a thought for praise and hope and meditation  i sit in my verandah in the moonlight and i do feel happy in spite of many thoughts of early days which may well make me feel unhappy  but i do feel an almost overpowering sensation of thankfulness and peace and calm tranquil happiness which i know cannot last long  it would not i suppose be good anyhow it will soon be broken by some trial which may show much of my present state to be a delusion  yet i like to tell you what i think and i know you will keep it to yourselves  goodbye and all easter blessings be with you  your loving brother  j c patteson    the island voyage was coming near and was to be conducted on a larger scale after the intermission of a whole year  mr brooke was to make some stay at florida mr atkin at wango in bauro and the bishop himself was to take the party who were to commence the christian village at mota while mr codrington and mr bice remained in charge of twentyseven melanesians  the reports of the effects of the labour traffic were becoming a great anxiety and not only the fiji settlers but those in queensland were becoming concerned in it  the southern cross arrived in june but the weather was so bad that knocking about outside the rocks she sustained some damage and could not put her freight ashore for a week  however on the 24th she sailed and put down mr atkin at wango the village in bauro where the bishop had stayed two years previously  mr atkin gives a touching description of taroniaras arrival  stephen was not long in finding his little girl paraiteka  she was soon in his arms  the old fellow just held her up for the bishop to see and then turned away with her and i saw a handkerchief come out privately and brush quickly across his eyes and in a few minutes he came back to us  the little girls mother for whose sake taroniara had once refused to return to school had been carried off by a maran man and as the heathen connection had been so slight and a proper marriage so entirely beyond the ideas of the native state it was thought advisable to leave this as a thing of heathen darkness and let him select a girl to be educated into becoming fit for his true wife  besides stephen joseph wate and two other christian lads were with mr atkin and he made an expedition of two days visit to wates father  at ulava he found that dysentery had swept off nearly all the natives and he thought these races even while left to themselves were dying out  but adds the brave man in his journal i will never i hope allow that because these people are dying out it is of no use or a waste of time carrying the gospel to them  it is i should rather say a case where we ought to be the more anxious to gather up the fragments  so he worked on bravely making it an object if he could do no more to teach enough to give new scholars a start in the school and to see who were most worth choosing there  he suffered a little loss of popularity when it was found that he was not a perpetual fountain of beads hatchets and tobacco but he did the good work of effecting a reconciliation between wango and another village named hane where he made a visit and heard a song in honour of taroniara  he was invited to a great reconciliation feast which he thus describes beginning with his walk to hane by short marches  we waited where we overtook taki until the main body from wango came up  they charged past in fine style looking very well in their holiday dress each with his left hand full of spears and one brandished in the right  it looked much more like a fighting party than a peace party but it is the custom to make peace with the whole army to convince the enemy that it is only for his accommodation that they are making peace and not because they are afraid to fight him  it was about 12 oclock when we reached the rendezvous  there was a fine charge of all except a dozen of the more sedate of the party they rattled their spears and ran and shouted and jumped even crossing the stream which was the neutral ground  we halted by the stream for some time at last some hane people came to their side there was a charge again almost up to them but they took it coolly  at about 10 oclock the whole body of the hane men came and two or three from wango went across to them  i was tired of waiting and asked taki if i should go  yes and tell them to bring the money he said  while i was wading through the stream the hane men gathered up and advanced i turned back with them  they rushed brandishing their spears to within ten or twelve paces of the wango party who had joined into a compact body and so seated themselves as soon as they saw the movement  kara a hane man made his speech first running forwards and backwards shaking his spear all the time and at the end he took out four strings of makira money and gave it to taki  hane went back across the stream and wango went through the same performance taki making the speech  he seemed a great orator and went on until one standing by him said thats enough when he laughed and gave over  he gave four strings of money two shorter than the others and the shortest was returned to him i dont know why but in this way the peace was signed  after nineteen days during which the bishop had been cruising about mr atkin and his scholars were picked up again and likewise mr brooke who had been spending ten days at florida with his scholars in all thirtyfive and then ensued a very tedious passage to the banks islands for the vessel had been crippled by the gale off norfolk island and could not be pressed little canvas was carried and the weather was unfavourable  however on september 6 mota was safely reached and great was the joy warm the welcome of the natives who eagerly assisted in unloading the vessel through storms of rain and surf  the old station house was in entire decay but the orange and lemon trees were thirty feet high though only the latter in bearing  the new village it was agreed should bear the name of kohimarama after the old home in new zealand meaning in maori focus of light  after landing the goats the bishop mr atkin and five more crossed to valua  they were warmly welcomed at ara where their long absence had made the natives fancy they must all be dead  the parents of henry lydia and edwin were the first to approach the boat eager to hear of their children left in norfolk island and the mother walked up the beach with her arm round mr atkins neck  but here it appeared that the vessels of the labour traffic had come to obtain people to work in the cotton plantations in queensland and that they had already begun to invite them in the name of the bishop whose absence they accounted for by saying his ship had been wrecked he had broken his leg he had gone to england and sent them to fetch natives to him  no force had been used as yet but there was evident dread of them and one vessel had a mota man on board who persuaded the people to go to sydney  about a hundred natives had been taken from the islands of valua ara and matlavo and from bligh island twentythree were just gone but motas inaccessibility had apparently protected it  it will be remembered that it has a high fortification of coral all round the beach with but one inconvenient entrance and that the people are little apt to resort to canoes this really has hitherto seemed a special providence for this nucleus of christianity  they spent the night at ara making a fire on the sandy beach where they boiled their chocolate and made gravy of some extract of meat to season their yam and supped in public by firelight reclining upon mats  afterwards they went up to the ogamal or barrack tent it was not an inviting bedchamber being so low that they could only kneel upright in it and so smoky that stephen remarked we shall be cooked ourselves if we stay here proving an advance in civilisation  one of the private houses was equally unattractive and the party slept on the beach  the next morning they started to walk round the island taking two cork beds a portmanteau and a basket of provisions stopping wherever a few people were found but it was a thinly peopled place and the loss of the men carried off was sensibly felt  one village had had a fight with a boats crew from sydney  they made no secret of it saying that they would not have their men taken away and they had been sharp enough to pour water into the guns before provoking the quarrel  further on there was a closer population where the bishop was enthusiastically welcomed and an ogamal was found making a good shelter for the night  then they returned to ara where mr atkin notes in the very centre of the island a curious rock about 200 feet high and on the top 20 or 30 feet from the nearest visible soil a sheoak stump and two more green and flourishing a little below  the rock was of black scoriae too hot in the middle of the day to sit upon and near it was a pool of water  such water so rotten  the water used by the visitors had been brought from auckland  the natives do not trouble water much i dont think they ever drink it and they certainly dont look as if they ever washed  on the following day they recrossed to vanua lava where they spent a quiet calm sunday in the vessel landing in the afternoon to see fisher youngs grave which they found well kept and covered with a pretty blue creeper  the next sunday they spent at kohimarama beginning with celebration at 730 am and in the afternoon making the circuit of the island about ten miles  in one place mr atkin bent over the edge of the natural sea wall and saw the sea breaking 150 or 200 feet below  after a fortnight spent in this manner he and the other two clergymen carried off their melanesians to norfolk island leaving the bishop to be fetched away in a months time  here is the letter written during his solitude   kohimarama mota island september 23 1869  my dearest joan and fanhere i am sitting in a most comfortable house in our new kohimarama for so the melanesians determine to call our station in mota  the house is 48 feet by 18 with a 9foot verandah on two sides  it has one large room a partition at each end one of which is subdivided into two small sleeping rooms for george and his wife and charles and his wife  there is no ceiling so that we have the full advantage of the height of the house and plenty of ventilation as the space beyond where the roof comes down upon the wall plates is left open  the verandah is a grand lounging place very commodious for school also when other classes fill the large room and a delightful place to sit or lie about on in this genial warm climate  these bright moonlight nights are indeed delicious  the mosquito gives no trouble here to speak of  the cocoanut trees the breadfruit trees yam gardens and many kinds of native trees and shrubs are all around us the fine wooded hill of mota shows well over the house  the breeze always plays round it and though it is very hot it is only when the wind comes from the north and northwest as in the midsummer that the heat is of an oppressive and sickly nature  about twenty lads and young men live here and about forty attend daily school but i think there is every indication of all mota sending its young people here as soon as we have our crops of yams c c to provide sufficient food  improved native huts will i think soon be built over our little estate here  many girls i hope to take to norfolk island  they could hardly be brought together with safety to this place yet  the parents see and admit this and consent to my taking them  i tell them that their sons will not marry ignorant heathen girls their sons i mean who have been and are still with us that all the young fellows growing up at kohimarama must have educated wives provided for them and that i must therefore take away many young girls with me to norfolk island  the fashion here is to buy at an early age young girls for their sons though occasionally a girl may be found not already betrothed but almost grown up  i now say i want to train up wives for my sons and the fashion of the place allows of my buying or appropriating them  you would be amused to see me engaged in this matchmaking  it is all the same a very important matter for clearly it is the best way to secure as i trust the introduction of christian family life among these people  george and i are satisfied that things are really very promising here  of course much old heathen ignorance and much that is very wrong will long survive  so you recollect perhaps old joe great uncle edwards coachman declaring that c s as a witch and there is little proof of practical christianity in the morals of our peasants of the west and of wales especially  it is not that one should acquiesce in what is wrong here but one ought not to be surprised at it  public opinion the constraint of law hereditary notions are more effective in preventing the outbreak of evil passions into criminal acts in very many cases and districts in england  now these restraints are indeed indirect consequences of christianity but do not imply any religion in the individuals who are influenced by them  these restraints dont exist here  if they did i think these mota people now would live just as orderly decent lives as average english folk  christianity would not be a vigorous power in the one case or in the other  exceptional cases would occur here and there  if i am asked for proofs of the conversion of this people i should say conversion from what to what and then i should say ask any close observer in england about the commercial and social morality existing in not only the most ignorant ranks of society how much is merely formal and therefore perhaps actually detrimental to a true spirit of religion  here you dont find much that you associate with religion in england in the external observances of it but there are not a few ignorant people i am not speaking of our trained scholars who are giving up their old habits adopting new ways accepting a stricter mode of life foregoing advantages of one kind and another because they believe that this good news this gospel is true and because the simple truths of christianity are thank god finding some entrance into their hearts  i dread the imposition from without of some formal compliances with the externals of religion while i know that the meaning and spirit of them cannot as yet be understood  can there be conceived anything more formal more mischievous than inculcating a rigid sabbatarian view of the lords day upon a people who dont know anything about the cross and the resurrection  time enough to talk about the observance when the people have some knowledge of the vital living truth of a spiritual religion  so about clothing  if i tried to do it i think i could make the people here buy certainly accept and wear clothing  with what result at present that they would think that wearing a yard of unbleached calico was a real evidence of the reception of the new teaching  such things are in this stage of mission work actually hurtful the mind naturally takes in and accepts the easy outward form and by such treatment you actually encourage it to do so and to save itself the trouble of thinking out the real meaning and teaching which must of course be addressed to the spirit  these outward things all follow as a matter of course after a time as consequences of the new power and light felt in the soul but they may be so spoken of as to become substitutes for the true spiritual life and train up a people in hypocrisy  i beg your pardon really for parading all these truisms  throw it in the fire  i dont for a moment mean or think that religion is to be taught by mere prudence and common sense  but a spiritual religion is imperilled the moment that you insist upon an unspiritual people observing outward forms which are to them the essence of the new teaching  anything better than turning heathens into pharisees what did our lord call the proselytes of the pharisee and the scribe  and while i see and love the beauty of the outward form when it is known and felt to be no more than the shrine of the inward spiritual power while i know that for highly advanced christians or for persons trained in accurate habits of thought all that beauty of holiness is needful yet i think i see that the divine wisdom of the gospel would guard the teacher against presenting the formal side of religion to the untaught and ignorant convert  god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth is the great lesson for the heathen mind chained down as it is to things of sense  he that hateth his brother is a murderer not the outward act but the inward motive justifies or condemns the man  every day convinces me more and more of the need of a different mode of teaching than that usually adopted for imperfectly taught people  how many of your ordinary parishioners even understand the simple meaning of the prayerbook nay of their wellknown as they think gospel miracles and parables  who teaches in ordinary parishes the christian use of the psalms  who puts simply before peasant and stonecutter the jew and his religion and what he and it were intended to be and the real error and sin and failurethe true nature of prophecy the progressive teaching of the bible never in any age compromising truth but never ignoring the state so often the unreceptive state of those to whom the truth must therefore be presented partially and in a manner adapted to rude and unspiritual natures  what an amount of preparatory teaching is needed  what labour must be spent in struggling to bring forth things new and old and present things simply before the indolent unthinking vacant mind  how much need there is of a more special training of the clergy even now  many men are striving nobly to do all this  but think of the rubbish that most of us chuck lazily out of our minds twice a week without method or order  it is such downright hard work to teach well  oh how weary it makes me to try  i feel as if i were at once aware of what should be attempted and yet quite unable to do it  st michaels dayafter an affectionate review of most of his relations at homewhen the bishop and mrs selwyn pressed me a good deal to go with them to england it obliged me a little to analyse my feelings  you wont suspect me of any want of longing to see you when i say that it never was a doubtful matter to me for five minutes  i saw nothing to make me wish to go to england in comparison with the crowd of reasons for not doing so  they good people thought it would be rest and refreshment to me  little they know how a man so unlike them takes his rest  i am getting it here hundreds of miles out of reach of any white man or woman free from what is to me the bother of society  i am not defending myself but it is true that to me it is a bore the very opposite of rest to be in society  i like a good talk with sir william martin above anything but i declare that even that is dearly purchased by the other accompaniments of society  and i could not spend a quiet month with you at weston  i should have people calling the greatest of all nuisances except that of having to go out to dinner  i should have to preach and perhaps to go to meetings all in the way of my business but not tending to promote rest  seriously i am very well now looking i am sure and feeling stronger and stouter than i was in new zealand in the winter  so dont fret yourself about me and dont think that i shouldnt dearly love to chat awhile with you  what an idle lazy letter  you see i am taking my rest with you writing without effort  he was looking well  kohimarama must be more healthily situated than the first station for all his three visits there were beneficial to him and there seems to have been none of the tendency to ague and low fever which had been the trouble of the first abode  mr codrington and mr bice came back in the schooner early in october and were landed at mota while the bishop went for a cruise in the new hebrides but the lateness of the season and the state of the vessel made it a short one and he soon came back with thirty five boys  meanwhile a small harmonium which was to be left with the christian settlement had caused such an excitement that mr bice was nearly squeezed to death by the crowds that came to hear it he played nearly all day to successive throngs of men but when the women arrived they made such a clatter that he was fain to close the instrument  unbleached calico clothing had been made for such of the young ladies as were to be taken on board for norfolk island cut out by the bishop and made up by robert william and benjamin his scholars and mr codrington says it was an odd sight to see the bishop on the beach with the group of girls round him and a number of garments over his arm  as each bride was brought by her friends she was clothed and added to the group  esthetically clothes were no improvement  a melanesian clothed the bishop observes never looks well there is almost always a stiff shabbygenteel look  a good specimen not disfigured by sores and ulcers the wellshaped form the rich warm colour of the skin and the easy graceful play of every limb unhurt by shoe or tight fitting dress the flower stuck naturally into the hair c make them look pleasant enough to my eye  you see in picture bibles figures draped as i could wish the melanesians to be clothed  to continue mr codringtons recollections of this stay in mota  i remember noticing how different his manner was from what was common at home  his eyes were cast all about him keeping a sharp lookout and all his movements and tones were quick and decisive in that steaming climate and those narrow paths he walked faster than was at all agreeable to his companions and was dressed moreover in a woollen coat and waistcoat all the time  in fact he thoroughly enjoyed the heat though no doubt it was weakening him he liked the food which gave him no trouble at all to eat and he liked the natives  he felt of course that he was doing his work all the while but the expression of his countenance was very different while sitting with a party of men over their food at mota and when sitting with a party in norfolk island  the contrast struck me very much between his recluse studious life there and his very active one at mota with almost no leisure to read and very little to write and with an abundance of society which was a pleasure instead of a burthen  i think that the alert and decisive tone and habit which was so conspicuous in the islands and came out whenever he was roused was not natural to his disposition but had been acquired in early years in a public school and faded down in the quiet routine of st barnabas and was recalled as occasion required with more effort as time went on  no doubt his habitual gentleness made his occasional severity more felt but at mota his capacity for scolding was held in respect  i was told when i was last there that i was no good for i did not know how to scold but that the bishop perfectly well understood how to do it  words certainly would never fail him in twenty languages to express his indignation but how seldom among his own scholars had he to do it in one  this voyage is best summed up in the ensuing letter to one of the norfolk relations   southern cross schooner 20 miles east of star island  my dear cousinwe are drawing near the end of a rather long cruise as i trust in safety  we left norfolk island on the 24th june and we hope to reach it in about ten days  we should have moved about in less time but for the crippled state of the schooner she fell in with a heavy gale off norfolk island about june 20th 23rd and we have been obliged to be very careful of our spars which were much strained  indeed we still need a new mainmast main boom and gaff a main topmast foretopmast and probably new wire rigging besides repairs of other kinds and possibly new coppering  thank god the voyage has been so far safe and on the whole prosperous we sailed first of all to the banks islands only dropping two lads at ambrym island on our way  we spent a week or more at mota while the vessel was being overhauled at the harbour in vanua lava island seven miles from mota  it was a great relief to us to get the house for the station at mota out of the vessel the weight of timber c was too much for a vessel not built for carrying freight  after a few days we left mr palmer george sarawia and others at mota busily engaged in putting up the house a very serious matter for us as you may suppose  our party was made up of mr atkin mr brooke and two mota volunteers for boat work and divers solomon islanders  we were absent from mota about seven years during which time we visited santa cruz and many of the solomon isles  mr atkin spent three weeks in one of the isles and mr brooke in another and we had more than thirty natives of the solomon islands on board including old scholars when we left ulava the last island of the solomon group at which we called  mr palmer mr atkin and mr brooke went on to norfolk island the whole number of melanesians on board being sixtytwo  i had spent a very happy month at mota when the vessel returned from norfolk island both with mr codrington and mr bice on board bringing those of the melanesians nearly thirty in all who chose to stay on norfolk island  then followed a fortnights cruise in the new hebrides and now with exactly fifty melanesians on board from divers islands we are on our way to norfolk island  we have fourteen girls two married on board and there are ten already at norfolk island  this is an unusual number but the people understand that the young men and lads who have been with us for some time who are baptized and accustomed to decent orderly ways are not going to marry heathen wild girls so they give up these young ones to be taught and qualify to become fit wives for our rapidly increasing party of young men  it is quite clear that we must aim at exhibiting by gods blessing christian family life in the islands and this can only be done by training up young men and women  three married couples all communicants live now at kohimarama the station at mota  george has two children benjamin one  it is already a small specimen of a little christian community and it must be reinforced year by year by accessions of new couples of christian men and women  about twenty lads live at the station and about forty more come daily to school  it may grow soon into a real working school from which the most intelligent and best conducted boys may be taken to norfolk island for a more complete education  i am hopeful about a real improvement in mota and elsewhere  but a new difficulty has lately been caused by the traders from sydney and elsewhere who have taken many people to work in the plantations at brisbane mimea new caledonia and the fiji islands actual kidnapping and this is a sad hindrance to us  i know of no case of actual violence in the banks islands but in every case they took people away under false pretences asserting that the bishop is ill and cant come he has sent us to bring you to him  the bishop is in sydney he broke his leg getting into his boat and has sent us to take you to him c c  in many of these places some of our old scholars are found who speak a little english and the traders communicated with them  in most places where any of our young people happened to be on shore they warned their companions against these men but not always with success  hindrances there must be always in the way of all attempts to do some good  but this is a sad business and very discreditable to the persons employed in it and the government which sanctions it for they must know that they cannot control the masters of the vessels engaged in the trade they may pass laws as to the treatment the natives are to receive on the plantations as to food pay c the time of service the date of their being taken home but they know that the whole thing is dishonest  the natives dont intend or know anything about any service or labour they dont know that they will have to work hard and any regular steady work is hard work to south sea islanders  they are brought away under false pretences else why tell lies to induce them to go on board  i dare say that many young fellows go on board without much persuasion  many causes may be at work to induce them to do so eg sickness in the island quarrels love of excitement spirit of enterprise c but if they knew what they were taken for i dont think they would go  november 2ndin sight of norfolk island  all well on board  november 6thyesterday we all landed safely and found our whole party quite well  our new hall is finished and in good time to receive 134 melanesians  before the full accumulation of letters arrived from auckland a report by a passing ship from sydney stirred the hermit bishop deeply and elicited the following warm congratulation   norfolk island november 17 1869  my dear dr  moberlysince my returna fortnight sincefrom the islands a rumour has reached us brought hither in a small trader that the bishop of winchester has resigned his see and that you are his successor  it is almost too good to be true  i am waiting with great anxiety for a vessel expected soon i have had no english news since letters of april  but in all seriousness private news is of small moment compared with the news of what is to become of that great diocese  and especially now when almost all the south of england is so sadly in want of officers to command the churchs army exeter bath and wells salisbury chichester very old and till now if this rumour be true winchester from old age or sickness almost if not quite unfit for work  if indeed i hear that gods providence has placed you in charge of that great see it will give a different hue to the prospect dreary enough i confess to me though i hope i am mistaken in my gloomy forebodings of the results of all those many dioceses being so long without active bishops salisbury of course i except and chichester is a small diocese comparatively and the good bishop i know works up to the maximum of his age and strength  but if this be a true rumour and i do sincerely trust and pray that it may be so indeed it will give hope and courage and fresh life and power to many and many a fainting soul  if i may presume to say so it is as mrs selwyn wrote to me when he was appointed to lichfield a solemn and anxious thing to undertake a great charge on the top of such great expectations  but already there is one out here anyhow who feels cheered and strengthened by the mere hope that this story is true and everywhere many anxious men and women will lift up their hearts to god in thankfulness and in earnest prayers that you may indeed do a great work to his glory and to the good of his church in a new and even greater sphere of usefulness  no doubt much of my thoughts and apprehensions about the religious and social state of england is very erroneous  i have but little time for reading about what is going on and though i have the blessing of codringtons good sense and ability yet i should like to have more persons to learn from on such matters  i am willing and anxious to believe that i am not cheerful and faithful enough to see the bright side as clearly as i ought your letters have always been a very great help to me not only a great pleasure much more than a pleasure  i felt that i accepted occasionally even that i had anticipated your remarks on the questions of the day the conduct of parties and public men books c  it has been a great thing for me to have my thoughts guided or corrected in this way  your last present to me was your volume of bampton lectures of which i need not say how both the subject and the mode of treating it make them especially valuable just now  and there is a strong personal feeling about the work and writings of one where the public man is also the private friend which gives a special zest to the enjoyment of reading a work of this kind  certainly it is one of the many blessings of my life that i should somehow have been allowed to grow into this degree of intimacy with you whom i have always known by name though i dont remember ever to have seen you  i think i first as a child became familiar with your name through good miss rennell whom i dare say you remember the old deans daughter  what a joy this would have been to dear mr and mrs keble what a joy it is to charlotte yonge and there may be others close to winchester whose lives have been closely bound tip with yours  but humanly speaking the thing is to have bishops who can command the respect and love and dutiful obedience of their clergy and laity alike  one wants men who by solid learning and by acquaintance too with modern modes of criticism and speculation by scholarship force of character largeness of mind as well as by their goodness can secure respect and exercise authority  it is the lawlessness of men that one deplores the presumption of individual priests striking out for themselves unauthorised ways of managing their parishes and officiating in their churches  and if i may dare to touch on such a subject is there not a mode of speaking and writing on the holy eucharist prevalent among some men now which has no parallel in the church of england except it may be in some of the nonjurors and which does not express the church of englands mind which is not the language of pearson and jackson and waterland and hooker no nor of bull and andrewes and taylor c  i know very little of such thingsvery little indeed  but it is oftentimes a sad grief to me that i cannot accept some of the reasonings and opinions of dear mr keble in his book on eucharistic adoration  i know that i have no right to expect to see things as such a man saw them that most probably the instinctive power of discerning truththe reward of a holy life from early childhoodguided him where men without such power feel all astray  but yet there is something about the book which may be quite right and true but does not to me quite savour of the healthy sound theology of the church of england the fragrance is rather that of an exotic plant here and there i meanthough i feel angry with myself for daring to think this and to say it to you who can understand him  november 27thi leave this as i wrote it though now i know from our mails which have come to us that you are bishop of salisbury not of winchester  i hardly stop to think whether it is winchester or salisbury so great is my thankfulness and joy at the report being substantially true  though it did seem that winchester was a natural sphere for you i cant help feeling that at salisbury you can do dv what perhaps scarcely any one else could do  and now i rejoice that you have had the opportunity of speaking with no uncertain sound in your bampton lectures  anyone can tell what the bishop of salisbury holds on the great questions of church doctrine and church government  the diocese knows already its bishop not only by many former but by his latest book  surely you will have the confidence of all churchmen and be blessed to do a great work for the glory of god and the edification of the church  and now my dear bishop of salisbury you will excuse my writing on so freely too freely i fear  i do like to think of you in that most perfect of cathedrals  i hope and trust that you will have ere long right good fellowworkers in exeter winton and bath and wells  but in the colonies you have a congeries of men from all countries and with every variety of creed jumbled up together with nothing whatever to hold them togetherno reverenceno thoughts of the old parish church c  they are restless worldly people to a great extent thinking of getting on making money  to such men the very idea of the church as a divine institution the mystical body of the lord on which all graces are bestowed and through whose ministrations men are trained in holiness and truth is wholly unknown  the personal religion of many a man is sincere his position and duty as a churchman he has never thought about  i wish the clergy would master that part at all events of your lectures which deals with this great fundamental point and then as they have opportunity teach it to their people  and byandby through the collective life of the church in its synods c many will come to see it we may hope  i think that i may give you a cheering account of ourselves  i was nineteen weeks in the islandsmet with no adventures worth mentioning only one little affair which was rather critical for a few minutes but ended very welland in some of the solomon islands made more way than heretofore with the people  we have 134 melanesians here and a baby  george sarawia and his wife and two children and two other married couplesall communicantsare at mota in a nice place with some twentytwo lads boarding with them and about thirty more coming to daily school  the vessel was much knocked about in a violent gale in june off norfolk island and we had to handle her very carefully  the whole voyage was made with a mainmast badly sprung and fore topmast very shaky  mr tilly was very watchful over the spars and though we had a large share of squally weather and for some days at different times were becalmed in a heavy swell the most trying of all situations to the gear of a vessel yet thank god all went well and i have heard of the schooner safe in auckland harbour  about forty of our melanesians here are solomon islanders from seven different islands a few came from the new hebrides the rest from the banks islands  we are already pretty well settled down to our work  indeed it took only a day or two to get to work our old scholars are such great helpers to us  we number six clergymen here g sarawia being at mota  ten or twelve of the sixth form are teachers  if you care to hear more i must refer you to a letter just written to miss yonge  but it is not easy to write details about 134 young people  their temptations are very great when they return to their islands every inducement to profligacy c is held out to them  one of our young baptized lads fell into sinful ways and is not now with us  he was not one of whom we had great expectations though we trusted that he would go on steadily  many others thank god were kept pure and truthful in the midst of it all refusing even to sleep one night away from our little hut and in some cases refusing even to leave the schooner  no i will wait till i am married said two lads to me who were married here to christian girls on november 24th and then go ashore for a time with my young wife  i dont think i should yield but i dont want to put myself in the way of such temptations  and so when i had naturally expected that they would take their six weeks holiday on shore while the southern cross went from mota to norfolk island and back during my stay at mota they remained on board rejoining me as they were two of my boating crew for the new hebrides trip  this was very comforting  and when i married three couples on november 24th and knew that they were pure youths and girls alike from the great sin of heathenism you can well think that my heart was very full of thankfulness and hope  i must end my long letter  how will you find time to read it send me some day a photograph of your beautiful cathedral  yours very faithfully  j c patteson   before the letter to which bishop moberly is referred mr codring tons bit about the weddings seems appropriate  these wedding days were great festivals especially before many had been seen  the chapel was dressed with flowers the wedding party in as new and cheerful attire as could be procured the english marriage service translated into mota  we make rings out of sixpences or threepenny bits  the place before is full of the sound of the hammer tapping the silver on the marlingspike  the wedding ceremony is performed with as much solemnity as possible all the school present in their new clothes and with flowers in their hair  there is even a kind of processional psalm as the wedding party enters the chapel there is of course a holiday and after the service they all go off taking with them the pig that has been killed for the feast  an enormous quantity of plum pudding awaits them when in the evening they come back to prayers and supper  rounds of hearty cheers led off by the bishop used to complete the day  weddings of this kind between old scholars christened confirmed and trustworthy represented much anxiety and much teaching and expense but they promise so much and that so near of what has been worked for that they have brought with them extraordinary pleasure and satisfaction   norfolk island november 24 1869  my dear cousintoday we married three young couples the bridegrooms  robert pantatun william pasvorang and marsden sawa who have been many years with us and are all communicants the brides emily milerauwe lydia lastitia and rhoda titrakrauwe who were baptized a year ago  the chapel was very prettily dressed up with lilies and many other flowers  the bridegrooms wore white trousers shirts c the brides wore pretty simple dresses and flowers in their hair  we crowded as many persons as possible into our little chapel  mr nobbs and some ten or twelve of our pitcairn friends were all the visitors that we could manage to make room for  great festivities followed a large pig was killed yesterday and eaten today and mr palmer had manufactured puddings without end a new kind of food to many of the present set of scholars but highly appreciated by most of them  then followed in the evening native dances and songs and a supper to end with with cheers for the brides and bridegrooms  there are now six married couples here three more at mota and one or two more weddings will take place soon  very fortunately a vessel came from auckland only three or four days ago the first since the southern cross in june it brought not only five mails for us english folk but endless packages and boxes for the mission ordered by us long ago stores clothing c  we had all ordered more or less in the way of presents for scholars and though we keep most of these treasures for christmas gifts yet some are distributed now  these presents are for the most part really good things  it is quite useless for kind friends to send presents to melanesians as they would do to an english lad or girl  to begin with most of our scholars are grown up and are more like english young people of twenty or eighteen years old than like boys and girls and not a few are older still and secondly no melanesian old or young cares a rush about a toy  they boys and girls men and women take a practical view of a present and are the very reverse of sentimental about it though they really do like a photograph of a friend  but a mere brummagem article that wont stand wear is quite valueless in their eyes  whatever is given them cheap or dear is estimated according to its usefulness and whatever is given though it may cost but a shilling must be good of its kind  for example a roughhandled single bladed knife bought for a shilling they fully appreciate but a knife with halfadozen blades bought for eighteenpence they would almost throw away  and so about everything else  i mention this as a hint to kind friends  they do like to hear that people think of them and are kind to them but they dont understand why useless things should be sent from the other end of the world when they could buy much better things with their own money out of the mission store here  they are very fond of anything in the way of notebooks 8vo and 12mo sizes good paper writingcases which must be good if given at all patent safety inkstandsthese things are useful on board ship and can be carried to the islands and brought back again safely workbaskets or boxes for the girls with good serviceable needles pins thread scissors thimbles tapes c  c not a plaything here we can buy for them or keep in the store for them to buy many things that are much too bulky to send from a distance the freight would be ruinous  the southern cross brings them usually to us such things i mean as good carpetbags from 5s to 10s stout tin boxes with locks and keys axes tools straw hats saucepans good strong stuff tweed or moleskin for trousers and shirts which they cut out and make up for themselves quite understanding the inferior character of slop work good flannel for undershirts or for making up into crimean shirts nottingham drill good towelling huckaback c ought to be worth while to send out and if bought in large quantities at the manufacturers it would pay us to get it in england especially if the said manufacturer reduced the price a little in consequence of the use to be made of his goods  dull small blue beads are always useful ditto red  bright glittering ones are no use few melanesians would take them as a gift  some islanders like large beads as big or bigger than boys marbles  these are some hints to any kind people who may wish to contribute in kind rather than in money  mr codrington has given these fellows a great taste for gardening much of their spare hours which are not many are spent in digging up fencing in and preparing little pieces of land close about the station two or three lads generally making up a party and frequently the party consists of lads and young men from different islands  then they have presents of seeds cuttings bulbs c from mr codrington chiefly and mrs palmer and others contribute some of these little gardens are really very nicely laid out in good taste and well looked after  they have an eye to the practically useful here too as every garden has its stock of bananas and here and there we see the sugarcane too  from 330 pm to 6 pm is the play time although they do not all have this time to themselves  for three lads must milk from 5 to 6 one or two must drive in the cows seven or eight are in the kitchen three or four must wash the horses one must drive the sheep into the fold all but the milkers have only their one week of these diverse occupations  there are about twelve head cooks who choose their helpers the whole school minus the milkers and two or three overlookers being included and so the cooking work comes only once in twelve weeks  the cooks of the one week drive up the cows and water the horses the next week and then there is no extra work that is nothing but the regular daily work from 930 am after school to 1 pm  wednesday is a halfholiday saturday a whole holiday  there are six milkers one of whom is responsible for the whole  one receives 2s 0d per week his chief mate 1s 6d and the other four 1s each  they take it in turns three each week  this is the hardest work in one sense it brings them in from their play and fishing or gardening c and so they are paid for it  we do not approve of the white man being paid for everything and the melanesian being expected to work habitually extra hours for nothing there are many other little extra occupations for which we take care that those engaged in them shall have some reward and as a matter of fact a good deal of money finds its way into the hands of the storekeeper and a very fair amount of 3d 4d and 6d pieces may be seen every sunday in the offertory bason  perhaps i should say that we have seldom seen here any indications of these melanesians expecting money or presents but we want to destroy the idea in their minds of their being fags by nature and to help them to have some proper selfrespect and independence of character  we see very little in them to make us apprehensive of their being covetous or stingy and indisposed to give service freely  school hours 8920 2330 singing 78 pm chapel 645 am 630 pm  of the 134 melanesians besides the baby ten are teachers and with their help we get on very fairly  there are sixteen of us teachers in all so that the classes are not too large  mr codrington takes at present the elder banks islanders mr palmer the next class and mr bice the youngest set of boys from the same group  mr atkin takes the southern solomon islanders and mr brooke those from the northern parts of the same group  i have been taking some lepers islanders and maiwo or aurora islanders as new comers and other classes occasionally  out of so many we shall weed out a good number no doubt  at present we dont condemn any as hopelessly dull but it will not be worth while to spend much time upon lads who in five months must go home for good and some such there must be we cannot attempt to teach all dull and clever alike  we must make selections and in so doing often i dare say make mistakes  but what can we do  our new hall is a great success  we had all the framework sawn out here it is solid almost massive work very unlike the flimsy wooden buildings that are run up in a week or two in most colonial villages it is so large that our party of 145 plus 9 english sit in the aisles without occupying any part of the middle of the room  this gives us ample accommodation for the present  indeed we might increase our numbers to 200 without any more buildings being necessary  the married people give the most trouble in this respect as they have their separate rooms and four or five married couples take up more room than three times the number of single folk however we have here room for all i am thankful to say though we must build again if more of our young people take it into their heads to be married  they pass on quickly however when married into the next stage the life in their own islands and so they leave their quarters here for some successors  i hope you can understand this attempt at a description but i never could write properly about such things and never shall do so i suppose  i like the life i know a great deal better than i can write about it  indeed it is a quiet restful life here comparatively  some anxieties always of course but as compared with the distractions of new zealand life it is pleasant indeed  we have very few interruptions here to the regular employment of our time and need not waste any of it in visits or small talk which seems to be a necessary though most wearisome part of civilised life  your namesake goes on well not a clever girl but very steady and good her sister and brother are here the sisters are much alike in character and ability the brother is sharper  you will i know specially think of george sarawia and his wife sarah at mota with charles and ellen benjamin and marion  they are all communicants but the temptations which surround them are very great and early familiarity with heathen practices and modes of thought may yet deaden the conscience to the quick apprehension of the first approaches of sin  they do indeed need the earnest prayers of all  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   how many sons who have lost a mother at fifteen or sixteen dwell on the thought like this affectionate spirit twentyseven years later   advent sunday november 20 1869  it is a solemn thing to begin a new year on the anniversary of our dear mothers death  i often think whether she would approve of this or that opinion action c  wrights painting is pleasant to look upon  i stand in a corner of my room at fathers old mahogany desk her picture and his the large framed photographs from richmonds drawing and a good photograph of the bishop are just above  i wish you could see my room  i write now on december 3 a bright summer day but my room with its deep verandah is cool and shady  it is true that i refuse carpet and curtains  they only hold dust and make the room fusty  but the whole room is filled with books and those pictures and the lionardo da vinci over the fireplace and mr boxalls photograph over it and his drawing visavis to it at the other end of the room and by my window a splendid gloxinia with fine full flowers out in a very pretty porcelain pot both mr codringtons gift  on another glass stand also his present a mota flower imported here a brilliant scarlet hibiscus and blossoms of my creepers and bignonia most beautiful  so fresh and pretty  the steps of the verandah are a mass of honeysuckle  the stephanotis with the beautiful scented white flowers and glossy leaves covers one of the posts  how pleasant it is  everyone is kind all are well all are going on well just now  such are missionary comforts where the hardships are i have not yet discovered  your chain dear joan is round my neck and the locket mammas in which you fan put the hair of you five hangs on it  i am dipping my pen into the old silver inkstand which used to be in the front drawingroom  every morning at about 5 am  i have a cup of tea or coffee and use grandmamma coleridges oldfashioned silver creamjug and the cup and saucer which augusta sent out years ago my old christening spoon and the old silver teapot and salver very grand but i like the old things  this day fortnight dv i ordain j atkin and c h brooke priests  i have no time to answer your april and september letters  i rejoice with all my heart to hear of dr moberlys appointment  what a joyful event for charlotte yonge  that child pena sent me shairps dear old shairp book which i wanted  i must write to sophy as soon as i can  you will forgive if i have seemed to be or really have been unmindful of your sorrows and anxieties  sometimes i think i am in too great a whirl to think long enough to realise and enter into all your doings  your loving brother  j c p   the intended letter to mrs martyn was soon written  the death there referred to was that of mrs william coleridge widow of the bishop of barbadoes   norfolk island december 14 1869  my dear sophyi should be specially thinking of you as christmas draws nigh with its blessed thoughts and hopes and the st stephens memories in any case i should be thinking of you  but now i have lately received your long loving letter of last eastertide partly written in bed  then your dear childs illness makes me think greatly and how lovingly of you three of the three generations  lastly i hear of dear aunt williams death  you know that i had a very great affection for her and i feel that this is a great blow probably to you all though dear aunty as i have noticed in all old persons especially when good as well as old takes this quietly i dare say the feeling must be well i shall soon meet her again a few short days only remain  i suppose that you with your quarter of a centurys widowhood still feel as if the waiting time was all sanctified by the thought of the reunion  oh what a thought it is too much almost to think that by his wonderful mercy one may hope to be with them all and for ever to behold the faces of apostles and apostolic men and prophets and saints holy men and women and as if this were not enough to see him as he is in his essential perfections and to know him  one cant sustain the effort of such a thought which shows how great a change must pass on one before the great consummation  well the more one can think of dear father and mother and dear dear uncle james and uncle frank and cousin george and uncle and aunt william others too uncles and aunts and your dear fanny and your husband though it would be untrue to say i knew him taken so earlythe more one thinks of them all the better  and i have sophy so many very different ones to think of edwin and fisher and so many melanesians taken away in the very first earnestness and simplicity of a new converts faith  how many have died in my armsgod be thankedin good hope  if by his great mercy there be a place for me there i feel persuaded that i shall there find many of those dear lads whom indeed i think of with a full heart full of affection and thankfulness  i have been reading the memoir of mr keble of course with extreme interest  it is all about events and chiefly about persons that one has heard about or even known  i think we get a little autobiography of our dear uncle john in it too for which i dont like it the less  there are passages as against going to borne which i am glad to see in print they are wanted now again i fear  i am glad you like moberlys bampton lectures  his book on the great forty days his best book  after all has the germ of it all  i am so thankful for his appointment to salisbury  i dare say you know that he is kind enough to write to me occasionally and he sends me his books one of the greatest of the indirect blessings of being known to mr keble  i do very little in the way of reading save that i get a quiet hour for hebrew 56 am and i do read some theology in one sense it is easier reading to me than other books history poetry because though i dont know much about it i know nothing about them  my pleasure would be if with you in talking over such little insight as i may have received into the wondrous harmony and symmetry of the whole bible by tolerably close examination of the text of the greek and to some extent of the hebrew  the way in which a peculiar word brings a whole passage or argument en rapport with a train of historical associations or previous statements is wonderful eg the verb of which moses is formed occurs only in exodus ii 10 2 samuel xxii 17 psalm xviii 16  see how the magnificent description of the passage of the red sea in psalm xviii  is connected with moses by this one word  these undesigned coincidences and surely proofs of inspiration are innumerable  i do delight in it only i want more help far more  we have great advantages in this generation  dear uncle james had no commentary one might almost say on old testament or new testament  ellicott wordsworth and alford on the new testament were not in existence and the germans used with discrimination are great helps  an orthodox lutheran one delitzsch of whom liddon wrote that dr pusey thinks highly of his hebrew scholarship helps me much in isaiah he has sucked all the best part out of vitringas enormous book and added much minute and i am told correct criticism  and how grand it is  this morningit is now 615 ami have been reading part of that wonderful chapter xxvi  it strikes me that the way to teach a class or a congregation is to bring out the doctrine from the very words of scripture carefully critically examined and explained  only think sophy of the vague desultory way in which we all more or less read and we have accepted a phraseology without enquiring to a great extent and use words to which we attach no definite meaning  few in the congregation could draw out in clear words what they mean when they talk of faith justification regeneration conversion c  c  all language denoting ideas and thoughts is transferred to the region of the mind from denoting at first only external objects and sensations this is in accordance with the mystery of all the union of mind and matterwhich no pagan philosopher could comprehendthe extreme difficulty of solving which caused dualism and asceticism on the one hand and neglect of all bodily discipline on the other  mind and matter must be antagonistic the work of different beings man must get rid of his material part to arrive at his true end and perfection  so some said mortify worry the body which is essentially and inherently evil  no said others the sins of the body dont hurt the mind the two things are distinct dont react on one another  st paul deals with all this in the colossians  the incarnation is the solution or the culmination of the mystery  what a prose but i meant that people so often use words as if the use of a word was equivalent to the knowledge of the thought which in the mind of an accurate thinker accompanies the utterance of the word  i should think that threefourths of what we clergymen say is unintelligible to the mass of the congregation  we assume an acquaintance with the bible and prayerbook thought and a knowledge of the meaning of words which few alas possess  we must begin then with the little ones as far as i see all children are apt to fail at the point when they ought to be passing from merely employing the memory in learning by heart eg the catechism by exercising the reasoning and thinking faculty  well now you have said that very well now let us think what it means  how well dr pusey says in his sermons not altogether intentional deliberate vice but thoughtlessness is destroying souls  i run on at random dear sophy hoping to give you one and a half hours occupation on a sick bed or couch and because as you say this is the only converse we are likely to have on earth  i think i am too exclusively fond of this reading very little else interests me  i take up a theological book as a recreation which is perhaps hardly reverent and may narrow the mind but even church history is not very attractive to me  i like jackson and hooker and some of the moderns of whom i read a good many and i lose a good deal of time in diving into things too deep by half for me while i forget or dont learn simple things  all this modern rage for reviews serials magazines i cant abide my mind is far too much distracted already and that fragmentary mode of reading is very bad for many people i am sure  naturally enough at fortytwo years of age ninetynine hundredths of the lighter books seem to me mere rubbish  they come to me occasionally  however there are younger ones here so it isnt sheer waste to receive such donations they soon get out of my room not mind you that i think this the least evidence of my being wiser or employing my time more carefully than other folk  only i want you to know what i am and what i think  pena has sent me a nice book which i wanted 1st because i have a great personal liking for shairp a simpleminded affectionate man with much poetical feeling and good tastea kindlynatured man  2nd because he writes in an appreciative kind of way and is the very opposite of  whom i cant stand with his insufferable self sufficiency and incapacity for appreciating the nobler simpler more generous natures who are unlike him  well that is fierce  but there is a school of men whom i cant stand  their nature repels me and i hardly wish to like them which is an evil feeling  i shall add a line in a few days  my very dearest love to auntydear aunty and if i cant write to pena give her my best love and thanks for her book  dear sophy your loving cousin  j c p   two other letters one to each of the sisters were in progress at this time  to joanna who had been grieved for the poor girl whose transgression had occurred in the beginning of the year he says  about semtingvat you must be comforted about her  for a poor child who two short years before had assumed as a matter of course that a woman simply existed to be a mans slave in every kind of way her fault could not i think be regarded as very great  indeed there was much comfort from the first and since that time they not only have gone on well but i do believe that their religious character has been much strengthened by the kind of revelation they then obtained of what christianity really does mean  anyhow all notice the fact that u has improved very much and they all sing semtingvats praises  i had no difficulty about marrying them after a little while  i spoke openly in chapel to everyone about it their wedding was not as other weddingsno festivity no dressing of the chapel no feast no supper and fun and holiday  it was perfectly understood to be in all respects different from a bright happy wedding  but it was quite as much for the sake of all for the sake of enforcing the new teaching about the sanctity of marriage that we made so very much of what as men speak was under the circumstances a comparatively light fault less than an impure thought on the part of such as have been taught their duty from their childhood  i am almost confused with the accounts from england  all seems in a state of turmoil and confusion all the old landmarks being swept away by a deluge of new opinions as to all matters civil and ecclesiastical  i dont think that we ought to refuse to see these signs of a change in mens mode of regarding great political and religious questions  a man left high and dry on the sandbank of his antiquated notions will do little good to the poor folk struggling in the sea way though he is safer as far as he is himself concerned by staying where he is than by plunging in to help them  it is a critical time in every sense  men and women can hardly be indifferent they must be at the pains of making up their minds  as for us clergy everywhere but in norfolk island we must know that people are thinking of matters which all were content a few years ago to keep back in silence and that they expect us to speak about them how thankful i am that we fortunate ones are exempt from this  yet in my way i too try to think a bit about what is going on and i dont want to be too gloomy or to ignore some good in all this ferment in mens minds  it is better than stagnation and indolent respectability  there is everywhere a consciousness of a vast work to be done and sincere efforts are made to do it  i suppose that is a fact many many poor souls are being taught and trained for heaven through all these various agencies which seem to a distant and idle critic to be so questionable in some ways  of old one thought that the sober standard of church of england divinity was the rule to which all speculations should be reduced and one thought that pearson hooker waterland jeremy taylor also and andrewes and bull and jackson and barrow c stood for the idea of english divinity  now we are launched upon a wider sea catholic usage and doctrine take the place of church of england teaching and practice rightly i dare say only it may be well to remember that men who can perhaps understand a good deal of the english divines can hardly be supposed to be equally capable of understanding the far wider and more difficult range of ecclesiastical literature of all ages and all writers  everyone knows and is struck by the fact that passages of old writers are continually quoted by men of quite different schools of thought in favour of their own different views  clearly they cant both understand the mind and spirit of these writers and the truth is isnt it that only they who by very long study and from a large share of the true historical imagination sympathise with and really enter into the hearts and minds of these writers are competent to deal with and decide upon such wide and weighty matters  it seems to me as if men who are in no sense divines theologians or well read speak strongly and use expressions and teach doctrines which indeed only very few men should think of uttering or teaching  and yet dont think i wish to be only an exclusive anglican without sympathy for east or west still less that i wish to ignore the catholic church of the truly primitive times but i take the real so to say representative teaching of the church of england to be the divinity of the truly primitive church to which our formularies and reformers appeal  i know moreover that our dear father accepted jackson and waterland and i dont feel disposed to disparage them as it is the fashion to do nowadays  few men in spite of occasional scholastic subtlety go so deep in their search right down into principles as jackson  few men so analyse dissect search out the precise exact meaning of words and phrases so carry you away from vague generalities to accurate defined meanings and doctrines  he had an honest and clear brain of his own though he was a tremendous bookworm and i think he is a great authority though i know about him and his antagonism to rome  i dont fear to weary you by this kind of talk but dont i wish i could hear three or four of our very best men discuss these points thoroughly  in all sincerity i believe that i should be continually convinced of error shallow judgments and ignorance  but then i should most likely get real light on some points where i would fain have it  to this unconscious token of humility another must be added from the same letter speaking of two new zealand friendsto me she has always been kindness itself with her husband overrating me to such an amusing extent that i dont think it hurt even my vanity  full preparation was going on for the ordination of the two priests  no special account of the actual service seems to have been written and the first letter of january was nearly absorbed by the tidings of the three episcopal appointments of the close of 1869 the oxford choice coming near to bishop patteson by his family affections and the appointment to exeter as dealing with his beloved county at home  and now before turning the page and leaving the period that had on the whole been full of brightness will be the best time to give mr codringtons account of the manner of life at st barnabas while the bishop was still in his strength  certainly one of the most striking points to a stranger would have been the familiar intercourse between the bishop and his boys not only the advanced scholars but the last and newest comers  the kindly and friendly disposition of the melanesians leads to a great deal of free and equal familiarity even where there are chiefs and the obsequious familiarity of which one hears in india is here quite unknown  nevertheless i doubt very much whether other melanesians live in the same familiarity with their missionarieseg carry wife of wadrokala writes thusi tremble very much to write to you i am not fit to write to you because does an ant know how to speak to a cow  we at nengone would not speak to a great man like you no our language is different to a chief and a missionary  making every allowance and looking at the matter from within that perfect freedom and affectionateness of intercourse that existed with him seems very remarkable  the secret of it is not far to seek  it did not lie in any singular attractiveness of his manner only but in the experience that everyone attracted gained that he sought nothing for himself he was entirely free from any desire to be admired or love of being thought much of as he was from love of commanding for the sake of being obeyed  the great temptations to missionaries among savage people as it seems are to selfesteem from a comparison of themselves with their european advantages and the natives among whom they live and to a domineering temper because they find an obedience ready and it is delightful to be obeyed  bishop pattesons natural disposition was averse to either and the principles of missionary work which he took up suited at once his natural temper and his religious character  he was able naturally without effort to live as a brother among his black brothers to be the servant of those he lived to teach  the natural consequence of this was the unquestioned authority which he possessed over those with whom he lived on equal terms  no one could entertain the idea that anything was ordered from a selfish motive for any advantage to himself or that anything was forbidden without some very good reason  this familiarity with a superior which is natural with melanesians is accompanied especially in banks islanders with a very great reserve about anything that touches the feelings or concerns character  thus a boy who would use the bishops room as if it were his own coming in unasked to read or write or sit by the fire there would with very great difficulty get over the physical trembling which their language implies that would come upon him if he wished to speak about his own feelings on religious matters or to tell him something which he well knew it was his duty to make known  when one knows how difficult it is to them to speak openly their openness with the bishop is more appreciated though he indeed often enough complained of their closeness with him  the real affection between the boys and the bishop required no acquaintance with the character of either to discern and could surprise no one who knew anything of the history of their relation one to another  it is well known that he wished his elder boys to stand in the place of the sixth form of a public school and to some extent they did so but being mostly banks islanders and banks islanders being peculiarly afraid of interfering with one another his idea was never reached  still no doubt a good deal is attained when they arrive rather at the position of pupil teacher in a national school and this at least they occupy very satisfactorily as is shown by the success with which so large a school has been carried on since the bishops death  no doubt the ordination of more from among their number would go far to raise them in their own estimation  in truth the carrying out of the principle of the equality of black and white in a missionary work which is the principle of this mission is very difficult and cannot be done in all particulars in practice by anyone and by most people unless brought up to it probably not at all  nevertheless it is practicable and as we think essential and was in all main points carried out by bishop patteson  but the effect of this must not be exaggerated  it is true that we have no servants yet a boy regularly brought water c for the bishop and a woman regularly swept and cleaned his rooms and received regular wages for it  the bishop never cooked his dinner or did any such work except upon occasions on which a bachelor curate in england does much of the kind as a matter of course  the extraordinary thing is that it is as he at any rate supposed the custom in other missions to make scholars and converts servants as a matter of course and the difference lies not in the work which is done or not done by the one party or the other but in the social relation of equality which subsists between them and the spirit in which the work is asked for and rendered  the main thing to notice about the bishop is that there was nothing forced or unnatural in his manner of taking a position of equality and equality as real in any way as his superiority in another consequently there was never the least loss of dignity or authority on his part  there never was visible the smallest diminution of freedom and affection in the intercourse that went on  it required some knowledge in one respect to appreciate the extraordinary facility with which he conversed with boys from various islands  a stranger would be struck with his bright smiles and sweet tones as he would address some little stranger who came into his room but one who knew a little of the languages alone could know with what extraordinary quickness he passed from one language to another talking to many boys in their own language but accommodating his tongue with wonderful readiness to each in succession  it would be hard to say how many languages he could speak those which he spoke quite freely to my knowledge were not so many mota bauro mahaga and nengone certainly some others no doubt quite readily when among the people who spoke them and very many only with a small vocabulary which was every instant being enlarged  it does not appear to me that his scientific philological acquirements were extraordinary but that his memory for words giving him such a command of vocabulary and so wide a scope for comparison and his accurate and delicate ear to catch the sounds and power of reproducing them were altogether wonderful and very rarely equalled  a man of his faculty of expression and powers of mind could not speak like a native he spoke better than a native than a native of mota at least  that is that although no doubt he never was quite master of the little delicate points of mota scholarship which no one not a native can keep quite right and no native can account for yet his vocabulary was so large and accurate and his feeling of the native ways of looking at things and representing them in words so true that he spoke to them more clearly and forcibly than even any native spoke and with the power of an educated mind controlling while following the native taste  he was an enthusiast no doubt about these languages and jealous of their claim to be considered true language and not what people suppose them to be the uncouth jargon of savages  i will only say that his translations of some of the psalms into mota are as lofty in their diction and as harmonious in their rhythm in my estimation as anything almost i read in any language  this no doubt sounds exaggerated and must be taken only for what it is worth  it was probably in a great measure because his natural power of acquiring languages was so extraordinary and needed so very little labour in him that he did so very little to put on paper what he knew of all those many tongues  all there is in print i have put together  besides this he carried the same unfortunate way of leaving off what he had begun into these notes on language also  in the year 6364 he got printed a number of small grammatical papers in almost all the languages he knew because he felt he ought not to subject them to the risk of being lost  another reason why he did not go into any laborious manuscript or printing work with the various languages was that he saw as time went on first that it was so very uncertain what language would come in practice into request and secondly that one language would suffice for the use in practice of all natives of a neighbourhood  for example the language of part of mae three hills in the new hebrides was once studied and well known  nothing whatever came of the intercourse with that island once so constant i dont know why and now the people themselves are destroyed almost and hopes of doing them good destroyed by the slave trade  and secondly the use of the mota language in our ordinary intercourse here has very much diminished the need for any ones knowing a particular language beyond the missionary who has charge of the boys who speak it  thus the bishop rather handed over the language of bauro to mr atkin of florida to mr brooke of lepers island to mr price and as the common teaching of all boys who belonged to either of the principal groups into which the school fell went on in mota there was no practical use in the other tongues the bishop knew except in his voyages and in giving him more effectual powers of influencing those to whom he could speak in their own tongue  besides he saw so clearly the great advantage on the one hand of throwing together in every possible way the boys from all the islands which was much helped by the use of one language and on the other hand the natural tendency in a group of boys from one island or neighbourhood to keep separate and of the teacher of a particular set to keep them separate with himself that without saying much about it he discouraged the printing of other languages besides mota and in other ways kept them rather in the background  how things would have arranged themselves if mota had not by circumstances come into such prominence i cannot say but the predominance of mota came in with the internal organisation of the mission by mr pritt  it is impossible for one who knew bishop patteson intimately and the later condition of the mission intimately to lose sight for long of mr pritts influence and his useful work  perhaps this chapter can best be completed by the external testimony of a visitor to norfolk island given in a letter to the editor of the australian churchman  daily at 7 am the bell rings for chapel about one minute and all hands promptly repair thither  in spite of the vast varieties of language and dialect spoken by fifty or sixty human beings collected from twenty or thirty islets of the pacific main no practical difficulty has been found in using the mota as the general language in chapel and school so that in a short time a congregation of twenty languages are able to join in worship in the one mota tongue more or less akin to all the rest and a class of say nine boys speaking by nature five different languages easily join in using the one mota language just as a frenchman a german a russian a pole an italian and an englishman all meeting in the same cafe or railway carriage on the same glacier or mountain top might harmoniously agree to use the french language as their medium of communication  so the service is conducted in mota with one exception only  the collect for the day is read in english as a brief allowable concession to the ears and hearts of the english members of the mission  the service consists of the greater part of the church of england service translated  some modifications have been made to suit the course of religious instruction  the psalms are chanted and hymns sung in parts and always in admirable tune by the congregation  noteworthy are the perfect attention the reverent attitude the hearty swing and unison of the little congregation a lesson i felt with shame to many of our white congregations  immediately after service clinks out the breakfast bell and with marvellous promptitude and punctuality whites and blacks lay and clerical are seen flocking to the messroom  the whites sit at the upper end of the table but beyond the special privilege of tea all fare alike chiefly on vegetables yams or sweet potatoes and carrots or vegetable marrows as may suit the season with plenty of biscuit for more ambitious teeth and plenty of milk to wash it down soon afterwards comes school for an hour and a half  then work for the boys and men planting yams reaping wheat mowing oats fencing carting building as the call may be only no caste distinction or ordering about it is not go and do that but come and do this whether the leader be an ordained clergyman a white farm bailiff or a white carpenter  this is noteworthy and your readers will gain no clear idea of the mission if they do not seize this point for it is no matter of mere detail but one of principle  the system is not that of the ship or the regiment of the farm or the manufactory of the old country but essentially of the family  it is not the officer or master saying go but the father or the brother saying come  and to this i firmly believe is the hearty cheerful following and merry work of the blacks chiefly due  at 1 pm is dinner much the same as breakfast  meat though not unknown is the weak point of the mission dietary  in the afternoon work  at 6 tea  in the evening class again for an hour or two this evening class being sometimes a singing lesson heartily enjoyed by the teacher  i forget precisely when the boys have to prepare matter arising out of the lessons they have received viva voce  there are evening prayers and bedtime is early  noteworthy are the happy conjunctions of perfect discipline with perfect jollity the marvellous attainment of a happy familiarity which does not breed contempt  i presume i need scarcely say to your readers that besides education in reading writing and arithmetic through the medium of the mota language instruction in the holy scriptures and the most careful explanations of their meaning and mutual relation forms a main part of the teaching given  the men and boys of the senior classes take notes notes not by order expressly to be inspected but so to say private notes for the aid of their memories and from the translation given to me by bishop patteson of some of these i should say that few if any of the senior class of an english sunday school could give anything like so close and sometimes philosophical an explanation of scripture and that sometimes in remarkably few words  there remains to be noticed one most effectual means of doing good after evening school the bishop his clergy and his aides retire mostly into their own rooms  then quietly and shyly on this night or the other night one or two three or four of the more intelligent of the black boys steal silently up to the bishops side and by fits and starts slowly often painfully tell their feelings state their difficulties ask for help and i believe with gods blessing rarely fail to find it  they are not gushing as negroes but shy as englishmen we englishmen ought indeed to have a fellowfeeling for these poor black boys and help them with all our hearts  such is the routine for five of the six work days  saturday is whole holiday and all hands go to fish if the sea permits if not to play rounders or what not  merry lads they are as ever gladdened an english playground  on sunday the early chapel is omitted  the full liturgy is divided into two servicesi forget the lawsand a kind of sermon in mota is given and in the afternoon the bishop or one of the ordained members of the mission usually goes down to the town to relieve mr nobbs in his service for the pitcairners  as regards the manual work of the station this general principle is observedwomen for washing and housework the men for planting and outofdoor work but no one white or black is to be too grand to do his share  the bishops share indeed is to study and investigate and compare the languages and necessary translations but no one is to be above manual labour  no one because he is a white man is to say here black fellow come and clean my boots here black people believe that i have come to give you a treasure of inestimable price  meantime work for me am i not your superior can i not give you money calico what not  this christian democracy if i may so call it has worked well in the long run  this observer does seem to have entered well into the spirit of the place and there can be no doubt that the plan and organisation of the mission had by this time been well tested and both found practicable and as at present worked more than ordinarily successful  the college was in full working order with a staff of clergy all save one formed under the bishop one native deacon and two teachers living with their wives in a population that was fast becoming moulded by the influence of christianity many more being trained up and several more islands in course of gradual preparation by the same process as was further advanced in mota  such were the achievements which could be thankfully recounted by the end of 1869     chapter xii  the last eighteen months  18701871    the prosperous days of every life pass away at last  suffering and sorrow failure and reverse are sure to await all who live out anything like their term of years and the missionary is perhaps more liable than other men to meet with a great disappointment  success but signifies vicissitude and looking at the history of the growth of the church it is impossible not to observe that almost in all cases immediately upon any extensive progress there has followed what seems like a strong effort of the evil one at its frustration either by external persecution reaction of heathenism or most fatally and frequently during the last 300 years from the reckless misdoings of unscrupulous sailors and colonists  the west indies japan america all have the same shameful tale to tellwhat wonder if the same shadow were to be cast over the isles of the south  it is one of the misfortunes perhaps the temptations of this modern world that two of its chief necessaries sugar and cotton require a climate too hot for the labour of men who have intelligence enough to grow and export them on a large scale and who are therefore compelled as they consider to employ the forced toil of races able to endure heat  the australian colony of queensland is unfit to produce wheat but well able to grow sugar and the islands of fiji which the natives have implored england to annex have become the resort of numerous planters and speculators  there were 300 white inhabitants in the latter at the time of the visit of the curacoa in 1865  in 1871 the numbers were from 5000 to 6000  large sheep farms have been laid out and sugar plantations established  south sea islanders are found to have much of the negro toughness and docility and as has been seen when away from their homes they are easily amenable and generally pleasant in manner and intelligent often too they have a spirit of enterprise which makes them willing to leave home or some feud with a neighbour renders it convenient thus the earlier planters did not find it difficult to procure willing labourers chiefly from those southern new hebrides anaiteum tanna erromango c which were already accustomed to intercourse with sandalwood traders had resident scottish or london missionaries and might have a fair understanding of what they were undertaking  the fiji islanders themselves had been converted by wesleyan missionaries and these while the numbers of imported labourers were small did not think ill of the system since it provided the islanders with their great need work and might give them habits of industry  but in the years 1868 and 1869 the demand began both in queensland and fiji to increase beyond what could be supplied by willing labour and the premium £8 a head on an ablebodied black was sufficient to tempt the masters of small craft to obtain the desired article by all possible means  neither in the colony nor in fiji were the planters desirous of obtaining workers by foul means but labour they must have and they were willing to pay for it queensland anxious to free herself from any imputation of slave hunting has drawn up a set of regulations requiring a regular contract to be made with the natives before they are shipped for so many years engaging that they shall receive wages and be sent home again at the end of the specified time  no one denies that when once the labourer has arrived these rules are carried out he is well fed kindly treated not over worked and at the end of three or five years sent home again with the property he has earned  a recent traveller has argued that this is all that can be desired and that no true friend of the poor islander can object to his being taught industry and civilisation  complaints are all missionary exaggeration that easy term for disposing of all defence of the dark races and as to the difficulty of making a man whose language is not understood understand the terms of a contractwhy we continually sign legal documents we do not understand  perhaps not but we do understand enough not to find ourselves bound to five years labour when we thought we were selling yams or taking a pleasure trip  and we have some means of ascertaining the signification of such documents and of obtaining redress if we have been deceived  as to the boasted civilisation a sugar plantation has not been found a very advanced school for the american or west indian negro and as a matter of fact the islander who has fulfilled his term and comes home bringing tobacco clothes and firearms only becomes a more dangerous and licentious savage than he was in his simplicity  it is absolutely impossible even if the planters wished it to give any instruction to these poor fellows so scattered are the settlements so various the languages on each and to send a man home with guns and gunpowder and no touch of christian teaching is surely suicidal policy  yet as long as the natives went in any degree willingly though the missionaries might deplore their so doing for the mens own sakes and for that of their islands it was only like a clergyman at home seeing his lads engage themselves to some occupation more undesirable than they knew  therefore the only thing that has been entreated for by all the missions of every denomination alike in the south seas has been such sufficient supervision of the labour traffic as may prevent deceit or violence from being used  for in the years 1869 and 1870 if not before the captains of the labour ships finding that a sufficient supply of willing natives could not be procured had begun to cajole them on board  when they went to trade they were thrust under hatches and carried off and if the southern new hebrides became exhausted and the labour ships entered on those seas where the southern cross was a welcome visitor these captains sometimes told the men that the bishop gave no pipes and tobacco he was bad they had better hold with them or else the bishop could not come himself but had sent this vessel to fetch them  sometimes even a figure was placed on deck dressed in a black coat with a book in his hand according to the sailors notion of a missionary to induce the natives to come on deck and there they were clapped under hatches and carried off  in 1870 hms rosario captain palmer brought one of these vessels the daphne into sydney where the master was tried for acts of violence but a conviction could not be procured and as will be seen in the correspondence bishop patteson did not regret the failure as he was anxious that ships of a fair size with respectable owners should not be deterred from the traffic since the more it became a smuggling unrecognised business the worse and more unscrupulous men would be employed in it  but decoying without violence began to fail the natives were becoming too cautious so the canoes were upset and the men picked up while struggling in the water  if they tried to resist they were shot at and all endeavours at a rescue were met with the use of firearms  they were thus swept off in such numbers that small islands lost almost all their ablebodied inhabitants and were in danger of famine for want of their workers  also the fiji planters thinking to make the men happier by bringing their wives desired that this might be done but it was not easy to make out the married couples nor did the crews trouble themselves to do so but took any woman they could lay hands on  husbands pursued to save the wives and were shot down and a deadly spirit of hatred and terror against all that was white was aroused  there is a still lower depth of atrocity but as far as enquiry of the government at sydney can make out unconnected with labour traffic but with the tortoiseshell trade  skulls it will be remembered were the ornament of old iris house at bauro and skulls are still the trophies in the more savage islands  it seems that some of the traders in tortoiseshell are in the habit of assisting their clients by conveying them in their vessels in pursuit of heads there is no evidence that they actually do the work of slaughter themselves though suspicion is strong but these are the killkill vessels in the patois of the pacific while the kidnappers are the snatchsnatch  both together these causes were working up the islanders to a perilous pitch of suspicion and exasperation during the years 1870 1871 and thus were destroying many of the best hopes of the fruit of the toils of all these years  but the full extent of the mischief was still unknown in norfolk island when in the midst of the bishops plans for the expedition of 1870 came the illness from which he never wholly recovered  already he had often felt and spoken of himself as an elderly man most men of a year or two past forty are at the most vigorous period of their existence generally indeed with the really individual and effective work of their lives before them having hitherto been only serving their apprenticeship but coleridge patteson had begun his task while in early youth and had been obliged to bear at once responsibility and active toil in no ordinary degree  few have had to be at once head of a college sole tutor and steward as well as primary schoolmaster all at once or afterwards united these charges with those of bishop examining chaplain and theological professor with the interludes of voyages which involved intense anxiety and watchfulness as well as the hardships of those unrestful nights in native huts and the exhaustion of the tropical climate  no wonder then that he was already as one whose work was wellnigh done and to whom rest was near  and though the entrance into that rest was by a sudden stroke it was one that mercifully spared the sufferings of a protracted illness and even if his friends pause to claim for it the actual honours on earth of martyrdom yet it was no doubt such a death as he was most willing to die full in his masters service such a death as all can be thankful to think of  and for the like minded young man who shared his death only with more of the bitterness thereof the spirit in which he went forth may best be seen in part of a letter written in the january of 1870 just after his ordination  the right way must be to have a general idea of what to aim at and to make for the goal by what seem as you go the best ways not to go on a course you fixed to yourself before starting without having seen it  it is so easy for people to hold theories and excellent ones too of the way to manage or deal with the native races but the worst is that when you come to work the theory the native race will never be found what it ought to be for properly carrying it out  i am quite sure that nothing is to be done in a hurry a good and zealous man in ignorance and haste might do more harm in one year than could be remedied in ten  i would not root out a single superstition until i had something better to put in its place lest if all the weeds were rooted up what had before been fertile should become desert barren disbelieving in anything  is not the right way to plant the true seed and nourish it that it may take root and outgrow and choke the weeds  my objection to mission reports has always been that the readers want to hear of progress and the writers are thus tempted to write of it and may they not without knowing it be at times hasty that they may seem to be progressing people expect too much  those do so who see the results of mission work who are engaged in it those do so who send them  we have the precious seed to sow and must sow it when and where we can but we must not always be looking out to reap what we have sown  we shall do that in due time if we faint not  because missionary work looks like a failure it does not follow that it is  our saviour the first of all christian missionaries was thirty years of his life preparing and being prepared for his work  three years he spake as never man spake and did not his work at that time look a failure  he made no mistakes either in what he taught or the way of teaching it and he succeeded though not to the eyes of men should not we be contented with success like his  and with how much less ought we not to be contented  so  the wonder is that by our means any result is accomplished at all  these are remarkable words for a young man of twentyseven full of life health and vigour and go far to prove the early ripening of a spirit chastened in hopes even while all was bright  in the latter part of february bishop patteson after about six days of warning was prostrated by a very severe attack of internal inflammation and for three daysfrom the 20th to the 22ndwas in considerable danger as well as suffering  mr nobbss medical knowledge seems humanly speaking to have brought him through and on the 28th when an opportunity occurred of sending letters he was able to write a note to his brother and sistersweak and shattered looking writing indeed but telling all that needed to be told and finishing with in a few days dv i may be quite well then in a postscript our most merciful father redeemer and sanctifier is merciful indeed  there was a time when i felt drawing near the dark valley and i thought of father mother of uncle frank and our little ones frankie and dollya brother and sister who had died in early infancy  but it was not the divine will that he should be well in a few days day after day he continued feeble and suffering much though not so acutely as in the first attack mr nobbs continued to attend him and the treatment was approved afterwards by the physicians consulted  all the clergy took their part in nursing and the melanesian youths in turn watched him day and night  he did not leave his room till the beginning of april and then was only equal to the exertion of preparing two lads for baptism and a few more for confirmation  on easter sunday he was able to baptize the first mentioned and confirm the others and the southern cross having by this time arrived for the regular voyage he embarked in her to obtain further advice at auckland  lady martin his kind and tender hostess and nurse thus describes his arrival  we had heard of his illness from himself and others and of his being out of danger in the middle of march  we were therefore much surprised when the southern cross which had sailed a fortnight before for norfolk island came into the harbour on the morning of the 25th of april and anchored in our bay with the bishops flag flying  we went down to the beach with anxious hearts to receive the dear invalid and were greatly shocked at his appearance  his beard which he had allowed to grow since his illness and his hair were streaked with grey his complexion was very dark and his frame was bowed like an old mans  the captain and mr bice almost carried him up the hill to our house  he was very thankful to be on shore and spoke cheerfully about the improvement he had made on the voyage  it was not very apparent to us who had not seen him for two years  even then he was looking worn and ill but still was a young active man  he seemed now quite a wreck  for the first fortnight his faithful attendant malagona slept in his room and was ready at all hours to wait upon his beloved bishop  day by day he used to sit by the fire in an easy chair too weak to move or to attend to reading  he got up very early being tired of bed  his books and papers were all brought out but he did little but doze  yet in his despatch of the 2nd of may where the manuscript is as firm clear and beautiful as ever only somewhat less minute he says that he had improved wonderfully on the voyage though he adds that the doctor told him at an office they would insure your life at fifty instead of fortythree years of age  dr goldsboro had on examination discovered a chronic ailment not likely with care and treatment to be dangerous to life but forbidding active exertion or horse exercise and warning him that a sudden jar or slip or fall on rugged ground would probably bring on acute inflammation which might prove fatal after hours of suffering  after in the abovementioned letter communicating his exact state he addsthe pain has been at times very severe and yet i cant tell you of the very great happiness and actual enjoyment of many of those sleepless nights when perhaps at 2 am i felt the pain subsiding and prayer for rest if it were his will was changed into thanksgiving for the relief then as the fire flickered came restful peaceful happy thoughts mingled with much i trust heart felt sorrow and remorse  and psalms seemed to have a new meaning and prayers to be so real and somehow there was a sense of a very near presence and i felt almost sorry when it was 530 and i got up and my kind melanesian nurse made me my morning cup of weak tea so good to the dry furred tongue  well that is all past and gone and now the hope and prayer is that when my time is really come i may be better prepared to go  sir william and lady martin are pretty well and i am in clover here getting real rest and gaining ground pretty well  i have all confidence in the prudence of the other missionaries and leave the work thankfully in their hands knowing well whose work it is and to whose guidance and protection we all trust  on the 9th in a letter sent by a different route he adds  so i think it will come to my doing my work on norfolk island just as usual with only occasional inconvenience or discomfort  but i think i shall have to forego some of the more risky and adventurous part of the work in the islands  this is all right  it is a sign that the time is come for me to delegate it to others  i dont mean that i shall not take the voyages and stop about on the islands dv as before  but i must do it all more carefully and avoid much that of old i never thought about  yet i think it will not as a matter of fact much interfere with my work  i have you understand no pain now only some discomfort  the fact that i cant do things move about c like a sound healthy person is not a trial  the relief from pain the resty feeling is such a blessing and enjoyment that i dont seem as yet at all events to care about the other  so of that restful state lady martin says indeed it was a most happy time to us and i think on the whole to him  it was a new state of things to keep him without any pricks of conscience or restlessness on his part  he liked to have a quiet halfhour by the fire at night and before i left him i used to put his books near him his bible his hebrew psalter his fathers copy of bishop andrewes  sometimes i would linger for a few minutes to talk about his past illness  he used to dwell specially on his dear fathers nearness to him at that time  he spoke once or twice with a reverent holy awe and joy of sleepless nights when thoughts of god had filled his soul and sustained him  his face always beautiful from the unworldly purity of its expression was really as the face of an angel while he spoke of these things and of the love and kindness he had received  he seemed to have been standing on the very brink of the river and it was yet doubtful whether he was to abide with us  now looking back we can see how mercifully god was dealing with his servant  a time of quiet and of preparation for death given to him apart from the hurry of his daily life then a few months of active service and then the crown  at the end of a fortnight you must please to rectify dates the southern cross sailed again with mr bice and malagona on board when just as we were expecting she would have reached norfolk island she was driving back into the harbour  the following letter to the bishop of lichfield gives an account of her peril   taurarua may 11 1870  my dear bishopi have to tell you of another great mercy  the southern cross left auckland on may 3fair wind and fine weather  on may 5 she was within 185 miles of norfolk island  then came on a fearful gale from the east and northeast to north west  they were hoveto for three days everything battened down port boat and davits carried away by a sea after a while the starboard boat dashed to pieces  malagona my nurse at norfolk island who was brought up for a treat was thrown completely across the cabin by one lurch when she seemed almost settling down  it was dark  the water in the cabin which had come through the deadlight showed a little phosphoric glimmer  brother he said to bice are we dying  i dont know it seems like it  we are in gods hands  yes i know  mr captain jacobs was calm and selfpossessed  he even behaved excellently  once all on deck were washed into the lee scuppers and one man washed overboard but he held a rope and with it and the recoil was borne in again upon the deck  lowest barometer 28° 65 we were startled yesterday at about 4 pm with the news of the reappearance of the vessel  i think that some £30 and the replacing the boats will pay damages but one doesnt think of that  we hope to get at all events one readymade boat so as to cause no delay  the good people at norfolk island will be anxious if the vessel does not reappear soon  auckland june 6thsouthern cross could not sail till may 23  if i am not found by them at norfolk island on their return they are to come on for me  i hope to make a two months cruise  general health quite well no pain for weeks past  dr goldsboro says i shall be better in a hot climate but he wont let me out of his hands yet  i really think i shall do very well byandby  your very affectionate  j c patteson   the repairs took some time continues lady martin  the delay must have been very trying to the bishop in his weak state as it threw out all the plans for the winter voyage but he showed no signs of fretfulness or of a restless desire to go himself to see after matters  the winter was unusually cold after the vessel sailed again and i used to wonder sometimes whether he lay awake listening to the wind that howled in gusts round the house he may have but certainly there was always a look of unruffled calm and peace on his face when we met in the morning   tis enough that thou shouldst care  why should i the burden bear   our dear friend mended very slowly  it was more than a month before he could bear even to be driven up to bishops court to receive the holy communion in the private chapel and some time longer before he could sit through the sunday services  i cannot be sure whether he went first on ascension day  his own letters may inform you  i only remember how thankful and happy he was to be able to get there  he had felt the loss of the frequent communions in which he could join all through his illness  he was making a real step towards recovery and by the 10th of june he was able to go and stay at st sepulchres parsonage with mr dudley and attend the gathering at the bishop of aucklands chapel on st barnabas day but the calm enjoyment and soothing indifference which seems so often a privilege of the weakness of recovery was broken by fuller tidings respecting the labour traffic that imperilled his work  a schooner had come in from fate with from fifteen to twenty natives from that and other islands to work in flax mills and a little later a letter arrived from his correspondent in fiji showing to what an extent the immigration thither had come and how large a proportion of the young men working in the sugar plantations had been decoyed from home on false pretences  this was the point as far as at the time appeared in new zealand if violence had then begun no very flagrant instances were known and the bishop was not at all averse to the employment of natives well knowing how great an agent in improvement is civilisation  but to have them carried off without understanding what they were about and then set to hard labour was quite a different thing  the difficulty is he writes to prove in a court of law what everyone acknowledges to be the case viz that the natives of the islands are inveigled on board these vessels by divers means then put under the hatches and sold ignorant of their destination or future employment and without any promises of being returned home  it comes to this though of course it is denied by the planters and the queensland government which is concerned in keeping up the trade  there will always be some islanders who from a roving nature or from a necessity of escaping retaliation for some injury done by them or from mere curiosity will paddle off to a ship and go on board  but they cant understand the white men they are tempted below to look at some presents or if the vessel be at anchor are allowed to sleep on board  then in the one case the hatches are clapped on in the other sail is made in the night and so they are taken off to a labour of which they know nothing among people of whom they know nothing  it is the regulation rather than the suppression of the employment of native labourers that i advocate  there is no reason why some of these islanders should not go to a plantation under proper regulations  my notion is that  1  a few vessels should be licensed for the purpose of conveying these islanders backwards and forwards  2  that such vessels should be in charge of fit persons heavily bound to observe certain rules and punishable summarily for violating them  3  that the missionaries wherever they be situated should be informed of the names of the vessels thus licensed of the sailing masters c  4  that all other vessels engaged in the trade should be treated as pirates and confiscated summarily when caught  5  that a small manofwar commanded by a man fit for such work should cruise among the islands from which islanders are being taken  6  that special legislative enactments should be passed enabling the sydney court to deal with the matter equitably  something of this kind is the best plan i can suggest  it is right and good that the galatea should undertake such work and yet we want a little tender to the galatea rather than the big vessel as i think my experience of large vessels is that there is too much of routine and great delay is occasioned by the difficulty of turning a great ship round and you cant work near the shore and even if chasing a little vessel which could be caught at once in the open sea you may be dodged by her among islands  yet the sense of the country is expressed very well by sending captain edinburgh himself to cruise between new caledonia fiji and the kingsmill islands for the suppression of the illegal deportation of natives so reads the despatch which the governor showed me the other day  he asked me to give such information as might be useful to the galatea  with the governor sir george bowen an old oxford friend bishop patteson spent several days and submitted to him a memorial to government on the subject both at home and in queensland stating the regulations as above expressed  the rosario captain palmer had actually captured the daphne a vessel engaged in capturing natives and brought her into sydney where the master was tried but though there was no doubt of the outrage it was not possible to obtain a conviction and a fiji planter whom the bishop met in auckland told him that the seizure of the daphne would merely lead to the exclusion of the better class of men from the trade and that it would not stop the demand for native labourers  it would always pay to run cargoes of natives into the many islets of fiji and they would be smuggled into the plantations  and there the government was almost necessarily by the whip  i cant talk to them said the planter i can only point to what they are to do and if they are lazy i whip them  it was no wonder that mr dudley thought the bishop depressed and moreover he overexerted himself walking a mile and a half one day and preaching in the little church of st sepulchres  he longed to return to st barnabas but was in no state to rough it in a common little sailing vessel so he waited on  i am very lazy he says i cant do much work  sir william and i read hebrew and discuss many questions in which his opinion is most valuable  i have business letters to write eg about the deportation of islanders and about a clergyman whom the melbourne people are helping to go to fiji this is perhaps a good trial for me to be sitting lazily here and thinking of others at work  this was written about the middle of july when the convalescent had regained much more strength and could walk into town or stand to read and write according to his favourite custom as well as thoroughly enjoy conversations with his hosts at taurarua  i never saw observes lady martin a larger charity united to a more living faith  he knew in whom he believed and this unclouded confidence seemed to enable him to be gentle and discriminating in his judgments on those whose minds are clouded with doubt  it was pleasant to see how at this time his mind went back to the interests which he had laid aside for years  he liked to hear bits of handel and other old masters and would go back to recollections of foreign travels and of his enthusiasm for music and art as freshly and brightly as he had done in the first days of our acquaintance but this was only in the gloaming or late in the evening when he was resting in his easy chair  at the end of july we were expecting a young relation and his bride to spend a week with us before returning to england and we gave the bishop the option of going to bishops court for the time where he was always warmly welcomed  some years before he would certainly have slipped away from the chatter and bustle but now he decided to remain with us and throw himself into the small interests around in a way which touched and delighted the young couple greatly  he put away his natural shrinking from society and his student ways and was willing to enjoy everything as it came  we had a curious instance at this time of the real difficulty the bishop felt about writing sermons  he had not attempted to preach save at mr dudleys church but a week or two before he left us archdeacon maunsell came to beg of him to preach at st marys where he had often taken service formerly  he promised to do so without any apparent hesitation and said afterwards to us that he could not refuse such a request  so on wednesday he began to prepare a sermon  he was sitting each morning in the room where i was at work and he talked to me from time to time of the thoughts that were in his mind  the subject was all that was implied in the words i have called thee by thy name the personal knowledge interest c and i was rejoicing in the treat in store when to my dismay i saw sheet after sheet which had been written in his neat clear hand as though the thoughts flowed on without effort flung into the fire  i cant write was said again and again and the work put by for another day  at last on saturday morning he walked up to the parsonage to make his excuses  happily dr maunsell would not let him off so on sunday the bishop without any notes or sermon spoke to us out of the fulness of his heart about the mission work of its encouragements and its difficulties  he described in a way that none can ever forget who heard the plaintive tones of his voice and saw his worn face that day what it was to be alone on an island for weeks surrounded by noisy heathen and the comfort and strength gained then by the thought that we who have the full privileges of christian worship and communion were remembering such in our prayers  our young friends sailed on sunday august 7 and we expected the bishop to sail the next day but the winds were foul and boisterous and we had him with us till friday morning the 12th  those last days were very happy ones  his thoughts went back to melanesia and to his work and every evening we drew him to tell of adventures and perils and to describe the islands to us in a way he had scarcely ever done before  i think it was partly to please our maori maiden who sat by his side on a footstool in the twilight plying him with questions with so much lively natural interest that he warmed up in return  generally he shrank into himself and became reserved at once if pressed to tell of his own doings  he spoke one evening quite openly about his dislike to ship life  we were laughing at some remembrance of the bishop of lichfields satisfaction when once afloat and he burst into an expression of wonder how anyone could go to sea for pleasure  i asked him what he disliked in particular and he answered everything  that he always felt dizzy headachy and unable to read with comfort the food was greasy and there was a general sense of dirt and discomfort  as the time drew nigh for sailing he talked a good deal about the rapidly growing evil of the labour trade  he grew very depressed one day and spoke quite despondingly of the future prospects of the mission  he told us of one island vanua lava i think where a few years ago 300 men used to assemble on the beach to welcome him  now only thirty or forty were left  he saw that if the trade went on at the same rate as it had been doing for the last year or two many islands would be depopulated and everywhere he must expect to meet with suspicion or open ill will  the next morning the cloud had rolled away and he was ready to go forth in faith to do the work appointed him leaving the result in gods hands  we accompanied him to the boat on friday morning bishop and mrs cowie came down and one or two of the clergy and his two english boys who were to go with him  it was a lovely morning  we rejoiced to see how much he had improved in his health during his stay  he had been very good and tractable about taking nourishment and certainly looked and was all the better for generous diet  he had almost grown stout and walked upright and briskly  sir william parted with him on the beach where we have had so many partings and i meant to do so too but a friend had brought another boat and invited me to come so i gladly went off to the southern cross which was lying about halfamile off the cowies were very anxious to see the vessel and the bishop showed them all about  i was anxious to go down to his cabin and arrange in safe nooks comforts for his use on the voyage  in half an hour the vessel was ready to sail  one last grasp of the hand one loving smile and we partednever to meet again on earth   so far this kind and muchloved friend  and to this i cannot but add an extract from the letter she wrote to his sisters immediately after the parting since it adds another touch to the character now ripened  i think you are a little mistaken in your notion that your brother would feel no interest in your home doings  he has quite passed out of that early stage when the mind can dwell on nothing but its own sphere of work  he takes a lively interest in all that is going on at home specially in church matters and came back quite refreshed from bishops court with all that bishop cowie had told him  what he would really dread in england would be the being lionised and being compelled to speak and preach here there and everywhere and yet he would have no power to say nay  but the cold would shrivel him up and societydinners table talkwould bore him and he would pine for his warmth and his books  not a bit the less does he dearly love you all  the brother and sisters knew it and forebore to harass him with remonstrances but resigned themselves to the knowledge that nothing would bring him home save absolute disqualification for his mission  his own last letter from taurarua dwells upon the enjoyment of his conversations with sir william martin and bishop cowie and then goes into details of a vision of obtaining young english boys to whom a good education would be a boon bringing them up at st barnabas and then if they turned out fit for the mission there they would be preparedif not they would have had the benefit of the schooling  meantime the southern cross with three of the clergy had made the voyage according to minute directions from the bishop  mr atkin made his yearly visit to bauro  he says  i hardly expected that when we came back we should have found the peace still unbroken between wango and hane but it is  though not very good friends they are still at peace  in the chiefs house i was presented with a piece of pork about two pounds and a dish of tauma their favourite a pudding made of yams nuts and cocoanut milk and cooked by steaming  fortunately good manners allowed me to take it away  before we left the village it took two women to carry our provisions  a little boy came back with us to stay with taki  the two boys who ought to have come last year are very anxious to do so still  july 12thwe anchored the boat on the beach at tawatana and i went into the oka public house to see the tauma prepared for the feast  there were thirtyeight dishes  the largest about four feet long stood nearly three feet high  i tried to lift one from the ground but could not it must have been five hundredweight the smallest daras held eighty or a hundred pounds  i calculated that there was at least two tons  when freshly made it is very good but at these feasts it is always old and sour and dripping with cocoa nut oil  the daras or wooden bowls into which it is put are almost always carved and inlaid with motherofpearl shell  there was a great crowd at the landingplace at saa malanta to meet us  nobody knew wate at first but he was soon recognised  the boat was pulled up into a little river and everything stealable taken out  we then went up to the village passing some women crying on the way here as at uleawa crying seems to be the sign of joy or welcome  wates fathers new house is the best i have seen in any of these islands  it has two rooms the drawingroom is about forty five feet long by thirty wide with a roof projecting about six feet outside the wall at the end and four feet at the eaves the bedroom is about eighteen feet wide so that the whole roof covers about seventy feet by forty  wates father lives like a chief of the olden time with large property but nothing of his own all that he has or gets goes as soon as he gets it to his retainers  august 3rdwent to heuru  the bwea began about ten oclock  a bwea means a stage but the word is used as we speak of the stage there is a stage in this case about three feet square twenty feet from the ground walled in to three feet height on three sides with a ladder of two stout poles  on the bwea sit or stand two or three men on either side having a bag visitors run up the ladder put their money or porpoise teeth into the bags if small give it to the men if large and if their present is worth it make a speech a little way down the ladder  a party from a village generally send up a spokesman and when he has done go up in a body and give their money  taki was orator for waiio and i led the party with my present of beads which if red or white pass as money  the object of a bwea is to get money but it may only be held on proper occasions the occasion of this was the adoption of a mara lad by the chief man at heuru to get money to pay the lads friends he held a bwea that all his friends might help him  as he was a connection of takis and waiio is the richest of the settlements he got great spoils from thence at tawatana the young men put on petticoats of cocoanut leaves and danced their graceful mao  i had only seen it before at norfolk island it is very pretty but must be very difficult to learn they say that not many know it  at nora they danced another most dirty dance all the performers were daubed from head to foot with mud and wore masks covered with mud and ashes the aim of the dance as far as i could see was to ridicule all sorts of infirmities and imbecilities tottering limping staggering and reeling but in time and order  one man had a basket of dripping mud on his head which was streaming down his face and back all the time a great point is that the actors should not be recognised  mr brooke was likewise dropped at florida  after this the rest of the party had gone on to mota where george sarawia was found working away well at his school plenty of attendants and the whole place clean wellventilated and wellregulated  a watch sent out as a present to sarawia was a delight which he could quite appreciate and he had sent back very sensible rightminded letters  of bishop pattesons voyage the history is pieced together from two letters one to the sisters the other to the bishop of lichfield  neither was begun till september after which they make a tolerably full diary  more than five weeks have passed since i left new zealand more than three since i left norfolk island  mr codrington and i reached mota on the morning of the eighth day after leaving norfolk island  i spent but half an hour on shore with george sarawia and his people sailed across to aroa and matlavo where i landed eight or ten of our scholars and came on at once to the solomon islands  on sunday morning september 4 what joy to find mr atkin well and hearty  mr brooke who took up his abode at the village of mboli had with him dudley lankana and richard maru but they were a good deal absorbed by their relations and not so useful to him as had been hoped though they kept out of heathen habits and remained constant to their intention of returning  brooke says the bishop knows and speaks the one language of anudha very well for there is but one language with a few dialectical varieties of course  a nice little house was built for him at mboli which i have always thought to be a very healthy place  the coral grit and sand runs a long way in shore under cocoanut groves but there is no very dense undergrowth  the wind when easterly blows freely along and is drawn rather upon the shore there two miles to windward of mboli is the good harbour of sara where the vessel anchored with us  brookes house was raised on poles five feet from the ground the floor made of neat smooth bamboos basketworked  he had his table and two benches one easy cane chair cork bed boxes harmonium and plenty of food  close to his house is the magnificent kiala or boat house about 180 feet long 42 high and about as many feet broad a really grand imposing place  here brooke in surplice with his little band had his sunday services singing hymns and chanting psalms in parts in the presence of from 150 to 300 once nearly 400 people to whom he spoke of course usually twice making two sermonets  the island is unlike any other much more open much less bush but it is not coral crag that crops out but almost bare reddish rock with but little soil on it and the population which is large finds it hard to procure food  three brothers takua savai and dikea are the principal men local chiefs exercise some small authority in each village  anudha or aunta is properly the name of a small island for there is no one great mainland but many islands separated by very narrow saltwater creeks and rivers along which a skiff may be sculled  brooke has been over every part of it  his only difficulties arose from jealousy on the part of takua and savai who living at mboli were very wroth at his not being their tame pakeha at his asserting his independence his motive in coming to teach all and make known to all alike a common message  especially they were indignant at his making up small parties of boys from different parts of the island as they of course wanted to monopolise him and through him the trade  he has evidently been firm and friendly too keeping his temper yet speaking out very plainly  the result as far as bringing boys goes is that we have now thirteen on board including dudley and richard from six different parts of the island  but so vexed was takua that he would not fulfil his promise of sending his two little girls  the fortnight spent in the solomon islands has been very fine winds very light and very little rain  we have at length got stephen taroniaras child a little girl of about seven years old paraitaku from the old grandmother and aunts  so thank god she will be brought up as a christian child  she is a dear little thing  this work of mr atkin and mr brooke in the easterly and more northwesterly parts of the solomon islands respectively is the nearest approach that has yet been made to regular missionary operations there  our short visits in the southern cross or my short three to ten days visits on shore are all useful as preparing the way for something more  but it is the quiet lengthened staying for some months among these islanders that gives opportunities for knowing them and their ways  they do everything with endless talk and discussion about it and it is only by living with and moving about constantly among them that any hold can be gained over them i think that the mission is now in a more hopeful state than ever before in these islands  our parties of scholars are large  they trust quite little fellows with us and for any length of time  true these little fellows cannot exercise any influence for years to come but if we take young men or lads of sixteen or eighteen years old it needs as many years to qualify them with heathen habits to be unlearned and with the quickness of apprehension of new teaching already gone for being useful among their people as would suffice for the arrival of these young children at mature age  three tikopian giants had made a visit at mota in the course of this year attracted by the fame of the hospitality and fertility of the place  george sarawia had got on well with them and tried to keep them to meet the bishop but one of them fell sick and the others took him away  this was hailed as a possible opening to those two curious isles oanuta and tikopia in so far as the southern cross work was concerned  the bishop continues to his former primate  on the whole things seem to be going on favourably  the banks islanders are very shy now of the vessels sent to carry off men to fiji or queensland  they will find their way into the solomon islands soon  one indeed a cutter has taken about twenty men from ulava  they were all kept under hatches  we warn the people wherever we go  the pressing question now is how to supply our young men and women married christian couples with proper occupations to prevent their acquiescing in an indolent useless selfish life  when their education is finished they have no profession no need to work to obtain a livelihood for themselves wives and children they cant all be clergymen nor all even teachers in such a sense as to make it a calling and occupation  some wants they havehouses fit for persons who like reading and writing a table a bench a window becomes necessary  coral lime houses would be good for them  they make and wear light clothing they wash and cook on new principles c but these wants are soon supplied  only a practical sense of the duty of helping others to know what they have been taught will keep them from idleness and its consequences  and how few of us with no other safeguard against idleness would be other than idle  some i think may be helped by being associated with us and with their friends of the solomon isles new hebrides in spending some months on shore where they would soon acquire a fair knowledge of the language and might be of great use to less advanced friends this would be a real work for them  just as mission work is the safeguard of the settled church so it must be the safeguard of these young native churches  no doubt the missionary spirit infused into the samoan and karotongan churches kept them living and fruitful  i am trying to think upon these points  if the contrast be too violent between the mission station with its daily occupations and the island life it becomes very difficult for the natives to perpetuate the habits of the one amidst the circumstances of the other  the habits acquired at norfolk island ought to be capable of being easily transferred to the conditions of the melanesian isles  they ought i think to wear in the hot summer and on week days light loose clothing which could be worn at home or clothing of the same shape and fit though perhaps of warm materials might be worn  the circumstances of the two places must be different but we must minimise the difference as much as possible  i often think of the steadygoing english family with regular family prayers and attendance twice at church on sunday and the same people spending two months on the continent  no opportunity is made for family prayers before the table dhôte breakfast and at least one part of the sunday is spent in the roman catholic cathedral or in a different way from the home use  and if this be so with good respectable folk among ourselves what must be the effect of altered circumstances on our melanesians  it is not easy to keep up the devotional life on shore at home or in the islands or on board ship with the same regularity  and where the convert must be more dependent than we ought to be on external opportunities the difficulty is increased  so if the alteration be as little as possible we gain something we make it easier to our scholars to perpetuate uninterruptedly the norfolk island life  to live with them and try to show them how on their island to keep up the religious life unchanged amidst the changed outward circumstances is a good way but then we cant live among them very long and our example is so often faulty  curiously do these practical difficulties make us realise that there may really be some benefit in artificial wants and that probably the most favourable situation for the development of the human character is a climate where the necessaries of life are just sufficiently difficult of production to require steady industry and yet that nature should not be so rigorous as to make living so hard a matter as to occupy the whole attention and dwarf the mental faculties  how remarkable is the date of the following thoughts almost like a foreboding  september 19th 10 am to the sisterswe are drawing near santa cruz about 100 miles off  how my mind is filled with hopes not unmingled with anxiety  it is more than eleven years since we sought to make an opening here and as yet we have no scholar  last year i went ashore at a large village called taive about seven miles from the scene of our disaster  many canoes came to us from that spot and we stood in quite close in the vessel so that people swam off to us  they are all fighting among the various villages and neighbouring islets of the reef archipelago twenty miles north of the main island  it is very difficult what to do or how to try to make a beginning  god will open a door in his own good time  yet to see and seize on the opportunity when given is difficult  how these things make one feel more than ever the need of divine guidance the gift of the spirit of wisdom and counsel and ghostly strength  to human eyes it seems almost hopeless  yet other islanders were in a state almost as hopeless apparently  only there is a something about santa cruz which is probably very unreal and imaginary which seems to present unusual difficulties  in a few days i may by gods goodness be writing to you again about our visit to the group  and if the time be come may god grant us some opening and grace to use it aright  at piteni matama nupani analogo i can talk somewhat to the people who are polynesians and speak a dialect connected with the maori of new zealand  i think that the people of indeni the native name for santa cruz are also more than half polynesians but i dont know a single sentence of their language properly  i can say nothing about it  they destroy and distort their organs of pronunciation by excessive use of the betelnut and pepper leaf and lime so that no word is articulately pronounced  it is very hard to catch the sounds they make amidst the hubbub on deck or the crowds on shore yet i think that if we had two or three lads quietly with us at norfolk island we should soon make out something  dont think i am depressed by this  i only feel troubled by the sense that i frequently lose opportunities from indolence and other faults  i am quite aware that we can do very little to bring about an introduction to these islanders and i fully believe that in some quite unexpected way or at all events in some way brought about independently of our efforts a work will be begun here some day in the day when god sees it to be fit and right   to the bishop of lichfield   september 27thleaving santa cruz we came to this group from ulava with light fair winds left ulava on saturday at 6 pm and sighted the island making the west side of graciosa bay on the next wednesday sea quite smooth thermometer reached 92 degrees  sundayvery calm but a light breeze took us into nukapu  a canoe came off i made them understand that it was our day of rest and that i would visit them atainu tomorrow a curious word  i gave a few presents and we slowly sailed on  monday 6 amoff piteni canoe off went ashore low tide got into a canoe and so reached the beach people well behaved much talk of taking lads quite well understood  the speech is you remember very maori indeed  there were some nice lads but no one came away  four canoes from taumaho were here and two piteni men came back from taumaho while i was on shore  at nukapu at 230 pm  high water went in easily over the reef by a short cut not by our old winding narrow passage  i was greatly pleased by the people asking me on board where is bisambe  here i am  no no the bisambe tuai of old  your mutua father  is he below  why doesnt he come up with some hatchets  so you see they remember you  a tall middleaged man moto said that he was with us in the boat in 1859 and he and i remembered the oneeyed man who piloted us  i went here also into the houses  here is a quaint place many things not altogether idols but uncanny and feared by the people women danced in my honour people gave small presents c but no volunteers  i could talk with them with sufficient ease and took my time lying at my ease on a good mat with cane pillow anaiteum fashion  i told them that they had seen on board many little fellows from many islands that they need not fear to let their children go that i could not spend time and property in coming year by year and giving presents when they were unwilling to listen to what i said but they only made unreal promises put boys in the boat merely to take them out again and so we went away atrakoi  there is a little weariness of spiritsnot of spiritin the contemporaneous words to the home party  i dont know what to write about this voyage  you have heard all about tropical vegetation santa cruz canoes houses customs c if indeed i could draw these fellows among whom i was lying on a mat on monday if you could see the fuzzy heads stained white and red the great shell ornaments on the arms the round plate of shell as big as a small dinner plate hanging over the chest the large holes in the lobes of the ears rilled with perhaps fifteen or twenty rings of tortoiseshell hung on to one another the woven scarves and girdles stained yellow with turmeric and stamped with a black pattern then it would make a curious sight for you and your worthy brother much at his ease lying flat on his back on two or three mats talking to the people about his great wish to take away some of the jolly little fellows to whom he was giving fishhooks would no doubt be very interesting  but really all this has become so commonplace that i cant write about it with any freshness  the volcano in this group tenakulu is now active and was a fine sight at night though the eruption is not continuous as it was in 1859  october 9thnear ambrym to the bishop  some people from aruas the large western bay of vanua lava had been taken by force to queensland or fiji  the natives simply speak of a ship of sydney  wednesdayaroa and matlavo  henry tagalana and joanna and their baby elizabeth william pasvorang and lydia and six others all baptized and four communicants among them had spent five weeks on shore a very nice set  six of them lived together at aroa had regular morning and evening prayers sang their hymns and did what they could talking to their people  codrington went over in a canoe and spent four days with them much pleased  we brought three scholars for george from thence  thursday motacodrington says the time is come in his opinion for some steps to be taken to further the movement in mota  grownup people much changed improved some almost to be regarded as catechumens  we left mota bringing all that were to come indeed we scarcely know what it is nowadays to lose a boy or mana great blessing there had been another visit of eleven canoes of tikopians friendly though unable to converse and promising to return again in two months  october 11tha topsail schooner in sight between ambrym and paamaone of those kidnapping vessels  i have any amount of to me conclusive evidence of downright kidnapping  but i dont think i could prove any case in a sydney court  they have no names painted on some of their vessels and the natives cant catch nor pronounce the names of the white men on board  they describe their appearance accurately and we have more than suspicions about some of these fellows  the planters in queensland and fiji who create the demand for labourers say that they dont like the kidnapping any more than i do  they pay occasionally from £6 to £12 for an imported labourer and they dont want to have him put into their hands in a sullen irritable state of mind  touching at nengone the bishop saw mr creagh who had recently visited new caledonia whither basset the poor chief who had been banished to tahiti for refusing to receive a french priest had been allowed to return on the emperor napoleon forbidding interference with protestant missionaries or their converts  wadrokala and his wife and child were brought away making up a number of 65 black passengers besides the 60 scholars already at norfolk island  the weather throughout the voyage had been unusually still with frequent calms the sea with hardly any swell  and this had been very happy for the bishop but he was less well than when he had left taurarua and was unequal to attending the general synod in new zealand far more so to another campaign in australia though he cherished the design of going to see after the condition of the labourers in fiji  he finishes his long letter to his former primate  it is perhaps cowardly to say that i am thankful that i am not a clergyman in england  i am not the man even in a small parish to stand up and fight against so many manyheaded monsters  i should give in and shirk the contest  the more i pray that you may have strength to endure it  i dont think i was ever pugnacious in the way of controversy and i am very very thankful to be out of it  indeed the tone of the references to church matters at home had become increasingly cautious and one long letter to mrs martyn he actually tore up lest it should do harm  his feeling more and more was to wish for patience and forbearance and to deprecate violent words or hasty actionslooking from his hermit life upon all the present distress more as a phase of church history that would develop into some form of good and perhaps hardly sensible of the urgency of the struggle and defence  for peace and shelter from the strife of tongues was surely one of the compensating blessings conferred on him  but as all his companions agree he was never the same man again after his illness  there was a lower level of spirits and of energy a sensitiveness to annoyances and an indisposition to active exertion which distressed him  his day began as early as ever and was mapped out as before for classes of all kinds hebrew and reading but he seldom left his room except for chapel and meals being unable to take much outdoor exercise  he did not see so much of his elder scholars as before chiefly because the very large number of newer pupils made it necessary to employ them more constantly but he never failed to give each of them some instruction for a short time every day though with more effort for indeed almost everything had become a burthen to him  mr codringtons photograph taken at this time shows how much changed and aged he had become  the quiet in which he now lived resulted in much letterwriting taking up correspondences that had slumbered in more busy times as his mind flew back to old friends though indeed the letters given in the preceding memoir must not be taken by any means to represent the numbers he wrote  when he speaks of sending thirtyfive by one mail perhaps only one or two have come into my hands and of those only such portions are of course taken as illustrate his life work character and opinions without trenching on the reserve due to survivors  thus multitudes of affectionate letters participating in the joys and sorrows of his brother his cousins and friends can necessarily find no place here though the idea of his character is hardly complete without direct evidence of the unbroken or more truly increasing sympathy he had with those whom he had not met for sixteen years and his love for his brothers wife and children whom he had never seen  soon after his return to norfolk island came a packet with a three months accumulation of home despatches  he read and replied in his old conversational way with occasionally a revelation of his deep inner self  i have been thinking dear old fan about your words there would be a good deal to give and take if you came home for a time less perhaps now than before i was somewhat tamed by my illness  i see more of the meaning of that petition from all blindness of heart from pride vainglory and hypocrisy and from all uncharitableness  alas you dont know what a misspent life i looked back upon never losing hold god be praised of the sure belief in his promises of pardon and acceptance in christ  i certainly saw that a want of sympathy an indifference to the feelings of others want of consideration selfishness in short lay at the bottom of very much that i mourned over  there is one thing that i dont mention as an excuse for a fault which really does exist but simply as a fact viz that being always even now pressed for time i write very abruptly and so seem to be much more positive and dogmatic than i hope and really think is the case  i dont remember ever writing you a letter in which i was able to write but as i would have talked out the matter under discussion in all its bearings  this arises partly from impatience my pen wont go fast enough but as i state shortly my opinion without going through the reasons which lead me to adopt it no doubt much that i say seems to be without reason and some of it no doubt is  i need make no excuse for giving as much as possible of the correspondence of these last few months whenthough the manner of his actual departure was violent there was already the shadow as it were of death upon him  to sir j t coleridge the letter was   december 9 1870  my dearest unclehow long it is since i wrote to you and yet it is true that i think more often of you than of anyone except jem joan and fan  in fact your name meets me so often in one way or anotherin papers from england and much more in books continually in use that i could not fail to think of you if i had not the true deep love that brings up the old familiar face and voice so often before my eyes  i wish i could talk with you or rather hear you answer my many questions on so many points  i get quite bewildered sometimes  it is hard to read the signs of our times so hard to see where charity ends and compromise begins where the old opinion is to be stoutly maintained and where the new mode of thought is to be accepted  i suppose there always was some little difference among divines as to fundamentals and no readymade solution exists of each difficult question as it emerges  there is reason for that being so because it is part of our duty and trial to exercise our own power of discretion and judgment  but so much now seems to be left to individuals and so little is accepted on authority  in church matters i have for years thought synods to be the one remedy  if men meet and talk over a difficulty there is a probability of mens understanding each others motives and thus preserving charity  if onetwentieth part of a diocese insists upon certain observances which nineteentwentieths repudiate it seems clear that the very small minority is put out of court  yet how often the small minority contains more salt than the large majority  i know indeed i am speaking honestly that i am not worthy to understand dear mr keble on many points  the secret of our lord is with such men and we fail to understand him nous autres i mean outside the sanctuary  yet there is i must confess it to you my dear uncle a something about his book on eucharistic adoration which has the character to me of foreign rather than of english divinity i dont want to be exclusive far from it  i dont want to be anglican versus primitive but yet somehow to me there is a something which belongs more to french or italian than to english character about some parts of the book  it is no doubt because i cant see what to his eye was plain  an account of the voyage follows as before given  the islanders are beginning to find out the true character of the many small vessels cruising among them taking away people to the plantations in queensland fiji c  so now force is substituted for deceit natives are enticed on board under promises by signs of course for nowhere can they talk to them of presents tempted down below into the hold to get tomahawks beads biscuit c then the hatches are clapped on and they are stolen away  i have to try and write a statement about it which is the last thing i can do properly  then the history of the weddings and baptisms  there is another pleasant feature to be noticed  the older scholars almost all of whom are banks islanders talk and arrange among themselves plans for helping natives of the islands  thus edward wogale of mota volunteers to go to anudha 300 or 400 miles off to stay there with his friend charles sapinamba of that island to aid him in working among his people  edward is older and knows more than charles  they talk in mota but edward will soon have to speak the tongue of anudha when living there  b and his wife offer to go to santa maria robert pantatun and his wife to go to matlavo john nonono to go to savo and andrew lalena also  this is very comforting to me  it is bona fide giving up country and home  it is indicative of a real desire to make known the gospel to other lands  so long as they will do this so long i think we may have the blessed assurance that gods holy spirit is indeed working in their hearts  dear fellows  it makes me very thankful  my clerical staff is increased by a mr jackson long a friend and supporter of the mission  atkin is a steadygoing fellow most conscientious with a good headpiece of his own diligent and thoughtful rather than quick  he and bice read hebrew daily with me and they will have soon a very fair knowledge of it  joe atkin knows his greek testament very fairly indeed ellicott trench alford wordsworth and others are in use among us  i wish you could see some of these little fellows  it is i suppose natural that an old bachelor should have pleasure in young things about him readymade substitutes for children of his own  i do like them  with english children save and except pena i never was at my ease partly i think from a worse than foolish self consciousness about so ugly a fellow not being acceptable to children  anyhow i dont feel shy with melanesians and i do like the little things about me even the babies come to me away from almost anyone chiefly perhaps because they are acquainted at a very early age with a corner of my room where dwells a tin of biscuits  to this day i shut up and draw into my shell when any white specimen of humanity looms in sight  how seldom do ones natural tastes coincide with ones work  and i may be deceiving myself all along it is true that i have a very small acquaintance with men not so very small an acquaintance with men passed from this world who live in their books and some living authors i readour english commentators are almost all alive  i think that i read too exclusively one class of books  i am not drawn out of this particular kind of reading which is alone really pleasant and delightful to me by meeting with persons who discuss other matters  so i read divinity almost if not quite exclusively i make dutiful efforts to read a bit of history or poetry but it wont do  my relaxation is in reading some old favourite jackson hooker jeremy taylor c  not that i know much about them for my real studying time is occupied in translating and teaching  and so i read these books and others some german occasionally but seldom french reuss for example and guizot  and on the whole i read a fair amount of hebrew though even now it is only the narrative books that i read so to say rapidly and with ease  i wish some of our good hebrew scholars were sound poly and melanesian scholars also  i believe it to be quite true that the mode of thought of a south sea islander resembles very closely that of a semitic man  and their state of mental knowledge or ignorance too  it is certainly a mistake to make the hebrew language do the work of one of our elaborated european languages the products of thoughts and education and literary knowledge which the hebrew knew nothing of  a hebrew grammar constructed on the principle of a greek or a latin grammar is simply a huge anachronism  how did the people of the time of moses or david or jeremiah think is the first question  how did they express their thoughts is the second  the grammar is but the mode adapted in speech for notifying and communicating thoughts  that the jew did not think consequently did not speak like a european is selfevident  where are we to find people children in thought keenly alive to the outer world impressible emotional but devoid of the power of abstract thought to whom long involved processes of thought and long involved sentences of speech are unknown  consequently the contrivances for stringing together dependent clauses dont exist  then some wiseacre of an 18th or 19th century german writes a grammar on the assumption that a paulopostfuturum is necessarily to be provided for the unfortunate israelite who thought and talked childs language  now we melanesians habitually think and speak such languages  i assure you the hebrew narrative viewed from the melanesian point of thought is wonderfully graphic and lifelike  the english version is dull and lifeless in comparison  no modern hebrew scholar agrees with any other as to the mode of construing hebrew  anyone makes anything out of those unfortunately misused tenses  delitzsch ewald gesenius perowne thrupp kay too give no rule by which the scholar is to know from the grammar whether the time is past present or future ie whether such and such a verse is a narrative of a past fact or the prophecy of a future one  it is much a matter of exegesis but exegesis not based on grammar is worth very little  really the time is not inherent in the tense at all  but that is a strong assertion which i think i could prove give me time and a power of writing clearly  sir william martin is trying to prove it  all languages of the south seas are constructed on the same principle  we say when i get there it will be right  but all south sea islanders i am there and it is right  the time is given by something in the context which indicates that the speakers mind is in past present or future time  in the beginning god made rightly so but not because the tense gives the past sense for the same tense very often cant have anything to do with a past sense but in the beginning indicates a past time  the doctrine of the vaw conversive is simply a figment of socalled grammarians language is not an artificial product but a natural mode of expressing ideas  and if they assume that hebrew has a perfect and imperfect or past and future for the grammars use all kinds of names why on earth should people who have on their showing a past tense use a clumsy contrivance of turning a future tense into a past and vice versa  if people had remembered that language is not a trick invented and contrived by scholars at their desks but a natural gift simple at first and elaborated by degrees they could not have made such a mess  the truth is i think that such a contrivance was devised to make hebrew do what european scholars decided it must do these very men being ignorant of languages in a simple uncivilised form  but my dear uncle what a prose  only as i think a good deal about it you will excuse it i know  well it is time for the weddings  the chapel looks so pretty and you cant believe it so do the girls emma eliza and minnie to be married to edwin mulewasawasa thomas  the native name is a baptismal one nevertheless and a good fellow he is my head nurse in my illness  i cant write about politics  then comes the astounding news of this fearful war  what am i to say to my melanesians about it  do these nations believe in the gospel of peace and goodwill  is the sermon on the mount a reality or not  is such conduct a repudiation of christianity or not  are nations less responsible than individuals  what possible justification is there for this war  it is fearful fearful on every ground  oh this mighty belauded nineteenthcentury civilisation  yet society has improved in some ways  even war is not without its accompaniment of religion  and it brings out kindly sympathy and stimulates works of charity  but what a fearful responsibility lies upon the cause of the war  it is hard to acquit louis napoleon of being really the cause  there would be great pleasure in seeing all the younger ones not equal of course to that of seeing you all but as i get older in my ways and habits i think that my mind goes back more to the young ones  true i have a large family about me 145 melanesians here now  yet there is the want of community of thought on some subjects and the difficulty of perfectly easy communication with them  no melanesian tongue is like english to me  i wrote a first sheet but filled it up with mere stupid thoughts about questions of the day not worth sending  and this long letter badly written too will weary your eyes  i must end  my kindest love to aunt mary and all  always my dearest uncle  your loving and grateful nephew  j c patteson   two letters of december 12 follow the first to bishop abraham   mrs palmers picture of the brides at the last of the weddings the bishop so enjoyed may be acceptable  it went to mrs abraham by the same opportunity  three were married a short time before christmas they with five others were baptized on advent sunday  they had been here about thirteen months and had got on very well during that time improved in every way  i think some of them are loveable girls and it is pleasant to see them so happy and at home here  they were a queerlooking set when they first came or i suppose i thought them so  i got some of the older girls to give them a good wash all over in warm water and then gave them the new clothes  they looked at me in such a curious way  they had heard of me palmers wife from the others but had not seen an englishwoman before  a few days after they came i ran into their room with my hair down and they exclaimed with wonder we ura ras very good almost shouting and then i told them to feel it and some kissed it with gentle reverence as though it were something very extraordinary  they are very kind and obliging in doing anything i want  they have to be looked after a good bit but are very obedient  i did not imagine they would give so little trouble  they are great chatterboxes and very noisy but all in an innocent way  they seldom quarrel among themselves  i dont think their feelings are so strong as those of the maoris either of love or hate  i wish you could have been present at the baptism  they looked so solemn and spoke out very distinctly  they wore white calico jackets and the font was prettily decorated  the whole service was impressive and not less so our good bishops voice and manner  they looked very nice and it was amusing to see how they took it  only one could i get to look in the glass and she said the flowers were too large the other two only submitted to being beautified   i return to the bishops correspondence   norfolk island fourth sunday in advent 1870  my dearest joani am choosinga strange moment to write in  it is 830 am and in an hour i am going to the new church built by the pitcairners to ordain mr c bice priest  i was up as usual early this morning and i am not well and feeling queer and having already read and had morning chapel service i take now this means of quieting myself  you see it is nearly three miles to the town the service will be nearly three hours i dont quite know how i shall get through it  i thought of having the service here but our little chapel wont hold even our melanesian party 80 out of 145 who attend public prayers and of course the islanders want to see and it is good for them to see an ordination  this is my first expedition to the town since i came from the islands i shall have a horse in case i am very tired but i would rather walk all the way if i can  just now i am headachy and seedy too but i think it is all coming right again  i hope to have a bright happy christmas  after this days ordination we shall number one bishop six priests and one deacon  there are three or four melanesians who ought soon to be ordained and if it is possible for me to spend two or three months this next winter at mota i must read with george and perhaps ordain him priest  it troubles me much that during all these summer months there can be no administration of the holy communion though there are six communicants besides george now living for good at mota  there will be four or five next year taking up their abode at the neighbouring island of aroa  dear joan  at such times as these when one is engaged in a specially solemn work there is much heartsearching and i cant tell you how my conscience accuses me of such systematic selfishness during many long years  i do see it now though only in part  i mean i see how i was all along making self the centre and neglecting all kinds of duties social and others in consequence  i think that selfconsciousness a terrible malady is ones misfortune as well as ones fault  but the want of any earnest effort at correcting a fault is worse perhaps than the fault itself and i feel such great such very great need for amendment here  this great fault brings its punishment in part even now  i mean there is a want of brightness cheerfulness elasticity of mind about the conscious man or woman  he is prone to have gloomy narrow sullen thoughts to brood over fancied troubles and difficulties because making everything refer to and depend on self he naturally can get none of that comfort which they enjoy whose minds naturally turn upwards for help and light  in this way i do suffer a good deal  my chariotwheels often drag very heavily  i am not often in what you may call good spirits  and yet i am aware that i am writing now under the influence of a specially depressing disorder and that i may misinterpret my real state of mind  no one ought to be happier as far as advantages of employment in a good service and kindness of friends c can contribute to make one happy  and on the whole i know my life is a happy one  i am sure that i have a far larger share of happiness than falls to the lot of most people  only i do feel very much the lack almost the utter lack of just that grace which was so characteristic of our dear father that simplicity and real humility and truthfulness of character  well one doesnt often say these things to another person  but it is a relief to say them  i know the remedy quite well  it is a very simple case for the doctor to deal with but it costs the patient just everything short of life when you have to dig right down and cut out by the roots an evil of a whole life standing  i assure you that it is hard work because these feelings of ours are such intangible untractable things  it is hard to lay hold of and mould and direct them  but i pray god that i may not willingly yield to these gloomy unloving feelings  as often as i look out of myself upon him his love and goodness then i catch a bright gleam  i think that you will not suspect me of being in a morbid state of mind  you will say poor old fellow he was seedy and depressed when he wrote all that  and thats true but not the whole truth  i have much need of your prayers indeed for grace and strength to correct faults of which i am conscious to say nothing of unknown sin  the ordination is over a quiet solemn service  the new church which i had not seen is very creditable to the people who built it themselves  it is wooden about thirtysix or thirtyeight feet high will hold 500 people well  mr  nobbs preached a very good sermon  i got on very well singing very good  five priests assisting in this little place  christmas evewhat a meaning one of my favourite hymns xxxviii in book of praise has when one thinks of this awful war how hard to realize the suffering and misery the rage and exasperation the pride and exaltation  how hard to be thankful enough for the blessings of peace in this little spot  our chapel is beautifully decorated  a star at the east end over the word emmanuel all in golden everlasting flame with lilies and oleanders in front of young norfolk island pines and evergreens  seven new communicants tomorrow morning  and all things god be praised happy and peaceful about us  all christmas blessings and joys to you dear ones  christmas day 3 pmsuch a happy day  such a solemn quiet service at 7 am followed by a short joyous 11 am service christmas hymn one with words set to the tune for hark the herald angels sing  you know we never have the litany on sundays because everybody is in chapel twice a day and we of course have it on wednesday and friday and every native communion sunday ie every alternate sunday we have no communion service at 11 am as our communicants have been in chapel at the 7 oclock service so today the lessons being short the service including my short service was over by 1120  now we have a weeks holiday that is no school though i think it is hard work inasmuch as the preparing plans for school lessons rearranging classes sketching out the work is tiring to me  then i have such heaps of letters which do worry me  but on the other hand i get much quiet time for some reading and i enjoy that more than anything  ten of our party were in chapel at 11 am with us for the first time  you know that we dont allow everyone to come but only those that we believe to be aware of the meaning of prayer and who can read and are in a fair way to be catechumens all these ten will i hope be baptized this summer  we are obliged seriously to think of a proper chapel  the present one is 45 ft by 19 ft and too small  it is only a temporary oblong room very nice because we have the crimson hangings handsome sandalwood lectern and some good carving  but we have to cram about eighty persons into it and on occasions baptisms and confirmations or at an ordination when others come we have no room  mr codrington understands these things well and not only as an amateur archaeologist he knows the principle of building well in stone and wood  especially useful in this knowledge here where we work up our own material to a great extent  our notionhis notion ratheris to have stone foundations and solid stone buttresses to carry a light roof  then the rest will be wood  it ought to be about sixty feet by thirty exclusive of chancel and apse  when we get all the measurements carefully made we shall send exact accounts of the shape and size of the windows and suggest subjects for stained glass by hardman or whoever might now be the best man i hope that it wont cost very much £perhaps 500  december 21stwe have not had a fine christmas week heavy rain and hot winds  but the rain has done much good  the norfolk islanders have much influenza but we are at present quite free from it  yesterday i spent two hours in training and putting to rights my stephanotis which now climbs over half my verandah  i have such japanese lilies making ready to put forth their splendours  two or three azaleas grow well  rhododendrons wont grow well  my little pines grow well and are about seven feet high  it is very pleasant to see the growth of these things when i return from the voyage  the pottering about the little gardens the parklike paddocks with our sheep and cattle and horses gives me some exercise every day i go about quietly and very often by myself with a book  after thinking of all kinds of things and persons i think that my increased and increasing unwillingness to write is one proof of my not being so strong or vigorous  i cant tell you what an effort it is to me to write a business letter and i almost dread a long effusion from anyone because though i like reading it i have the thought of the labour of answering it in my mind  then again i who used to be so very talkative am taciturn now occasionally i victimize some unfortunate with a flow of language about some point of divinity or if i get a hearer on south sea languages i can bore him with much satisfaction to myself  but i am so stupid about small talk  i cannot make it  when i have to try with some norfolk islander eg it does weary me so  mind i dont despise it  but instead of being a relaxation it is of all things the hardest work to me  i am very dull in that way you know  and sometimes i think people must take me to be sullen for i never know how to keep the talk going  then if i do talk i get upon some point that no one cares for and bore everybody  so here too i fall back on my own set of friends who are most tolerant of my idiosyncrasies and on my melanesians who dont notice them  your loving brother  j c p  in spite of this distaste for writing a good many letters were sent forth during the early months of 1871 most of them the final ones to each correspondent  the next to miss mackenzie is a reply to one in which by bishop wilkinsons desire she had sought for counsel regarding the zulu mission especially on questions that she knew by experience to be most difficult ie of inculcating christian modesty and likewise on the qualifications of a native ministry   norfolk island jan 26 1871  my dear miss mackenziein addition to a very long and interesting letter of yours i have a letter from my sister who has just seen you at havant so i must lose no more time in writing  first let me say that i am as sure as i can be of anything that i have not registered that i wrote to thank you for the prints long ago  indeed all these many gifts of yours are specially valuable as having been once the property of your brother of whom it seems presumptuous for me to speak and as having actually been used in mission work in so distant a part of the world  i need not say that thomas a kempis his sextant and his pedometer are among my few real valuables  for the use of the prints i cant say much on my own knowledge  my classes are for the most part made up of lads and young men teachers or preparing for confirmation or holy communion one class always of younger ones being prepared for baptism and sometimes youths newcomers when we have to take in hand a new language  those prints are not of much use therefore to my special classes  most of them have passed beyond the stage of being taught by pictures though they like to look at them  but mrs palmer has been using them constantly with the girls classes and so with the less advanced classes throughout the school  one difficulty will to the end be that by the time we can talk freely to our scholars and they can understand their own language employed as a vehicle for religious teaching they are not sufficiently supplied with books  true we have translations of such parts of the bible as quite enable us to teach all that a christian need know and do but i often wish for plenty of good useful little books on other subjects and i dont see my way to this  our own press is always at work printing translations c  it is not easy to write the proper kind of book in these languages and how are they to be printed  we havent time to print them here and who is to correct the press elsewhere  the great fact in your letter is the account of bishop wilkinsons consecration  i am heartily glad to hear of it and i will send if i can now if not soon an enclosure to him for you to forward  i doubt if i can help him by any means as to qualifications of candidates for holy orders c our work is quite in a tentative state and i am sometimes troubled to see that this mission is supposed to be in a more advanced state than is really the case  for example the report of a man going ashore dressed as a bishop with a bible in his hand to entice the natives away assumes islands to be in a state where the conventional man in white tie and black tail coat preaches to the natives  my costume when i go ashore is an old crimean shirt a very ancient wideawake  not a syllable has in all probability ever been written except in our small notebooks of the language of the island  my attention is turned to keeping the crowd in goodhumour by a few simple presents of fishhooks beads c  only at mota is there a resident christian and even there people who dont know what mota was and what a melanesian island for the most part alas still is would see nothing to indicate a change for the better except that the people are unarmed and would be friendly and confiding in their manner to a stranger  i hardly know how to bring my melanesian experience to bear upon zululand  the immorality infanticide superstition c seem to be as great in a melanesian island as in any part of the heathen world and with our many languages it is not possible for us toknow the slang of the various islands  we must be cheery about it all  just see what the old writers eg chrysostom say about christian nominally morals and manners at wedding feasts and generally  impurity is the sin par excellence of all unchristian people  look at st pauls words to the corinthians and others  and we must not expect though we must aim at and hope and pray for much that we dont see yet  what opportunity will bishop wilkinson have for testing the practical teaching power and steady conduct of his converts  many of our melanesians have their classes here and we can form an opinion of their available knowledge how far they can reproduce what they know c we can see too whether they exercise any influence over the younger ones  twelve this season are counted as sixth form or monitors or whatever you please to call them  then ensues an account of the rotation of industrial work c  the other day i was examining an ysabel lad not formally in school but he happened to be in my room as they are always hanging about as you know  he knew much more than i expected who taught you all this  i am very well pleased  wogale was the answer  edward wogale is george sarawais own brother volunteering now to go to anudha florida near ysabel island  if i see that a young man by his written notes little essays so to say analysis of lessons understands what he has been taught and if i see by the proficiency of his pupils that he can reproduce and communicate this teaching to others then one part of the question of his fitness is answered  if he has been here for years always well conducted and if when at home occasionally he has always behaved well and resisted temptation and perhaps i should add if he is respectably married or about to be married to a decent christian girl then we may hope that the matter of moral fitness may be hopefully settled  assuming this and thank god i believe i may assume that it is the case with several here now as soon as a deacon is required in any place that he is willing to work in i should not hesitate to ordain him but i cant specify exactly what his qualifications ought to be because i cant undertake to settle the difficult question of what constitutes absolutely essential teaching for a christian ie the doctrine of fundamentals  practically one can settle it and that quite as well as in england where there is and must be any amount of inequality in the attainments and earnestness of the candidates and where no examination can secure the fitness or even the mental capacity of the minister  i say to myself here is an island or a part of an island from which we have had a good many scholars  some married ones are going back to live permanently  they are christians and some are communicants  they wish to do what they can to get the young ones about them for regular school and to talk to the older people  they all have and can use their prayerbooks  the people are friendly is there one among them of whom i can humanly speaking feel sure that by gods blessing he will lead a good life among them and that he can and will teach them faithfully the elements of christian truth and practice  if we all agree that there is such a one why not ordain him  but i want to see people recognising the office of deacon as something very distinct indeed from that of the priest  it is a very different matter indeed when we come to talk about candidates for priests orders  again look at the missionary clergy of old times  no doubt in mediaeval times so much stress was laid upon the mere perfunctory performance of the ministerial act as apart from careful teaching of the meaning and purport of the act that the mediaeval missionary is so far not a very safe model for us to imitate  but i suppose that multitudes of men did good work who could no more comprehend nor write out the result of lessons that edward henry edmund robert and twenty others here are writing out than our english peasant can comprehend a learned theological treatise  and we must consider the qualifications of ones native clergy in relation to the work that they have to do  they have not to teach theology to educated christians but to make known the elements of gospel truth to ignorant heathen people  if they can state clearly and forcibly the very primary leading fundamental truths of the gospel and live as simpleminded humble christians that is enough indeed  perhaps this is as likely to make the bishop understand my notions on the subject as any more detailed account of the course of instruction  i really have not time to copy out some ten or twelve pages of some older lads notebook  i think you would be satisfied with their work  i dont mean of course the mere writing which is almost always excellent but there is a ready apprehension of the meaning of any point clearly put before them which is very satisfactory  i am now thinking of the twenty or thirty best among our 145 scholars  this is a confused almost unintelligible scrawl but i am busy and not very fresh for work  yours very truly  j c patteson   a letter to bishop abraham was in hand at the same time full of replies to the information in one newly received from this much valued friend  after deploring an attack of illness from which mrs abraham had been suffering comes the remark  you know what one always feels that one cant be unhappy about good people whatever happens to them  i do so enjoy your talk about church works in england  it makes the modern phraseology intelligible  i know now what is meant by missions and missioners and retreats  i was thinking lately of george herbert at hereford as i read the four sermons which vaughan lately preached there one on the atonement which i liked very much indeed  the cathedral has been beautifully restored has it not  then i think of you in york minster on november 20 with that good text from psalm xcvi  i read your letter on tuesday on which day our morning psalms in chapel are always chanted xcv xcvi xcvii  the application seems very natural but to work out those applications is difficult  the more i read sermons and i read a good many the more i wonder how men can write them  mind i will gladly pay charley ten shillings a sermon if he will copy it out for me  it will do the boy good  dear old tutor used to fag me to write copies of the bishops long new zealand letters as i wrote a decent hand then  dont i remember a long one from anaiteum and how i wondered where on earth or sea anaiteum could be  i want to hear men talk on these matters the eucharistic question who represent the view that is least familiar to me  and then i feel when it comes to a point of greek criticism sad regret and almost remorse at my old idleness and foolish waste of time when i might have made myself a decent scholar  i cram up passages instead of applying a scholarly habit of mind to the examination of them and now too it is harder than ever to correct bad habits of inattention inaccuracy c  i am almost too weary oftentimes to do my work anyhow much less can i make an effort to improve my way of doing it  but i must be content thankful to get on somehow or other and to be able to teach the fellows something  it is quite curious to see how often one is baffled in ones attempts to put oneself en rapport with the melanesian mind  if one can manage it they really show one that they know a good deal not merely by heart or as matter of memory that is worth little but they show that they can think  but often they seem utterly stupid and lost and one is perplexed to know what their difficulty can possibly be  one thing is clear that they have little faculty of generalization  as you know they seldom have a name for their island but only names for each tiny headland and bay and village the name for the island you must learn from the inhabitants of another island who view the one whose name you are seeking as one because being distant it must appear to them in its oneness not in its many various parts  just so they find it very difficult to classify any ideas under general heads  ask for details and you get a whole list of them  ask for general principles and only a few can answer  for example it is not easy to make them see how all temptations to sin were overcome in the three representative assaults made upon him in the wilderness how love is the fulfilling of the law or how the violation of one commandment is the violation of the principle of all  then they have much difficulty from shyness partly and a want of teaching when young in expressing themselves  they really know much that only skilful questioning much more skilful than mine can get out of them  it wantsall teaching doesa man with lots of animal spirits health pluck vigour c  every year i find it more difficult   to another of the new zealand friends who had returned to england there was a letter on jan 31   my dear mr  lloydi must send you a line though i have little to say  and i should be very sorry if we did not correspond with some attempt at regularity  what can one think of long without the mind running off to france what a wonderful story it is  only old testament language can describe it only a prophet can moralise upon it  it is too dreadful in its suddenness and extent  one fears that vice and luxury and ungodliness have destroyed whatever of chivalry and patriotism there once was in the french character  to think that this is the country of st louis and bayard  the empire seems almost systematically to have completed the demoralisation of the people  there is nothing left to appeal to nothing on which to rally  it is an awful thing to see such judgments passing before our very eyes  so fearful a humiliation may do something yet for the french people but i dread even worse news  it nearly came the other day to a repetition of the old danton and robespierre days  here we are going on happily i would give something to spend a quiet sunday with you in your old church  how pleasant to have an old church  always yours affectionately  j c patteson   my own last letter came at the same time   norfolk island february 16th 1871  my dear cousini must not leave your letter of last october without an instalment of an answer though this is only a chance opportunity of sending letters by a whaler and i have only ten minutes  your account of the southampton congress is a regular picture  i thinly i can see the bishops of winton sarum and oxon and all that you say by way of comment on what is going off in the church at home interests me exceedingly  you cant think what a treat your letters are  you see mr codrington is the only one of my age and so to say education here and so to commune with one who thinks much on these matters which of course have the deepest interest for me is very pleasant and useful  on this account i do so value the bishop of salisburys letters and it is so very kind of him to write to me in the midst of the overwhelming occupations of an english diocese  i dont think you have mentioned dr vaughan  i read his books with much interest  he doesnt belong to the keble theology but he seems to me to be a thoughtful useful and eminently practical writer  he seems to know what men are thinking of and to grapple with their difficulties  i am pleased with a little book by canon norris key to the new testament the work of a man who has read a good deal and thought much  he condenses into a 2s 6d book the work of years  you are all alive now trying to work up your parochial schools to efficiency markrather you were doing so for i think there was only time allowed up to december 31 1870  i hope that the efforts were successful  at such times one wishes to see great noble gifts men of great riches giving their £10000 to a common fund  then i remember that the claims and calls are so numerous in england that very wealthy men can hardly give in that way  certainly i am spared the temptation myself of seeing the luxury and extravagance which must tempt one to feel hard and bitter i should fear  we go on quietly and happily  you know our school is large thank god we are all well save dear old fisher who met with a sad boating accident last week  a coil of the boat raft caught his ankle as the strain was suddenly tightened by a rather heavy sea and literally tore the front part of his foot completely off besides dislocating and fracturing the anklebone  he bears the pain well and he is doing very well but there may be latent tetanus and i shall not feel easy for ten days more yet  his smile was pleasant and his grasp of the hand was an indication of his faith and trust as he answered my remark you know fisher he does nothing without a reason you remember our talk about the sparrows and the hairs of our heads  i know was all he said but the look was a whole volume  your charlotte is fishers wife you know and a worthy good creature she is  poor old fisher the first time i saw tears on his cheeks was when his wife met him being carried up and i took her to him  the mail goes  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   it may as well be here mentioned that fisher pantatun escaped tetanus lived to have his limb amputated by a medical man who has since come to reside at norfolk island and that he has been further provided with a wooden leg to the extreme wonder and admiration of his countrymen at mota where he has since joined the christian community  the home letter finished the last had been begun before the first on feb 11 my birthday as the bishop writes addinghow as time goes on we think more and more of him and miss him  especially now in these times with so many difficult questions distressing and perplexing men his wise calm judgment would have been such a strength and support  you know i have all his letters since i left england and he never missed a mail  and now it is nearly ten years since he passed away from this world  what would he say to us all what would he think of all that has taken place in the interval thank god he would certainly rejoice in seeing all his children loving each other more and more as they grow older and learn from experience the blessedness and infrequency of such a thoroughly united happy set of brothers and sisters  why you have never missed a single mail in all these sixteen years and i know in spite of occasional differences of opinion that there is really more than ever of mutual love and much more of mutual esteem than ever  there is no blessing like this  and it is a special and unusual blessing and surely next to god we owe it to our dear parents and perhaps especially to him who was the one to live on as we grew up into men and women  what should i have done out here without a perfect trust in you three and without your letters and loving remembrances in boxes c  i fancy that i should have broken down altogether or else have hardened more than i have become to the soft and restful influences of the home life  i see some people really alone in these countries really expatriated  now i never feel that partly because i have your letters partly because i have the knowledge that if ever i did have to go to england i should find all the old family love only intensified and deepened  i can tell you that the consciousness of all this is a great help and carries one along famously  and then the hope of meeting byandby and for ever   true to the kindred points of heaven and home  surely such loyalty of heart making a living influence of parents so long in their graves has been seldom at least put on record though maybe it often and often has existed   again on march 8such a fit came over me yesterday of old memories  i was reading a bit of wordsworth the poet  i remembered dear dear uncle frank telling me how wordsworth came over to ottery and called on him and how he felt so honoured and so i felt on thinking of him and the old pet names and most of all of course of father and mother i seemed to see them all with unusual clearness  then i read one of the two little notes i had from mr keble which live in my christian year and so i went on dreaming and thinking  yes if by his mercy i may indeed be brought to the home where they dwell  but as the power of keen enjoyment of this world was never mine as it is given to bright healthy creatures with eyes and teeth and limbs sound and firm so i try to remember dear fathers words that he did not mean that he was fit to go because there was little that he cared to stop here for  and i dont feel morbid like only with a diminished capacity for enjoying things here  of the mere animal pleasures eating and drinking are a serious trouble  my eyes dont allow me to look about much and i walk with unshowing eye turned towards the earth  i dont converse with ease there is the feeling of difficulty in framing words  i prefer to be alone and silent  if i must talk i like the english tongue least of all melanesia doesnt have such combinations of consonants and harsh sounds as our vernacular rejoices in  if i speak loud as in preaching i am pretty clear still but i cant read at all properly now without real awkwardness  i am delighted with shairps essays that pena sent me  he has the very nature to make him capable of appreciating the best and most thoughtful writers especially those who have a thoughtful spirit of piety in them  he gives me many a very happy quiet hour  i wish such a book had come in my way while i was young  i more than ever regret that mr kebles praelectiones was never translated into english  i am sure that i have neglected poetry all my life for want of some guide to the appreciation and criticism of it and that i am the worse for it  if you dont use uncle sams biographia literaria and literary remains i should much like to have them  do you fan care to have any of my german books  i have indeed scarce any but theological ones  but no one else reads german here and i read none but the divinity and indeed i almost wish i had them in translations for the sake of the english type and paper my eyes dont like the german type at all  moreover now it was not so years ago all that is worth reading in their language is in a good serviceable english dress and passed moreover through the minds of clear english thinkersand the germans are such wordy clumsy involved writers  a man need not be a german scholar to be well acquainted with all useful german theology  döllinger is almost the only clear plain writer i know among them  dorner the great lutheran divine gives you about two pages and a half of close print for a single sentenceawful work worse than my english but i know that if i read less and thought more it would be better  only it is such hard work thinking and i am so lazy  i was amused at hearing through another lad of edward wogales remark this helping in translation a revisal of the acts in mota is such hard work  yes my boy brain work takes it out of you  i wish i had jems power of writing reports condensing evidence into clear reliable statements  lawyers get that power while we clergymen are careless and inaccurate because as old lord campbell said there is no reply to our sermons  what would i give to have been well drilled in grammar and made an accurate scholar in old days  ottery school and eton didnt do much for me in that way though of course the fault was chiefly in myself  but most of all i think that i regret the real loss to us eton boys of the weekly help that winchester rugby and harrow boys had from moberly arnold and vaughan in their sermons  i really think that might have helped to keep us out of harm  it is now 430 pm calm and hot  such a tigerlily on my table and the pretty delicate achimenes and the stephanotis climbing up the verandah and a bignonia by its side with honeysuckle all over the steps and jessamine all over the two watertanks at the angle of the verandah  the melanesians have i think twentynine flower gardens and they bring the flowers clots of flowers and the oleanders are a sight  some azaleas are doing well verbenas hibiscus of all kinds  roses and alas clove carnations and stocks and many of the dear old cottage things wont grow well scarlet passion flowers and splendid japanese lilies of perfect white or pink or spotted  the golden one i have not yet dared to buy they are most beautiful  i like both the red and the yellow tritoma we have both  but i dont think we have the perfume of the english flowers and i miss the clover and buttercup  and what would i give for an oldfashioned cabbage rose as big as a saucer and for fresh violets which grow here but have little scent and lilies of the valley  still more fancy seeing a devonshire bank in spring with primroses and daisies or meadows with cowslip and clover and buttercups and hearing thrushes and blackbirds and larks and cuckoos and seeing trout rise to the flies on the water  there is much exaggeration in secondrate books about tropical vegetation you are really much better off than we are  no trees equal english oaks beeches and elms and chestnuts and with very little expense and some care you have any flowers you like growing out of doors or in a greenhouse  you can make a warmer climate and we cant a colder one   but we have plenty to look at for all that  there what a nice hour i have spent in chatting with you  this same dreamy kind of chat full of the past and of quiet meditation over the present reminding one of bunyans pilgrims in the land of beulah continues at intervals through the sheets written while waiting for the southern cross  here is a note march 14 of the teaching  i am working at the miracles with the second set and i am able to venture upon serious questions viz the connection between sin and physical infirmity or sickness the demoniacs the power of working miracles as essential to the second adam in whom the prerogative of the man the ideal man according to the idea of his original condition was restored  then we go pretty closely into detail on each miracle and try to work away till we reach a general principle or law  with another class i am making a kind of commentary on st luke with a third trying to draw out in full the meaning of the lords prayer  with a fourth old testament history  it is often very interesting but apart from all sham i am a very poor teacher  i can discourse or talk with equals but i cant teach  so i dont do justice to these or any other pupils i may chance to have  but they learn something among us all  he speaks of himself as being remarkably well and free from the discomforts of illness during the months of march and april and these letters show perfect peace and serenity of spirit but his silence and inadequacy for small talk were felt like depression or melancholy by some of his white companions and he always seemed to feel it difficult to rouse himself  to sit and study his hebrew isaiah with delitzschs comment was his chief pleasure and on his birthday april 1 easter eve and the ensuing holy days he read over all his fathers letters to him and dwelt in the remarks to his sisters upon their wisdom and tenderness  mr codrington says before starting on the voyage he had confirmed some candidates in the church in town on which occasion he seemed to rouse himself with difficulty for the walk and would go by himself but he was roused again by the service and gave a spirited and eloquent address and came back after a hearty meal and lively conversation much refreshed in mind and body  this was on palm sunday  on easter day he held his last confirmation of three girls and two solomon island boys  then came the southern cross bringing with her from new zealand a box with numerous books and other treasures the pillow that the old bishop of exeter was leaning on when he died a photograph from the bishop of salisbury of his cathedral and among the gifts for the younger melanesians a large noahs ark which elicited great shouts of delight  well after mentioning the articles in order all these things and still more the thought of the pains taken and the many loving feelings engaged in getting them together will help me much during the coming months  all the little unexpected things are so many little signs of the care and love you always have for me and that is more than their own value after all  i always feel it solemn to go off on these voyages  we have had such mercies  fisher is doing quite well getting about on crutches and that is the only hospital case we have had during the whole summer  then follows  april 27thwe start in a few hours dv  the weather is better you have my thoughts and hopes and prayers  i am really pretty well and though often distressed by the thought of past sins and present ones yet i have a firm trust in gods mercy through christ and a reasonable hope that the holy spirit is guiding and influencing me what more can i say to make you think contentedly and cheerfully about me god bless you all  so the last voyage was begun  the plan was much the same as usual on the way to mota the bishop landed on whitsuntide island and there was told that what the people called a thief ship had carried off some of their people  star island was found nearly depopulated on may 16 the bishop with mr bice and their scholars landed at mota and the southern cross went on with mr brooke to florida where he found that the snatchsnatch vessels as they were there called had carried off fifty men  they had gone on board to trade but were instantly clapped under hatches while tobacco and a hatchet were thrown to their friends in the canoe  some canoes had been upset by a noose from the vessel then a gun was fired and while the natives tried to swim away a boat was lowered which picked up the swimmers and carried them off  one man named lave who jumped overboard and escaped had had two fingers held up to him which he supposed to mean two months but which did mean two years  it was plain that enticing having failed violence was being resorted to and mr brooke was left to an anxious sojourn while mr atkin returned to mota on his way to his own special charge at bauro  he says on june 9  the bishop had just come back from a weeks journeying with william in his boat  they had been to santa maria vanua lava and saddle island the weather was bad but the bishop although he is tired does not think he is any the worse for his knocking about  he is not at all well he is in low spirits and has lost almost all his energy  he said while talking about the deportation of islanders to fiji that he didnt know what was to be done all this time had been spent in preparing teachers qualified to teach their own people but now when the teachers were provided all the people were taken away the extent to which the carrying off of the natives has gone is startling  it certainly is time for us to think what is to be done next  i do not think that it is an exaggerated estimate others would say it is under the mark that one half the population of the banks islands over ten years of age have been taken away  i am trying not to expect anything about the solomon islands before we are there but we have heard that several vessels have cargoes from there  if the people have escaped a little longer for their wildness it will not be for long  the bishop still remained at mota while i went back to the solomon islanders  the cliffs of mota and perhaps the intelligence of the people had comparatively protected it though port patteson had become a station of the labour ships  the village of kohimarama was not a disappointment  bishop patteson proceeds  things are very different  i think that we may without danger baptize a great many infants and quite young childrenso many parents are actually seeking christian teaching themselves or willing to give their children to be taught  i think that some adults married men may possibly be baptized  i should think that not less than forty or fifty are daily being taught twice a day as a distinct set of catechumens  besides this some of the women seem to be in earnest  about two hours and a half are spent daily by me with about twenty three grownup men  they come too at all hours in small parties two or three to tell their thoughts and feelings how they are beginning to pray what they say what they wish and hope c  there is more indication than i ever saw here before of a movement a distinct advance towards christianity  the distinction between passively listening to our teaching and accepting it as gods word and acting upon it seems to be clearly felt  i speak strongly and habitually about the necessity of baptism  he that believeth and is baptized c  independently of the doctrinal truth about baptism the call to the heathen man to take some step to enter into some engagement to ally himself with a body of christian believers by some distinct act of his own needing careful preparation c has a meaning and a value incalculably great  yes jesus is to us all a source of pardon light and life all these treasures are in him  but he distributes these gifts by his spirit in his appointed ways  you cant understand or receive the gospel with a heart clinging to your old ways  and you cant remake your hearts  he must do it and this is his way of doing it  you must be born again  you must be made new men  but why write all this which is so commonplace  i feel more than ever the need of very simple very short services for ignorant catechumens  they used to throng our morning and evening prayer perhaps 130 being present for about that number attend our daily school but they could not understand one sentence in ten of the common prayer book  and it is bad for people to accustom themselves to a formal service  so i have stopped that  we baptized people have our regular service and at the end of my school held in the dark 7830 pm in the verandah we kneel down and i pray extempore touching the points which have formed the lesson  i dont like teaching these adults who cant read a form of private prayer  i try to make them understand that to wish earnestly is to pray that they must put what they wish for clearly before their own minds and then pray to god for it through christ  but i must try to supply progressive lessons for the catechumens and others with short prayers to be read by the teacher at the end and beginning too perhaps of the lesson  much must depend on the individual teachers unction and force  well i hope and trust to be able to tell you two months hence of some of these people being baptized  only three adults have been baptized here on the island and all three were dying  it is very comforting to think that all of us have been engaged in this mota work dudley and mr pritt and mr kerr too and all our present staff have had much to do with it  especially i think now of three young men all married who came to me lately saying all these years an interval of six or seven years we have been thinking now and then about what we heard years ago when we were with you in new zealand for a few months  they are now thoroughly in earnest as far as i can judge and their wives as i hope move along with them  how one old set must have influenced them a long time ago bice who speaks mota very well was very energetic during his fortnight here  he is now gone on with mr brooke and mr atkin that he may see the work in the solomon isles  i meant to go but there seemed to be a special reason why i should stay here just now vessels seeking labourers for fiji and queensland are very frequently calling at these islands  mr thurston late acting consul at fiji was with me the day before yesterday  he has taken a very proper view of this labour question and he assures me that the great majority of the fiji planters are very anxious that there should be no kidnapping no unfair treatment of the islanders  i have engaged to go to fiji dv at the end of my island work ie on my return to norfolk island probably about the end of september  i shall go there in the southern cross send her on to her summer quarters in new zealand and get from fiji to new zealand after six or eight weeks in fiji in some vessel or other  there are about 4000 or 5000 white people in fiji mostly church of england people but as i suppose not very clearly understanding what is really meant by that designation  it is assumed that i am to act as their bishop and i ought to have been there before  but really a competent man might work these islands into a bishopric before long  we must try to follow these islanders into fiji or queensland  but how to do it  on a plantation of say one hundred labourers you may find natives of eight or ten islands  how can we supply teachers at the rate of one for every fifteen or twenty people  and there are some 6000 or 7000 islanders already on the fiji plantations and i suppose as many in queensland  some one knowing several languages and continually itinerating from one plantation to another might do something but i dont think a native clergyman could do that  he must move about among white people continually in the boats c  i ought to do it but i think my day has gone by for that kind of thing  i hope to judge of all this byandby  it might end in my dividing my year into melanesian work as of old and melanesian work in fiji combined with the attempt to organise the white church of england community and only a month or twos work in norfolk island  to do this i must be in pretty good health  i may soon find out the limit of my powers of work and then confine myself to whatever i find i can do with some degree of usefulness  we ought to make no attempt to proselytise among the fiji natives who have been evangelised by the wesleyans  but there is work among our western pacific imported islanders and the white people  norfolk island could be quite well managed without me  mr codrington could take that entirely into his own hands  i might spend a month or two there and confirm melanesians and norfolk islanders and quietly fall into a less responsible position and be a moveable clergyman in fiji or anywhere else as long as my strength lasts  norfolk island certainly was rather my restingplace  but i think i am becoming more and more indifferent to that kind of thing  a tropical climate suits me and fiji is healthyno ague  dysentery is the chief trouble there  these are notions flying thoughts most likely never to be fully realised  indeed who can say what may befall me  never to be fully realised  no  he who in broken health so freely and simply sacrificed in will his cherished nook of rest on earth for a life so trying and distasteful was very near the rest that remaineth for the people of god  on june 26 the first public baptism in mota took place of one man the bishop and sarawia in surplices in front of their verandah the people standing round but unfortunately it was a very wet day and the rush of rain drowned the voices as the bishop made his convert wilgan renounce individually and by name individual evil fashions of heathenism just as st boniface made the germans forsake thor and odin by name there were twentyfive more nearly ready and a corallime building was finished like a cob wall only white plaster instead of red mud says the devonshire man  it was the first church of mota again reminding us of the many white churches of our ancestors and on the 25th of june at 7 am the first holy eucharist was celebrated there  it is also the place of private prayer for the christians and catechumens of kohimarama  the weather was exceedingly bad drenching rain continually yet the bishop continued unusually well  his heart might well be cheered when on that sunday evening in the dark he was thus accosted  i have for days been watching for a chance of speaking to you alone always so many people about you  my heart is so full so hot every word goes into it deep deep  the old life seems a dream everything seems to be new  when a month ago i followed you out of the said goro you said that if i wanted to know the meaning and power of this teaching i must pray  and i tried to pray and it becomes easier as every day i pray as i go about and in the morning and evening and i dont know how to pray as i ought but my heart is light and i know its all true and my mind is made up and i have been wanting to tell you and so is sogoivnowut and we four talk together and all want to be baptized  this man had spent one season at st johns seven years before but on his return home had gone back to the ordinary island life until at last the good seed was beginning to take root  the next sunday the 2nd of july ninetyseven children were baptized at four villages chosen as centres to which the adjacent ones could bring their children  it was again a wet day but the rain held up at the first two places  the people stood or sat in a great halfcircle from which the eldest children four or five years old walked out in a most orderly manner the lesser ones were carried up by their parents and out of the whole ninetyseven only four cried  the people all behaved admirably and made not a sound at the last two places there was a deluge of rain but as sickness prevailed in them it was not thought well to defer the baptism  it was a day full of thankful and anxious feelings  i was too tired and too much concerned with details of arrangements new names c to feel the more contemplative devotional part of the whole days services till the evening  then for i could not sleep for some hours it came on me and i thought of the old times too the dear bishops early visits my own fourteen years acquaintance with this place the care taken by many friends past and present members of the mission  the sunday collects as we call them st michaels all saints saint simon and st judes calmed me and my sunday prayer that beautiful prayer in the ordination of priests almighty god and heavenly father slightly altered was very full of meaning  so thank god one great step has been taken a great responsibility indeed but i trust not rashly undertaken  on july 4 the southern cross returned and the cruise among the new hebrides was commenced  mr bice was left to make a fortnights visit at lepers island and the bishop going on to mai found only three men on the beach where there used to be hundreds and was advised not to go to tariko as there had been fighting  at ambrym there was a schooner with mr thurston on board and fifty five natives for fiji  on the north coast was the isabella with twentyfive for queensland  the master gave captain jacob his credentials to show to the bishop and said the bishop might come on board and talk to the people so as to be convinced they came willingly but weighed anchor immediately after and gave no opportunity and one man who stood on the rail calling out pishopa pishopa was dragged back  mr bice was picked up again on the 17th having been unmolested during his visit but two of the lepers who had been at espiritu santo had brought back a fearful story that a small twomasted vessel had there been mastered by the natives and the crew killed and eaten in revenge for the slaughter of some men of their own by another ships company some time back  on the voyage he wrote to the bishop of lichfield   off tariko  sloop july 8 1871  my dear bishoptowards the end of april i left norfolk island and after a six days passage reached mota  i called at ambrym dropping three boys at three places at whitsuntide at lepers island dropping seven boys aurora two places santa maria where i left b and so to mota on the day before ascension day and sent the vessel back at once to norfolk island for the solomon island scholars  all our aroa and matlavo party wished to spend ascension day with us and after holy communion they went across with commodore william pasvorang in a good whale boat which i brought down on the deck of the schooner and which willy looks after at aroa  we want it for keeping up a visitation of the group  bice ordained priest last christmas was with me  we found george and all well george very steady and much respected  charles woleg benjamin vassil and james neropa all going on well  the wives have done less than i hoped true they all had children to look after yet they might have done more with the women  then as before about the movement  after a week i went off in the boat leaving bice at kohimarama the mota station  i went to b first at the northeast part of the island back to tarasagi northeast point sailed round to lakona our old cock sparrow point where b and i selected one or two boys to stay with him at tarasagi  thence we sailed to avreas bay the great bay of vanua lava b going back to tarasagi by land heavy sea and rain reached land in the dark 8 pm thankful to be safe on shore  on to aroa where i spent two days willie and edwin doing what they can  twenty children at school but the island is almost depopulated some seven hundred gone to brisbane and fiji  i did not go to uvaparapara the weather was bad i was not well and i expected the southern cross from norfolk island  next day after just a weeks trip in the boat i got to mota and the next day the southern cross arrived with joe atkin and brooke and some twenty four solomon islanders many of them pressing to stay at norfolk island where about eighty scholars in all are under the charge of codrington palmer and jackson  i sent bice on in the southern cross as he ought to see something of his brethrens work in the north and west  i had just a month at mota very interesting  i hope to spend three weeks more at mota if this new hebrides trip is safely accomplished and to baptize the rest of the children and probably some ten or fifteen adults  all seem thoroughly in earnest some of the first scholars who for years have seemed indifferent are now among my class of thirtythree adults  it would be too long a story to tell you of their frequent private conversations their stories their private prayers their expressions of earnest thankfulness that they are being led into the light  some of the women wives of the men are hopeful  georges old mother said to me my boys are gone george woleg wogalelehna died a christian wowetaraka the firstborn is going  i must follow  i listen to it all and believe it all  when you think fit i must join you ie be baptized  it is very comforting that all the old party from the beginning are directly of course indirectly also connected with this movement some of those most in earnest now came under the influence of the early workers dudley mr pritt c  we need this comfort  from mota some thirty or more have gone or been taken away but the other islands are almost depopulated  mr thurston late acting consul in fiji was at mota the other day seeking labourers  he says that about 3000 natives from tanna and uvaparapara are now in fiji and queensland has almost as many  he admits that much kidnapping goes on  he with all his advantages of personal acquaintance with the people and with native interpreters on board could only get about thirty  another captain weston a respectable man who would not kidnap cruised for some weeks and left for fiji without a single native on board  how then do others obtain seventy or one hundred more  but the majority of the fiji settlers i am assured do not like these kidnapping practices and would prefer some honest way of obtaining men  indeed many natives go voluntarily  in the solomon isles a steamer has been at savo and other places trying to get men  three or four of these vessels called at mota while i was there  on one day three were in sight  they told me they were shot at at whitsuntide sta maria vanua lava c  and indeed i am obliged to be very careful more so than at any time and here in the north hebrides i never know what may happen though of course in many places they know me  we are now at our maximum point of dispersion brooke at anudha j atkin at or near san cristoval gr sarawia at mota b at santa maria bice at lepers island codrington at norfolk island i on board southern cross  lepers island is very pleasant i longed to stay there  all the people wanting to come with us and already discriminating between us and the other white visitors who seem to have had little or no success there  july 21stat anchor lakona west side of santa maria  pleasant to be quietly at anchor on our old shooting ground we anchored for a day and a night at ambrym near the east point very safe and comfortable place  nine lads from five villages are on board  i bought about three and a half tons of yams there  anchored again at the end of whitsuntide where i am thankful to say we have at last received two lads one a very pleasantlooking fellow  that sad year of the dysentery 1862 when tanau died and tarivai was so ill two out of only three scholars from the island made them always unwilling to give up lads  next day at lepers island  anchored a night off wehurigi the east end of the high land the centre part of the island  bice was quite feted by the people  we brought away three old and twelve new scholars refusing the unpromising old scholars  there is i hope a sufficient opening now at ambrym and lepers island to justify my assigning these islands to jackson and bice respectively  our plan now is to take very few people indeed from the banks islands to norfolk island as they have a permanent school and resident clergyman at mota  the lads who may turn out clever and competent teachers are taken to norfolk island none others  we must take our large parties from islands where there is as yet no permanent teacher ambrym lepers island the solomon islands  meanwhile the traders are infesting these islands as captain jacobs says like mosquitoes  three vessels anchored at mai during the day i was there  three different vessels were at ambrym  today i saw four three anchored together near the northeast side of santa maria  b saw six yesterday  the people now refuse to go in them they are much exasperated at their people being kept away so long  sad scenes are occurring several white men have been killed boats crews cut off vessels wrecked  we shall hear more of such doings and really i cant blame the islanders  they are perfectly friendly to friends though there is much suspicion shown even towards us where we are not well known  as far as i can speak of my own plans i hope to stay at mota for a time till the southern cross returns from norfolk island then go to the solomon islands return by way of santa cruz and probably tikopia to mota thence to norfolk island thence probably to new zealand to take the steamer for fiji  we have no chart on board of fiji and i dont think it right to run the risk of getting somehow to levuka with only the general chart of the south pacific so i must go as i think to new zealand and either take the steamer or procure charts and perhaps take mr tilly as pilot  i dont like it it will be very cold but then i shall dv see our dear taurarua friends the good bishop and others and get advice about my fiji movements  the church of england folk there regard me as their bishop i understand and the bishops of sydney and melbourne assume this to be the fitting course  a really able energetic man might do much there and in five years would be bishop of levuka  this is all of melanesia and myself but you will like to have this scrawl read to you  how i think of you as i cruise about the old familiar places and think that you would like to have another trip and see the old scenes with here and there thank god some little changes for the better  best love my dear dear bishop to mrs selwyn william and john  your very affectionate  j c patteson   about forty old scholars and new had been collected and brought back to mota where after landing the bishop captain jacobs sailed back to norfolk island carrying with him the last letters that were to be received and read as from a living man  all that follow only came in after the telegram which announced that the hand that had written them was resting beneath the pacific waters  but this was not until it had been granted to him to gather in his harvest in mota as will be seen   mota july 31 1871  my dearest sistersyou will be glad to know that on my return hither after three weeks absence i found no diminution of strong earnest feeling among the people  george sarawia had indeed been unable to do very much in the way of teaching 60 or 90 men and women but he had done his best and the 100 younger people were going on with their schooling regularly  i at once told the people that those who wished to be baptized must let me know and out of some 30 or 40 who are all i think in earnest 15 and some few women are to be baptized next sunday  these will be the first grownup people save john wilgan baptized in mota except a few when in an almost dying state  they think and speak much of the fact that so many of their children have been baptized they wish to belong to the same set but i believe them all to be fairly well instructed in the great elementary truths  they cant read all the teaching is oral no objection in my eyes  it may be dangerous to admit it but i am convinced that all that we can do is to elevate some few of the most intelligent islanders well so that they can teach others and be content with careful oral teaching for the rest  how few persons even among ourselves know how to use a book  and these poor fellows for i can only except a percentage of our scholars have not so completely mastered the mechanical difficulty of reading as to leave their minds free for examination of the meaning and sense of what they read  i dont undervalue a good education as you know  but i feel that but few of these islanders can ever be booklearned and i would sooner see them content to be taught plain truths by qualified persons than puzzling themselves to no purpose by the doubtful use of their little learning  you know that i dont want to act the romish priest amongst them  i dont want to domineer at all  and i do teach reading and writing to all who come into our regular school and i make them read passages to verify my teaching  at the same time i feel that the protestant complaint of shutting up the bible from the laity is the complaint of educated persons able to read think and reflect  the main difficulty is of course to secure a supply of really competent teachers  george edward henry robert and some three or four others are trustworthy  i comfort myself by thinking that a great many of the mediaeval clergy certainly did not know as much nor teach as well  yesterday i baptized 41 more children and infants on again an unpropitious day  i was obliged to leave 42 to be baptized at some future time  the rain poured down  the people will bring them over tomorrow  the whole number of infants and children will amount to 230 or more of adults to perhaps 25 or 30  you will pray earnestly for them that they may lead the rest of their lives according to this beginning  there is much talk something more than talk i think about putting up a large churchhouse here on this side of the island northwest side and of a schoolhouse for church also on the southeast side  we have all heavy coughs and colds and i have had two or three very disturbed nights owing to the illness of one of the many babies the little thing howls all night  all our means of housing people are exhausted  people flock here for the sake of being taught  four new houses have been built three are being built  we shall have a large christian village here soon i hope and trust  at present every place is crammed and 25 or 30 sleep on the verandah  the little cooking house holds somehow or other about 24 boys they pack close not being burdened with clothes and fourposters  i sleep on a table people under and around it  i am very well barring this heavy cold and almost total loss of voice for a few hours in the morning and evening  august 1stvery tired 7 am prayers 720820 school 82010 baptized 55 infants and young children  now it is past 1 a boisterous day though as yet no rain  i had a cup of cocoa at 630 and at 1030 a plate of rice and a couple of eggs nice clean fare the weather is against me so cold wet and so boisterous  i got a good night though for i sent mrs rhoda and her squalling baby to another house and so slept quietly  i am sorry that teaching is so irksome to me  i am in a sense at it all day  but there is so much to be done and the people worthy souls have no idea that one can ever be tired  after i was laid down on my table with my airpillow under my head and my plaid over me i woke up from a doze to find the worthy tanoagnene sitting with his face towards me waiting for a talk about the rather comprehensive subject of baptism  and at all odd times i ought to be teaching george and others how to teach the hardest work of all  i think what a life a real pedagogue must have of it  there is so much variety with me so much change and holiday and so much that has its special interest  the southern cross has been gone a week  i hope they have not this kind of weather  if they have they are getting a good knocking about and they number about 55 on board  august 6thtoday there is no rain for the first time for weeks it blew a heavy gale all night and had done so with heavy rain for some days before  at 8 am today i baptized 14 grown men one an old bald man and another with a son of sixteen or so five women and six lads taught entirely in georges school  afterwards at a different service 7 infants and little children were baptized  238  5 who have died have now been baptized since the beginning of july  todays service was very comforting  i pray and trust that these grownup men and women may be kept steadfast to their profession  it is a great blessing that i could think it right to take this step  you will i know pray for them their position is necessarily a difficult one  it is 2 pm and i feel tired the crowds are gone though little fellows are as usual sitting all round one  i tell them i cant talk i must sit quietly with charlotte yonges pupils of st john the divine  dear me what advantage young folks have nowadays though indeed the dangers of these times far outweigh those of our young days  i suppose lightfoots commentaries hardly come in your way  they are critical and learned on the greek of st pauls epistles  but there are dissertations which may be read by the english reader  he seems to me to be a very valuable man well fitted by his learning and moderation and impartiality and uncontroversial temper to do much good  his sympathies with the modern school of thought are i fancy beyond me  there is no doubt that matthew arnold says much that is true of the narrowness bigotry and jealous unchristian temper of puritanism and i suppose no one doubts that they do misrepresent the true doctrine of christianity both by their exclusive devotion to one side only of the teaching of the bible and by their misconception of their own favourite portions of scripture  the doctrine of the atonement was never in ancient times i believe drawn out in the form in which luther calvin wesley and others have lately stated it  the fact of the atonement through the death of christ was always clearly stated the manner the why the how mans redemption and reconciliation to god is thus brought about was not taught if at all after the protestant fashion  oxenhams history of the catholic doctrine of the atonement is a fairlywritten statement of what was formerly held and taught  such words as substitution satisfaction with all the ideas introduced into the subject from the use of illustrations eg of criminals acquitted debts discharged have perplexed it perhaps rather than explained what must be beyond explanation  the ultracalvinistic view becomes in the mind and language of the hotheaded ignorant fanatic a denial of gods unity  the merciful son appeasing the wrath of the angry father is language which implies two wills two counsels in the divine mind compare with this john iii 16  i suppose that an irreverent man being partly disgusted with the popular theology having no scruples about putting aside inspiration c and conceiving that he himself is an adequate representative of the nineteenth centurys intelligence and that the nineteenth centurys intelligence is most profound and infallible sets to work to demolish what is distasteful to himself and what the unerring criticism of the day rejects correcting st pauls mistakes patronising him whenever he is fortunate enough to receive the approbation of the great thinkers of our day and so constructs a vague human religion out of the christianity which he criticises eliminating all that lies beyond the speculative range of the mind and that demands assent by its own authority as gods revelation i dont know how to state briefly what i mean  i think i can understand that this temper of mind is very prevalent in england now and that i can partly trace the growth of it moreover i feel that to ignore despise or denounce it will do no good  as a matter of fact thousands of educated men are thinking on these great matters as our fathers did not think of them  simplicity of belief is a great gift but then the teaching submitted to such simple believers ought to be true otherwise the simple belief leads them into error  how much that common protestant writers and preachers teach is not true  perhaps some of their teaching is untrue absolutely but it is certainly untrue relatively because they do not hold the proportion of the faith and by excluding some truths and presenting others in an extravagant form they distort the whole body of truth  but when a man not only points out some of the popular errors but claims to correct st paul when he judaizes and to do a little judicious hellenizing for an inspired apostle one may well distrust the nineteenth century tone and spirit  i do really and seriously think that a great and reverentlyminded man conscious of the limits of human reasona man like butler would find his true and proper task now in presenting christian teaching in an unconventional form stripped of much error that the terms which we all employ when speaking doctrine seem unavoidably to carry with them  such a man might ask what do you mean by your theory of substitution satisfaction c  where do you find it  prove it logically from the bible  show that the early church held it  butler as you know reproved the curiosity of men who sought to find out the manner of the atonement  i do not find he says that it is declared in the scriptures  he believed the fact of course as his very souls treasure  our ignorance he says is the proper answer to such enquiries  at the same time no one now can do it seems what another butler might do viz deal with the bible as the best of the nineteenth century men wish to hear a divine deal with it  he would never make mere assertions  he would never state as a proved truth to be presented to a congregations acceptance a statement or a doctrine which really equalled only an opinion of wesley or any other human teacher  he would never make arbitrary quotations from scripture and try to prove points by illogical reasoning and unduly pressing texts which a more careful collation of mss has shown to be at least doubtful  and by fairness and learning he would win or conciliate rightminded men of the critical school  what offends these men is the cool reckless way in which so many preachers make the most audacious statements wholly unsupported by any sound learning and logical reasoning  a man makes a statement quotes a text or two which he doesnt even know to be capable of at least one inter pretation different from that which he gives to it and so the critical hearer is disgusted and no wonder  one gain of this critical spirit is that it makes all of us clergy more circumspect in what we say and many a man looks at his greek testament nowadays and at a good commentary too before he ventures to quote a text which formerly would have done duty in its english dress and passed muster among an uncritical congregation  nowadays every clergyman knows that there are probably men in his congregation who know their bible better than he does and as practical lawyers men of business c are more than his match at an argument  it offends such men to have a shallowminded preacher taking for granted the very points that he ought to prove giving a sentence from some divine of his school as if it settled the question without further reference even to the bible  this critical spirit becomes very easily captious and a man neednt be unbelieving because he doesnt like to be credulous  campbells book on the atonement is very hard chiefly because the man writes such unintelligible english  i think shairp in his essays gives a good critique as far as it goes on the philosophical and religious manner of our day  alexander knox says somewhere in his correspondence with bishop jebb that he couldnt understand the protestant theory of justification and it does seem to be often stated as if the terms employed in describing a mere transaction could adequately convey the true power and meaning of a divine mystery  but i only puzzle you i dare say and certainly i am liable to the charge of not writing intelligible english  i can tell you i am glad enough that i am not called on to preach on these subjects after the fashion that a preacher in england must go to work  it is a cool thing to say but i do believe that what half our english congregations want is just the plain simple teaching that our melanesians get only the english congregations wouldnt stand it   a letter to arthur coleridge is of the same date   mota island august 6 1871  my dear arthuri have had a busy day having baptized thirtytwo persons of whom twentyfive are adults and then the crowd the incessant talking teaching and the anxious feeling which attend any step of so much importance as the baptism from heathenism  fourteen of the men are married two are elderly several are middleaged five women are among the number  i believe that gods spirit is indeed working in the hearts of these people  some twelve or thirteen years have passed and only now have i felt that i could take the step of baptizing the infants and young children here the parents promising that they shall be sent to school as they grow up about 200 young children have during the past month been baptized things seem hopeful  it is very happy work and i get on pretty well often very tired but that doesnt matter  i could wish all my good friends were here that those who have been enabled to contribute to this end might see for themselves something of the long hoped for beginning of a new state of things in this little island  august 11in a little more than a month 248 persons have been baptized here twentyfive of them adults the rest infants and young children  i am very sorry to think that i must leave them soon for i expect the southern cross in a few days and i must go to the solomon islands from them to santa cruz island and so to norfolk island calling here on the way  then i am off to the fiji islands for i suppose a month or six weeks  there are some 6000 or 7000 white people there and it is assumed by them and the church people in this part of the world that i must be regarded as their bishop very soon a separate bishop ought to be at work there and i shall probably have to make some arrangement with the settlers  then on the other hand i want to look into the question of south sea islanders who are taken to the fiji plantations  how far i can really examine into the matter i hardly know  but many of the settlers invite me to consider the matter with them  i believe that for the most part the islanders receive good treatment when on the plantations but i know that many of them are taken away from their islands by unfair means  the settlers are only indirectly responsible for this  the traders and sailing masters of the vessels who take away the islanders are the most culpable  but the demand creates the supply  among all my multifarious occupations here i have not much time for reading i am never alone night or day  i sleep on a table with some twelve or more fellows around me and all day long people are about me in and out of school hours  but i have read for the third time i think lightfoots galatiansand i am looking forward to receiving his book on the ephesians  he doesnt lay himself out to do exactly the work that bishop ellicott has done so excellently and his dissertations are perhaps the most valuable part of his work  he will gain the ear of the men of this generation rather than ellicott he sympathises more with modern modes of thought and is less rigid than ellicott  but he seems very firm on all the most essential and primary points and i am indeed thankful for such a man  i dont find much time for difficult reading i go on quietly hebrew c  i have many good books on both old and new testaments english and german and some french eg keuss and guizot  i like to hear something of what this restless speculative scientific generation is thinking and doing  but i cant read with much pleasure the fragmentary review literature of the day  the cornhill and that class of books i cant stand and sketchy writings  the best specimens of light reading i have seen of late are charlotte yonges pupils of st john the divine and guizots st louis excellent  i did read for it was put on board disraelis novel  i was on my back seasick for four days what utter rubbish clever nonsense and i have read mr arnolds st paul and protestantism  he says some clever things about the puritan mind no doubt  but what a painful book it is cant he see that he is reducing all that the spirit of a man must needs rest on to the level of human criticism simply eliminating from the writings of the apostles and i suppose from the words of the saviour all that is properly and strictly divinethen follows much that has been before givenhow winding up thus thankful i am that i am far away from the noise and worry of this sceptical yet earnest age  there is something hazy about your friend daviss writings  i know some of his publications and sympathise to a very considerable extent with him  but i cant be sure that i always understand him that school has a language of its own and i am not so far initiated as to follow  i cant understand maurice much as i respect him  it is simply wasting my time and my brains to attempt to read him he has great thoughts and he makes them intelligible to people less stupid than me and many writers whom i like and understand have taken their ideas from him but i cannot understand him  and i think many of his men have his faults  at least i am so conceited as to think it is not all my fault  do you know two little books by norris canon of bristol key to the gospel history and a manual on the catechism  they are well worth reading indeed i should almost say studying so as to mould the teaching of your young ones upon them  how you would be amused could you see the figures and scenes which surround me here  today about 140 men women lads and girls are working voluntarily here clearing and fencing the gardens and digging the holes for the yams and they do this to help us in the school we have two pigs killed and give them a bit of a feast  the feeling is very friendly  a sculptor might study them to great advantage though clothing is becoming common here now  our thirty four baptized adults and our sixteen or twenty old scholars wear decent clothing of course  well i must leave off  i think very often of you your wife and children and indeed of you all  it would be very nice to spend a few weeks with you but i should not get on well in your climate  the heat seems to suit me better and i am pretty well here  indeed i am better than i have been for more than a year though i have a good deal of discomfort  goodbye dear arthur  how often i think of your dear dear father  your affectionate cousin  j c patteson   to the sisters the journal continuesrecording on august 14 the baptism of twelve men and women the day before the communion of sixteen at 7 am the presence of fiftysix baptized persons at morning service  more than 100 were working away the ensuing day in preparing yam gardens for kohimarama while two pigs were stewing in native ovens to feast them afterwards and the bishop was planting cocoanut trees and sowing flower seeds or trying experiments with a machine for condensing water in his moments of relaxation which were few though he was fairly well and very happy as no one can doubt on reading this  lots of jolly little children and many of them know me quite well and are not a bit shy  they are often very sadlooking objects and as they dont get regularly washed they often have large sores and abscesses poor little things  but there are many othersclean skinned reddish brown blackeyed merry little souls among them the colour of the people is just what titian and the venetian painters delighted in the colour of their own weatherbeaten venetian boatmen glowing warm rich colour  white folks look as if they were bleached and had all the colour washed out of them  some of the solomon islanders are black and some of the new hebrides people glossy and smooth and stronglooking but here you seldom see any very dark people and there are some who have the yellow almost olive complexion of the south european  many of the women are tattooed from head to foot a regular network of a bluish inlaid pattern  it is not so common with the men rather i ought to say very unusual with them though many have their bodies marked pretty freely  on the 17th sixteen more adults were baptized elderly men whose sons had been baptized in new zealand coming in and enemies resigning deadly feuds  the work in mota is best summed up in this last letter to bishop abraham begun the day after what proved the final farewell to the flock there for the southern cross came in on the 19th and the last voyage was at once commenced   southern cross sunday august 20 1871  my dear dear friendsyesterday the southern cross came to me at mota twentyseven days after leaving that island for norfolk island with some fifty melanesians on board under charge of bice  into what a new world your many kind affectionate letters take me and how good it must be for me to be taught to think more than i alas usually do about the trials and sorrows of others  i have had such a seven weeks at mota broken by a three weeks course in the new hebrides into two portions of three and four weeks  last year we said in our report that the time seemed to be come when we should seek to move the people in mota to do more than assent to the truth of our words and the blessings promised in the gospel when we should urge them to appropriate to themselves those blessings by abandoning their ignorant heathen ways and embracing christianity  that time has come in the good providence of god in answer to his allprevailing intercession and hastened who can doubt it by the prayers of the faithful everywhereyour whitsunday thoughts and prayers your daily thoughts and prayers all contributing to bring about a blessed change indeed in the little island  in these two months i have baptized 289 persons in mota 231 children and infants seventeen of the lads and boys at kohimarama george sarawias school and fortyone grown and almost all married men and women  i have tried to proceed cautiously and to act only when i had every human probability of a personal conviction and sincere desire to embrace christian teaching and to lead a christian life  i think the adult candidates were all competently instructed in the great truths  i feel satisfied of their earnestness and i think it looks like a stable permanent work  yet i need not tell you how my old text is ever in my mind thine heart shall fear and be enlarged  now more than ever are your prayers needed for dear old george sarawia and his infant church  i never had such an experience before  it is something quite new to me  classes regularly morning and evening and all day parties coming to talk and ask questions some bringing a wife or child some a brother some a friend  we were 150 sleeping on the mission premises houses being put up all round by people coming from a distance  scarce a moments rest but the work so interesting and absorbing that i could scarcely feel weariness  the weather for six out of the seven weeks was very rainy and bad generally but i am and was well very wellnot very strong yet walking to gatava and back five or six miles on slippery and wet paths and schooling and talking all day  the actual services were somewhat striking  the behaviour of the people reverent and quiet during the infants and childrens baptisms and remarkably so during the baptisms of adults  you can understand the drift of my teaching trying to keep to the great main truths so as not to perplex their minds with a multiplicity of new thoughts  i think that i shall have to stay a few days at mota on my return dv from solomon and santa cruz islands as there are still many catechumens  i am half disposed to ordain george priest on my return dv  yet on the whole i think it may be better to wait till another year  but i am balancing considerations  should any delay occur from my incapacity to go to mota which i dont at all anticipate it would be a serious thing to leave such a work in the hands of a deacon eg ten communicants are permanent dwellers now in mota and i really believe that george though not learned is in all essentials quite a fit person to be ordained priest  this growth of the work owing no doubt much to him is a proof of gods blessing on him  i pray god that this may be a little gleam of light to cheer you dear friends on your far more toilsome and darksome path  it is a little indeed in one sense yet to me who know the insufficiency of the human agency it is a proof indeed that the gospel is dunamis theou eis soterian  i can hardly realize it all yet  it is good to be called away from it for a month or two  i often wished that codrington palmer and the rest could be with me it seemed selfish to be witnessing by myself all this great happinessthat almost visible victory over powers of darkness  there is little excitement no impulsive vehement outpouring of feeling  people come and say i do see the evil of the old life i do believe in what you teach us  i feel in my heart new desires new wishes new hopes  the old life has become hateful to me the new life is full of joy  but it is so mawa weighty i am afraid  what if after making these promises i go back  what do you doubtgods power and love or your own weakness  i dont doubt his power and love but i am afraid  afraid of what of falling away  doesnt he promise his help to those who need it  yes i know that do you pray  i dont know how to pray properly but i and my wife saygod make our hearts light  take away the darkness  we believe that you love us because you sent jesus to become a man and die for us but we cant understand it all  make us fit to be baptized  if you really long to lead a new life and pray to god to strengthen you come in faith without doubting  evening by evening my school with the baptized men and women is the saying by heart at first sentence by sentence after me now they know them well the general confession which they are taught to use in the singular number as a private prayer the lords prayer the creed the ten commandments a short version  they are learning the te deum  they use a short prayer for grace to keep their baptismal vows  i think that they know fairly well the simpler meaning of these various compendiums of prayer faith and duty  but why enter into details  you know all about it  and indeed you have all had your large share so to say in bringing about this happy change  and then i turn from all this little secluded work to the thoughts of england and france the church at home c  i have now read the guardians account of the civil war in france there is nothing like it to be read of except in the old testament perhaps  it is like the taking of jerusalem  it is an awful thing most awful  i never read anything like it will they ever learn to be humble  i dont suppose that even now they admit their sins to have brought this chastening on them  it is hard to say this without indulging a pharisaic spirit but i dont mean to palliate our national sins by exaggerating theirs  yet i hardly think any mob but a french or irish mob could have done what these men did  and what will be the result  will it check the tendency to republicanism  will governments unite to put down the manyheaded monster  will they take a lesson from the fate of paris and france of course republicanism is not the same thing as communism  but where are we to look for the good effects of republicanism  august 22ndthe seventh anniversary of dear fishers death may god grant us this year a blessing at santa cruz  your affectionate  j c patteson   the last letter to the beloved sister fanny opened with the date of her neverforgotten birthday the 27th of august though it was carried on during the following weeks and in the meantime mr atkin stephen joseph and the rest were called for from wango in bauro where they had had a fairly peaceable stay in spite of a visit from a labour traffic vessel called the emma bell with twentynine natives under hatches and alas on her way for more after picking the bauro party up the bishop wrote to the elder mr atkin   wango bay at anchor august 25 1871  my dear mr atkinyou may imagine my joy at finding joe looking really well when we reached this part of the world on the 23rd  i thought him looking unwell when he spent an hour or two with me at mota about ten weeks since and i begged him to be careful to use quinine freely c  he is certainly looking now far better than he was then and he says that he feels quite well and strong  there is the more reason to be thankful for this because the weather has been very rough and rain has been falling continually  i had the same weather in the banks islands scarcely a day for weeks without heavy rain  here the sandy soil soon becomes dry again it does not retain the moisture and so far it has the advantage over the very tenacious clayey soil of mota  nearly all the time of the people here has been spentwasted perhaps we should sayin making preparations for a great feast so that joe found it very hard to gain the attention of the people when he tried to point out to them better things to think of than pigs native money tobacco and pipes  such advance as has been made is rather in the direction of gaining the confidence and goodwill of the people all about and in becoming very popular among all the young folks  nearly all the young people would come away with him if the elders would allow them to do so  i have no doubt that much more has been really effected than is apparent to us now  words have been said that have not been lost and seed sown that will spring up some day  just as at mota now after some twelve or thirteen years we first see the result in the movement now going on there so it will be by gods goodness some day here  there at mota the good example of george sarawia the collective result of the teaching of many years and the steady conduct with one exception of the returned scholars have now been blessed by god to the conversion of many of the people  we no longer hesitate to baptize infants and young children for the parents engage to send them to school when they grow up and are themselves receiving instruction in a really earnest spirit  many too of those who have for some time abandoned the old ways but yet did not distinctly accept the new teaching have now felt the power of the gospel and though many candidates are still under probation and i sought to act with caution and to do all that lay in my power to make them perceive the exceeding solemnity of being baptized the weighty promises the great responsibility yet i thought it right to baptize not less than fortyone grown men and women besides seventeen lads of georges school about whom there could be no hesitation  it has indeed been a very remarkable season there  i spent seven weeks broken by a new hebrides trip of three weeks duration into two periods of three and four weeks  bice was with me for the first three weeks and with a good many of our scholars turned into teachers here we three bice george and i kept up very vigorous school a continual talking questioning c about religion were always going on day and night  many young children and infants were baptized about 240 in all  41  17  you will i am sure pray more than ever for george and all these converts to christianity that they may be strengthened and guarded against all evil and live lives worthy of their profession  we hope to spend two or three days there on our return dv and if so joe will write you his impressions  meanwhile i tell him what i fully believe that no one hearty effort of his to benefit these poor people is thrown away  already they allow us to take boys and perhaps this very day we may go off with two young girls also  and all this will result in some great change for the better some day  you will want to hear a word about myself  i am much better partly i confess owing to the warmth of the climate which certainly agrees with me  i may feel less well as we draw byandby to the south once more  i cant take strong exercise and that is a privation  it did me good and i feel the want of it but i am much better than i was a year or ten months ago and i do my work very fairly and get about better than i expected  remember me kindly to mrs atkin and mary and believe me to be  your very sincere friend  j c patteson   mr brooke and edward wogale had had a far more trying sojourn at florida  wogale suffered much from his eyes and the labour ships were frequently on the coastall the three varieties the fairly conducted one with a government agent on board the snatchsnatch which only inveigled but did not kill without necessity and the killkill which absolutely came headhunting  it was a dreary eleven weeks  on july 11 a sydney vessel as the natives called it was on the west of the island and nine natives were reported to mr brooke as having been killed and with so much evidence that he had no doubt on the subject  on the 13th takua came to him to say the killkill vessel had anchored four miles off  what was he to do  how was it you and bisope came first and then these slaughterers do you send them  mr brooke advised them to remain on shore but if the strangers landed and wanted to kill or burn them to fight for their lives your words are the words of a chief said takua  this ship however sailed away but on august 13 another came much like the southern cross and canoes went out to her in one of them dudley lankona  these returned safely but without selling their fruit and dudley related that the men said bishop and brooke were bad but they themselves were good and had pipes and tobacco for those who would go with them  these however went away without doing them harm only warning them that another vessel which was becalmed near at hand was a killer and the people were so uneasy about her that mr brooke went on board and was taken by the captain for a maker of cocoanut oil  he was a scotchman from tanna where he had settled and was in search of labourers a goodnatured friendly kind of person on the whole though regarding natives as creatures for capture  if i get a chance to carry a lot of them off he said ill do it but killing is not my creed  mr brooke hinted that the natives might attack him and he pointed to six muskets  thats only a few of them  let them come  well give it them pretty strong  he was rather taken aback when he found that he was talking to a clergyman  well wherever you go nowadays theres missionaries who would have thought youd got so far down  and he looked with regret at mr brookes party of natives in their canoes and observed ah my fine fellows if your friend was not here id have the whole lot of you what a haul  he said the other ship was from queensland and had a government agent on board of whom he spoke with evident awe  on mr brookes return takua and dikea were furbishing up old guns which some incautious person on board the curacoa had given them and they were disappointed to find that there could be no attack on the vessel  she however was scarcely gone before at the other end of the island vara four out of five men were killed by a boats crew  the survivor sorova told mr brooke that he and one companion had gone out in one canoe and three more in another to a vessel that lay near the shore  he saw four blacks in her as he thought ysabel men a white man came down from the boat and sat in the bow of sorovas canoe but presently stood up and capsized both canoes catching at sorovas belt which broke and the poor fellow was thus enabled to get away and shelter himself under the stern of the canoe till he could strike out for land but he saw a boat come round from the other side of the ship with four menwhether whites or light coloured islanders was not clearbut they proceeded to beat his companions with oars then to fall on them with tomahawks and finally cut off their heads which were taken on board and their bodies thrown to the sharks  these men evidently belonged to that lowest and most horrible class of menstealers who propitiate the chiefs by assisting them in head hunting  of course the island was full of rage and on the 26th again another brig was in sight  spite of warning desire to trade induced five men to put off in a canoe  two boats came down and placed themselves on either side  mr brooke could not watch but a fierce shout arose from the crowd on shore they rushed to the great canoe house and a war fleet was launched dikea standing up in the foremost with a long ebony spear in his hand  fortunately they were too late the boats were hauled up and the brig went off at full sail  whether the five were killed or carried captive is not clear  the whole place was full of wailing  revenge was all the cry  let not their pigs be killed said takua we will give them to bisope he shall avenge us  his brother dikea broke out my humour is bad because bisope does not take us about in his vessel to killkill these people  when two days later the southern cross was unmistakeably in sight takua said let bisope only bring a manofwar and get me vengeance on my adversaries and i shall be exalted likelikelike our father above  the residence of mr brooke in the island and the testimony of their own countrymen to the way of life in norfolk island had taught the floridians to separate the bishop from their foes but it could scarcely be thus in places where confidence in him had not been established  the bishop meanwhile wrote on  the new zealand bishops have sent me a kind letter a round robin urging me to go to england but they are ignorant of two things 1st that i am already much better 2nd that i should not derive the benefit generally to my spirits c from a visit to england as they would and take it for granted that i should do so  they use only one other argument viz that i must rest after some years work  that is not so  i dont feel the pressure of work for a very simple reason viz that i dont attempt to work as i used to do  but just now it is quite clear that i must not go unless there were a very obvious necessity for it  for 1st mota needs all the help we can give 2nd several melanesians are coming on rapidly to the state when they ought to be ordained 3rd we are about to start dv new stations at ambrym lepers island and savo 4th the school is so large that we want all hands to work it 5th i must go to fiji and watch both fiji and queensland 6th after the 1872 voyage we shall need as i think to sell this vessel and have another new one built in auckland  the funds will need careful nursing for this  but i will really not be foolish  if i have a return of the bad symptoms i will go to dr goldsboro and if he advises it strongly will go to england  the deportation of natives is going on to a very great extent here as in the new hebrides and banks islands  means of all kinds are employed sinking canoes and capturing the natives enticing men on board and getting them below and then securing hatches and imprisoning them  natives are retaliating  lately two or three vessels have been taken and all hands killed besides boats crews shot at continually  a man called on me at mota the other day who said that five out of seven in the boat were struck by arrows a few days before  the arrows were not poisoned but one man was very ill it makes even our work rather hazardous except where we are thoroughly well known  i hear that a vessel has gone to santa cruz and i must be very cautious there for there has been some disturbance almost to a certainty  whatever regulations the government of queensland or the consul of fiji may make they cant restrain the traders from employing unlawful means to get hold of the natives  and i know that many of these men are utterly unscrupulous  but i cant get proofs that are sufficient to obtain a verdict in a court of law  some islands are almost depopulated and i dread the return of these labourers when they are brought back  they bring guns and other things which enable them to carry out with impunity all kinds of rascality  they learn nothing that can influence them for good they are like squatters in the bush coming into the town to have their fling  these poor fellows come back to run riot steal mens wives shoot fight and use their newly acquired possessions to carry out more vigorously all heathen practices  september 3rdat anchor savo island sunday  the experiment of anchoring at sara florida and this place answers well  the decks were crowded and crammed but the people behaved very well barring the picking up of everything they could lay hands upon as is natural to many persons whose education has been neglected  yesterday i took wadrokala of nengone to the village here where he is to live with some of our old scholars from these parts and try to begin a good work among the people  he has four baptized friends a married couple being two and three other very good lads to start with  it was a long and very hot walk  a year ago i could not have got through it  i was tired but not overtired  and now we have had holy communion and this afternoon we take our party on shore wadrokalas wife carry and jemima their daughter of eight or nine  there is no fighting or quarrelling here now  i know all the people so i leave them with good hope   on the 7th joseph atkin began a letter as follows   our bishop is much improved in health and strength  his stay at mota has put new life into him again the whole island is becoming christian  the bishop is now very strong and clear about establishing permanent schools on the islands i fear in almost too great a hurry  the great requisite for a school is a native teacher and generally if not always a teacher ought as george was at mota to be well supported by a little band of native converts who if their teaching in the common use of the word is not much can by their consistent lives preach a continual sermon that all who see may understand  what is the use of preaching an eloquent sermon on truth to a people who do not know what it means or purity of which they have never dreamt  their ears take in the words they sound very pleasant and they go away again to their sin and the preacher is surprised that they can do so  i do not forget the power of the spirit to change mens hearts but do not expect the holy spirit to work with you as he never worked with anyone else but rather as he always has worked with others if in looking into the history of missions you find no heathen people has been even nominally and professionally christianised within say ten or fifteen years why not be content to set to work to try that the conversion of those to whom you are sent may be as thorough and real as possible in that time and not to fret at being unable to hurry the work some years   this letter too was destined never to be finished though it was continued later as will be seen   the bishops next letter is dated  september 16thoff the santa cruz group some twenty miles distant  tomorrow being sunday we stay quietly some way off the islands and on monday dv we go to nukapu and perhaps to piteni too wind permitting  you can enter into my thoughts how i pray god that if it be his will and if it be the appointed time he may enable us in his own way to begin some little work among these very wild but vigorous energetic islanders  i am fully alive to the probability that some outrage has been committed here by one or more vessels  the master of the vessel that atkin saw did not deny his intention of taking away from these or from any other islands any men or boys he could induce to come on board  i am quite aware that we may be exposed to considerable risk on this account  i trust that all may be well that if it be his will that any trouble should come upon us dear joseph atkin his father and mothers only son may be spared  but i dont think there is very much cause for fear first because at these small reef islands they know me pretty well though they dont understand as yet our object in coming to them and they may very easily connect us white people with the other white people who have been illusing them second last year i was on shore at nukapu and piteni for some time and i can talk somewhat with the people third i think that if any violence has been used to the natives of the north face of the large island santa cruz i shall hear of it from these inhabitants of the small islets to the north nukapu and piteni and so be forewarned  if any violence has been used it will make it impossible for us to go thither now  it would simply be provoking retaliation  one must say as newman of the new dogma that the progress of truth and religion is delayed no one can say how long  it is very sad  but the evil one everywhere and always stirs up opposition and hindrance to every attempt to do good  and we are not so sorely tried in this way as many others  contrary windsor rather a calm with such light wind as there was contrarykept the vessel from approaching the island for four days more while the volcano made every night brilliant and the untiring pen ran on with affectionate responses to all that the last home packet had contained and then proceeded to public interests  then the great matters you write aboutthe great social and religious crisis in england now  moreover who can estimate the effect of this german and french war upon the social state of europe possibly a temporary violent suppression in north germany of republican principles a reaction an attempt to use the neutrality of england as a focus for political agitation  and then the extravagant luxury side by side with degrading poverty  it is a sad picture and you who have to contemplate it have many trials and troubles that are in one sense far away from me  september 19thhere we are becalmed for three days we have scarcely made ten miles in the direction we want to go  it is not prudent to go near the large island unless we have a good breeze and can get away from the fleets of canoes if we see reason for so doing  we may have one hundred and fifty canoes around us and perhaps sixty or eighty strong men on deck as we had last year and this year we have good reason for fearing that labour vessels have been here  many of the people here would distinguish between us and them but it is quite uncertain for we cant talk to the people of the large island and cant therefore explain our object in so doing yesterday being becalmed a large canoe passing for there was occasionally a light air from the north from nupani to santa cruz came near us  it could not get away and the southern cross could not get near it  so we went to it in the boat  i can talk to these nupani people and we had a pleasant visit  they knew my name directly and were quite at ease the moment they were satisfied it was the bishop  they will advertise us i dare say and say a good word for us and we gave them presents c  i shall be thankful if this visit ends favourably and oh how thankful if we obtain any lads  it seems so sad to leave this fine people year after year in ignorance and darkness but he knows and cares for them more than we do the sun is nearly vertical thermometer 91° and 88° at night i am lazy but not otherwise affected by it and spend my day having some about an hours school and in writing and reading  i think that the education question has been more satisfactorily settled than i dared to hope a year ago  a religious as opposed to an irreligious education has been advisedly chosen by the country and denominationalism what a word as against secularism  well thats not much from a christian country but it isnt the choice of an antichristian or even of a country indifferent to christianity  mrs abraham and pena have sent me shairps little book on religion and culture  it is capital and if you knew the man you would not wonder at his writing such sensible thoughtful books  he is one of the most loveable beings i ever knew  his good wholesome teaching is about the best antidote i have seen to much of the poison circulating about in magazines and alluring ignorant unsound people with the specious name of philosophy  and he is always fair and credits his opponents with all that can possibly be imagined to extenuate the injury they are doing by their false and faithless teaching   here the letter suddenly ceases  no doubt this last sentence had given the last impulse towards addressing the old balliol friend above named now principal of st andrews in the following   southern cross mission schooner  in the santa cruz group sw pacific september 19  my dear principalyou wont remember my name and it is not likely that you can know anything about me but i must write you a line and thank you for writing your two books for i have but two on studies on poetry and philosophy and religion and culture  the moral dynamic  and the latter book are indeed the very books i have longed to see books that one can put with confidence and satisfaction into the hands of men young and old in these stirring and dangerous times  then it did me good to be recalled to old scenes and to dream of old faces  i was almost a freshman when you came up to keep your ma term and as i knew some of the men you knew you kindly as i well remember gave me the benefit of it  as john coleridges cousin and the acquaintance of john keate cumin palmer and dear james eiddell i came to know men whom otherwise i could not have known and of these how many there still are that i have thought of and cared for ever since  you must have thought of riddell dear james riddell when you wrote the words in p 76 of your book on religion and culture we have known such  yes there was indeed about him a beauty of character that is very very rare  sellar is in the north somewhere i think i have seen essays by him on lucretius  i think that he is professor at some university  i am ashamed to know so little about him  should you see him pray remember me most kindly to him  as year after year passes on it is very pleasant to think there are men on the other side of the world that i can with a certainty count upon as friends  i find it difficult to read much of what is worth reading nowadays and i have little taste for magazines c i confess  but i know enough of what is working in mens minds in europe to be heartily thankful for such thoughtful wholesome teaching as yours  indeed you are doing a good work and i pray god it may be abundantly blessed  i remain my dear friend  very sincerely yours  j c patteson   this is the last letter apparently finished and signed  to the bishop of lichfield the long journalletter says   tenakulu the volcano was fine last night but not so fine as on that night we saw it together  but it was very solemn to look at it and think how puny all mans works are in comparison with this little volcano  what is all the bombardment of paris to those masses of fire and hundreds of tons of rock cast out into the sea  if he do but touch the hills they shall smoke  and now what will the next few days bring forth it may be gods will that the opening for the gospel may be given to us now sometimes i feel as if i were almost too importunate in my longings for some beginning here and i try not to be impatient and to wait his good time knowing that it will come when it is the fulness of time  then again i am tempted to think if not soon if not now the trading vessels will make it almost impossible as men think to obtain any opening here  but i am on the whole hopeful though sometimes fainthearted  to days first lesson has a good verse haggai ii 4l and there is psalm xci also  then follows a good deal about further plans and need of men ending with the decision that the present southern cross ought to be sold and that a new one could be built at auckland for £2000 which the bishop thought he could obtain in new zealand and australia  yet now be strong o zerubbabel saith the lord and be strong o joshua son of josedech the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith the lord and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts  a much smaller additional vessel would be useful and he merrily says  you dont know an amiable millionaire with a nice quick yacht from 70 to 120 tons to be given away and sent out to auckland free of expense i suppose  we must give up all idea of our chapel for a time but we can do without it  and a vessel is necessary  the last of this letter is on delitzsch and biblical criticism but too much mixed up with other persons private affairs for quotation  reading hebrew with mr atkin or studying isaiah alone had been the special recreation throughout the voyage  his scholar edward wogale has given a touch of that last morning of the 20th  and as we were going to that island where he died but were still in the open sea he schooled us continually upon luke ii iii up to vi but he left off with us with his death  and he preached to us continually at prayers in the morning every day and every evening on the acts of the apostles and he spoke as far as to the seventh chapter and then we reached that island  and he had spoken admirably and very strongly indeed to us about the death of stephen and then he went up ashore on that island nukapu  that island nukapu lay with the blue waves breaking over the circling reef the white line of coral sand the trees coming down to it and in the glowing sun of september 20 the equatorial midsummer eve four canoes were seen hovering about the reef as the southern cross tried to make for the islet  mr brooke says that this lingering had seemed to intensify the bishops prayer and anxiety for these poor people and thinking that the unusual movements of the vessel puzzled the people in the canoes and that they might be afraid to approach he desired that at 1130 am the boat should be lowered and entered it with mr atkin stephen taroniara james minipa and john nonono  he sat in the stern sheets and called back to mr brooke tell the captain i may have to go ashore  then he waited to collect more things as presents to take on shore and pulled towards the canoes but they did not come to meet the boat and seemed undecided whether to pull away or not  the people recognized the bishop and when he offered to go on shore they assented and the boat went on to a part of the reef about two miles from the island and there met two more canoes making six in all  the natives were very anxious that they should haul the boat up on the reef the tide being too low for her to cross it but when this was not consented to two men proposed to take the bishop into their boat  it will be remembered that he had always found the entering one of their canoes a sure way of disarming suspicion and he at once complied  mr atkin afterwards said he thought he caught the word tabu as if in warning and saw a basket with yams and other fruits presented and those acquainted with the customs of the polynesians  the race to which these islanders belongedsay that this is sometimes done that an intended victim may unconsciously touch something tabu and thus may become a lawful subject for a blow and someone may have tried to warn him  there was a delay of about twenty minutes and then two canoes went with the one containing the bishop the two chiefs moto and taula who had before been so friendly to him being in them  the tide was so low that it was necessary to wade over the reef and drag the canoes across to the deeper lagoon within  the boats crew could not follow but they could see the bishop land on the beach and there lost sight of him  the boat had been about halfanhour drifting about in company with the canoes and there had been some attempt at talk when suddenly at about ten yards off without any warning a man stood up in one of them and calling out have you anything like this shot off one of the yardlong arrows and his companions in the other two canoes began shooting as quickly as possible calling out as they aimed this for new zealand man  this for bauro man  this for mota man the boat was pulled back rapidly and was soon out of range but not before three out of the four had been struck james only escaped by throwing himself back on the seat while an arrow had nailed johns cap to his head mr atkin had one in his left shoulder and poor stephen lay in the bottom of the boat trussed as mr brooke described it with six arrows in the chest and shoulders  it was about two hours since they had left the ship when they reached it again and mr atkin said we are all hurt as they were helped on board but no sooner had the arrowhead formed of human bone and acutely sharp been extracted than he insisted on going back to find his bishop  he alone knew the way by which the reef could be crossed in the now rising tide so that his presence was necessary  meantime mr brooke extracted as best he might the arrows from poor stephen  we two bisope said the poor fellow meaning that he shared the same fate as the bishop  as joseph wate a lad of fifteen mr atkins malanta godson and pupil wrote afterwards joe said to me and sapi we are going to look for the bishop are you two afraid  no why should i be afraid  very well you two go and get food for yourselves and bring a beaker full of water for us all for we shall have to lie on our oars a long time today  the others who pulled the boat were charles sapinamba a sailor and mr bongarde the mate who carried a pistol for the first time in the records of the southern cross  they had long to wait till the tide was high enough to carry them across the reef and they could see people on shore at whom they gazed anxiously with a glass  about halfpast four it became possible to cross the reef and then two canoes rowed towards them one cast off the other and went back the other with a heap in the middle drifted towards them and they rowed towards it  but says wate when we came near we two were afraid and i said to joe if there is a man inside to attack us when he rises up we shall see him  then the mate took up his pistol but the sailor said those are the bishops shoes  as they came up with it and lifted the bundle wrapped in matting into the boat a shout or yell arose from the shore  wate says four canoes put off in pursuit but the others think their only object was to secure the now empty canoe as it drifted away  the boat came alongside and two words passed the body  then it was lifted up and laid across the skylight rolled in the native mat which was secured at the head and feet  the placid smile was still on the face there was a palm leaf fastened over the breast and when the mat was opened there were five wounds no more  the strange mysterious beauty as it may be called of these circumstances almost makes one feel as if this were the legend of a martyr of the primitive church but the fact is literally true and can be interpreted though probably no account will ever be obtained from the actors in the scene  the wounds were one evidently given with a club which had shattered the right side of the skull at the back and probably was the first and had destroyed life instantly and almost painlessly another stroke of some sharp weapon had cloven the top of the head the body was also pierced in one place and there were two arrow wounds in the legs but apparently not shot at the living man but stuck in after his fall and after he had been stripped for the clothing was gone all but the boots and socks  in the front of the cocoanut palm there were five knots made in the long leaflets  all this is an almost certain indication that his death was the vengeance for five of the natives  blood for blood is a sacred law almost of nature wherever christianity has not prevailed and a whole tribe is held responsible for the crime of one  five men in fiji are known to have been stolen from nukapu and probably their families believed them to have been killed and believed themselves to be performing a sacred duty when they dipped their weapons in the blood of the bisope whom they did not know well enough to understand that he was their protector  nay it is likely that there had been some such discussion as had saved him before at mai from suffering for peteres death and indeed one party seem to have wished to keep him from landing and to have thus solemnly and reverently treated his body  even when the tidings came in the brief uncircumstantial telegram there were none of those who loved and revered him who did not feel that such was the death he always looked for and that he had willingly given his life  there was peace in the thought even while hearts trembled with dread of hearing of accompanying horrors and when the full story arrived showing how far more painless his death had been than had he lived on to suffer from his broken health and how wonderfully the unconscious heathen had marked him with emblems so sacred in our eyes there was thankfulness and joy even to the bereaved at home  the sweet calm smile preached peace to the mourners who had lost his guiding spirit but they could not look on it long  the next morning st matthews day the body of john coleridge patteson was committed to the waters of the pacific his son after the faith joseph atkin reading the burial service  mr atkin afterwards wrote to his mother  he had written to his father the day before but the substance of his letter has been given in the narrative   september 21 1871  my dear motherwe have had a terrible loss such a blow that we cannot at all realise it  our bishop is dead killed by the natives at nukapu yesterday  we got the body and buried it this morning he was alone on shore and none of us saw it done  we were attacked in the boat too and stephen so badly wounded that i am afraid there is small hope of his recovery  john and i have arrow wounds but not severe  our poor boys seem quite awestricken  captain jacobs is very much cut up  brooke although not at all well has quite devoted himself to the wounded and so has less time to think about it all  it would only be selfish to wish him back  he has gone to his rest dying as he lived in his masters service  it seems a shocking way to die but i can say from experience that it is far more to hear of than to suffer  in whatever way so peaceful a life as his is ended his end is peace  there was no sign of fear or pain on his facejust the look that he used to have when asleep patient and a little wearied  what a stroke his death will be to hundreds what his mission will do without him god only knows who has taken him away  his ways are not as our ways  seeing people taken away when as we think they are almost necessary to do gods work on earth makes one think that we often think and talk too much about christian work  what god requires is christian men  he does not need the work only gives it to form or perfect the character of the men whom he sends to do it  stephen is in great pain at times tonight one of the arrows seems to have entered his lungs and it is broken in too deep to be got out  john is wounded in the right shoulder i in the left  we are both maimed for the time but if it were not for the fear of poison the wounds would not be worth noticing  i do not expect any bad consequences but they are possible  what would make me cling to life more than anything else is the thought of you at home but if it be gods will that i am to die i know he will enable you to bear it and bring good for you out of it  saturday 23rdwe are all doing well  stephen keeps up his strength sleeps well and has no long attacks of pain  we have had good breezes yesterday and todayvery welcome it is but the motion makes writing too much labour  brooke and edward wogale are both unwellague i believe with both of them and brookes nerves are upset  he has slept most of today and will probably be the better for it  his private journal adds  september 21stburied the bishop in the morning  the wounded all doing well but stephen in pain occasionally  calm day passed over a reef in the morning about eighteen miles north of nukapu nine fathoms on it  thermometer ninetyone degrees yesterday and today began writing home at night  began reading miss yonges chaplet of pearls  friday 22nda light breeze came up in the evening which freshened through the night and carried us past tenakulu  stephen doing very well had a good night and has very little pain today a breeze through the day much cooler  i am dressing my shoulder with brine  read some sermons of vaughans preached at doncaster during passion week  saturday 23rdbreeze through the day  a few showers of rain brooke and wogale down with ague gave wogale ipecacuanha and quinine afterwards  read mota prayers in evening  all wounds going on well finished chaplet of pearls and wrote a little  sunday 24ththis morning the wind went round to ne and n and then died away  we were 55 miles w of the torres islands at noon brooke took english and mota morning prayers  i celebrated holy communion afterwards  john came into cabin i went out to stephen  brooke and wogale both better but b quite weak  during that celebration while administering the sacred elements mr atkins tongue stumbled and hesitated over some of the words  then the mota men looked at one another and knew what would follow  he knew it himself too and called to joseph wate his own special pupil saying as the lad wrote to mr atkin the elder stephen and i again are going to follow the bishop and they of your country who is to speak to them  i do not know  then he said again it is all right  dont grieve about it because they did not do this thing of themselves but god allowed them to do it  it is very good because god would have it so because he only looks after us and he understands about us and now he wills to take away us two and it is well  there was much more for that strong young frame to undergo before the vigorous life could depart  the loss was to be borne  the head of the mission who had gone through long sickness and lain at the gates of the grave so long died almost painlessly his followers had deeply to drink of the cup of agony  the night between the 26th and 27th was terrible the whole nervous system being jerked and strained to pieces and he wandered too much to send any message home i lost my wits since they shot me he said  towards morning he almost leapt from his berth on the floor crying goodbye  mr  brooke asked if he would have a little sal volatile  no  a little brandy  no  do you want anything  i want nothing but to die  those were his last words  he lay convulsed on a mattress on the floor for about an hour longer and was released on the morning of the 29th  stephen with an arrow wound in the lungs and several more of these wounds in the chest could hardly have lived even without the terrible tetanus  he had spent his time in reading his mota gospel and prayerbook praying and speaking earnestly to the other men on board before the full agony came on  he was a tall large powerfully framed man and the struggles were violent before he too sank into rest on the morning of the 28th all the time most assiduously nursed by joseph wate  on st michaels day these two teachers of poor bauro received at the same time their funeral at sea  john coleridge patteson was fortyfour years and a half old  joseph atkin twentynine  stephen taroniara probably twentyfiveas he was about eighteen when he joined the mission in 1864  his little girl will be brought up at norfolk island his wife tara to whom he had been married only just before his voyage became consumptive and died january 1873 only twenty minutes after her baptism  as one of the scholars said had the songs of the angels for joy of her being made a child of god finished before they were again singing to welcome her an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven  john nonono showed no symptoms of tetanus but was landed at mota to recover under more favourable circumstances than the crowded cabin could afford  calms and baffling winds made the return to this island trying and difficult and mota was not reached till the 4th of october  george sarawia was still perfectly satisfactory and his community on the whole going on hopefully  want of provisions which mota could not supply made the stay very brief and after obtaining the necessary supplies at aurora the southern cross brought her sad tidings to norfolk island on the 17th  that day mrs palmer wrote   on monday afternoon 15th mr codrington went for a ride to the other side of the island and there espied the schooner eight miles off  he rode home quickly and soon the shouting and racing of the boys told us that the vessel had come  they were all at arrowroot making  never i think had the whole party english and natives seemed in higher spirits  mr bice walked to the settlement to see if she was far in enough to land that night we asked him to call and tell us on his way home  next morning mr bice rode down to see if it really was the schooner and was back to breakfast all thinking we should soon see them come up  mr codrington and mr bice got their horses ready to ride down and i got the rooms ready when in an hour a norfolk island boy rode up to say the flag was halfmast high  we told the boys and girls something was wrong to stop their joyous shouting and laughing and then i waited till mr jackson returned and all he could say was only brooke has come  what more shall i tell  comments on such a life and such a death are superfluous and to repeat the testimonies of friends outpourings of grief and utterances in sermons is but to weaken the impression of the reality  there is pain too in telling the further fate of nukapu  hms rosario commander markham then cruising in the southern pacific touched at norfolk island and captain markham undertook at once to go to the island and make enquiries  a protest was drawn up and signed by all the members of the mission against any attempt to punish the natives for the murder and captain markham a kind humane and conscientious man as no one can doubt promised that nothing of the kind should be attempted  but the natives could not but expect retaliation for what they had done  there was no interpreter  they knew nothing of flags of truce and when they saw a boat approaching full of white men armed what could they apprehend but vengeance for bisope  so they discharged a volley of arrows and a sergeant of marines was killed this was an attack on the british flag and it was severely chastised with british firearms  it is very much to be doubted whether nukapu will ever understand that her natives were shot not for killing the bishop but for firing on the british flag  for the present the way is closed and we can only echo fisher youngs sigh poor santa cruz people  bishop pattesons will bequeathed his whole inheritance to the melanesian mission and appointed that the senior priest should take charge of it until another bishop should be chosen  the rev robert codrington therefore took the management though refusing the episcopate and considering the peculiar qualifications needful for a melanesian bishop which can only be tested by actual experiment on physical as well as moral and spiritual abilities it has up to the present moment may 1873 been thought better to leave the see vacant obtaining episcopal aid from the bishop of auckland  but this implies no slackness nor falling off in the mission  by gods good providence coleridge patteson had so matured his system that it could work without him  mr codrington and the other clergy make their periodic voyages in the southern cross  kohimarama flourishes under george sarawia who was ordained priest at auckland on st barnabas day 1873  bishop cowie has paid a visit to norfolk island and ordained as deacons edward wogale robert pantatun henry tagalana to work in mota santa maria and ara  joseph wate remains the chief teacher of the lads from bauro but there is much to be done before the work in that island can be carried on  the people there seem peculiarly devoid of earnestness and it is remarkable that though they were among the first visited and their scholars the very earliest favourites stephen has been the only one whose christianity seems to have been substantial  but the sight of his patient endurance had the same effect on those who were with him in the ship as walter hotaswols exhortations had had on himself and several of them began in earnest to prepare for baptism  the english staff of the mission has been recruited by the rev john r selwyn and the rev john still as well as by mr kenny from new zealand  and there is good hope that he who hath begun a good work will perform it unto the day of the lord  as to the crimes connected with the murder the queen herself directed the attention of parliament to it in her speech at the commencement of the session of 1872  the admiralty do what in them lies to keep watch over the labour vessels by means of queens ships and in queensland regulations are made in fiji the british consul endeavours to examine the newly arrived whether they have been taken away by force  but it may be feared that it will not be possible entirely to prevent atrocities over so wide a range though if as bishop patteson suggested all vessels unregistered and not committed to trustworthy masters were liable to be seized and confiscated much of the shameless deceit and horrible skullhunting would be prevented  perhaps the fittest conclusion to the bishops history will be the words written by henry tagalana translated literally by mr codrington  as he taught he confirmed his word with his good life among us as we all know and also that he perfectly well helped anyone who might be unhappy about anything and spoke comfort to him about it and about his character and conduct they are consistent with the law of god  he gave the evidence of it in his practice for he did nothing carelessly lest he should make anyone stumble and turn from the good way and again he did nothing to gain anything for himself alone but he sought what he might keep others with and then he worked with it and the reason was his pitifulness and his love  and again he did not despise anyone nor reject anyone with scorn whether it were a white or a black person he thought them all as one and he loved them all alike  he loved them all alike  that was the secret of john coleridge pattesons history and his labours  need more be said of him  surely the simple islanders summary of his character is the honour he would prefer
