who has made a great deal of money out of tarletons underwear  the house is in surrey on the slope of hindhead and johnny reclining novel in hand in a swinging chair with a little awning above it is enshrined in a spacious half hemisphere of glass which forms a pavilion commanding the garden and beyond it a barren but lovely landscape of hill profile with fir trees commons of bracken and gorse and wonderful cloud pictures  the glass pavilion springs from a bridgelike arch in the wall of the house through which one comes into a big hall with tiled flooring which suggests that the proprietors notion of domestic luxury is founded on the lounges of weekend hotels  the arch is not quite in the centre of the wall  there is more wall to its right than to its left and this space is occupied by a hat rack and umbrella stand in which tennis rackets white parasols caps panama hats and other summery articles are bestowed  just through the arch at this corner stands a new portable turkish bath recently unpacked with its crate beside it and on the crate the drawn nails and the hammer used in unpacking  near the crate are open boxes of garden games  bowls and croquet  nearly in the middle of the glass wall of the pavilion is a door giving on the garden with a couple of steps to surmount the hotwater pipes which skirt the glass  at intervals round the pavilion are marble pillars with specimens of viennese pottery on them very flamboyant in colour and florid in design  between them are folded garden chairs flung anyhow against the pipes  in the side walls are two doors  one near the hat stand leading to the interior of the house the other on the opposite side and at the other end leading to the vestibule  there is no solid furniture except a sideboard which stands against the wall between the vestibule door and the pavilion a small writing table with a blotter a rack for telegram forms and stationery and a wastepaper basket standing out in the hall near the sideboard and a ladys worktable with two chairs at it towards the other side of the lounge  the writing table has also two chairs at it  on the sideboard there is a tantalus liqueur bottles a syphon a glass jug of lemonade tumblers and every convenience for casual drinking also a plate of sponge cakes and a highly ornate punchbowl in the same style as the keramic display in the pavilion  wicker chairs and little bamboo tables with ash trays and boxes of matches on them are scattered in all directions  in the pavilion which is flooded with sunshine is the elaborate patent swing seat and awning in which johnny reclines with his novel  there are two wicker chairs right and left of him  bentley summerhays one of those smallish thinskinned youths who from 17 to 70 retain unaltered the mental airs of the later and the physical appearance of the earlier age appears in the garden and comes through the glass door into the pavilion  he is unmistakably a grade above johnny socially and though he looks sensitive enough his assurance and his high voice are a little exasperating  johnny  hallo  wheres your luggage  bentley  i left it at the station  ive walked up from haslemere he goes to the hat stand and hangs up his hat  johnny shortly  oh  and whos to fetch it  bentley  dont know  dont care  providence probably  if not your mother will have it fetched  johnny  not her business exactly is it  bentley  returning to the pavilion  of course not  thats why one loves her for doing it  look here  chuck away your silly weekend novel and talk to a chap  after a week in that filthy office my brain is simply bluemouldy  lets argue about something intellectual he throws himself into the wicker chair on johnnys right  johnny  straightening up in the swing with a yell of protest  no now seriously bunny ive come down here to have a pleasant weekend and im not going to stand your confounded arguments  if you want to argue get out of this and go over to the congregationalist ministers  hes a nailer at arguing  he likes it  bentley  you cant argue with a person when his livelihood depends on his not letting you convert him  and would you mind not calling me bunny  my name is bentley summerhays which you please  johnny  whats the matter with bunny  bentley  it puts me in a false position  have you ever considered the fact that i was an afterthought  johnny  an afterthought  what do you mean by that  bentley  i  johnny  no stop  i dont want to know  its only a dodge to start an argument  bentley  dont be afraid  it wont overtax your brain  my father was 44 when i was born  my mother was 41  there was twelve years between me and the next eldest  i was unexpected  i was probably unintentional  my brothers and sisters are not the least like me theyre the regular thing that you always get in the first batch from young parents  quite pleasant ordinary dotheregularthing sort all body and no brains like you  johnny  thank you  bentley  dont mention it old chap  now im different  by the time i was born the old couple knew something  so i came out all brains and no more body than is absolutely necessary  i am really a good deal older than you though you were born ten years sooner  everybody feels that when they hear us talk consequently though its quite natural to hear me calling you johnny it sounds ridiculous and unbecoming for you to call me bunny  he rises  johnny  does it by george  you stop me doing it if you can  thats all  bentley  if you go on doing it after ive asked you not youll feel an awful swine  he strolls away carelessly to the sideboard with his eye on the sponge cakes  at least i should but i suppose youre not so particular  johnny rising vengefully and following bentley who is forced to turn and listen  ill tell you what it is my boy  you want a good talking to and im going to give it to you  if you think that because your fathers a kcb and you want to marry my sister you can make yourself as nasty as you please and say what you like youre mistaken  let me tell you that except hypatia not one person in this house is in favor of her marrying you and i dont believe shes happy about it herself  the match isnt settled yet  dont forget that youre on trial in the office because the governor isnt giving his daughter money for an idle man to live on her  youre on trial here because my mother thinks a girl should know what a man is like in the house before she marries him  thats been going on for two months now and whats the result  youve got yourself thoroughly disliked in the office and youre getting yourself thoroughly disliked here all through your bad manners and your conceit and the damned impudence you think clever  bentley  deeply wounded and trying hard to control himself  thats enough thank you  you dont suppose i hope that i should have come down if i had known that that was how you felt about me  he makes for the vestibule door  johnny  collaring him  no  you dont run away  im going to have this out with you  sit down  dy hear  bentley attempts to go with dignity  johnny slings him into a chair at the writing table where he sits bitterly humiliated but afraid to speak lest he should burst into tears  thats the advantage of having more body than brains you see  it enables me to teach you manners and im going to do it too  youre a spoilt young pup and you need a jolly good licking  and if youre not careful youll get it  ill see to that next time you call me a swine  bentley  i didnt call you a swine  but bursting into a fury of tears  you are a swine  youre a beast  youre a brute  youre a cad  youre a liar  youre a bully  i should like to wring your damned neck for you  johnny  with a derisive laugh  try it my son  bentley gives an inarticulate sob of rage  fighting isnt in your line  youre too small and youre too childish  i always suspected that your cleverness wouldnt come to very much when it was brought up against something solid  some decent chaps fist for instance  bentley  i hope your beastly fist may come up against a mad bull or a prizefighters nose or something solider than me  i dont care about your fist but if everybody here dislikes me he is checked by a sob  well i dont care  trying to recover himself  im sorry i intruded  i didnt know  breaking down again  oh you beast you pig  swine swine swine swine swine  now  johnny  all right my lad all right  sling your mud as hard as you please  it wont stick to me  what i want to know is this  how is it that your father who i suppose is the strongest man england has produced in our time  bentley  you got that out of your halfpenny paper  a lot you know about him  johnny  i dont set up to be able to do anything but admire him and appreciate him and be proud of him as an englishman  if it wasnt for my respect for him i wouldnt have stood your cheek for two days let alone two months  but what i cant understand is why he didnt lick it out of you when you were a kid  for twentyfive years he kept a place twice as big as england in order  a place full of seditious coffeecolored heathens and pestilential white agitators in the middle of a lot of savage tribes  and yet he couldnt keep you in order  i dont set up to be half the man your father undoubtedly is but by george its lucky for you you were not my son  i dont hold with my own fathers views about corporal punishment being wrong  its necessary for some people and id have tried it on you until you first learnt to howl and then to behave yourself  bentley  contemptuously  yes  behavior wouldnt come naturally to your son would it  johnny  stung into sudden violence  now you keep a civil tongue in your head  ill stand none of your snobbery  im just as proud of tarletons underwear as you are of your fathers title and his kcb and all the rest of it  my father began in a little hole of a shop in leeds no bigger than our pantry down the passage there  he  bentley  oh yes  i know  ive read it  the romance of business or the story of tarletons underwear  please take one  i took one the day after i first met hypatia  i went and bought half a dozen unshrinkable vests for her sake  johnny  well  did they shrink  bentley  oh dont be a fool  johnny  never mind whether im a fool or not  did they shrink thats the point  were they worth the money  bentley  i couldnt wear them  do you think my skins as thick as your customers hides  id as soon have dressed myself in a nutmeg grater  johnny  pity your father didnt give your thin skin a jolly good lacing with a cane  bentley  pity you havnt got more than one idea  if you want to know they did try that on me once when i was a small kid  a silly governess did it  i yelled fit to bring down the house and went into convulsions and brain fever and that sort of thing for three weeks so the old girl got the sack and serve her right  after that i was let do what i like  my father didnt want me to grow up a brokenspirited spaniel which is your idea of a man i suppose  johnny  jolly good thing for you that my father made you come into the office and shew what you were made of  and it didnt come to much let me tell you that  when the governor asked me where i thought we ought to put you i said make him the office boy  the governor said you were too green  and so you were  bentley  i daresay  so would you be pretty green if you were shoved into my fathers set  i picked up your silly business in a fortnight youve been at it ten years and you havnt picked it up yet  johnny  dont talk rot child  you know you simply make me pity you  bentley  romance of business indeed  the real romance of tarletons business is the story that you understand anything about it  you never could explain any mortal thing about it to me when i asked you  see what was done the last time  that was the beginning and the end of your wisdom  youre nothing but a turnspit  johnny  a what  bentley  a turnspit  if your father hadnt made a roasting jack for you to turn youd be earning twentyfour shillings a week behind a counter  johnny  if you dont take that back and apologize for your bad manners ill give you as good a hiding as ever  bentley  help  johnnys beating me  oh  murder  he throws himself on the ground uttering piercing yells  johnny  dont be a fool  stop that noise will you  im not going to touch you  shsh  hypatia rushes in through the inner door followed by mrs tarleton and throws herself on her knees by bentley  mrs tarleton whose knees are stiffer bends over him and tries to lift him  mrs tarleton is a shrewd and motherly old lady who has been pretty in her time and is still very pleasant and likeable and unaffected  hypatia is a typical english girl of a sort never called typical  that is she has an opaque white skin black hair large dark eyes with black brows and lashes curved lips swift glances and movements that flash out of a waiting stillness boundless energy and audacity held in leash  hypatia  pouncing on bentley with no very gentle hand  bentley whats the matter  dont cry like that  whats the use  whats happened  mrs tarleton  are you ill child  they get him up  there there pet  its all right  dont cry they put him into a chair  there there there  johnny will go for the doctor and hell give you something nice to make it well  hypatia  what has happened johnny  mrs tarleton  was it a wasp  bentley  impatiently  wasp be dashed  mrs tarleton  oh bunny that was a naughty word  bentley  yes i know  i beg your pardon  he rises and extricates himself from them  thats all right  johnny frightened me  you know how easy it is to hurt me and im too small to defend myself against johnny  mrs tarleton  johnny  how often have i told you that you must not bully the little ones  i thought youd outgrown all that  hypatia  angrily  i do declare mamma that johnnys brutality makes it impossible to live in the house with him  johnny  deeply hurt  its twentyseven years mother since you had that row with me for licking robert and giving hypatia a black eye because she bit me  i promised you then that id never raise my hand to one of them again and ive never broken my word  and now because this young whelp begins to cry out before hes hurt you treat me as if i were a brute and a savage  mrs tarleton  no dear not a savage but you know you must not call our visitor naughty names  bentley  oh let him alone  johnny  fiercely  dont you interfere between my mother and me dy hear  hypatia  johnnys lost his temper mother  wed better go  come bentley  mrs tarleton  yes  that will be best  to bentley  johnny doesnt mean any harm dear  hell be himself presently  come  the two ladies go out through the inner door with bentley who turns at the door to grin at johnny as he goes out  johnny left alone clenches his fists and grinds his teeth but can find no relief in that way for his rage  after choking and stamping for a moment he makes for the vestibule door  it opens before he reaches it and lord summerhays comes in  johnny glares at him speechless  lord summerhays takes in the situation and quickly takes the punchbowl from the sideboard and offers it to johnny  lord summerhays  smash it  dont hesitate  its an ugly thing smash it  hard  johnny with a stifled yell dashes it in pieces and then sits down and mops his brow  feel better now  johnny nods  i know only one person alive who could drive me to the point of having either to break china or commit murder and that person is my son bentley  was it he  johnny nods again not yet able to speak  as the car stopped i heard a yell which is only too familiar to me  it generally means that some infuriated person is trying to thrash bentley  nobody has ever succeeded though almost everybody has tried  he seats himself comfortably close to the writing table and sets to work to collect the fragments of the punchbowl in the wastepaper basket whilst johnny with diminishing difficulty collects himself  bentley is a problem which i confess i have never been able to solve  he was born to be a great success at the age of fifty most englishmen of his class seem to be born to be great successes at the age of twentyfour at most  the domestic problem for me is how to endure bentley until he is fifty  the problem for the nation is how to get itself governed by men whose growth is arrested when they are little more than college lads  bentley doesnt really mean to be offensive  you can always make him cry by telling him you dont like him  only he cries so loud that the experiment should be made in the open air  in the middle of salisbury plain if possible  he has a hard and penetrating intellect and a remarkable power of looking facts in the face but unfortunately being very young he has no idea of how very little of that sort of thing most of us can stand  on the other hand he is frightfully sensitive and even affectionate so that he probably gets as much as he gives in the way of hurt feelings youll excuse me rambling on like this about my son  johnny  who has pulled himself together  you did it on purpose i wasnt quite myself  i needed a moment to pull round  thank you  lord summerhays  not at all  is your father at home  johnny  no  hes opening one of his free libraries  thats another nice little penny gone  hes mad on reading  he promised another free library last week  its ruinous  itll hit you as well as me when bunny marries hypatia  when all hypatias money is thrown away on libraries where will bunny come in  cant you stop him  lord summerhays  im afraid not  hes a perfect whirlwind indefatigable at public work  wonderful man i think  johnny  oh public work  he does too much of it  its really a sort of laziness getting away from your own serious business to amuse yourself with other peoples  mind  i dont say there isnt another side to it  it has its value as an advertisement  it makes useful acquaintances and leads to valuable business connections  but it takes his mind off the main chance and he overdoes it  lord summerhays  the danger of public business is that it never ends a man may kill himself at it  johnny  or he can spend more on it than it brings him in  thats how i look at it  what i say is that everybodys business is nobodys business  i hope im not a hard man nor a narrow man nor unwilling to pay reasonable taxes and subscribe in reason to deserving charities and even serve on a jury in my turn and no man can say i ever refused to help a friend out of a difficulty when he was worth helping  but when you ask me to go beyond that i tell you frankly i dont see it  i never did see it even when i was only a boy and had to pretend to take in all the ideas the governor fed me up with  i didnt see it and i dont see it  lord summerhays  there is certainly no business reason why you should take more than your share of the worlds work  johnny  so i say  its really a great encouragement to me to find you agree with me  for of course if nobody agrees with you how are you to know that youre not a fool  lord summerhays  quite so  johnny  i wish youd talk to him about it  its no use my saying anything  im a child to him still  i have no influence  besides you know how to handle men  see how you handled me when i was making a fool of myself about bunny  lord summerhays  not at all  johnny  oh yes i was  i know i was  well if my blessed father had come in hed have told me to control myself  as if i was losing my temper on purpose  bentley returns newly washed  he beams when he sees his father and comes affectionately behind him and pats him on the shoulders  bentley  hello commander have you come  ive been making a filthy silly ass of myself here  im awfully sorry johnny old chap  i beg your pardon  why dont you kick me when i go on like that  lord summerhays  as we came through godalming i thought i heard some yelling  bentley  i should think you did  johnny was rather rough on me though  he told me nobody here liked me and i was silly enough to believe him  lord summerhays  and all the women have been kissing you and pitying you ever since to stop your crying i suppose  baby  bentley  i did cry  but i always feel good after crying  it relieves my wretched nerves  i feel perfectly jolly now  lord summerhays  not at all ashamed of yourself for instance  bentley  if i started being ashamed of myself i shouldnt have time for anything else all my life  i say  i feel very fit and spry lets all go down and meet the grand cham  he goes to the hatstand and takes down his hat  lord summerhays  does mr tarleton like to be called the grand cham do you think bentley  bentley  well he thinks hes too modest for it  he calls himself plain john  but you cant call him that in his own office  besides it doesnt suit him  its not flamboyant enough  johnny  flam what  bentley  flamboyant  lets go and meet him  hes telephoned from guildford to say hes on the road  the dear old son is always telephoning or telegraphing  he thinks hes hustling along like anything when hes only sending unnecessary messages  lord summerhays  thank you  i should prefer a quiet afternoon  bentley  right o  i shant press johnny  hes had enough of me for one weekend  he goes out through the pavilion into the grounds  johnny  not a bad idea that  lord summerhays  what  johnny  going to meet the governor  you know you wouldnt think it but the governor likes bunny rather  and bunny is cultivating it  i shouldnt be surprised if he thought he could squeeze me out one of these days  lord summerhays  you dont say so  young rascal  i want to consult you about him if you dont mind  shall we stroll over to the gibbet bentley is too fast for me as a walking companion but i should like a short turn  johnny  rising eagerly highly flattered  right you are  thatll suit me down to the ground  he takes a panama and stick from the hat stand  mrs tarleton and hypatia come back just as the two men are going out hypatia salutes summerhays from a distance with an enigmatic lift of her eyelids in his direction and a demure nod before she sits down at the worktable and busies herself with her needle  mrs tarleton hospitably fussy goes over to him  mrs tarleton  oh lord summerhays i didnt know you were here  wont you have some tea  lord summerhays  no thank you  im not allowed tea  and im ashamed to say ive knocked over your beautiful punchbowl  you must let me replace it  mrs tarleton  oh it doesnt matter  im only too glad to be rid of it  the shopman told me it was in the best taste but when my poor old nurse martha got cataract bunny said it was a merciful provision of nature to prevent her seeing our china  lord summerhays  gravely  that was exceedingly rude of bentley mrs tarleton  i hope you told him so  mrs tarleton  oh bless you  i dont care what he says so long as he says it to me and not before visitors  johnny  were going out for a stroll mother  mrs tarleton  all right  dont let us keep you  never mind about that crock  ill get the girl to come and take the pieces away recollecting herself  there  ive done it again  johnny  done what  mrs tarleton  called her the girl  you know lord summerhays its a funny thing but now im getting old im dropping back into all the ways john and i had when we had barely a hundred a year  you should have known me when i was forty  i talked like a duchess and if johnny or hypatia let slip a word that was like old times i was down on them like anything  and now im beginning to do it myself at every turn  lord summerhays  there comes a time when all that seems to matter so little  even queens drop the mask when they reach our time of life  mrs tarleton  let you alone for giving a thing a pretty turn  youre a humbug you know lord summerhays  john doesnt know it and johnny doesnt know it but you and i know it dont we  now thats something that even you cant answer so be off with you for your walk without another word  lord summerhays smiles bows and goes out through the vestibule door followed by johnny  mrs tarleton sits down at the worktable and takes out her darning materials and one of her husbands socks hypatia is at the other side of the table on her mothers right they chat as they work  hypatia  i wonder whether they laugh at us when they are by themselves  mrs tarleton  who  hypatia  bentley and his father and all the toffs in their set  mrs tarleton  oh thats only their way  i used to think that the aristocracy were a nasty sneering lot and that they were laughing at me and john  theyre always giggling and pretending not to care much about anything  but you get used to it  theyre the same to one another and to everybody  besides what does it matter what they think  its far worse when theyre civil because that always means that they want you to lend them money and you must never do that hypatia because they never pay  how can they  they dont make anything you see  of course if you can make up your mind to regard it as a gift thats different but then they generally ask you again and you may as well say no first as last  you neednt be afraid of the aristocracy dear  theyre only human creatures like ourselves after all and youll hold your own with them easy enough  hypatia  oh im not a bit afraid of them i assure you  mrs tarleton  well no not afraid of them exactly but youve got to pick up their ways  you know dear i never quite agreed with your fathers notion of keeping clear of them and sending you to a school that was so expensive that they couldnt afford to send their daughters there so that all the girls belonged to big business families like ourselves  it takes all sorts to make a world and i wanted you to see a little of all sorts  when you marry bunny and go among the women of his fathers set theyll shock you at first  hypatia  incredulously  how  mrs tarleton  well the things they talk about  hypatia  oh scandalmongering  mrs tarleton  oh no  we all do that  thats only human nature  but you know theyve no notion of decency  i shall never forget the first day i spent with a marchioness two duchesses and no end of ladies this and that  of course it was only a committee  theyd put me on to get a big subscription out of john  id never heard such talk in my life  the things they mentioned  and it was the marchioness that started it  hypatia  what sort of things  mrs tarleton  drainage  shed tried three systems in her castle and she was going to do away with them all and try another  i didnt know which way to look when she began talking about it  i thought theyd all have got up and gone out of the room  but not a bit of it if you please  they were all just as bad as she  they all had systems and each of them swore by her own system  i sat there with my cheeks burning until one of the duchesses thinking i looked out of it i suppose asked me what system i had  i said i was sure i knew nothing about such things and hadnt we better change the subject then the fat was in the fire i can tell you  there was a regular terror of a countess with an anaerobic system and she told me downright brutally that id better learn something about them before my children died of diphtheria  that was just two months after id buried poor little bobby and that was the very thing he died of poor little lamb  i burst out crying  i couldnt help it  it was as good as telling me id killed my own child  i had to go away but before i was out of the door one of the duchessesquite a young womanbegan talking about what sour milk did in her inside and how she expected to live to be over a hundred if she took it regularly  and me listening to her that had never dared to think that a duchess could have anything so common as an inside  i shouldnt have minded if it had been childrens insides  we have to talk about them  but grownup people  i was glad to get away that time  hypatia  there was a physiology and hygiene class started at school but of course none of our girls were let attend it  mrs tarleton  if it had been an aristocratic school plenty would have attended it  thats what theyre like  theyve nasty minds  with really nice good women a thing is either decent or indecent and if its indecent we just dont mention it or pretend to know about it and theres an end of it  but all the aristocracy cares about is whether it can get any good out of the thing  theyre what johnny calls cynicallike  and of course nobody can say a word to them for it  theyre so high up that they can do and say what they like  hypatia  well i think they might leave the drains to their husbands i shouldnt think much of a man that left such things to me  mrs tarleton  oh dont think that dear whatever you do  i never let on about it to you but its me that takes care of the drainage here  after what that countess said to me i wasnt going to lose another child or trust john  and i dont want my grandchildren to die any more than my children  hypatia  do you think bentley will ever be as big a man as his father  i dont mean clever  i mean big and strong  mrs tarleton  not he  hes overbred like one of those expensive little dogs  i like a bit of a mongrel myself whether its a man or a dog  theyre the best for everyday  but we all have our tastes whats one womans meat is another womans poison  bunnys a dear little fellow but i never could have fancied him for a husband when i was your age  hypatia  yes but he has some brains  hes not like all the rest one cant have everything  mrs tarleton  oh youre quite right dear  quite right  its a great thing to have brains  look what its done for your father thats the reason i never said a word when you jilted poor jerry mackintosh  hypatia  excusing herself  i really couldnt stick it out with jerry mother  i know you liked him and nobody can deny that hes a splendid animal  mrs tarleton  shocked  hypatia  how can you  the things that girls say nowadays  hypatia  well what else can you call him  if id been deaf or hed been dumb i could have married him  but living with father ive got accustomed to cleverness  jerry would drive me mad  you know very well hes a fool  even johnny thinks him a fool  mrs tarleton  up in arms at once in defence of her boy  now dont begin about my johnny  you know it annoys me  johnnys as clever as anybody else in his own way  i dont say hes as clever as you in some ways but hes a man at all events and not a little squit of a thing like your bunny  hypatia  oh i say nothing against your darling  we all know johnnys perfection  mrs tarleton  dont be cross dearie  you let johnny alone and ill let bunny alone  im just as bad as you  there  hypatia  oh i dont mind your saying that about bentley  its true he is a little squit of a thing  i wish he wasnt  but who else is there  think of all the other chances ive had  not one of them has as much brains in his whole body as bentley has in his little finger besides theyve no distinction  its as much as i can do to tell one from the other  they wouldnt even have money if they werent the sons of their fathers like johnny  whats a girl to do  i never met anybody like bentley before  he may be small but hes the best of the bunch  you cant deny that  mrs tarleton  with a sigh  well my pet if you fancy him theres no more to be said  a pause follows this remark  the two women sewing silently  hypatia  mother  do you think marriage is as much a question of fancy as it used to be in your time and fathers  mrs tarleton  oh it wasnt much fancy with me dear  your father just wouldnt take no for an answer and i was only too glad to be his wife instead of his shopgirl  still its curious but i had more choice than you in a way because you see i was poor and there are so many more poor men than rich ones that i might have had more of a pick as you might say if john hadnt suited me  hypatia  i can imagine all sorts of men i could fall in love with but i never seem to meet them  the real ones are too small like bunny or too silly like jerry  of course one can get into a state about any man  fall in love with him if you like to call it that but who would risk marrying a man for love  i shouldnt  i remember three girls at school who agreed that the one man you should never marry was the man you were in love with because it would make a perfect slave of you  theres a sort of instinct against it i think thats just as strong as the other instinct  one of them to my certain knowledge refused a man she was in love with and married another who was in love with her and it turned out very well  mrs tarleton  does all that mean that youre not in love with bunny  hypatia  oh how could anybody be in love with bunny  i like him to kiss me just as i like a baby to kiss me  im fond of him and he never bores me and i see that hes very clever but im not what you call gone about him if thats what you mean  mrs tarleton  then why need you marry him  hypatia  what better can i do  i must marry somebody i suppose ive realized that since i was twentythree  i always used to take it as a matter of course that i should be married before i was twenty  bentleys voice  in the garden  youve got to keep yourself fresh to look at these things with an open mind  john tarletons voice  quite right quite right  i always say so  mrs tarleton  theres your father and bunny with him  bentley  keep young  keep your eye on me  thats the tip for you  bentley and mr tarleton an immense and genial veteran of trade come into view and enter the pavilion  john tarleton  you think youre young do you  you think im old energetically shaking off his motoring coat and hanging it up with his cap  bentley  helping him with the coat  of course youre old  look at your face and look at mine  what you call your youth is nothing but your levity  why do we get on so well together  because im a young cub and youre an old josser  he throws a cushion at hypatias feet and sits down on it with his back against her knees  tarleton  old  thats all you know about it my lad  how do patsy hypatia kisses him  how is my chickabiddy  he kisses mrs tarletons hand and poses expansively in the middle of the picture look at me  look at these wrinkles these gray hairs this repulsive mask that you call old age  what is it  vehemently  i ask you what is it  bentley  jolly nice and venerable old man  dont be discouraged  tarleton  nice  not a bit of it  venerable  venerable be blowed read your darwin my boy  read your weismann  he goes to the sideboard for a drink of lemonade  mrs tarleton  for shame john  tell him to read his bible  tarleton  manipulating the syphon  whats the use of telling children to read the bible when you know they wont  i was kept away from the bible for forty years by being told to read it when i was young  then i picked it up one evening in a hotel in sunderland when i had left all my papers in the train and i found it wasnt half bad he drinks and puts down the glass with a smack of enjoyment better than most halfpenny papers anyhow if only you could make people believe it  he sits down by the writingtable near his wife  but if you want to understand old age scientifically read darwin and weismann  of course if you want to understand it romantically read about solomon  mrs tarleton  have you had tea john  tarleton  yes  dont interrupt me when im improving the boys mind where was i  this repulsive maskyes  explosively  what is death  mrs tarleton  john  hypatia  death is a rather unpleasant subject papa  tarleton  not a bit  not scientifically  scientifically its a delightful subject  you think deaths natural  well it isnt  you read weismann  there wasnt any death to start with  you go look in any ditch outside and youll find swimming about there as fresh as paint some of the identical little live cells that adam christened in the garden of eden  but if big things like us didnt die wed crowd one another off the face of the globe  nothing survived sir except the sort of people that had the sense and good manners to die and make room for the fresh supplies  and so death was introduced by natural selection  you get it out of your head my lad that im going to die because im wearing out or decaying  theres no such thing as decay to a vital man  i shall clear out but i shant decay  bentley  and what about the wrinkles and the almond tree and the grasshopper that becomes a burden and the desire that fails  tarleton  does it by george  no sir  it spiritualizes  as to your grasshopper i can carry an elephant  mrs tarleton  you do say such things bunny  what does he mean by the almond tree  tarleton  he means my white hairs  the repulsive mask  that my boy is another invention of natural selection to disgust young women with me and give the lads a turn  mrs tarleton  john  i wont have it  thats a forbidden subject  tarleton  they talk of the wickedness and vanity of women painting their faces and wearing auburn wigs at fifty  but why shouldnt they why should a woman allow nature to put a false mask of age on her when she knows that shes as young as ever  why should she look in the glass and see a wrinkled lie when a touch of fine art will shew her a glorious truth  the wrinkles are a dodge to repel young men  suppose she doesnt want to repel young men  suppose she likes them  mrs tarleton  bunny  take hypatia out into the grounds for a walk theres a good boy  john has got one of his naughty fits this evening  hypatia  oh never mind me  im used to him  bentley  im not  i never heard such conversation  i cant believe my ears  and mind you this is the man who objected to my marrying his daughter on the ground that a marriage between a member of the great and good middle class with one of the vicious and corrupt aristocracy would be a misalliance  a misalliance if you please this is the man ive adopted as a father  tarleton  eh  whats that  adopted me as a father have you  bentley  yes  thats an idea of mine  i knew a chap named joey percival at oxford you know i was two months at balliol before i was sent down for telling the old woman who was head of that silly college what i jolly well thought of him  he would have been glad to have me back too at the end of six months but i wouldnt go  i just let him want and serve him right  well joey was a most awfully clever fellow and so nice  i asked him what made such a difference between him and all the other pupsthey were pups if you like  he told me it was very simple  they had only one father apiece and he had three  mrs tarleton  dont talk nonsense child  how could that be  bentley  oh very simple  his father  tarleton  which father  bentley  the first one  the regulation natural chap  he kept a tame philosopher in the house  a sort of coleridge or herbert spencer kind of card you know  that was the second father  then his mother was an italian princess and she had an italian priest always about  he was supposed to take charge of her conscience but from what i could make out she jolly well took charge of his  the whole three of them took charge of joeys conscience  he used to hear them arguing like mad about everything  you see the philosopher was a freethinker and always believed the latest thing  the priest didnt believe anything because it was sure to get him into trouble with someone or another and the natural father kept an open mind and believed whatever paid him best  between the lot of them joey got cultivated no end  he said if he could only have had three mothers as well hed have backed himself against napoleon  tarleton  impressed  thats an idea  thats a most interesting idea  a most important idea  mrs tarleton  you always were one for ideas john  tarleton  youre right chickabiddy  what do i tell johnny when he brags about tarletons underwear  its not the underwear  the underwear be hanged  anybody can make underwear  anybody can sell underwear  tarletons ideas  thats whats done it  ive often thought of putting that up over the shop  bentley  take me into partnership when you do old man  im wasted on the underwear but i shall come in strong on the ideas  tarleton  you be a good boy and perhaps i will  mrs tarleton  scenting a plot against her beloved johnny  now john  you promised  tarleton  yes yes  all right chickabiddy  dont fuss  your precious johnny shant be interfered with  bouncing up too energetic to sit still  but im getting sick of that old shop thirtyfive years ive had of it  same blessed old stairs to go up and down every day  same old lot  same old game  sorry i ever started it now  ill chuck it and try something else  something that will give a scope to all my faculties  hypatia  theres money in underwear  theres none in wildcat ideas  tarleton  theres money in me madam no matter what i go into  mrs tarleton  dont boast john  dont tempt providence  tarleton  rats  you dont understand providence  providence likes to be tempted  thats the secret of the successful man  read browning natural theology on an island eh  caliban was afraid to tempt providence  that was why he was never able to get even with prospero what did prospero do  prospero didnt even tempt providence  he was providence  thats one of tarletons ideas and dont you forget it  bentley  you are full of beef today old man  tarleton  beef be blowed  joy of life  read ibsen  he goes into the pavilion to relieve his restlessness and stares out with his hands thrust deep in his pockets  hypatia  thoughtful  bentley  couldnt you invite your friend mr percival down here  bentley  not if i know it  youd throw me over the moment you set eyes on him  mrs tarleton  oh bunny  for shame  bentley  well whod marry me dyou suppose if they could get my brains with a fullsized body  no thank you  i shall take jolly good care to keep joey out of this until hypatia is past praying for  johnny and lord summerhays return through the pavilion from their stroll  tarleton  welcome welcome  why have you stayed away so long  lord summerhays  shaking hands  yes  i should have come sooner but im still rather lost in england  johnny takes his hat and hangs it up beside his own  thank you  johnny returns to his swing and his novel  lord summerhays comes to the writing table the fact is that as ive nothing to do i never have time to go anywhere  he sits down next mrs tarleton  tarleton  following him and sitting down on his left  paradox paradox  good  paradoxes are the only truths  read chesterton  but theres lots for you to do here  you have a genius for government you learnt your job out there in jinghiskahn  well we want to be governed here in england  govern us  lord summerhays  ah yes my friend but in jinghiskahn you have to govern the right way  if you dont you go under and come home  here everything has to be done the wrong way to suit governors who understand nothing but partridge shooting our english native princes in fact and voters who dont know what theyre voting about  i dont understand these democratic games and im afraid im too old to learn  what can i do but sit in the window of my club which consists mostly of retired indian civil servants  we look on at the muddle and the folly and amateurishness and we ask each other where a single fortnight of it would have landed us  tarleton  very true  still democracys all right you know  read mill  read jefferson  lord summerhays  yes  democracy reads well but it doesnt act well like some peoples plays  no no my friend tarleton  to make democracy work you need an aristocratic democracy  to make aristocracy work you need a democratic aristocracy  youve got neither and theres an end of it  tarleton  still you know the superman may come  the supermans an idea  i believe in ideas  read whatshisname  lord summerhays  reading is a dangerous amusement tarleton  i wish i could persuade your free library people of that  tarleton  why man its the beginning of education  lord summerhays  on the contrary its the end of it  how can you dare teach a man to read until youve taught him everything else first  johnny  intercepting his fathers reply by coming out of the swing and taking the floor  leave it at that  thats good sense  anybody on for a game of tennis  bentley  oh lets have some more improving conversation  wouldnt you rather johnny  johnny  if you ask me no  tarleton  johnny  you dont cultivate your mind  you dont read  johnny  coming between his mother and lord summerhays book in hand  yes i do  i bet you what you like that page for page i read more than you though i dont talk about it so much  only i dont read the same books  i like a book with a plot in it  you like a book with nothing in it but some idea that the chap that writes it keeps worrying like a cat chasing its own tail  i can stand a little of it just as i can stand watching the cat for two minutes say when ive nothing better to do  but a man soon gets fed up with that sort of thing  the fact is you look on an author as a sort of god  i look on him as a man that i pay to do a certain thing for me  i pay him to amuse me and to take me out of myself and make me forget  tarleton  no  wrong principle  you want to remember  read kipling lest we forget  johnny  if kipling wants to remember let him remember  if he had to run tarletons underwear hed be jolly glad to forget  as he has a much softer job and wants to keep himself before the public his cry is dont you forget the sort of things im rather clever at writing about  well i dont blame him  its his business  i should do the same in his place  but what he wants and what i want are two different things  i want to forget and i pay another man to make me forget  if i buy a book or go to the theatre i want to forget the shop and forget myself from the moment i go in to the moment i come out  thats what i pay my money for  and if i find that the authors simply getting at me the whole time i consider that hes obtained my money under false pretences  im not a morbid crank  im a natural man and as such i dont like being got at  if a man in my employment did it i should sack him  if a member of my club did it i should cut him  if he went too far with it i should bring his conduct before the committee  i might even punch his head if it came to that  well who and what is an author that he should be privileged to take liberties that are not allowed to other men  mrs tarleton  you see john  what have i always told you  johnny has as much to say for himself as anybody when he likes  johnny  im no fool mother whatever some people may fancy  i dont set up to have as many ideas as the governor but what ideas i have are consecutive at all events  i can think as well as talk  bentley  to tarleton chuckling  had you there old man hadnt he  you are rather all over the shop with your ideas aint you  johnny  handsomely  im not saying anything against you governor  but i do say that the time has come for sane healthy unpretending men like me to make a stand against this conspiracy of the writing and talking and artistic lot to put us in the back row it isnt a fact that were inferior to them  its a putup job and its they that have put the job up  its we that run the country for them and all the thanks we get is to be told were philistines and vulgar tradesmen and sordid city men and so forth and that theyre all angels of light and leading  the time has come to assert ourselves and put a stop to their stuckup nonsense  perhaps if we had nothing better to do than talking or writing we could do it better than they anyhow theyre the failures and refuse of business hardly a man of them that didnt begin in an office and were the successes of it thank god i havnt failed yet at anything and i dont believe i should fail at literature if it would pay me to turn my hand to it  bentley  hear hear  mrs tarleton  fancy you writing a book johnny  do you think he could lord summerhays  lord summerhays  why not  as a matter of fact all the really prosperous authors i have met since my return to england have been very like him  tarleton  again impressed  thats an idea  thats a new idea  i believe i ought to have made johnny an author  ive never said so before for fear of hurting his feelings because after all the lad cant help it but ive never thought johnny worth tuppence as a man of business  johnny  sarcastic  oh  you think youve always kept that to yourself do you governor  i know your opinion of me as well as you know it yourself  it takes one man of business to appreciate another and you arnt and you never have been a real man of business  i know where tarletons would have been three of four times if it hadnt been for me  with a snort and a nod to emphasize the implied warning he retreats to the turkish bath and lolls against it with an air of goodhumoured indifference  tarleton  well who denies it  youre quite right my boy  i dont mind confessing to you all that the circumstances that condemned me to keep a shop are the biggest tragedy in modern life  i ought to have been a writer  im essentially a man of ideas  when i was a young man i sometimes used to pray that i might fail so that i should be justified in giving up business and doing something  something firstclass  but it was no good  i couldnt fail  i said to myself that if i could only once go to my chickabiddy here and shew her a chartered accountants statement proving that id made 20 pounds less than last year i could ask her to let me chance johnnys and hypatias future by going into literature  but it was no good  first it was 250 pounds more than last year  then it was 700 pounds  then it was 2000 pounds  then i saw it was no use  prometheus was chained to his rock  read shelley  read mrs browning  well well it was not to be  he rises solemnly  lord summerhays  i ask you to excuse me for a few moments  there are times when a man needs to meditate in solitude on his destiny  a chord is touched and he sees the drama of his life as a spectator sees a play  laugh if you feel inclined  no man sees the comic side of it more than i  in the theatre of life everyone may be amused except the actor brightening  theres an idea in this  an idea for a picture  what a pity young bentley is not a painter  tarleton meditating on his destiny  not in a toga  not in the trappings of the tragedian or the philosopher  in plain coat and trousers  a man like any other man and beneath that coat and trousers a human soul  tarletons underwear  he goes out gravely into the vestibule  mrs tarleton  fondly  i suppose its a wifes partiality lord summerhays but i do think john is really great  im sure he was meant to be a king  my father looked down on john because he was a rate collector and john kept a shop  it hurt his pride to have to borrow money so often from john and he used to console himself by saying after all hes only a linendraper  but at last one day he said to me john is a king  bentley  how much did he borrow on that occasion  lord summerhays  sharply  bentley  mrs tarleton  oh dont scold the child  hed have to say something like that if it was to be his last word on earth  besides hes quite right  my poor father had asked for his usual five pounds and john gave him a hundred in his big way  just like a king  lord summerhays  not at all  i had five kings to manage in jinghiskahn and i think you do your husband some injustice mrs tarleton  they pretended to like me because i kept their brothers from murdering them but i didnt like them  and i like tarleton  mrs tarleton  everybody does  i really must go and make the cook do him a welsh rabbit  he expects one on special occasions  she goes to the inner door  johnny  when he comes back ask him where were to put that new turkish bath  turkish baths are his latest  she goes out  johnny  coming forward again  now that the governor has given himself away and the old ladys gone ill tell you something lord summerhays  if you study men whove made an enormous pile in business without being keen on money youll find that they all have a slate off  the governors a wonderful man but hes not quite all there you know  if you notice hes different from me and whatever my failings may be im a sane man  erratic  thats what he is  and the danger is that some day hell give the whole show away  lord summerhays  giving the show away is a method like any other method  keeping it to yourself is only another method  i should keep an open mind about it  johnny  has it ever occurred to you that a man with an open mind must be a bit of a scoundrel  if you ask me i like a man who makes up his mind once for all as to whats right and whats wrong and then sticks to it  at all events you know where to have him  lord summerhays  that may not be his object  bentley  he may want to have you old chap  johnny  well let him  if a member of my club wants to steal my umbrella he knows where to find it  if a man put up for the club who had an open mind on the subject of property in umbrellas i should blackball him  an open mind is all very well in clever talkytalky but in conduct and in business give me solid ground  lord summerhays  yes  the quicksands make life difficult  still there they are  its no use pretending theyre rocks  johnny  i dont know  you can draw a line and make other chaps toe it  thats what i call morality  lord summerhays  very true  but you dont make any progress when youre toeing a line  hypatia  suddenly as if she could bear no more of it  bentley do go and play tennis with johnny  you must take exercise  lord summerhays  do my boy do  to johnny  take him out and make him skip about  bentley  rising reluctantly  i promised you two inches more round my chest this summer  i tried exercises with an indiarubber expander but i wasnt strong enough  instead of my expanding it it crumpled me up  come along johnny  johnny  do you no end of good young chap  he goes out with bentley through the pavilion  hypatia throws aside her work with an enormous sigh of relief  lord summerhays  at last  hypatia  at last  oh if i might only have a holiday in an asylum for the dumb  how i envy the animals  they cant talk  if johnny could only put back his ears or wag his tail instead of laying down the law how much better it would be  we should know when he was cross and when he was pleased and thats all we know now with all his talk  it never stops  talk talk talk talk  thats my life  all the day i listen to mamma talking at dinner i listen to papa talking and when papa stops for breath i listen to johnny talking  lord summerhays  you make me feel very guilty  i talk too im afraid  hypatia  oh i dont mind that because your talk is a novelty  but it must have been dreadful for your daughters  lord summerhays  i suppose so  hypatia  if parents would only realize how they bore their children three or four times in the last half hour ive been on the point of screaming  lord summerhays  were we very dull  hypatia  not at all  you were very clever  thats whats so hard to bear because it makes it so difficult to avoid listening  you see im young and i do so want something to happen  my mother tells me that when im her age i shall be only too glad that nothings happened but im not her age so what good is that to me  theres my father in the garden meditating on his destiny  all very well for him  hes had a destiny to meditate on but i havnt had any destiny yet  everythings happened to him  nothings happened to me  thats why this unending talk is so maddeningly uninteresting to me  lord summerhays  it would be worse if we sat in silence  hypatia  no it wouldnt  if you all sat in silence as if you were waiting for something to happen then there would be hope even if nothing did happen  but this eternal cackle cackle cackle about things in general is only fit for old old old people  i suppose it means something to them  theyve had their fling  all i listen for is some sign of it ending in something but just when it seems to be coming to a point johnny or papa just starts another hare and it all begins over again and i realize that its never going to lead anywhere and never going to stop  thats when i want to scream  i wonder how you can stand it  lord summerhays  well im old and garrulous myself you see besides im not here of my own free will exactly  i came because you ordered me to come  hypatia  didnt you want to come  lord summerhays  my dear  after thirty years of managing other peoples business men lose the habit of considering what they want or dont want  hypatia  oh dont begin to talk about what men do and about thirty years experience  if you cant get off that subject youd better send for johnny and papa and begin it all over again  lord summerhays  im sorry  i beg your pardon  hypatia  i asked you didnt you want to come  lord summerhays  i did not stop to consider whether i wanted or not because when i read your letter i knew i had to come  hypatia  why  lord summerhays  oh come miss tarleton  really really  dont force me to call you a blackmailer to your face  you have me in your power and i do what you tell me very obediently  dont ask me to pretend i do it of my own free will  hypatia  i dont know what a blackmailer is  i havnt even that much experience  lord summerhays  a blackmailer my dear young lady is a person who knows a disgraceful secret in the life of another person and extorts money from that other person by threatening to make his secret public unless the money is paid  hypatia  i havnt asked you for money  lord summerhays  no but you asked me to come down here and talk to you and you mentioned casually that if i didnt youd have nobody to talk about me to but bentley  that was a threat was it not  hypatia  well i wanted you to come  lord summerhays  in spite of my age and my unfortunate talkativeness  hypatia  i like talking to you  i can let myself go with you  i can say things to you i cant say to other people  lord summerhays  i wonder why  hypatia  well you are the only really clever grownup highclass experienced man i know who has given himself away to me by making an utter fool of himself with me  you cant wrap yourself up in your toga after that  you cant give yourself airs with me  lord summerhays  you mean you can tell bentley about me if i do  hypatia  even if there wasnt any bentley  even if you didnt care and i really dont see why you should care so much still we never could be on conventional terms with one another again  besides ive got a feeling for you  almost a ghastly sort of love for you  lord summerhays  shrinking  i beg youno please  hypatia  oh its nothing at all flattering  and of course nothing wrong as i suppose youd call it  lord summerhays  please believe that i know that  when men of my age  hypatia  impatiently  oh do talk about yourself when you mean yourself and not about men of your age  lord summerhays  ill put it as bluntly as i can  when as you say i made an utter fool of myself believe me i made a poetic fool of myself  i was seduced not by appetites which thank heaven ive long outlived  not even by the desire of second childhood for a child companion but by the innocent impulse to place the delicacy and wisdom and spirituality of my age at the affectionate service of your youth for a few years at the end of which you would be a grown strong formedwidow  alas my dear the delicacy of age reckoned as usual without the derision and cruelty of youth  you told me that you didnt want to be an old mans nurse and that you didnt want to have undersized children like bentley  it served me right  i dont reproach you  i was an old fool  but how you can imagine after that that i can suspect you of the smallest feeling for me except the inevitable feeling of early youth for late age or imagine that i have any feeling for you except one of shrinking humiliation i cant understand  hypatia  i dont blame you for falling in love with me  i shall be grateful to you all my life for it because that was the first time that anything really interesting happened to me  lord summerhays  do you mean to tell me that nothing of that kind had ever happened before that no man had ever  hypatia  oh lots  thats part of the routine of life here  the very dullest part of it  the young man who comes acourting is as familiar an incident in my life as coffee for breakfast  of course hes too much of a gentleman to misbehave himself and im too much of a lady to let him and hes shy and sheepish and im correct and selfpossessed and at last when i can bear it no longer i either frighten him off or give him a chance of proposing just to see how hell do it and refuse him because he does it in the same silly way as all the rest  you dont call that an event in ones life do you with you it was different  i should as soon have expected the north pole to fall in love with me as you  you know im only a linendrapers daughter when alls said  i was afraid of you  you a great man a lord and older than my father  and then what a situation it was  just think of it  i was engaged to your son and you knew nothing about it  he was afraid to tell you  he brought you down here because he thought if he could throw us together i could get round you because i was such a ripping girl  we arranged it all  he and i  we got papa and mamma and johnny out of the way splendidly and then bentley took himself off and left usyou and meto take a walk through the heather and admire the scenery of hindhead  you never dreamt that it was all a plan  that what made me so nice was the way i was playing up to my destiny as the sweet girl that was to make your boy happy  and then and then  she rises to dance and clap her hands in her glee  lord summerhays  shuddering  stop stop  can no woman understand a mans delicacy  hypatia  revelling in the recollection  and thenha hayou proposed  you  a father  for your sons girl  lord summerhays  stop i tell you  dont profane what you dont understand  hypatia  that was something happening at last with a vengeance  it was splendid  it was my first peep behind the scenes  if id been seventeen i should have fallen in love with you  even as it is i feel quite differently towards you from what i do towards other old men  so offering her hand you may kiss my hand if that will be any fun for you  lord summerhays  rising and recoiling to the table deeply revolted  no no no  how dare you  she laughs mischievously how callous youth is  how coarse  how cynical  how ruthlessly cruel  hypatia  stuff  its only that youre tired of a great many things ive never tried  lord summerhays  its not alone that  ive not forgotten the brutality of my own boyhood  but do try to learn glorious young beast that you are that age is squeamish sentimental fastidious if you cant understand my holier feelings at least you know the bodily infirmities of the old  you know that i darent eat all the rich things you gobble up at every meal that i cant bear the noise and racket and clatter that affect you no more than they affect a stone  well my soul is like that too  spare it  be gentle with it he involuntarily puts out his hands to plead  she takes them with a laugh  if you could possibly think of me as half an angel and half an invalid we should get on much better together  hypatia  we get on very well i think  nobody else ever called me a glorious young beast  i like that  glorious young beast expresses exactly what i like to be  lord summerhays  extricating his hands and sitting down  where on earth did you get these morbid tastes  you seem to have been well brought up in a normal healthy respectable middleclass family yet you go on like the most unwholesome product of the rankest bohemianism  hypatia  thats just it  im fed up with  lord summerhays  horrible expression  dont  hypatia  oh i daresay its vulgar but theres no other word for it im fed up with nice things  with respectability with propriety when a woman has nothing to do money and respectability mean that nothing is ever allowed to happen to her  i dont want to be good and i dont want to be bad  i just dont want to be bothered about either good or bad  i want to be an active verb  lord summerhays  an active verb  oh i see  an active verb signifies to be to do or to suffer  hypatia  just so  how clever of you  i want to be i want to do and im game to suffer if it costs that  but stick here doing nothing but being good and nice and ladylike i simply wont  stay down here with us for a week and ill shew you what it means  shew it to you going on day after day year after year lifetime after lifetime  lord summerhays  shew me what  hypatia  girls withering into ladies  ladies withering into old maids  nursing old women  running errands for old men  good for nothing else at last  oh you cant imagine the fiendish selfishness of the old people and the maudlin sacrifice of the young its more unbearable than any poverty  more horrible than any regularrightdown wickedness  oh home home parents family duty how i loathe them  how id like to see them all blown to bits  the poor escape  the wicked escape  well i cant be poor  were rolling in money  its no use pretending were not  but i can be wicked and im quite prepared to be  lord summerhays  you think that easy  hypatia  well isnt it  being a man you ought to know  lord summerhays  it requires some natural talent which can no doubt be cultivated  its not really easy to be anything out of the common  hypatia  anyhow i mean to make a fight for living  lord summerhays  living your own life i believe the suffragist phrase is  hypatia  living any life  living instead of withering without even a gardener to snip you off when youre rotten  lord summerhays  ive lived an active life but ive withered all the same  hypatia  no  youve worn out  thats quite different  and youve some life in you yet or you wouldnt have fallen in love with me  you can never imagine how delighted i was to find that instead of being the correct sort of big panjandrum you were supposed to be you were really an old rip like papa  lord summerhays  no no  not about your father  i really cant bear it  and if you must say these terrible things  these heartwounding shameful things at least find something prettier to call me than an old rip  hypatia  well what would you call a man proposing to a girl who might be  lord summerhays  his daughter  yes i know  hypatia  i was going to say his granddaughter  lord summerhays  you always have one more blow to get in  hypatia  youre too sensitive  did you ever make mud pies when you were a kidbeg pardon  a child  lord summerhays  i hope not  hypatia  its a dirty job but johnny and i were vulgar enough to like it  i like young people because theyre not too afraid of dirt to live  ive grown out of the mud pies but i like slang and i like bustling you up by saying things that shock you and id rather put up with swearing and smoking than with dull respectability and there are lots of things that would just shrivel you up that i think rather jolly  now  lord summerhays  ive not the slightest doubt of it  dont insist  hypatia  its not your ideal is it  lord summerhays  no  hypatia  shall i tell you why  your ideal is an old woman  i daresay shes got a young face but shes an old woman  old old old squeamish  cant stand up to things  cant enjoy things  not real things  always on the shrink  lord summerhays  on the shrink  detestable expression  hypatia  bah you cant stand even a little thing like that  what good are you  oh what good are you  lord summerhays  dont ask me  i dont know  i dont know  tarleton returns from the vestibule  hypatia sits down demurely  hypatia  well papa  have you meditated on your destiny  tarleton  puzzled  what  oh my destiny  gad i forgot all about it  jock started a rabbit and put it clean out of my head besides why should i give way to morbid introspection  its a sign of madness  read lombroso  to lord summerhays  well summerhays has my little girl been entertaining you  lord summerhays  yes  she is a wonderful entertainer  tarleton  i think my idea of bringing up a young girl has been rather a success  dont you listen to this patsy  it might make you conceited  shes never been treated like a child  i always said the same thing to her mother  let her read what she likes  let her do what she likes  let her go where she likes  eh patsy  hypatia  oh yes if there had only been anything for me to do any place for me to go anything i wanted to read  tarleton  there you see  shes not satisfied  restless  wants things to happen  wants adventures to drop out of the sky  hypatia  gathering up her work  if youre going to talk about me and my education im off  tarleton  well well off with you  to lord summerhays  shes active like me  she actually wanted me to put her into the shop  hypatia  well they tell me that the girls there have adventures sometimes  she goes out through the inner door  tarleton  she had me there though she doesnt know it poor innocent lamb  public scandal exaggerates enormously of course but moralize as you will superabundant vitality is a physical fact that cant be talked away  he sits down between the writing table and the sideboard  difficult question this of bringing up children between ourselves it has beaten me  i never was so surprised in my life as when i came to know johnny as a man of business and found out what he was really like  how did you manage with your sons  lord summerhays  well i really hadnt time to be a father  thats the plain truth of the matter  their poor dear mother did the usual thing while they were with us  then of course harrow cambridge the usual routine of their class  i saw very little of them and thought very little about them  how could i with a whole province on my hands they and i areacquaintances  not perhaps quite ordinary acquaintances  theres a sort oferi should almost call it a sort of remorse about the way we shake hands when we do shake hands which means i suppose that were sorry we dont care more for one another and im afraid we dont meet oftener than we can help  we put each other too much out of countenance  its really a very difficult relation  to my mind not altogether a natural one  tarleton  impressed as usual  thats an idea certainly  i dont think anybody has ever written about that  lord summerhays  bentley is the only one who was really my son in any serious sense  he was completely spoilt  when he was sent to a preparatory school he simply yelled until he was sent home  harrow was out of the question but we managed to tutor him into cambridge no use  he was sent down  by that time my work was over and i saw a good deal of him  but i could do nothing with himexcept look on  i should have thought your case was quite different  you keep up the middleclass tradition  the day school and the business training instead of the university  i believe in the day school part of it at all events you know your own children  tarleton  do you  im not so sure of it  fact is my dear summerhays once childhood is over once the little animal has got past the stage at which it acquires what you might call a sense of decency its all up with the relation between parent and child  you cant get over the fearful shyness of it  lord summerhays  shyness  tarleton  yes shyness  read dickens  lord summerhays surprised  dickens  of all authors charles dickens  are you serious  tarleton  i dont mean his books  read his letters to his family read any mans letters to his children  theyre not human  theyre not about himself or themselves  theyre about hotels scenery about the weather about getting wet and losing the train and what he saw on the road and all that  not a word about himself  forced  shy  duty letters  all fit to be published  that says everything  i tell you theres a wall ten feet thick and ten miles high between parent and child  i know what im talking about  ive girls in my employment girls and young men  i had ideas on the subject  i used to go to the parents and tell them not to let their children go out into the world without instruction in the dangers and temptations they were going to be thrown into  what did every one of the mothers say to me  oh sir how could i speak of such things to my own daughter  the men said i was quite right but they didnt do it any more than id been able to do it myself to johnny  i had to leave books in his way and i felt just awful when i did it  believe me summerhays the relation between the young and the old should be an innocent relation  it should be something they could talk about  well the relation between parent and child may be an affectionate relation  it may be a useful relation  it may be a necessary relation  but it can never be an innocent relation  youd die rather than allude to it  depend on it in a thousand years itll be considered bad form to know who your father and mother are  embarrassing  better hand bentley over to me i can look him in the face and talk to him as man to man  you can have johnny  lord summerhays  thank you  ive lived so long in a country where a man may have fifty sons who are no more to him than a regiment of soldiers that im afraid ive lost the english feeling about it  tarleton  restless again  you mean jinghiskahn  ah yes  good thing the empire  educates us  opens our minds  knocks the bible out of us  and civilizes the other chaps  lord summerhays  yes  it civilizes them  and it uncivilizes us their gain  our loss tarleton believe me our loss  tarleton  well why not  averages out the human race  makes the nigger half an englishman  makes the englishman half a nigger  lord summerhays  speaking as the unfortunate englishman in question i dont like the process  if i had my life to live over again id stay at home and supercivilize myself  tarleton  nonsense dont be selfish  think how youve improved the other chaps  look at the spanish empire  bad job for spain but splendid for south america  look at what the romans did for britain they burst up and had to clear out but think of all they taught us they were the making of us  i believe there was a roman camp on hindhead  ill shew it to you tomorrow  thats the good side of imperialism  its unselfish  i despise the little englanders theyre always thinking about england  smallminded  im for the parliament of man the federation of the world  read tennyson  he settles down again  then theres the great food question  lord summerhays  apprehensively  need we go into that this afternoon  tarleton  no but i wish youd tell the chickabiddy that the jinghiskahns eat no end of toasted cheese and that its the secret of their amazing health and long life  lord summerhays  unfortunately they are neither healthy nor long lived  and they dont eat toasted cheese  tarleton  there you are  they would be if they ate it    anyhow say what you like provided the moral is a welsh rabbit for my supper

lucky chap i can tell you  the aviator and tarleton come in through the pavilion followed by lord summerhays and bentley the aviator on tarletons right  bentley passes the aviator and turns to have an admiring look at him  lord summerhays overtakes tarleton less pointedly on the opposite side with the same object  the aviator  im really very sorry  im afraid ive knocked your vinery into a cocked

word to him and i cant answer for him socially but hes an ideal passenger for a flyer  he saved me from a smash  lord summerhays  i saw it  it was extraordinary  when you were thrown out he held on to the top bar with one hand  you came past him in the air going straight for the glass  he caught you and turned you off into the flower bed and then lighted beside you like a bird  percival  how he

effectually sir  percival  saved my life  i admit it most gratefully  tarleton  i must apologize madam for having offered you the civilities appropriate to the opposite sex  and yet why opposite we

lina  that was why i went up  hypatia  of course  cant you understand the fascination of the thing the novelty the daring the sense of something happening  lina  oh no  its too tame a business for that  i went up for family reasons  tarleton  eh  what  family reasons  mrs tarleton  i hope it wasnt to spite your mother  percival  quickly  or your husband  lina  im not married  and why should i want to spite my mother  hypatia  aside to percival  that was clever of you mr percival  percival  what  hypatia  to find out  tarleton  im in a difficulty  i cant understand a lady going up in an aeroplane for family reasons  its rude to be curious and ask questions but then its inhuman to be indifferent as if you didnt care  lina  ill tell you with pleasure  for the last hundred and fifty years not a single day has passed without some member of my family risking his lifeor her life  its a point of honor with us to keep up that tradition  usually several of us do it but it happens that just at this moment it is being kept up by one of my brothers only early this morning i got a telegram from him to say that there had been a fire and that he could do nothing for the rest of the week fortunately i had an invitation from the aerial league to see this gentleman try to break the passenger record  i appealed to the president of the league to let me save the honor of my family  he arranged it for me  tarleton  oh i must be dreaming  this is stark raving nonsense  lina  quietly  you are quite awake sir  johnny  we cant all be dreaming the same thing governor  tarleton  of course

princess  whats this family of warriors and statesmen that risk their lives every day  lord summerhays  they are evidently not warriors and statesmen or they wouldnt do that  tarleton  well then who the devil are they  lord summerhays  i think i know  the last time i saw that lady she did something i should not have thought possible  tarleton  what was that  lord summerhays  well she walked backwards along a taut wire without a balancing pole and turned a somersault in the middle  i remember that her name was lina and that the other name was foreign though i dont recollect it  tarleton  szcz  you couldnt have forgotten that if youd heard it  lord summerhays  i didnt hear it  i only saw it on a program  but its clear shes an acrobat  it explains how she saved percival  and it accounts for her family pride  tarleton  an acrobat eh  good good good  summerhays  that brings her within reach  thats better than a princess  i steeled this evergreen heart of mine when i thought she was a princess  now i shall let it be touched  she is accessible  good  lord summerhays  i hope you are not serious  remember  you have a family  you have a position  you are not in your first youth  tarleton  no matter       theres magic in the night      when the heart is young  my heart is young  besides im a married man not a widower like you  a married man can do anything he likes if his wife dont mind  a widower cant be too careful  not that i would have you think me an unprincipled man or a bad husband  im not  but ive a superabundance of vitality  read pepys diary  lord summerhays  the woman is your guest tarleton  tarleton  well is she  a woman i bring into my house is my guest a woman you bring into my house is my guest  but a woman who drops bang down out of the sky into my

family bible and the dore bible and the parallel revised version bible and the doves press bible and johnnys bible and bobbys bible and patsys bible and the chickabiddys bible and my bible and i daresay the servants could raise a few more between them  let her have the lot  mrs tarleton  dont talk like that before lord summerhays john  lord summerhays  it doesnt matter mrs tarleton  in jinghiskahn it was a punishable offence to expose a bible for sale  the empire has no religion  lina comes in  she has left her cap in hypatias room  she stops on the landing just inside the door and speaks over the handrail  lina  oh mrs tarleton shall i be making myself very troublesome if i ask for a musicstand in my room as well  tarleton  not at all you can have the piano if you like  or the

family we touch nothing but classical work  anybody can do lamps and hatstands i can do silver bullets  that is really hard  she passes on to lord summerhays and looks gravely down at him as he sits by the writing table  mrs tarleton  well im sure i dont know what youre talking about and i only hope you know yourselves  however you shall have what you want of course  she goes up the steps and leaves the room  lord summerhays  will you forgive my curiosity  what is the bible for  lina  to quiet my soul  lord summerhays with a sigh  ah yes yes  it no longer quiets mine i am sorry to say  lina  that is because you do not know how to read it  put it up before you on a stand and open it at the psalms  when you can read them and understand them quite quietly and happily and keep six balls in the air all the time you are in perfect condition and youll never make a mistake that evening  if you find you cant do that then go and pray until you can  and be very careful that evening  lord summerhays  is that the usual form of test in your profession  lina  nothing that we szczepanowskis do is usual my lord  lord summerhays  are you all so wonderful  lina  it is our profession to be wonderful  lord summerhays  do you never condescend to do as common people do for instance do you not pray as common people pray  lina  common people do not pray my lord  they only beg  lord

pavilion door and looks in  seeing that there is nobody he enters cautiously until he has come far enough to see into the hatstand corner  he draws a revolver and examines it apparently to make sure that it is loaded  then his attention is caught by the turkish bath  he looks down the lunette and opens the panels  hypatia  calling in the garden  mr percival  mr percival  where are you  the young man makes for the door but sees percival coming  he turns and bolts into the turkish bath which he closes upon himself just in time to escape being caught by percival who runs in through the pavilion bareheaded  he also it appears is in search of a hidingplace for he stops and turns between the two tables to take a survey of the room then runs into the corner between the end of the sideboard and the wall  hypatia excited mischievous her eyes glowing runs in precisely on his trail turns at the same spot and discovers him just as he makes a dash for the pavilion door  she flies back and intercepts him  hypatia  aha arnt you glad ive caught you  percival  illhumoredly turning away from her and coming towards the writing table  no im not  confound it what sort of girl are you what sort

tempting you to be free  percival  not at all  freedom my good girl means being able to count on how other people will behave  if every man who dislikes me is to throw a handful of mud in my face and

met in the road were to make love to you  no  give me the blessed protection of a good stiff conventionality among thoroughly wellbrought up ladies and gentlemen  hypatia  another talker  men like conventions because men made them i didnt make them  i dont like them  i wont keep them  now what will you do  percival  bolt  he runs out through the pavilion  hypatia  ill catch you  she dashes off in pursuit  during this conversation the head of the scandalized man in the turkish bath has repeatedly risen from the lunette with a strong expression of moral shock  it vanishes abruptly as the two turn towards it in their flight  at the same moment tarleton comes back through the vestibule door exhausted by severe and unaccustomed exercise  tarleton  looking after the flying figures with amazement  hallo patsy  whats up  another aeroplane  they are far too preoccupied to hear him and he is left staring after them as they rush away through the garden  he goes to the pavilion door and looks up but the heavens are empty  his exhaustion disables him from further inquiry  he dabs his brow with his handkerchief and walks stiffly to the nearest convenient support which happens to be the turkish bath he props himself upon it with his elbow and covers his eyes with his hand for a moment  after a few sighing breaths he feels a little better and uncovers his eyes  the mans head rises from the lunette a few inches from his nose  he recoils from the bath with a violent start  oh lord  my brains gone  calling piteously chickabiddy  he staggers down to the writing table  the man  coming out of the bath pistol in hand  another sound and youre a dead man  tarleton  braced  am i  well youre a live one  thats one comfort  i thought you were a ghost  he sits down quite undisturbed by the pistol  who are you and what the devil were you doing in my new turkish bath  the man  with tragic intensity  i am the son of lucinda titmus  tarleton  the name conveying nothing to him  indeed  and how is she  quite well i hope eh  the man  she is dead  dead my god and youre alive  tarleton  unimpressed by the tragedy but sympathetic  oh  lost your mother  thats sad  im sorry  but we cant all have the luck to survive our mothers and be nursed out of the world by the hands that nursed us into it  the man  much you care damn you  tarleton  oh dont cut up rough  face it like a man  you see i didnt know your mother but ive no doubt she was an excellent woman  the man  not know her  do you dare to stand there by her open grave and deny that you knew her  tarleton  trying to recollect  what did you say her name was  the man  lucinda titmus  tarleton  well i ought to remember a rum name like that if i ever heard it  but i dont  have you a photograph or anything  the man  forgotten even the name of your victim  tarleton  oh she was my victim was she  the man  she was  and you shall see her face again before you die dead as she is  i have a photograph  tarleton  good  the man  ive two photographs  tarleton  still better  treasure the mothers pictures  good boy  the man  one of them as you knew her  the other as she became when you flung her aside and she withered into an old woman  tarleton  shed have done that anyhow my lad  we all grow old look at me  seeing that the man is embarrassed by his pistol in fumbling for the photographs with his left hand in his breast pocket let me hold the gun for you  the man  retreating to the worktable  stand back  do you take me for a fool  tarleton  well youre a little upset naturally  it does you credit  the man  look here upon this picture and on this  he holds out the two photographs like a hand at cards and points to them with the pistol  tarleton  good  read shakespear  he has a word for every occasion he takes the photographs one in each hand and looks from one to the other pleased and interested but without any sign of recognition  what a pretty girl  very pretty  i can imagine myself falling in love with her when i was your age  i wasnt a badlooking young fellow myself in those days  looking at the other  curious that we should both have gone the same way  the man  you and she the same way  what do you mean  tarleton  both got stout i mean  the man  would you have had her deny herself food  tarleton  no  it wouldnt have been any use  its constitutional no matter how little you eat you put on flesh if youre made that way he resumes his study of the earlier photograph  the man  is that all the feeling that rises in you at the sight of the face you once knew so well  tarleton  too much absorbed in the portrait to heed him  funny that i cant remember  let this be a lesson to you young man  i could go into court tomorrow and swear i never saw that face before in my life if it wasnt for that brooch pointing to the photograph have you got that brooch by the way  the man again resorts to his breast pocket  you seem to carry the whole family property in that pocket  the man  producing a brooch  here it is to prove my bona fides  tarleton  pensively putting the photographs on the table and taking the brooch  i bought that brooch in cheapside from a man with a yellow wig and a cast in his left eye  ive never set eyes on him from that day to this  and yet i remember that man and i cant remember your mother  the man  monster  without conscience without even memory  you left her to her shame  tarleton  throwing the brooch on the table and rising pepperily come come young man none of that  respect the romance of your mothers youth  dont you start throwing stones at her  i dont recall her features just at this moment but ive no doubt she was kind to me and we were happy together  if you have a word to say against her take yourself out of my house and say it elsewhere  the man  what sort of a joker are you  are you trying to put me in the wrong when you have to answer to me for a crime that would make every honest man spit at you as you passed in the street if i were to make it known  tarleton  you read a good deal dont you  the man  what if i do  what has that to do with your infamy and my mothers doom  tarleton  there you see  doom  thats not good sense but its literature  now it happens that im a tremendous reader  always was when i was your age i read books of that sort by the bushel  the doom sort you know  its odd isnt it that you and i should be like one another in that respect  can you account for it in any way  the man  no  what are you driving at  tarleton  well do you know who your father was  the man  i see what you mean now  you dare set up to be my father thank heaven ive not a drop of your vile blood in my veins  tarleton  sitting down again with a shrug  well if you wont be civil theres no pleasure in talking to you is there  what do you want  money  the man  how dare you insult me  tarleton  well what do you want  the man  justice  tarleton  youre quite sure thats all  the man  its enough for me  tarleton  a modest sort of demand isnt it  nobody ever had it since the world began fortunately for themselves but you must have it must you  well youve come to the wrong shop for it  youll get no justice here  we dont keep it  human nature is what we stock  the man  human nature  debauchery gluttony selfishness robbery of the poor  is that what you call human nature  tarleton  no  thats what you call it  come my lad  whats the matter with you  you dont look starved and youve a decent suit of clothes  the man  fortytwo shillings  tarleton  they can do you a very decent suit for fortytwo shillings have you paid for it  the man  do you take me for a thief  and do you suppose i can get credit like you  tarleton  then you were able to lay your hand on fortytwo shillings judging from your conversational style i should think you must spend at least a shilling a week on romantic literature  the man  where would i get a shilling a week to spend on books when i can hardly keep myself decent  i get books at the free library  tarleton springing to his feet  what  the man  recoiling before his vehemence  the free library theres no harm in that  tarleton  ingrate  i supply you with free books and the use you make of them is to persuade yourself that its a fine thing to shoot me  he throws himself doggedly back into his chair  ill never give another penny to a free library  the man  youll never give another penny to anything  this is the end  for you and me  tarleton  pooh  come come man talk business  whats wrong  are you out of employment  the man  no  this is my saturday afternoon  dont flatter yourself that im a loafer or a criminal  im a cashier and i defy you to say that my cash has ever been a farthing wrong  ive a right to call you to account because my hands are clean  tarleton  well call away  what have i to account for  had you a hard time with your mother  why didnt she ask me for money  the man  shed have died first  besides who wanted your money  do you suppose we lived in the gutter  my father maynt have been in as large a way as you but he was better connected and his shop was as respectable as yours  tarleton  i suppose your mother brought him a little capital  the man  i dont know  whats that got to do with you  tarleton  well you say she and i knew one another and parted  she must have had something off me then you know  one doesnt get out of these things for nothing  hang it young man  do you suppose ive no heart  of course she had her due and she found a husband with it and set him up in business with it and brought you up respectably so what the devil have you to complain of  the man  are women to be ruined with impunity  tarleton  i havnt ruined any woman that im aware of  ive been the making of you and your mother  the man  oh im a fool to listen to you and argue with you  i came here to kill you and then kill myself  tarleton  begin with yourself if you dont mind  ive a good deal of business to do still before i die  havnt you  the man  no  thats just it  ive no business to do  do you know what my life is  i spend my days from nine to sixnine hours of daylight and fresh airin a stuffy little den counting another mans money  ive an intellect  a mind and a brain and a soul and the use he makes of them is to fix them on his tuppences and his eighteenpences and his two pound seventeen and tenpences and see how much they come to at the end of the day and take care that no one steals them  i enter and enter and add and add and take money and give change and fill cheques and stamp receipts and not a penny of that money is my own  not one of those transactions has the smallest interest for me or anyone else in the world but him and even he couldnt stand it if he had to do it all himself  and im envied aye envied for the variety and liveliness of my job by the poor devil of a bookkeeper that has to copy all my entries over again fifty thousand entries a year that poor wretch makes and not ten out of the fifty thousand ever has to be referred to again and when all the figures are counted up and the balance sheet made out the boss isnt a penny the richer than hed be if bookkeeping had never been invented  of all the damnable waste of human life that ever was invented clerking is the very worst  tarleton  why not join the territorials  the man  because i shouldnt be let  he hasnt even the sense to see that it would pay him to get some cheap soldiering out of me  how can a man tied to a desk from nine to six be anythingbe even a man let alone a soldier  but ill teach him and you a lesson  ive had enough of living a dogs life and despising myself for it  ive had enough of being talked down to by hogs like you and wearing my life out for a salary that wouldnt keep you in cigars  youll never believe that a clerks a man until one of us makes an example of one of you  tarleton  despotism tempered by assassination eh  the man  yes  thats what they do in russia  well a business office is russia as far as the clerks are concerned  so dont you take it so coolly  you think im not going to do it but i am  tarleton  rising and facing him  come now as man to man  its not my fault that youre poorer than i am and its not your fault that im richer than you  and if you could undo all that passed between me and your mother you wouldnt undo it and neither would she  but youre sick of your slavery and you want to be the hero of a romance and to get into the papers  eh  a son revenges his mothers shame villain weltering in his gore  mother  look down from heaven and receive your unhappy sons last sigh  the man  oh rot do you think i read novelettes  and do you suppose i believe such superstitions as heaven  i go to church because the boss told me id get the sack if i didnt  free england  ha  lina appears at the pavilion door and comes swiftly and noiselessly forward on seeing the man with a pistol in his hand  tarleton  youre afraid of getting the sack but youre not afraid to shoot yourself  the man  damn you youre trying to keep me talking until somebody comes  he raises the pistol desperately but not very resolutely  lina  at his right elbow  somebody has come  the man turning on her  stand off  ill shoot you if you lay a hand on me  i will by god  lina  you cant cover me with that pistol  try  he tries presenting the pistol at her face  she moves round him in the opposite direction to the hands of a clock with a light dancing step  he finds it impossible to cover her with the pistol  she is always too far to his left  tarleton behind him grips his wrist and drags his arm straight up so that the pistol points to the ceiling as he tries to turn on his assailant lina grips his other wrist  lina  please stop  i cant bear to twist anyones wrist but i must if you dont let the pistol go  the man  letting tarleton take it from him  all right  im done couldnt even do that job decently  thats a clerk all over  very well  send for your damned police and make an end of it  im accustomed to prison from nine to six  i daresay i can stand it from six to nine as well  tarleton  dont swear  thats a lady  he throws the pistol on the writing table  the man  looking at lina in amazement  beaten by a female  it needed only this  he collapses in the chair near the worktable and hides his face  they cannot help pitying him  lina  old pal  dont call the police  lend him a bicycle and let him get away  the man  i cant ride a bicycle  i never could afford one  im not even that much good  tarleton  if i gave you a hundred pound note now to go and have a good spree with i wonder would you know how to set about it  do you ever take a holiday  the man  take  i got four days last august  tarleton  what did you do  the man  i did a cheap trip to folkestone  i spent sevenpence on dropping pennies into silly automatic machines and peepshows of rowdy girls having a jolly time  i spent a penny on the lift and fourpence on refreshments  that cleaned me out  the rest of the time i was so miserable that i was glad to get back to the office  now you know  lina  come to the gymnasium  ill teach you how to make a man of yourself  the man is about to rise irresolutely from the mere habit of doing what he is told when tarleton stops him  tarleton  young man  dont  youve tried to shoot me but im not vindictive  i draw the line at putting a man on the rack  if you want every joint in your body stretched until its an agony to liveuntil you have an unnatural feeling that all your muscles are singing and laughing with painthen go to the gymnasium with that lady  but youll be more comfortable in jail  lina  greatly amused  was that why you went away old pal  was that the telegram you said you had forgotten to send  mrs tarleton comes in hastily through the inner door  mrs tarleton  on the steps  is anything the matter john  nurse says she heard you calling me a quarter of an hour ago and that your voice sounded as if you were ill  she comes between tarleton and the man  is anything the matter  tarleton  this is the son of an old friend of mine  mrermr gunner  to the man who rises awkwardly  my wife  mrs tarleton  good evening to you  gunner  er he is too nervous to speak and makes a shambling bow  bentley looks in at the pavilion door very peevish and too preoccupied with his own affairs to pay any attention to those of the company  bentley  i say  has anybody seen hypatia  she promised to come out with me and i cant find her anywhere  and wheres joey  gunner  suddenly breaking out aggressively being incapable of any middle way between submissiveness and violence  i can tell you where hypatia is  i can tell you where joey is  and i say its a scandal and an infamy  if people only knew what goes on in this socalled respectable house it would be put a stop to  these are the morals of our pious capitalist class  this is your rotten bourgeoisie  this  mrs tarleton  dont you dare use such language in company  i wont allow it  tarleton  all right chickabiddy  its not bad language  its only socialism  mrs tarleton  well i wont have any socialism in my house  tarleton  to gunner  you hear what mrs tarleton says  well in this house everybody does what she says or out they go  gunner  do you suppose i want to stay  do you think i would breathe this polluted atmosphere a moment longer than i could help  bentley  running forward between lina and

let themselves be cut in pieces with the knout or driven through the frozen snows of siberia sooner than stand looking on tamely at the world being made a hell for the toiling millions  if you were not all skunks and cowards youd be suffering with them instead of battening here on the plunder of the poor  mrs tarleton  much vexed  oh did you ever hear such silly nonsense  bunny  go and tell the gardener to send over one of his men to grayshott for the police  gunner  ill go with him  i intend to give myself up  im going to expose what ive seen here no matter what the consequences may be to

after all why shouldnt she do it  the russian students do it  women should be as free as men  im a fool  im so full of your bourgeois morality that i let myself be shocked by the application of my own revolutionary principles  if she likes the man why shouldnt she tell him so  mrs tarleton  i do wonder at you john letting him talk like this before everybody  turning rather tartly to lina  would you mind going away to the drawingroom just for a few minutes miss chipenoska  this is a private family matter if you dont mind  lina  i should have gone before mrs tarleton if there had been anyone to protect mr tarleton and the young gentleman  tarleton  youre quite right miss lina  you must stand by  i could have tackled him this morning but since you put me through those exercises id rather die than even shake hands with a man much less fight him  gunner  its all of a piece here  the men effeminate the women unsexed  tarleton  dont begin again old chap  keep it for trafalgar square  hypatias voice outside  no no  she breaks off in a stifled half laugh half scream and is seen darting across the garden with percival in hot pursuit  immediately afterwards she appears again and runs into the pavilion  finding it full of people including a stranger she stops but percival flushed and reckless rushes in and seizes her before he too realizes that they are not alone  he releases her in confusion  dead silence  they are all afraid to look at one another except mrs tarleton who stares sternly at hypatia  hypatia is the first to recover her presence of mind  hypatia  excuse me rushing in like this  mr percival has been chasing me down the hill  gunner  who chased him up it  dont be ashamed  be fearless  be truthful  tarleton  gunner  will you go to paris for a fortnight  ill pay your expenses  hypatia  what do you mean  gunner  there was a silent witness in the turkish bath  tarleton  i found him hiding there  whatever went on here he saw and heard  thats what he means  percival  sternly approaching gunner and speaking with deep but contained indignation  am i to understand you as daring to put forward the monstrous and blackguardly lie that this lady behaved improperly in my presence  gunner  turning white  you know what i saw and heard  hypatia with a gleam of triumph in her eyes slips noiselessly into the swing chair and watches percival and gunner swinging slightly but otherwise motionless  percival  i hope it is not necessary for me to assure you all that there is not one word of truthnot one grain of substancein this rascally calumny which no man with a spark of decent feeling would have uttered even if he had been ignorant enough to believe it  miss tarletons conduct since i have had the honor of knowing her has been i need hardly say in every respect beyond reproach  to gunner  as for you sir youll have the goodness to come out with me immediately  i have some business with you which cant be settled in mrs tarletons presence or in her house  gunner  painfully frightened  why should i go out with you  percival  because i intend that you shall  gunner  i wont be bullied by you  percival makes a threatening step towards him

him  let him go  percival  not until he has taken back and made the fullest apology for the abominable lie he has told  he shall do that or he shall defend himself as best he can against the most thorough thrashing im capable of giving him  releasing gunner but facing him ominously take your choice  which is it to be  gunner  give me a fair chance  go and stick at a desk from nine to six for a month and let me have your grub and your sport and your lessons in boxing and ill fight you fast enough  you know im no good or you darent bully me like this  percival  you should have thought of that

moment  turkish bathyes  tarleton  continuing  with a pistol with which i threatened to take the life of the said john tarleton  mrs tarleton  oh john  you might have been killed  tarleton  and was

just signed  gunner  i havnt yet  am i to sign now  percival  of course  gunner who is now incapable of doing anything on his own initiative signs  now stand up and read your declaration to this gentleman  gunner makes a vague movement and looks stupidly round  percival adds peremptorily  now please  gunner rising apprehensively and reading in a hardly audible voice like a very sick man  i john brown of 4 chesterfield parade kentish town do hereby voluntarily confess that on the 31st may 1909 i trespassed on the land of john tarleton at hindhead and effected an unlawful entry into his house where i secreted myself in a portable turkish bath with a pistol with which i threatened to take the life of the said john tarleton and was prevented from doing so only by the timely arrival of the celebrated miss lena shshsheepanossika  i further confess that i was guilty of uttering an abominable calumny concerning miss hypatia tarleton for which there was not a shred of foundation  i apologize most humbly to the lady and her family for my conduct and i promise mr tarleton not to repeat it and to amend my life and to do what in me lies to prove worthy of his kindness in giving me another chance and refraining from delivering me up to the punishment i so richly deserve  a short and painful silence follows  then percival speaks  percival  do you consider that sufficient lord summerhays  lord summerhays  oh quite quite  percival to hypatia  lord summerhays would probably like to hear you say that you are satisfied miss tarleton  hypatia  coming out of the swing and advancing between percival and lord summerhays  i must say that you have behaved like a perfect gentleman mr percival  percival  first bowing to hypatia and then turning with cold contempt to gunner who is standing helpless  we need not trouble you any further  gunner turns vaguely towards the pavilion  johnny with less refined offensiveness pointing to the pavilion thats your way  the gardener will shew you the shortest way into the road  go the shortest way  gunner  oppressed and disconcerted hardly knows how to get out of the room  yes sir  i he turns again appealing to tarleton maynt i have my mothers photographs back again  mrs tarleton pricks up her ears  tarleton  eh  what  oh the photographs  yes yes yes  take them  gunner takes them from the table and is creeping away when mrs tarleton puts out her hand and stops him  mrs tarleton  whats this john  what were you doing with his mothers photographs  tarleton  nothing nothing  never mind chickabiddy  its all right  mrs tarleton  snatching the photographs from gunners irresolute fingers and recognizing them at a glance  lucy titmus  oh john john  tarleton  grimly to gunner  young man  youre a fool but youve just put the lid on this job in a masterly manner  i knew you would i told you all to let well alone  you wouldnt and now you must take the consequencesor rather i must take them  mrs tarleton  to gunner  are you lucys son  gunner  yes  mrs tarleton  and why didnt you come to me  i didnt turn my back on your mother when she came to me in her trouble  didnt you know that  gunner  no  she never talked to me about anything  tarleton  how could she talk to her own son  shy summerhays shy parent and child  shy  he sits down at the end of the writing table nearest the sideboard like a man resigned to anything that fate may have in store for him  mrs tarleton  then how did you find out  gunner  from her papers after she died  mrs tarleton  shocked  is lucy dead  and i never knew  with an effusion of tenderness  and you here being treated like that poor orphan with nobody to take your part  tear up that foolish paper child and sit down and make friends with me  johnny            hallo mother this is all very well you know                 percival          but may i point out mrs tarleton that                 bentley           do you mean that after what he said of                 hypatia           oh look here mamma  this is really  mrs tarleton  will you please speak one at a time  silence  percival in a very gentlemanly manner  will you allow me to remind you mrs tarleton that this man has uttered a most serious and disgraceful falsehood concerning miss tarleton and myself  mrs tarleton  i dont believe a word of it  if the poor lad was there in the turkish bath who has a better right to say what was going on here than he has  you ought to be ashamed of yourself patsy and so ought you too mr percival for encouraging her  hypatia retreats to the pavilion and exchanges grimaces with johnny shamelessly enjoying percivals sudden reverse  they know their mother  percival  gasping  mrs tarleton  i give you my word of honor  mrs tarleton  oh go along with you and your word of honor  do you think im a fool  i wonder you can look the lad in the face after bullying him and making him sign those wicked lies and all the time you carrying on with my daughter before youd been half an hour in my house  fie for shame  percival  lord summerhays  i appeal to you  have i done the correct thing or not  lord summerhays  youve done your best mr percival  but the correct thing depends for its success on everybody playing the game very strictly  as a singlehanded game its impossible  bentley  suddenly breaking out lamentably  joey  have you taken hypatia away from me  lord summerhays  severely  bentley  bentley  control yourself sir  tarleton  come mr percival the shutters are up on the gentlemanly business  try the truth  percival  i am in a wretched position  if i tell the truth nobody will believe me  tarleton  oh yes they will  the truth makes everybody believe it  percival  it also makes everybody pretend not to believe it  mrs tarleton  youre not playing the game  mrs tarleton  i dont think youve behaved at all nicely mr percival  bentley  i wouldnt have played you such a dirty trick joey struggling with a sob  you beast  lord summerhays  bentley  you must control yourself  let me say at the same time mr percival that my son seems to have been mistaken in regarding you either as his friend or as a gentleman  percival  miss tarleton  im suffering this for your sake  i ask you just to say that i am not to blame  just that and nothing more  hypatia  gloating mischievously over his distress  you chased me through the heather and kissed me  you shouldnt have done that if you were not in earnest  percival  oh this is really the limit  turning desperately to gunner  sir  i appeal to you  as a gentleman as a man of honor as a man bound to stand by another man  you were in that turkish bath  you saw how it began  could any man have behaved more correctly than i did  is there a shadow of foundation for the accusations brought against me  gunner  sorely perplexed  well what do you want me to say  johnny  he has said what he had to say already hasnt he  read that paper  gunner  when i tell the truth you make me go back on it  and now you want me to go back on myself  what is a man to do  percival  patiently  please try to get your mind clear mr brown i pointed out to you that you could not as a gentleman disparage a ladys character  you agree with me i hope  gunner  yes  that sounds all right  percival  but youre also bound to tell the truth  surely youll not deny that  gunner  whos denying it  i say nothing against it  percival  of course not  well i ask you to tell the truth simply and unaffectedly  did you witness any improper conduct on my part when you were in the bath  gunner  no sir  johnny            then what do you mean by saying that                 hypatia           do you mean to say that i                 bentley           oh you are a rotter  youre afraid  tarleton  rising  stop  silence  leave it at that  enough said  you keep quiet johnny  mr percival  youre whitewashed  so are you patsy  honors are easy  lets drop the subject  the next thing to do is to open a subscription to start this young man on a ranch in some far country thats accustomed to be in a disturbed state he  mrs tarleton  now stop joking the poor lad john  i wont have it has been worried to death between you all  to gunner  have you had your tea  gunner  tea  no  its too early  im all right only i had no dinner  i didnt think id want it  i didnt think id be alive  mrs tarleton  oh what a thing to say  you mustnt talk like that  johnny  hes out of his mind  he thinks its past dinnertime  mrs tarleton  oh youve no sense johnny  he calls his lunch his dinner and has his tea at halfpast six  havnt you dear  gunner  timidly  hasnt everybody  johnny  laughing  well by george thats not bad  mrs tarleton  now dont be rude johnny  you know i dont like it to gunner  a cup of tea will pick you up  gunner  id rather not  im all right  tarleton  going to the sideboard  here try a mouthful of sloe gin  gunner  no thanks  im a teetotaler  i cant touch alcohol in any form  tarleton  nonsense  this isnt alcohol  sloe gin  vegetarian you know  gunner  hesitating  is it a fruit beverage  tarleton  of course it is  fruit beverage  here you are  he gives him a glass of sloe gin  gunner  going to the sideboard  thanks  he begins to drink it confidently but the first mouthful startles and almost chokes him its rather hot  tarleton  do you good  dont be afraid of it  mrs tarleton  going to him  sip it dear  dont be in a hurry  gunner sips slowly each sip making his eyes water  johnny  coming forward into the place left vacant by gunners visit to the sideboard  well now that the gentleman has been attended to i should like to know where we are  it may be a vulgar business habit but i confess i like to know where i am  tarleton  i dont  wherever you are youre there anyhow  i tell you again leave it at that  bentley  i want to know too  hypatias engaged to me  hypatia  bentley  if you insult me againif you say another word ill leave the house and not enter it until you leave it  johnny  put that in your pipe and smoke it my boy  bentley  inarticulate with fury and suppressed tears  oh beasts  brutes  mrs tarleton  now dont hurt his feelings poor little lamb  lord summerhays  very sternly  bentley  you are not behaving well  you had better leave us until you have recovered yourself  bentley goes out in disgrace but gets no further than half way to the pavilion door when with a wild sob he throws himself on the floor and begins to yell  mrs tarleton      running to him  oh poor child                    poor child  dont cry duckie                    he didnt mean it  dont cry                 lord summerhays    stop that infernal noise sir  do you                    hear  stop it instantly                 johnny            thats the game he tried on me                    there you are  now mother                    now patsy  you see for yourselves                 hypatia           covering her ears  oh you little                    wretch  stop him mr percival  kick him                 tarleton          steady on steady on  easy bunny easy  lina  leave him to me mrs tarleton  stand clear please  she kneels opposite bentley quickly lifts the upper half of him from the ground dives under him rises with his body hanging across her shoulders and runs out with him  bentley  in scared sobered humble tones as he is borne off what are you doing  let me down  please miss szczepanowska they pass out of hearing  an awestruck silence falls on the company as they speculate on bentleys fate  johnny  i wonder what shes going to do with him  hypatia  spank him i hope  spank him hard  lord summerhays  i hope so  i hope so  tarleton  im beyond measure humiliated and annoyed by my sons behavior in your house  i had better take him home  tarleton  not at all  not at all  now chickabiddy  as miss lina has taken away ben suppose you take away mr brown for a while  gunner  with unexpected aggressiveness  my name isnt brown they stare at him  he meets their stare defiantly pugnacious with sloe gin drains the last drop from his glass throws it on the sideboard and advances to the writing table   my names baker julius baker  mister baker  if any man doubts it im ready for him  mrs tarleton  john  you shouldnt have given him that sloe gin  its gone to his head  gunner  dont you think it  fruit beverages dont go to the head and what matter if they did  i say nothing to you maam  i regard you with respect and affection  lachrymosely  you were very good to my mother  my poor mother  relapsing into his daring mood  but i say my names baker and im not to be treated as a child or made a slave of by any man  baker is my name  did you think i was going to give you my real name  not likely  not me  tarleton  so you thought of john brown  that was clever of you  gunner  clever  yes  were not all such fools as you think  we clerks  it was the bookkeeper put me up to that  its the only name that nobody gives as a false name he said  clever eh  i should think so  mrs tarleton  come now julius  gunner  reassuring her gravely  dont you be alarmed maam  i know what is due to you as a lady and to myself as a gentleman  i regard you with respect and affection  if you had been my mother as you ought to have been i should have had more chance  but you shall have no cause to be ashamed of me  the strength of a chain is no greater than its weakest link but the greatness of a poet is the greatness of his greatest moment  shakespear used to get drunk frederick the great ran away from a battle  but it was what they could rise to not what they could sink to that made them great they werent good always but they were good on their day  well on my dayon my day mind youim good for something too  i know that ive made a silly exhibition of myself here  i know i didnt rise to the occasion  i know that if youd been my mother youd have been ashamed of me  i lost my presence of mind  i was a contemptible coward  but slapping himself on the chest  im not the man i was then  this is my day  ive seen the tenth possessor of a foolish face carried out kicking and screaming by a woman  to percival  you crowed pretty big over me  you hypnotized me  but when you were put through the fire yourself you were found wanting  i tell you straight i dont give a damn for you  mrs tarleton  no  thats naughty  you shouldnt say that before me  gunner  i would cut my tongue out sooner than say anything vulgar in your presence for i regard you with respect and affection  i was not swearing  i was affirming my manhood  mrs tarleton  what an idea  what puts all these things into your head  gunner  oh dont you think because im a clerk that im not one of the intellectuals  im a reading man a thinking man  i read in a booka high class six shilling bookthis precept  affirm your manhood  it appealed to me  ive always remembered it  i believe in it  i feel i must do it to recover your respect after my cowardly behavior  therefore i affirm it in your presence  i tell that man who insulted me that i dont give a damn for him  and neither i do  tarleton  i say summerhays  did you have chaps of this sort in jinghiskahn  lord summerhays  oh yes  they exist everywhere  they are a most serious modern problem  gunner  yes  youre right  conceitedly  im a problem  and i tell you that when we clerks realize that were problems well look out  thats all  lord summerhays  suavely to gunner  you read a great deal you say  gunner  ive read more than any man in this room if the truth were known i expect  thats whats going to smash up your capitalism  the problems are beginning to read  ha  were free to do that here in england  what would you do with me in jinghiskahn if you had me there  lord summerhays  well since you ask me so directly ill tell you i should take advantage of the fact that you have neither sense enough nor strength enough to know how to behave yourself in a difficulty of any sort  i should warn an intelligent and ambitious policeman that you are a troublesome person  the intelligent and ambitious policeman would take an early opportunity of upsetting your temper by ordering you to move on and treading on your heels until you were provoked into obstructing an officer in the discharge of his duty  any trifle of that sort would be sufficient to make a man like you lose your selfpossession and put yourself in the wrong  you would then be charged and imprisoned until things quieted down  gunner  and you call that justice  lord summerhays  no  justice was not my business  i had to govern a province and i took the necessary steps to maintain order in it  men are not governed by justice but by law or persuasion  when they refuse to be governed by law or persuasion they have to be governed by force or fraud or both  i used both when law and persuasion failed me  every ruler of men since the world began has done so even when he has hated both fraud and force as heartily as i do  it is as well that you should know this my young friend so that you may recognize in time that anarchism is a game at which the police can beat you  what have you to say to that  gunner  what have i to say to it  well i call it scandalous  thats what i have to say to it  lord summerhays  precisely  thats all anybody has to say to it except the british public which pretends not to believe it  and now let me ask you a sympathetic personal question  havnt you a headache  gunner  well since you ask me i have  ive overexcited myself  mrs tarleton  poor lad  no wonder after all youve gone through you want to eat a little and to lie down  you come with me  i want you to tell me about your poor dear mother and about yourself  come along with me  she leads the way to the inner door  gunner  following her obediently  thank you kindly madam  she goes out  before passing out after her he partly closes the door and stops an the landing for a moment to say  mind  im not knuckling down to any man here  i knuckle down to mrs tarleton because shes a woman in a thousand  i affirm my manhood all the same  understand i dont give a damn for the lot of you  he hurries out rather afraid of the consequences of this defiance which has provoked johnny to an impatient movement towards him  hypatia  thank goodness hes gone  oh what a bore  what a bore talk talk talk  tarleton  patsy  its no good  were going to talk  and were going to talk about you  johnny  its no use shirking it pat  wed better know where we are  lord summerhays  come miss tarleton  wont you sit down  im very tired of standing  hypatia comes from the pavilion and takes a chair at the worktable  lord summerhays takes the opposite chair on her right  percival takes the chair johnny placed for lina on her arrival  tarleton sits down at the end of the writing table  johnny remains standing  lord summerhays continues with a sigh of relief at being seated  we shall now get the change of subject we are all pining for  johnny  puzzled  whats that  lord summerhays  the great question  the question that men and women will spend hours over without complaining  the question that occupies all the novel readers and all the playgoers  the question they never get tired of  johnny  but what question  lord summerhays  the question which particular young man some young woman will mate with  percival  as if it mattered  hypatia  sharply  whats that you said  percival  i said  as if it mattered  hypatia  i call that ungentlemanly  percival  do you care about that you who are so magnificently unladylike  johnny  look here mr percival  youre not supposed to insult my sister  hypatia  oh shut up johnny  i can take care of myself  dont you interfere  johnny  oh very well  if you choose to give yourself away like thatto allow a man to call you unladylike and then to be unladylike ive nothing more to say  hypatia  i think mr percival is most ungentlemanly but i wont be protected  ill not have my affairs interfered with by men on pretence of protecting me  im not your baby  if i interfered between you and a woman you would soon tell me to mind my own business  tarleton  children  dont squabble  read dr watts  behave yourselves  johnny  ive nothing more to say and as i dont seem to be wanted here i shall take myself off  he goes out with affected calm through the pavilion  tarleton  summerhays  a family is an awful thing an impossible thing  cat and dog  patsy  im ashamed of you  hypatia  ill make it up with johnny afterwards but i really cant have him here sticking his clumsy hoof into my affairs  lord summerhays  the question is mr percival are you really a gentleman or are you not  percival  was napoleon really a gentleman or was he not  he made the lady get out of the way of the porter and said respect the burden madam  that was behaving like a very fine gentleman but he kicked volney for saying that what france wanted was the bourbons back again that was behaving rather like a navvy  now i like napoleon am not all one piece  on occasion as you have all seen i can behave like a gentleman  on occasion i can behave with a brutal simplicity which miss tarleton herself could hardly surpass  tarleton  gentleman or no gentleman patsy  what are your intentions  hypatia  my intentions  surely its the gentleman who should be asked his intentions  tarleton  come now patsy none of that nonsense  has mr percival said anything to you that i ought to know or that bentley ought to know  have you said anything to mr percival  hypatia  mr percival chased me through the heather and kissed me  lord summerhays  as a gentleman mr percival what do you say to that  percival  as a gentleman i do not kiss and tell  as a mere man  a mere cad if you like i say that i did so at miss tarletons own suggestion  hypatia  beast  percival  i dont deny that i enjoyed it  but i did not initiate it and i began by running away  tarleton  so patsy can run faster than you can she  percival  yes when she is in pursuit of me  she runs faster and faster  i run slower and slower  and these woods of yours are full of magic  there was a confounded fern owl  did you ever hear the churr of a fern owl  did you ever hear it create a sudden silence by ceasing  did you ever hear it call its mate by striking its wings together twice and whistling that single note that no nightingale can imitate  that is what happened in the woods when i was running away so i turned and the pursuer became the pursued  hypatia  i had to fight like a wild cat  lord summerhays  please dont tell us this  its not fit for old people to hear  tarleton  come  how did it end  hypatia  its not ended yet  tarleton  how is it going to end  hypatia  ask him  tarleton  how is it going to end mr percival  percival  i cant afford to marry mr tarleton  ive only a thousand a year until my father dies  two people cant possibly live on that  tarleton  oh cant they  when i married i should have been jolly glad to have felt sure of the quarter of it  percival  no doubt but i am not a cheap person mr tarleton  i was brought up in a household which cost at least seven or eight times that and i am in constant money difficulties because i simply dont know how to live on the thousand a year scale  as to ask a woman to share my degrading poverty its out of the question  besides im rather young to marry  im only 28  hypatia  papa  buy the brute for me  lord summerhays  shrinking  my dear miss tarleton  dont be so naughty  i know how delightful it is to shock an old man but there is a point at which it becomes barbarous  dont  please dont  hypatia  shall i tell papa about you  lord summerhays  tarleton  i had better tell you that i once asked your daughter to become my widow  tarleton  to hypatia  why didnt you accept him you young idiot  lord summerhays  i was too old  tarleton  all this has been going on under my nose i suppose  you run after young men and old men run after you  and im the last person in the world to hear of it  hypatia  how could i tell you  lord summerhays  parents and children tarleton  tarleton  oh the gulf that lies between them the impassable eternal gulf  and so im to buy the brute for you eh  hypatia  if you please papa  tarleton  whats the price mr percival  percival  we might do with another fifteen hundred if my father would contribute  but i should like more  tarleton  its purely a question of money with you is it  percival  after a moments consideration  practically yes  it turns on that  tarleton  i thought you might have some sort of preference for patsy you know  percival  well but does that matter do you think  patsy fascinates me no doubt  i apparently fascinate patsy  but believe me all that is not worth considering  one of my three fathers the priest has married hundreds of couples  couples selected by one another couples selected by the parents couples forced to marry one another by circumstances of one kind or another and he assures me that if marriages were made by putting all the mens names into one sack and the womens names into another and having them taken out by a blindfolded child like lottery numbers there would be just as high a percentage of happy marriages as we have here in england  he said cupid was nothing but the blindfolded child  pretty idea that i think  i shall have as good a chance with patsy as with anyone else mind  im not bigoted about it  im not a doctrinaire  not the slave of a theory  you and lord summerhays are experienced married men  if you can tell me of any trustworthy method of selecting a wife i shall be happy to make use of it  i await your suggestions he looks with polite attention to lord summerhays who having nothing to say avoids his eye  he looks to tarleton who purses his lips glumly and rattles his money in his pockets without a word apparently neither of you has anything to suggest  then patsy will do as well as another provided the money is forthcoming  hypatia  oh you beauty you beauty  tarleton  when i married patsys mother i was in love with her  percival  for the first time  tarleton  yes  for the first time  percival  for the last time  lord summerhays  revolted  sir  you are in the presence of his daughter  hypatia  oh dont mind me  i dont care  im accustomed to papas adventures  tarleton  blushing painfully  patsy my child  that was notnot delicate  hypatia  well papa youve never shewn any delicacy in talking to me about my conduct and i really dont see why i shouldnt talk to you about yours  its such nonsense  do you think young people dont know  lord summerhays  im sure they dont feel  tarleton  this is too horrible too brutal  if neither of these young people have anyanyany  percival  shall we say paternal sentimentality  im extremely sorry to shock you but you must remember that ive been educated to discuss human affairs with three fathers simultaneously  im an adult person patsy is an adult person  you do not inspire me with veneration apparently you do not inspire patsy with veneration  that may surprise you  it may pain you  im sorry  it cant be helped  what about the money  tarleton  you dont inspire me with generosity young man  hypatia  laughing with genuine amusement  he had you there joey  tarleton  i havnt been a bad father to you patsy  hypatia  i dont say you have dear  if only i could persuade you ive grown up we should get along perfectly  tarleton  do you remember bill burt  hypatia  why  tarleton  to the others  bill burt was a laborer here  i was going to sack him for kicking his father  he said his father had kicked him until he was big enough to kick back  patsy begged him off  i asked that man what it felt like the first time he kicked his father and found that it was just like kicking any other man  he laughed and said that it was the old man that knew what it felt like think of that summerhays think of that  hypatia  i havnt kicked you papa  tarleton  youve kicked me harder than bill burt ever kicked  lord summerhays  its no use tarleton  spare yourself  do you seriously expect these young people at their age to sympathize with what this gentleman calls your paternal sentimentality  tarleton  wistfully  is it nothing to you but paternal sentimentality patsy  hypatia  well i greatly prefer your superabundant vitality papa  tarleton  violently  hold your tongue you young devil  the young are all alike  hard coarse shallow cruel selfish dirtyminded  you can clear out of my house as soon as you can coax him to take you and the sooner the better  to percival  i think you said your price was fifteen hundred a year  take it  and i wish you joy of your bargain  percival  if you wish to know who i am  tarleton  i dont care a tinkers curse who you are or what you are youre willing to take that girl off my hands for fifteen hundred a year  thats all that concerns me  tell her who you are if you like its her affair not mine  hypatia  dont answer him joey  it wont last  lord summerhays im sorry about bentley but joeys the only man for me  lord summerhays  it may  hypatia  please dont say it may break your poor boys heart  its much more likely to break yours  lord summerhays  oh  tarleton  springing to his feet  leave the room  do you hear leave the room  percival  arnt we getting a little cross  dont be angry mr tarleton  read marcus aurelius  tarleton  dont you dare make fun of me  take your aeroplane out of my vinery and yourself out of my house  percival  rising to hypatia  im afraid i shall have to dine at the beacon patsy  hypatia  rising  do  i dine with you  tarleton  did you hear me tell you to leave the room  hypatia  i did  to percival  you see what living with ones parents means joey  it means living in a house where you can be ordered to leave the room  ive got to obey  its his house not mine  tarleton  who pays for it  go and support yourself as i did if you want to be independent  hypatia  i wanted to and you wouldnt let me  how can i support myself when im a prisoner  tarleton  hold your tongue  hypatia  keep your temper  percival  coming between them  lord summerhays  youll join me im sure in pointing out to both father and daughter that they have now reached that very common stage in family life at which anything but a blow would be an anticlimax  do you seriously want to beat patsy mr tarleton  tarleton  yes  i want to thrash the life out of her  if she doesnt get out of my reach ill do it  he sits down and grasps the writing table to restrain himself  hypatia  coolly going to him and leaning with her breast on his writhing shoulders  oh if you want to beat me just to relieve your feelingsjust really and truly for the fun of it and the satisfaction of it beat away  i dont grudge you that  tarleton  almost in hysterics  i used to think that this sort of thing went on in other families but that it never could happen in ours  and now he is broken with emotion and continues lamentably  i cant say the right thing  i cant do the right thing i dont know what is the right thing  im beaten and she knows it summerhays  tell me what to do  lord summerhays  when my council in jinghiskahn reached the point of coming to blows i used to adjourn the sitting  let us postpone the discussion  wait until monday  we shall have sunday to quiet down in  believe me im not making fun of you but i think theres something in this young gentlemans advice  read something  tarleton  ill read king lear  hypatia  dont  im very sorry dear  tarleton  youre not  youre laughing at me  serve me right  parents and children  no man should know his own child  no child should know its own father  let the family be rooted out of civilization  let the human race be brought up in institutions  hypatia  oh yes  how jolly  you and i might be friends then and joey could stay to dinner  tarleton  let him stay to dinner  let him stay to breakfast  let him spend his life here  dont you say i drove him out  dont you say i drove you out  percival  i really have no right to inflict myself on you  dropping in as i did  tarleton  out of the sky  ha  dropping in  the new sport of aviation  you just see a nice house drop in scoop up the mans daughter and off with you again  bentley comes back with his shoulders hanging as if he too had been exercised to the last pitch of fatigue  he is very sad  they stare at him as he gropes to percivals chair  bentley  im sorry for making a fool of myself  i beg your pardon hypatia  im awfully sorry but ive made up my mind that ill never marry  he sits down in deep depression  hypatia  running to him  how nice of you bentley  of course you guessed i wanted to marry joey  what did the polish lady do to you  bentley  turning his head away  id rather not speak of her if you dont mind  hypatia  youve fallen in love with her  she laughs  bentley  its beastly of you to laugh  lord summerhays  youre not the first to fall today under the lash of that young ladys terrible derision bentley  lina her cap on and her goggles in her hand comes impetuously through the inner door  lina  on the steps  mr percival  can we get that aeroplane started again  she comes down and runs to the pavilion door  i must get out of this into the air  right up into the blue  percival  impossible  the frames twisted  the petrol has given out  thats what brought us down  and how can we get a clear run to start with among these woods  lina  swooping back through the middle of the pavilion  we can straighten the frame  we can buy petrol at the beacon  with a few laborers we can get her out on to the portsmouth road and start her along that  tarleton  rising  but why do you want to leave us miss szcz  lina  old pal  this is a stuffy house  you seem to think of nothing but making love  all the conversation here is about lovemaking  all the pictures are about lovemaking  the eyes of all of you are sheeps eyes  you are steeped in it soaked in it  the very texts on the walls of your bedrooms are the ones about love  it is disgusting it is not healthy  your women are kept idle and dressed up for no other purpose than to be made love to  i have not been here an hour and already everybody makes love to me as if because i am a woman it were my profession to be made love to  first you old pal  i forgave you because you were nice about your wife  hypatia  oh oh oh  oh papa  lina  then you lord summerhays come to me and all you have to say is to ask me not to mention that you made love to me in vienna two years ago  i forgave you because i thought you were an ambassador and all ambassadors make love and are very nice and useful to people who travel  then this young gentleman  he is engaged to this young lady but no matter for that  he makes love to me because i carry him off in my arms when he cries  all these i bore in silence  but now comes your johnny and tells me im a ripping fine woman and asks me to marry him  i lina szczepanowska marry him  i do not mind this boy  he is a child  he loves me  i should have to give him money and take care of him  that would be foolish but honorable  i do not mind you old pal  you are what you call an oldouf but you do not offer to buy me  you say until we are tireduntil you are so happy that you dare not ask for more  that is foolish too at your age but it is an adventure  it is not dishonorable  i do not mind lord summerhays  it was in vienna  they had been toasting him at a great banquet  he was not sober  that is bad for the health but it is not dishonorable  but your johnny  oh your johnny with his marriage  he will do the straight thing by me  he will give me a home a position  he tells me i must know that my present position is not one for a nice woman  this to me lina szczepanowska  i am an honest woman  i earn my living  i am a free woman  i live in my own house  i am a woman of the world  i have thousands of friends every night crowds of people applaud me delight in me buy my picture pay hardearned money to see me  i am strong  i am skilful i am brave  i am independent  i am unbought  i am all that a woman ought to be and in my family there has not been a single drunkard for four generations  and this englishman this linendraper he dares to ask me to come and live with him in this rrrrrrrabbit hutch and take my bread from his hand and ask him for pocket money and wear soft clothes and be his woman his wife  sooner than that i would stoop to the lowest depths of my profession  i would stuff lions with food and pretend to tame them  i would deceive honest peoples eyes with conjuring tricks instead of real feats of strength and skill  i would be a clown and set bad examples of conduct to little children  i would sink yet lower and be an actress or an opera singer imperilling my soul by the wicked lie of pretending to be somebody else  all this i would do sooner than take my bread from the hand of a man and make him the master of my body and soul  and so you may tell your johnny to buy an englishwoman  he shall not buy lina szczepanowska and i will not stay in the house where such dishonor is offered me  adieu she turns precipitately to go but is faced in the pavilion doorway by johnny who comes in slowly his hands in his pockets meditating deeply  johnny  confidentially to lina  you wont mention our little conversation miss shepanoska  itll do no good and id rather you didnt  tarleton  weve just heard about it johnny  johnny  shortly but without illtemper  oh  is that so  hypatia  the cats out of the bag johnny about everybody  they were all beforehand with you  papa lord summerhays bentley and all dont you let them laugh at you  johnny  a grin slowly overspreading his countenance  well theres no use my pretending to be surprised at you governor is there  i hope you got it as hot as i did  mind miss shepanoska  it wasnt lost on me  im a thinking man  i kept my temper  youll admit that  lina  frankly  oh yes  i do not quarrel  you are what is called a chump but you are not a bad sort of chump  johnny  thank you  well if a chump may have an opinion i should put it at this  you make i suppose ten pounds a night off your own bat miss lina  lina  scornfully  ten pounds a night  i have made ten pounds a minute  johnny  with increased respect  have you indeed  i didnt know youll excuse my mistake i hope  but the principle is the same  now i trust you wont be offended at what im going to say but ive thought about this and watched it in daily experience and you may take it from me that the moment a woman becomes pecuniarily independent she gets hold of the wrong end of the stick in moral questions  lina  indeed  and what do you conclude from that mister johnny  johnny  well obviously that independence for women is wrong and shouldnt be allowed  for their own good you know  and for the good of morality in general  you agree with me lord summerhays dont you  lord summerhays  its a very moral moral if i may so express myself  mrs tarleton comes in softly through the inner door  mrs tarleton  dont make too much noise  the lads asleep  tarleton  chickabiddy  we have some news for you  johnny  apprehensively  now theres no need you know governor to worry mother with everything that passes  mrs tarleton  coming to tarleton  whats been going on  dont you hold anything back from me john  what have you been doing  tarleton  bentley isnt going to marry patsy  mrs tarleton  of course not  is that your great news  i never believed shed marry him  tarleton  theres something else  mr percival here  mrs tarleton  to percival  are you going to marry patsy  percival diplomatically  patsy is going to marry me with your permission  mrs tarleton  oh she has my permission  she ought to have been married long ago  hypatia  mother  tarleton  miss lina here though she has been so short a time with us has inspired a good deal of attachment ini may say in almost all of us  therefore i hope shell stay to dinner and not insist on flying away in that aeroplane  percival  you must stay miss szczepanowska  i cant go up again this evening  lina  ive seen you work it  do you think i require any help  and bentley shall come with me as a passenger  bentley  terrified  go up in an aeroplane  i darent  lina  you must learn to dare  bentley  pale but heroic  all right  ill come  lord summerhays    no no bentley impossible  i                    shall not allow it                 mrs tarleton      do you want to kill the child  he shant go  bentley  i will  ill lie down and yell until you let me go  im not a coward  i wont be a coward  lord summerhays  miss szczepanowska  my son is very dear to me  i implore you to wait until tomorrow morning  lina  there may be a storm tomorrow  and ill go  storm or no storm  i must risk my life tomorrow  bentley  i hope there will be a storm  lina  grasping his arm  you are trembling  bentley  yes  its terror sheer terror  i can hardly see  i can hardly stand  but ill go with you  lina  slapping him on the back and knocking a ghastly white smile into his face  you shall  i like you my boy  we go tomorrow together  bentley  yes  together  tomorrow  tarleton  well sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof  read the old book  mrs tarleton  is there anything else  tarleton  well ier he addresses lina and stops  ier he addresses lord summerhays and stops  ier he gives it up well i supposeeri suppose theres nothing more to be said  hypatia  fervently  thank goodness
