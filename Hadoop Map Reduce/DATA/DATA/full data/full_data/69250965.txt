the punctiliousness of don sebastian   i  xiormonez is the most inaccessible place in spain only one train arrives there in the course of the day and that arrives at two oclock in the morning only one train leaves it and that starts an hour before sunrise no one has ever been able to discover what happens to the railway officials during the intermediate oneandtwenty hours a german painter i met there who had come by the only train and had been endeavouring for a fortnight to get up in time to go away told me that he had frequently gone to the station in order to clear up the mystery but had never been able to do so yet from his inquiries he was inclined to suspectthat was as far as he would commit himself being a cautious manthat they spent the time in eating garlic and smoking execrable cigarettes the guidebooks tell you that xiormonez possesses the eyebrows of joseph of arimathea a cathedral of the greatest quaintness and battlements untouched since their erection in the fourteenth century and they strongly advise you to visit it but recommend you before doing so to add keatings insect powder to your other toilet necessaries  i was travelling to madrid in an express train which had been rushing along at the pace of sixteen miles an hour when suddenly it stopped i leant out of the window asking where we were  xiormonez answered the guard  i thought we did not stop at xiormonez  we do not stop at xiormonez he replied impassively  but we are stopping now  that may be but we are going on again  i had already learnt that it was folly to argue with a spanish guard and drawing back my head i sat down but looking at my watch i saw that it was only ten i should never again have a chance of inspecting the eyebrows of joseph of arimathea unless i chartered a special train so seizing the opportunity and my bag i jumped out  the only porter told me that everyone in xiormonez was asleep at that hour and recommended me to spend the night in the waitingroom but i bribed him heavily i offered him two pesetas which is nearly fifteenpence and leaving the train to its own devices he shouldered my bag and started off  along a stony road we walked into the dark night the wind blowing cold and bitter and the clouds chasing one another across the sky in front i could see nothing but the porter hurrying along bent down under the weight of my bag and the wind blew icily i buttoned up my coat and then i regretted the warmth of the carriage the comfort of my corner and my rug i wished i had peacefully continued my journey to madridi was on the verge of turning back as i heard the whistling of the train i hesitated but the porter hurried on and fearing to lose him in the night i sprang forwards then the puffing of the engine and on the smoke the bright reflection of the furnace and the train steamed away like abderrahman i felt that i had flung my scabbard into the flames  still the porter hurried on bent down under the weight of my bag and i saw no light in front of me to announce the approach to a town on each side bordering the road were trees and beyond them darkness and great black clouds hastened after one another across the heavens then as we walked along we came to a rough stone cross and lying on the steps before it was a woman with uplifted hands and the wind blew bitter and keen freezing the marrow of ones bones what prayers had she to offer that she must kneel there alone in the night we passed another cross standing up with its outstretched arms like a soul in pain at last a heavier night rose before me and presently i saw a great stone arch passing beneath it i found myself immediately in the town  the street was tortuous and narrow paved with rough cobbles and it rose steeply so that the porter bent lower beneath his burden panting with the bag on his shoulders he looked like some hunchbacked gnome a creature of nightmare on either side rose tall houses lying crooked and irregular leaning towards one another at the top so that one could not see the clouds and their windows were great black apertures like giant mouths there was not a light not a soul not a soundexcept that of my own feet and the heavy panting of the porter we wound through the streets round corners through low arches a long way up the steep cobbles and suddenly down broken steps they hurt my feet and i stumbled and almost fell but the hunchback walked along nimbly hurrying ever then we came into an open space and the wind caught us again and blew through our clothes so that i shrank up shivering and never a soul did we see as we walked on it might have been a city of the dead then past a tall church i saw a carved porch and from the side grim devils grinning down upon me the porter dived through an arch and i groped my way along a narrow passage at length he stopped and with a sigh threw down the bag he beat with his fists against an iron door making the metal ring a window above was thrown open and a voice cried out the porter answered there was a clattering down the stairs an unlocking and the door was timidly held open so that i saw a woman with the light of her candle throwing a strange yellow glare on her face  and so i arrived at the hotel of xiormonez   ii  my night was troubled by the ghostly crying of the watchman protect us mary queen of heaven protect us mary every hour it rang out stridently as soon as the heavy bells of the cathedral had ceased their clanging and i thought of the woman kneeling at the cross and wondered if her soul had found peace  in the morning i threw open the windows and the sun came dancing in flooding the room with gold in front of me the great wall of the cathedral stood grim and grey and the gargoyles looked savagely across the square the cathedral is admirable when you enter you find yourself at once in darkness and the air is heavy with incense but as your eyes become accustomed to the gloom you see the black forms of penitents kneeling by pillars looking towards an altar and by the light of the painted windows a reredos with the gaunt saints of an early painter and aureoles shining dimly  but the gem of the cathedral of xiormonez is the chapel of the duke de losas containing as it does the alabaster monument of don sebastian emanuel de mantona duque de losas and of the very illustrious señora doña sodina de berruguete his wife like everything else in spain the chapel is kept locked up and the guidebook tells you to apply to the porter at the palace of the present duke i sent a little boy to fetch that worthy who presently came back announcing that the porter and his wife had gone into the country for the day but that the duke was coming in person  and immediately i saw walking towards me a little dark man wrapped up in a big capa with the red and blue velvet of the lining flung gaudily over his shoulder he bowed courteously as he approached and i perceived that on the crown his hair was somewhat more than thin i hesitated a little rather awkwardly for the guidebook said that the porter exacted a fee of one peseta for opening the chapelone could scarcely offer sevenpencehalfpenny to a duke but he quickly put an end to all doubt for as he unlocked the door he turned to me and said  the fee is one franc  as i gave it him he put it in his pocket and gravely handed me a little printed receipt baedeker had obligingly informed me that the duchy of losas was shorn of its splendour but i had not understood that the present representative added to his income by exhibiting the bones of his ancestors at a franc a head  we entered and the duke pointed out the groining of the roof and the tracery of the windows  this chapel contains some of the finest gothic in spain he said  when he considered that i had sufficiently admired the architecture he turned to the pictures and with the fluency of a professional guide gave me their subjects and the names of the artists  now we come to the tombs of don sebastian the first duke of losas and his spouse doña sodinanot however the first duchess  the monument stood in the middle of the chapel covered with a great pall of red velvet so that no economical tourist should see it through the bars of the gate and thus save his peseta the duke removed the covering and watched me silently a slight smile trembling below his little black moustache  the duke and his wife who was not his duchess lay side by side on a bed of carved alabaster at the corners were four twisted pillars covered with little leaves and flowers and between them basreliefs representing love and youth and strength and pleasure as if even in the midst of death death must be forgotten don sebastian was in full armour his helmet was admirably carved with a representation of the battle between the centaurs and the lapithæ on the right armpiece were portrayed the adventures of venus and mars on the left the emotions of vulcan but on the breastplate was an elaborate crucifixion with soldiers and women and apostles the visor was raised and showed a stern heavy face with prominent cheek bones sensual lips and a massive chin  it is very fine i remarked thinking the duke expected some remark  people have thought so for three hundred years he replied gravely  he pointed out to me the hands of don sebastian  the guidebooks have said that they are the finest hands in spain tourists especially admire the tendons and veins which as you perceive stand out as in no human hand would be possible they say it is the summit of art  and he took me to the other side of the monument that i might look at doña sodina  they say she was the most beautiful woman of her day he said but in that case the castilian lady is the only thing in spain which has not degenerated  she was indeed not beautiful her face was fat and broad like her husbands a short ungraceful nose and a little nobbly chin a thick neck set dumpily on her marble shoulders one could not but hope that the artist had done her an injustice  the duke of losas made me observe the dog which was lying at her feet  it is a symbol of fidelity he said  the guidebook told me she was chaste and faithful  if she had been he replied smiling don sebastian would perhaps never have become duque de losas  really  it is an old history which i discovered one day among some family papers  i pricked up my ears and discreetly began to question him  are you interested in old manuscripts said the duke come with me and i will show you what i have  with a flourish of the hand he waved me out of the chapel and having carefully locked the doors accompanied me to his palace he took me into a gothic chamber furnished with worn french furniture the walls covered with cheap paper offering me a cigarette he opened a drawer and produced a faded manuscript  this is the document in question he said those crooked and fantastic characters are terrible i often wonder if the writers were able to read them  you are fortunate to be the possessor of such things i remarked  he shrugged his shoulders  what good are they i would sooner have fifty pesetas than this musty parchment  an offer i quickly reckoned it out into english money he would doubtless have taken less but i felt a certain delicacy in bargaining with a duke over his family secrets  do you mean it may ier  he sprang towards me  take it my dear sir take it shall i give you a receipt  and so for thirtyone shillings and threepence i obtained the only authentic account of how the frailty of the illustrious señora doña sodina was indirectly the means of raising her husband to the highest dignities in spain   iii  don sebastian and his wife had lived together for fifteen years with the entirest happiness to themselves and the greatest admiration of their neighbours people said that such an example of conjugal felicity was not often seen in those degenerate days for even then they prated of the golden age of their grandfathers lamenting their own decadence as behoved good castilians burdened with such a line of noble ancestors the fortunate couple conducted themselves with all imaginable gravity no strange eye was permitted to witness a caress between the lord and his lady or to hear an expression of endearment but everyone could see the devotion of don sebastian the look of adoration which filled his eyes when he gazed upon his wife and people said that doña sodina was worthy of all his affection they said that her virtue was only matched by her piety and her piety was patent to the whole world for every day she went to the cathedral at xiormonez and remained long immersed in her devotions her charity was exemplary and no beggar ever applied to her in vain  but even if don sebastian and his wife had not possessed these conjugal virtues they would have been in xiormonez persons of note since not only did they belong to an old and respected family which was rich as well but the gentlemans brother was archbishop of the see who when he graced the cathedral city with his presence paid the greatest attention to don sebastian and doña sodina everyone said that the archbishop pablo would shortly become a cardinal for he was a great favourite with the king and with the latter his holiness the pope was then on terms of quite unusual friendship  and in those days when the priesthood was more noticeable for its gallantry than for its good works it was refreshing to find so highplaced a dignitary of the church a pattern of christian virtues who notwithstanding his gorgeous habit of life his retinue his palaces recalled by his freedom from at least two of the seven deadly sins the simplicity of the apostles which the common people have often supposed the perfect state of the minister of god  don sebastian had been affianced to doña sodina when he was a boy of ten and before she could properly pronounce the viperish sibilants of her native tongue when the lady attained her sixteenth year the pair were solemnly espoused and the young priest pablo the bridegrooms brother assisted at the ceremony in these days the union would have been instanced as a triumphant example of the success of the mariage de convenance but at that time such arrangements were so usual that it never occurred to anyone to argue for or against them yet it was not customary for a young man of twoandtwenty to fall madly in love with the bride whom he saw for the first time a day or two before his marriage and it was still less customary for the bride to give back an equal affection for fifteen years the couple lived in harmony and contentment with nothing to trouble the even tenor of their lives and if there was a cloud in their sky it was that a kindly providence had vouchsafed no fruit to the union notwithstanding the prayers and candles which doña sodina was known to have offered at the shrine of more than one saint in spain who had made that kind of miracle particularly his own  but even felicitous marriages cannot last for ever since if the love does not die the lovers do and so it came to pass that doña sodina having eaten excessively of pickled shrimps which the abbess of a highly respected convent had assured her were of great efficacy in the begetting of children took a fever of the stomach as the chronicle inelegantly puts it and after a week of suffering was called to the other world from which as from the pickled shrimps she had always expected much there let us hope her virtues have been rewarded and she rests in peace and happiness   iv  when don sebastian walked from the cathedral to his house after the burial of his wife no one saw a trace of emotion on his face and it was with his wonted grave courtesy that he bowed to a friend as he passed him sternly and briefly as usual he gave orders that no one should disturb him and went to the room of doña sodina he knelt on the prayingstool which doña sodina had daily used for so many years and he fixed his eyes on the crucifix hanging on the wall above it the day passed and the night passed and don sebastian never movedno thought or emotion entered him being alive he was like the dead he was like the dead that linger on the outer limits of hell with never a hope for the future dull with the despair that shall last for ever and ever and ever but when the woman who had nursed him in his childhood lovingly disobeyed his order and entered to give him food she saw no tear in his eye no sign of weeping  you are right he said painfully rising from his knees give me to eat  listlessly taking the food he sank into a chair and looked at the bed on which had lately rested the corpse of doña sodina but a kindly nature relieved his unhappiness and he fell into a weary sleep  when he awoke the night was far advanced the house the town were filled with silence all round him was darkness and the ivory crucifix shone dimly dimly outside the door a page was sleeping he woke him and bade him bring light in his sorrow don sebastian began to look at the things his wife had loved he fingered her rosary and turned over the pages of the halfdozen pious books which formed her library he looked at the jewels which he had seen glittering on her bosom the brocades the rich silks the cloths of gold and silver that she had delighted to wear and at last he came across an old breviary which he thought she had losthow glad she would have been to find it she had so often regretted it the pages were musty with their long concealment and only faintly could be detected the scent which doña sodina used yearly to make and strew about her things turning over the pages listlessly he saw some crabbed writing he took it to the lighttonight my beloved i come and the handwriting was that of pablo archbishop of xiormonez don sebastian looked at it long why should his brother write such words in the breviary of doña sodina he turned the pages and the handwriting of his wife met his eye and the words were the sametonight my beloved i comeas if they were such delight to her that she must write them herself the breviary dropped from don sebastians hand  the taper flickering in the draught threw glaring lights on don sebastians face but it showed no change in it he sat looking at the fallen breviary and in his mind at the love which was dead at last he passed his hand over his forehead  and yet he whispered i loved thee well  but as the day came he picked up the breviary and locked it in a casket he knelt again at the prayingstool and lifting his hands to the crucifix prayed silently then he locked the door of doña sodinas room and it was a year before he entered it again  that day the archbishop pablo came to his brother to offer consolation for his loss and don sebastian at the parting kissed him on either cheek   v  the people of xiormonez said that don sebastian was heartbroken for from the date of his wifes interment he was not seen in the streets by day a few returning home from some riot had met him wandering in the dead of the night but he passed them silently by but he sent his servants to toledo and burgos to salamanca cordova even to paris and rome and from all these places they brought him booksand day after day he studied in them till the common folk asked if he had turned magician  so passed eleven months and nearly twelve till it wanted but five days to the anniversary of the death of doña sodina then don sebastian wrote to his brother the letter which for months he had turned over in his mind       seeing the instability of all human things and the uncertain      length of our exile upon earth i have considered that it is evil      for brothers to remain so separate therefore i implore youwho      are my only relative in this world and heir to all my goods and      estatesto visit me quickly for i have a presentiment that death      is not far off and i would see you before we are parted by the      immense sea  the archbishop was thinking that he must shortly pay a visit to his cathedral city and as his brother had desired came to xiormonez immediately on the anniversary of doña sodinas interment don sebastian entertained archbishop pablo to supper  my brother said he to his guest i have lately received from cordova a wine which i desire you to taste it is very highly prized in africa whence i am told it comes and it is made with curious art and labour  glass cups were brought and the wine poured in the archbishop was a connoisseur and held it between the light and himself admiring the sparkling clearness and then inhaled the odour  it is nectar he said  at last he sipped it  the flavour is very strange  he drank deeply don sebastian looked at him and smiled as his brother put down the empty glass but when he was himself about to drink the cup fell between his hands and the stewards breaking into a hundred fragments and the wine spilt on the floor  fool cried don sebastian and in his anger struck the servant  but being a man of peace the archbishop interposed  do not be angry with him it was an accident there is more wine in the flagon  no i will not drink it said don sebastian wrathfully i will drink no more tonight  the archbishop shrugged his shoulders  when they were alone don sebastian made a strange request  my brother it is a year today that sodina was buried and i have not entered her room since then but now i have a desire to see it will you come with me  the archbishop consented and together they crossed the long corridor that led to doña sodinas apartment preceded by a boy with lights  don sebastian unlocked the door and taking the taper from the pages hand entered the archbishop followed the air was chill and musty and even now an odour of recent death seemed to pervade the room  don sebastian went to a casket and from it took a breviary he saw his brother start as his eye fell on it he turned over the leaves till he came to a page on which was the archbishops handwriting and handed it to him  oh god exclaimed the priest and looked quickly at the door don sebastian was standing in front of it he opened his mouth to cry out but don sebastian interrupted him  do not be afraid i will not touch you  for a while they looked at one another silently one pale sweating with terror the other calm and grave as usual at last don sebastian spoke hoarsely  did shedid she love you  oh my brother forgive her it was long agoand she repented bitterly and ii  i have forgiven you  the words were said so strangely that the archbishop shuddered what did he mean  don sebastian smiled  you have no cause for anxiety from now it is finished i will forget and opening the door he helped his brother across the threshold the archbishops hand was clammy as a hand of death  when don sebastian bade his brother goodnight he kissed him on either cheek   vi  the priest returned to his palace and when he was in bed his secretary prepared to read to him as was his wont but the archbishop sent him away desiring to be alone he tried to think but the wine he had drunk was heavy upon him and he fell asleep but presently he awoke feeling thirsty he drank some water then he became strangely wideawake a feeling of uneasiness came over him as of some threatening presence behind him and again he felt the thirst he stretched out his hand for the flagon but now there was a mist before his eyes and he could not see his hand trembled so that he spilled the water and the uneasiness was magnified till it became a terror and the thirst was horrible he opened his mouth to call out but his throat was dry so that no sound came he tried to rise from his bed but his limbs were heavy and he could not move he breathed quicker and quicker and his skin was extraordinarily dry the terror became an agony it was unbearable he wanted to bury his face in the pillows to hide it from him he felt the hair on his head hard and dry and it stood on end he called to god for help but no sound came from his mouth then the terror took shape and form and he knew that behind him was standing doña sodina and she was looking at him with terrible reproachful eyes and a second doña sodina came and stood at the end of the bed and another came by her side and the room was filled with them and his thirst was horrible he tried to moisten his mouth with spittle but the source of it was dry cramps seized his limbs so that he writhed with pain presently a red glow fell upon the room and it became hot and hotter till he gasped for breath it blinded him but he could not close his eyes and he knew it was the glow of hellfire for in his ears rang the groans of souls in torment and among the voices he recognised that of doña sodina and thenthen he heard his own voice and in the livid heat he saw himself in his episcopal robes lying on the ground chained to doña sodina hand and foot and he knew that as long as heaven and earth should last the torment of hell would continue  when the priests came in to their master in the morning they found him lying dead with his eyes wide open staring with a ghastly brilliancy into the unknown then there was weeping and lamentation and from house to house the people told one another that the archbishop had died in his sleep the bells were set tolling and as don sebastian in his solitude heard them referring to the chief ingredient of that strange wine from cordova he permitted himself the only jest of his life  it was belladonna that sent his body to the worms and it was belladonna that sent his soul to hell   vii  the chronicle does not state whether the thought of his brothers heritage had ever entered don sebastians head but the fact remains that he was sole heir and the archbishop had gathered the loaves and fishes to such purpose during his life that his death made don sebastian one of the wealthiest men in spain the simplest actions in this world oh martin tupper have often the most unforeseen results  now don sebastian had always been ambitious and his changed circumstances made him realise more clearly than ever that his merit was worthy of a brilliant arena the times were propitious for the old king had just died and the new one had sent away the army of priests and monks which had turned every day into a sunday people said that god almighty had had his day and that the heathen deities had come to rule in his stead from all corners of spain gallants were coming to enjoy the sunshine and everyone who could make a compliment or a graceful bow was sure of a welcome  so don sebastian prepared to go to madrid but before leaving his native town he thought well to appease a possibly vengeful providence by erecting in the cathedral a chapel in honour of his patron saint not that he thought the saints would trouble themselves about the death of his brother even though the causes of it were not entirely natural but don sebastian remembered that pablo was an archbishop and the fact caused him a certain anxiety he called together architects and sculptors and ordered them to erect an edifice befitting his dignity and being a careful man as all spaniards are thought he would serve himself as well as the saint and bade the sculptors make an image of doña sodina and an image of himself in order that he might use the chapel also as a burialplace  to pay for this don sebastian left the revenue of several of his brothers farms and then with a peaceful conscience set out for the capital  at madrid he laid himself out to gain the favour of his sovereign and by dint of unceasing flattery soon received much of the kings attention and presently philip deigned to ask his advice on petty matters and since don sebastian took care to advise as he saw the king desired the latter concluded that the courtier was a man of stamina and ability and began to consult him on matters of state don sebastian opined that the pleasure of the prince must always come before the welfare of the nation and the king was so impressed with his sagacity that one day he asked his opinion on a question of precedenceto the indignation of the most famous councillors in the land  but the haughty soul of don sebastian chafed because he was only one among many favourites the court was full of flatterers as assiduous and as obsequious as himself his proud castilian blood could brook no companions but one day as he was moodily waiting in the royal antechamber thinking of these things it occurred to him that a certain profession had always been in great honour among princes and he remembered that he had a cousin of eighteen who was being educated in a convent near xiormonez she was beautiful with buoyant heart he went to his house and told his steward to fetch her from the convent at once within a fortnight she was at madrid mercia was presented to the queen in the presence of philip and don sebastian noticed that the royal eye lighted up as he gazed on the bashful maiden then all the proud castilian had to do was to shut his eyes and allow the king to make his own opportunities within a week mercia was created maid of honour to the queen and don sebastian was seized with an indisposition which confined him to his room  the king paid his court royally which is boldly and doña mercia had received in the convent too religious an education not to know that it was her duty to grant the king whatever it graciously pleased him to ask  when don sebastian recovered from his illness he found the world at his feet for everyone was talking of the kings new mistress and it was taken as a matter of course that her cousin and guardian should take a prominent part in the affairs of the country but don sebastian was furious he went to the king and bitterly reproached him for thus dishonouring him philip was a humane and generousminded man and understood that with a certain temperament it might be annoying to have ones ward philander with a king so he did his best to console the courtier he called him his friend and brother he told him he would always love him but don sebastian would not be consoled and nothing would comfort him except to be made high admiral of the fleet philip was charmed to settle the matter so simply and as he delighted in generosity when to be generous cost him nothing he also created don sebastian duke of losas and gave him into the bargain the hand of the richest heiress in spain  and that is the end of the story of the punctiliousness of don sebastian with his second wife he lived many years beloved of his sovereign courted by the world honoured by all till he was visited by the destroyer of delights and the leveller of the grandeur of this world   viii  towards evening the duke of losas passed my hotel and seeing me at the door asked if i had read the manuscript  i thought it interesting i said a little coldly for of course i knew no englishman would have acted like don sebastian  he shrugged his shoulders  it is not half so interesting as a good dinner  at these words i felt bound to offer him such hospitality as the hotel afforded i found him a very agreeable messmate he told me the further history of his family which nearly became extinct at the end of the last century since the only son of the seventh duke had unfortunately not been born of any duchess but ferdinand who was then king of spain was unwilling that an ancient family should die out and was at the same time sorely in want of money so the titles and honours of the house were continued to the son of the seventh duke and king ferdinand built himself another palace  but now said my guest mournfully shaking his head it is finished my palace and a few acres of barren rock are all that remain to me of the lands of my ancestors and i am the last of the line  but i bade him not despair he was a bachelor and a duke and not yet forty i advised him to go to the united states before they put a duty on foreign noblemen this was before the war and i recommended him to take maida vale and manchester on his way personally i gave him a letter of introduction to an heiress of my acquaintance at hampstead for even in these days it is not so bad a thing to be duchess of losas and the present duke has no brother     a bad example   i  james clinton was a clerk in the important firm of haynes bryan  co and he held in it an important position he was the very essence of respectability and he earned one hundred and fiftysix pounds per annum james clinton believed in the church of england and the conservative party in the greatness of great britain in the need of more ships for the navy and in the superiority of city men to other members of the commonweal  its the man of business that makes the world go round he was in the habit of saying dyou think sir that fifty thousand country squires could rule great britain no its the city man the man whos ad a sound business training thats made england what it is and that is why i old the conservative party most capable of governing this mighty empire because it as taken the business man to its eart the strength of the conservative party lies in its brewers and its city men its bankers and ironfounders and stockbrokers and as long as the liberal party is a nest of socialists and tradesunionists and anarchists we city men cannot and will not give it our support  except for the lamentable conclusion of his career he would undoubtedly have become an imperialist and the union of the great anglosaxon races would have found in him the sturdiest of supporters  mr clinton was a little spindlyshanked man with weak myopic eyes protruding fishlike behind his spectacles his hair was scant worn long to conceal the baldness of the crownand cæsar was pleased to wear a wreath of laurel for the same purpose mr clinton wore small sidewhiskers but was otherwise cleanshaven and the lack of beard betrayed the weakness of his mouth his teeth were decayed and yellow he was always dressed in a black tailcoat shiny at the elbows and he wore a shabby narrow black tie with a false diamond stud in his dickey his grey trousers were baggy at the knees and frayed at the edges his boots had a masculine and english breadth of toe his top hat of antiquated shape was kept carefully brushed but always looked as if it were suffering from a recent shower when he had deserted the frivolous byways in which bachelordom is wont to disport itself for the sober path of the married man he had begun to carry to and from the city a small black bag to impress upon the world at large his eminent respectability mr clinton was married to amy second daughter of john rayner esquire of peckham rye   ii  every morning mr clinton left his house in camberwell in time to catch the eightfiftyfive train for the city he made his way up ludgate hill walking sideways with a projection of the left part of his body a habit he had acquired from constantly slipping past and between people who walked less rapidly than himself such persons always annoyed him if they were not in a hurry he was and they had no right to obstruct the way and it was improper for a city man to loiter in the morningthe luncheonhour was the time for loitering no one was then in haste but in the morning and at night on the way back to the station one ought to walk at the same pace as everybody else if mr clinton had been head of a firm he would never have had in his office a man who sauntered in the morning if a man wanted to loiter let him go to the westend there he could lounge about all day but the city was meant for business and there wasnt time for westend airs in the city  mr clinton reached his office at a quarter to ten except when the train by some mistake arrived up to time when he arrived at ninethirty precisely on these occasions he would sit in his room with the door open awaiting the coming of the officeboy who used to arrive two minutes before mr clinton and was naturally much annoyed when the punctuality of the train prepared him a reprimand  is that you dick called mr clinton when he heard a footstep  yes sir answered the boy appearing  mr clinton looked up from his nails which he was paring with a pair of pocket scissors  what is the meaning of this you dont call this alfpast nine do you  very sorry said the boy it wasnt my fault sir train was late  its not the first time ive ad to speak to you about this dick you know quite well that the company is always unpunctual you should come by an earlier train  the officeboy looked sulky and did not answer mr clinton proceeded i ad to open the office myself as assistantmanager you know quite well that it is not my duty to open the office you receive sixteen shillings a week to be ere at alfpast nine and if you dont feel yourself capable of performing the duties for which you was engaged you should give notice dont let it occur again  but usually on arriving mr clinton took off his tailcoat and put on a jacket manufactured from the office paper a pair of false cuffs to keep his own clean and having examined the nibs in both his penholders and sharpened his pencil set to work from then till one oclock he remained at his desk solemnly poring over figures casting accounts comparing balancesheets writing letters occasionally going for some purpose or another into the clerks office or into the room of one of the partners at one he went to luncheon taking with him the portion of his daily telegraph which he was in the habit of reading during that meal he went to an a b c shop and ordered a roll and butter a cup of chocolate and a scone he divided his pat of butter into two one half being for the roll and the other for the scone he drank one moiety of the cup of chocolate after eating the roll and the other after eating the scone meanwhile he read pages three and four of the daily telegraph at a quarter to two he folded the paper put down sixpence in payment and slowly walked back to the office he returned to his desk and there spent the afternoon solemnly poring over figures casting accounts comparing balancesheets writing letters occasionally going for some purpose or another into the clerks office or into the room of one of the partners at ten minutes to six he wiped his pens and put them back in the tray tidied his desk and locked his drawer he took off his paper cuffs washed his hands wiped his face brushed his hair arranging the long whisps over the occipital baldness and combed his whiskers at six he left the office caught the sixseventeen train from ludgate hill and thus made his way back to camberwell and the bosom of his family   iii  on sunday mr clinton put on sunday clothes and heading the little procession formed by mrs clinton and the two children went to church carrying in his hand a prayer book and a hymn book after dinner he took a little walk with his wife along the neighbouring roads avenues and crescents examining the exterior of the houses stopping now and then to look at a garden or a wellkept house or trying to get a peep into some room mr and mrs clinton criticised as they went along comparing the window curtains blaming a door in want of paint praising a wellwhitened doorstep  the clintons lived in the fifth house down in the adonis road and the house was distinguishable from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which mrs clinton had furnished all the windows mrs clinton was a woman of taste before marriage the happy pair accompanied by mrs clintons mother had gone househunting and fixed on the adonis road which was cheap respectable and near the station mrs clinton would dearly have liked a house on the righthand side of the road which had nooks and angles and curiouslyshaped windows but mr clinton was firm in his refusal and his motherinlaw backed him up  i dare say theyre artistic he said in answer to his wifes argument but a man in my position dont want arthe wants substantiality if the governorthe governor was the senior partner of the firmif the governor was going to take a ouse id ave nothing to say against it but in my position arts not necessary  quite right james said his motherinlaw i old with what you say entirely  even in his early youth mr clinton had a fine sense of the responsibility of life and a truly english feeling for the fitness of things  so the clintons took one of the twentythree similar houses on the lefthand side of the street and there lived in peaceful happiness but mr clinton always pointed the finger of scorn at the houses opposite and he never rubbed the back of his hands so heartily as when he could point out to his wife that suchandsuch a number was having its roof repaired and when the builder went bankrupt he cut out the notice in the paper and sent it to his spouse anonymously  at the beginning of august mr clinton was accustomed with his wife and family to desert the sultry populousness of london for the solitude and sea air of ramsgate he read the daily telegraph by the sad sea waves and made castles in the sand with his children then he changed his pepperandsalt trousers for white flannel but nothing on earth would induce him to forsake his top hat he entirely agreed with the heroes of englands proudest epochof course i mean the middle victorianthat the top hat was the signmanual the mark the distinction of the true englishman the completest expression of englands greatness mr clinton despised all foreigners and although he would never have ventured to think of himself in the same breath with an english lord he felt himself the superior of any foreign nobleman  i dare say theyre all right in their way but with these foreigners you dont feel theyre gentlemen i dont know what it is but theres something you understand dont you and i do like a man to be a gentleman i thank god im an englishman   iv  now it chanced one day that the senior partner of the firm was summoned to serve on a jury at a coroners inquest and mr clinton furnished with the excuse that mr haynes was out of town was told to go in his stead mr clinton had never performed that part of a citizens duties for on becoming a householder he had hit upon the expedient of being summoned for his rates so that his name should be struck off the coroners list he was very indifferent to the implied dishonour it was with some curiosity therefore that he repaired to the court on the morning of the inquest  the weather was cold and grey and a drizzling rain was falling mr clinton did not take a bus since by walking he could put in his pocket the threepence which he meant to charge the firm for his fare the streets were wet and muddy and people walked close against the houses to avoid the splash of passing vehicles mr clinton thought of the jocose solicitor who was in the habit of taking an articled clerk with him on muddy days to walk on the outside of the street and protect his master from the flying mud the story particularly appealed to mr clinton that solicitor must have been a fine man of business as he walked leisurely along under his umbrella mr clinton looked without envy upon the city men who drove along in hansoms  some of us he said are born great others achieve greatness a man like thathe pointed with his minds finger at a passing aldermana man like that can go about in is carriage and nobody can say anything against it es worked imself up from the bottom  but when he came down parliament street to westminster abbey he felt a different atmosphere and he was roused to jeremiac indignation at the sight in a passing cab of a gilded youth in an opera hat with his coat buttoned up to hide his dress clothes  thats the sort of young feller i cant abide said mr clinton and if i was a member of parliament id stop it thats what comes of aving too much money and nothing to do if i was a member of the aristocracy id give my sons five years in an accountants office theres nothing like a sound business training for making a man he paused in the road and waved his disengaged hand now what should i be if i adnt ad a sound business training  mr clinton arrived at the mortuary a gay red and white building which had been newly erected and consecrated by a duke with much festivity and rejoicing mr clinton was sworn with the other jurymen and with them repaired to see the bodies on which they were to sit but mr clinton was squeamish  i dont like corpses he said i object to them on principle  he was told he must look at them  very well said mr clinton you can take a orse to the well but you cant make im drink when it came to his turn to look through the pane of glass behind which was the body he shut his eyes  i cant say im extra gone on corpses he said as they walked back to the court the smell of them aint what you might call eaudecologne the other jurymen laughed mr clinton often said witty things like that  well gentlemen said the coroner rubbing his hands weve only got three cases this morning so i shant have to keep you long and they all seem to be quite simple   v  the first was an old man of seventy he had been a respectable hardworking man till two years before when a paralytic stroke had rendered one side of him completely powerless he lost his work he was alone in the worldhis wife was dead and his only daughter had not been heard of for thirty yearsand gradually he had spent his little savings one by one he sent his belongings to the pawn shop his pots and pans his clothes his armchair finally his bedstead then he died the doctor said the man was terribly emaciated his stomach was shrivelled up for want of food he could have eaten nothing for two days before death the jury did not trouble to leave the box the foreman merely turned round and whispered to them a minute they all nodded and a verdict was returned in accordance with the doctors evidence  the next inquiry was upon a child of two the coroner leant his head wearily on his hand such cases were so common the babes mother came forward to give her evidencea pale little woman with thin and hollow cheeks her eyes red and dim with weeping she sobbed as she told the coroner that her husband had left her and she was obliged to support herself and two children she was out of work and food had been rather scanty she had suckled the dead baby as long as she could but her milk dried up two days before on waking up in the morning the child she held in her arms was cold and dead the doctor shrugged his shoulders want of food and the jury returned their verdict framed in a beautiful and elaborate sentence in accordance with the evidence  the last case was a girl of twenty she had been found in the thames a bargee told how he saw a confused black mass floating on the water and he put a boathook in the skirt tying the body up to the boat while he called the police he was so used to such things in the girls pocket was found a pathetic little letter to the coroner begging his pardon for the trouble she was causing saying she had been sent away from her place and was starving and had resolved to put an end to her troubles by throwing herself in the river she was pregnant the medical man stated that there were signs on the body of very great privation so the jury returned a verdict that the deceased had committed suicide whilst in a state of temporary insanity  the coroner stretched his arms and blew his nose and the jury went their way  but mr clinton stood outside the mortuary door meditating and the coroners officer remarked that it was a wet day  could i ave another look at the bodies timidly asked the clerk stirring himself out of his contemplation  the coroners officer looked at him with surprise and laughed  yes if you like  mr clinton looked through the glass windows at the bodies and he carefully examined their faces he looked at them one after another slowly and it seemed as if he could not tear himself away finally he turned round his face was very pale and it had quite a strange expression on it he felt very sick  thank you he said to the coroners officer and walked away but after a few steps he turned back touching the man on the arm dyou ave many cases like that he asked  why you look quite upset said the coroners officer with amusement i can see youre not used to such things youd better go to the pub opposite and ave three aporth of brandy  they seemed rather painful cases said mr clinton in a low voice  oh it was a slack day today nothing like what it is usually this time of year  they all died of starvationstarvation and nothing else  i suppose they did more or less replied the officer  dyou ave many cases like that  starvation cases lor bless you on a eavy day well ave alf a dozen easy  oh said mr clinton  well i must be getting on with my work said the officerthey were standing on the doorstep and he looked at the publichouse opposite but mr clinton paid no further attention to him he began to walk slowly away citywards  well you are a rummy old file said the coroners officer  but presently a mist came before mr clintons eyes everything seemed suddenly extraordinary he had an intense pain and he felt himself falling he opened his eyes slowly and found himself sitting on a doorstep a policeman was shaking him asking what his name was a woman standing by was holding his top hat he noticed that his trousers were muddy and mechanically he pulled out his handkerchief and began to wipe them  he looked vacantly at the policeman asking questions the woman asked him if he was better he motioned her to give him his hat he put it feebly on his head and staggering to his feet walked unsteadily away  the rain drizzled down impassively and cabs passing swiftly splashed up the yellow mud   vi  mr clinton went back to the office it was his boast that for ten years he had never missed a day but he was dazed he did his work mechanically and so distracted was he that on going home in the evening he forgot to remove his paper cuffs and his wife remarked upon them while they were supping mrs clinton was a short stout person with an appearance of immense determination her black shiny hair was parted in the middlethe parting was broad and very whiteseverely brushed back and gathered into a little knot at the back of the head her face was red and strongly lined her eyes spirited her nose aggressive her mouth resolute everyone has some one procedure which seems most exactly to suit hima slim youth bathing in a shaded stream an alderman standing with his back to the fire and his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoatand mrs clinton expressed her complete self exhibiting every trait and attribute on sunday in church when she sat in the front pew selfreliantly singing the hymns in the wrong key it was then that she seemed more than ever the personification of a full stop her morals were above suspicion and her religion low church  theyve moved into the second ouse down she remarked to her husband and mrs tillys taken er summer curtains down at last mrs clinton spent most of her time in watching her neighbours movements and she and her husband always discussed at the suppertable the events of the day but this time he took no notice of her remark he pushed away his cold meat with an expression of disgust  you dont seem up to the mark tonight jimmy said mrs clinton  i served on a jury today in place of the governor and it gave me rather a turn  why was there anything particular  mr clinton crumbled up his bread rolling it about on the table  only some poor things starved to death  mrs clinton shrugged her shoulders why couldnt they go to the workhouse i wonder ive no patience with people like that  mr clinton looked at her for a moment then rose from the table well dear i think ill get to bed i daresay i shall be all right in the morning  thats right said mrs clinton you get to bed and ill bring you something ot i expect youve got a bit of a chill and a good perspirationll do you a world of good  she mixed bad whisky with harmless water and stood over her husband while he patiently drank the boiling mixture then she piled a couple of extra blankets on him and went down stairs to have her usual nip scotch and cold before going to bed herself  all night mr clinton tossed from side to side the heat was unbearable and he threw off the clothes his restlessness became so great that he got out of bed and walked up and down the rooma pathetically ridiculous object in his flannel nightshirt from which his thin legs protruded grotesquely going back to bed he fell into an uneasy sleep but waking or sleeping he had before his eyes the faces of the three horrible bodies he had seen at the mortuary he could not blot out the image of the thin baby face with the pale open eyes the white face drawn and thin hideous in its starved dead shapelessness and he saw the drawn wrinkled face of the old man with the stubbly beard looking at it he felt the long pain of hunger the agony of the hopeless morrow but he shuddered with terror at the thought of the drowned girl with the sunken eyes the horrible discolouration of putrefaction and mr clinton buried his face in his pillow sobbing sobbing very silently so as not to wake his wife  the morning came at last and found him feverish and parched unable to move mrs clinton sent for the doctor a slow cautious scotchman in whose wisdom mrs clinton implicitly relied since he always agreed with her own idea of her childrens ailments this prudent gentleman ventured to assert that mr clinton had caught cold and had something wrong with his lungs then promising to send medicine and come again next day went off on his rounds mr clinton grew worse he became delirious when his wife smoothing his pillow asked him how he felt he looked at her with glassy eyes  lor bless you he muttered on a eavy day well ave alf a dozen easy  whats this hes talking about asked the doctor next day  e was serving on a jury the day before yesterday and my opinion is that its got on is brain answered mrs clinton  oh thats nothing you neednt worry about that i daresay itll turn to clothes or religion before hes done people talk of funny things when theyre in that state hell probably think hes got two hundred pairs of trousers or a million pounds a year  a couple of days later the doctor came to the final conclusion that it was a case of typhoid and pronounced mr clinton very ill he was indeed he lay for days between life and death on his back looking at people with dull unknowing eyes clutching feebly at the bedclothes and for hours he would mutter strange things to himself so quietly that one could not hear but at last dame nature and the scotch doctor conquered the microbes and mr clinton became better   vii  one day mrs clinton was talking to a neighbour in the bedroom the patient was so quiet that they thought him asleep  yes ive ad a time with im i can tell you said mrs clinton no one knows what ive gone through  well i must say said the friend you havent spared yourself youve nursed him like a professional nurse  mrs clinton crossed her hands over her stomach and looked at her husband with selfsatisfaction but mr clinton was awake staring in front of him with wideopen fixed eyes various thoughts confusedly ran through his head  isnt e looking strange whispered mrs clinton  the two women kept silence watching him  amy are you there asked mr clinton suddenly without turning his eyes  yes dear is there anything you want  mr clinton did not reply for several minutes the women waited in silence  bring me a bible amy he said at last  a bible jimmy asked mrs clinton in astonishment  yes dear  she looked anxiously at her friend  oh i do ope the delirium isnt coming on again she whispered and pretending to smooth his pillow she passed her hand over his forehead to see if it was hot are you quite comfortable dear she asked without further allusion to the bible  yes amy quite  dont you think you could go to sleep for a little while  i dont feel sleepy i want to read will you bring me the bible  mrs clinton looked helplessly at her friend she feared something was wrong and she didnt know what to do but the neighbour with a significant look pointed to the daily telegraph which was lying on a chair mrs clinton brightened up and took it to her husband  heres the paper dear mr clinton made a slight movement of irritation  i dont want it i want the bible mrs clinton looked at her friend more helplessly than ever  ive never known im ask for such a thing before she whispered and es never missed reading the telegraph a single day since we was married  i dont think you ought to read she said aloud to her husband but the doctorll be here soon and ill ask im then  the doctor stroked his chin thoughtfully i dont think thered be any harm in letting him have a bible he said but youd better keep an eye on him i suppose theres no insanity in the family  no doctor not as far as i know ive always eard that my mothers uncle was very eccentric but that wouldnt account for this because we wasnt related before we married  mr clinton took the bible and turning to the new testament began to read he read chapter after chapter pausing now and again to meditate or reading a second time some striking passage till at last he finished the first gospel then he turned to his wife  amy dyou know i think i should like to do something for my fellercreatures i dont think were meant to live for ourselves alone in this world  mrs clinton was quite overcome she turned away to hide the tears which suddenly filled her eyes but the shock was too much for her and she had to leave the room so that her husband might not see her emotion she immediately sent for the doctor  oh doctor she said her voice broken with sobs im afraidim afraid my poor usbands going off is ead  and she told him of the incessant reading and the remark mr clinton had just made the doctor looked grave and began thinking  youre quite sure theres no insanity in the family he asked again  not to the best of my belief doctor  and youve noticed nothing strange in him his mind hasnt been running on money or clothes  no doctor i wish it ad i shouldnt ave thought anything of that theres something natural in a man talking about stocks and shares and trousers but ive never eard im say anything like this before he was always a wonderfully steady man   viii  mr clinton became daily stronger and soon he was quite well he resumed his work at the office and in every way seemed to have regained his old self he gave utterance to no more startling theories and the casual observer might have noticed no difference between him and the model clerk of six months back but mrs clinton had received too great a shock to look upon her husband with casual eyes and she noticed in his manner an alteration which disquieted her he was much more silent than before he would take his supper without speaking a word without making the slightest sign to show that he had heard some remark of mrs clintons he did not read the paper in the evening as he had been used to do but would go upstairs to the top of the house and stand by an open window looking at the stars he had an enigmatical way of smiling which mrs clinton could not understand then he had lost his old punctualityhe would come home at all sorts of hours and when his wife questioned him would merely shrug his shoulders and smile strangely once he told her that he had been wandering about looking at mens lives  mrs clinton thought that a very unsatisfactory explanation of his unpunctuality and after a long consultation with the cautious doctor came to the conclusion that it was her duty to discover what her husband did during the long time that elasped between his leaving the office and returning home  so one day at about six she stationed herself at the door of the big building in which were mr clintons offices and waited presently he appeared in the doorway and after standing for a minute or two on the threshold ever with the enigmatical smile hovering on his lips came down the steps and walked slowly along the crowded street his wife walked behind him and he was not difficult to follow for he had lost his old quick businesslike step and sauntered along looking to the right and to the left carelessly as if he had not awaiting him at home his duties as the father of a family after a while he turned down a side street and his wife followed with growing astonishment she could not imagine where he was going just then a little flowergirl passed by and offered him a yellow rose he stopped and looked at her mrs clinton could see that she was a grimy little girl with a shock of unkempt brown hair and a very dirty apron but mr clinton put his hand on her head and looked into her eyes then he gave her a penny and stooping down lightly kissed her hair  bless you my dear he said and passed on  well i never said mrs clinton quite aghast and as she walked by the flower girl snorted at her and looked so savagely that the poor little maiden quite started mr clinton walked very slowly stopping now and then to look at a couple of women seated on a doorstep or the children round an icecream stall mrs clinton saw him pay a penny and give an ice to a little child who was looking with longing eyes at its more fortunate companions as they licked out the little glass cups he remained quite a long while watching half a dozen young girls dancing to the music of a barrel organ and again to his wifes disgust mr clinton gave money  we shall end in the workouse if this goes on muttered mrs clinton and she pursed up her lips more tightly than ever thinking of the explanation she meant to have when her mate came home  at last mr clinton came to a narrow slum down which he turned and so filthy was it that the lady almost feared to follow but indignation curiosity and a stern sense of duty prevailed she went along with upturned nose making her way carefully between cabbages and other vegetable refuse sidling up against a house to avoid a dead cat which lay huddled up in the middle of the way with a great red wound in its head  mrs clinton was disgusted to see her husband enter a publichouse  is this where he gets to she said to herself and looking through the door saw him talk with two or three rough men who were standing at the bar drinking four arf  but she waited determinedly she had made up her mind to see the matter to the end come what might she was willing to wait all night  after a time he came out and going through a narrow passage made his way into an alley then he went straight up to a bigboned coarsefeatured woman in a white apron who was standing at an open door and when he had said a few words to her the two entered the house and the door was closed behind them  mrs clinton suddenly saw it all  i am deceived she said tragically and she crackled with virtuous indignation  her first impulse was to knock furiously at the door and force her way in to bear her james away from the clutches of the bigboned siren but she feared that her rival would meet her with brute force and the possibility of defeat made her see the unladylikeness of the proceeding so she turned on her heel holding up her skirts and her nose against the moral contamination and made her way out of the low place she walked tempestuously down to fleet street jumped fiercely on a bus frantically caught the train to camberwell and having reached her house in the adonis road flung herself furiously down on a chair and gasped  oh  then she got ready for her husbands return  well she said when he came in and she looked daggers well  im afraid im later than usual my dear it was in fact past nine oclock  dont talk to me she replied with a vigorous jerk of her head i know what youve been up to  what do you mean my love he gently asked  she positively snorted with indignation she had rolled her handkerchief into a ball and nervously dabbed the palms of her hands with it i followed you this afternoon and i saw you go into that ouse with that low woman what now eh she spoke with the greatest possible emphasis  woman said mr clinton with a smile what are you to me  dont call me woman said mrs clinton very angrily what am i to you im your wife and ive got the marriage certificate in my pocket at this moment she slapped her pocket loudly im your wife and you ought to be ashamed of yourself  wife you are no more to me than any other woman  and you ave the audacity to tell me that to my face oh youyou villain i wont stand it i tell you i wont stand it i know i cant get a divorcethe laws of england are scandalousbut ill ave a judicious separation i might have known it youre all alike every one of you thats ow you men treat women you take advantage of their youth and beauty and then oh you villain here ave i worked myself to the bone for you and brought up your children and i dont know what i avent done and now you go and take on with some woman and leave me oh she burst into tears mr clinton still smiled and there was a curious look in his eyes  woman woman he said you know not what you say he went up to his wife and laid his hand on her shoulder dry your tears he said and i will tell you of these things  mrs clinton shook herself angrily keeping her face buried in her pocket handkerchief but he turned away without paying more attention to her then standing in front of the glass he looked at himself earnestly and began to speak  it was during my illness that my eyes were opened lying in bed through those long hours i thought of the poor souls whose tale i ad eard in the coroners court and all night i saw their dead faces i thought of the misery of mankind and of the ardness of mens earts then a ray of light came to me and i called for a bible and i read and read and the light grew into a great glow and i saw that man was not meant to live for imself alone that there was something else in life that it was mans duty to elp his fellers and i resolved when i was well to do all that in me lay to elp the poor and the wretched and faithfully to carry out those precepts which the book ad taught me  oh dear oh dear sobbed mrs clinton who had looked up and listened with astonishment to her husbands speech oh dear oh dear what is he talking about  mr clinton turned towards her and again put his hand on her shoulder  and that is ow i spend my time amy i go into the most miserable ouses into the dirtiest oles the foulest alleys and i seek to make men appier i do what i can to elp them in their distress and to show them that brilliant light which i see so gloriously lighting the way before me and now goodnight he stretched out his arm and for a moment let his hand rest above her head then turning on his heel he left the room  next day mrs clinton called on the doctor and told him of her husbands strange behaviour the doctor slowly and meditatively nodded then he raised his eyebrows and with his finger significantly tapped his head  well he said i think youd better wait a while and see how things go on ill just write out a prescription and you can give him the medicine three times a day after meals and he ordered the unhappy mr clinton another tonic which if it had no effect on that gentleman considerably reassured his wife   ix  mr clinton in fact became worse he came home later and later every night and his wife was disgusted at the state of uncleanness which his curious wanderings brought about he refused to take the baths which mrs clinton prepared for him he was more silent than ever but when he spoke it was in biblical language and always hovered on his lips the enigmatical smile and his eyes always had the strange disconcerting look mrs clinton perseveringly made him take his medicine but she lost faith in its power when one night at twelve mr clinton brought home with him a very dirty ragged man who looked halfstarved and smelt distinctly alcoholic  jim she said on seeing the miserable object slinking in behind her husband jim whats that  that amy that is your brother  my brother what dyou mean cried mrs clinton firing up thats no brother of mine i avent got a brother  its your brother and my brother be good to him  i tell you it isnt my brother repeated mrs clinton my brother adolphus died when he was two years old and thats the only brother i ever ad  mr clinton merely looked at her with his usual gentle expression and she asked angrily  what ave you brought im ere for  e is ungry and i am going to give im food e is omeless and i am going to give im shelter  shelter where  here in my ouse in my bed  in my bed screamed mrs clinton not if i know it ere you she said addressing the man and pushing past her husband out you get im not going to ave tramps and loafers in my ouse get out mrs clinton was an energetic woman and a strong one catching hold of her husbands stick and flourishing it she opened the front door  amy amy expostulated mr clinton  now then you be quiet ive ad about enough of you get on out will you  the man made a rush for the door and as he scrambled down the steps she caught him a smart blow on the back and slammed the door behind him then returning to the sittingroom she sank panting on a chair mr clinton slowly recovered from his surprise  woman he said this being now his usual mode of addresshe spoke solemnly and sadlyyou ave cast out your brother you ave cast out your husband you ave cast out yourself  dont talk to me said mrs clinton very wrathfully its bed time now come along upstairs  i will not come to your bed again you ave refused it to one who was better than i and why should i ave it go woman go and leave me  now then dont come trying your airs on me said mrs clinton they wont wash come up to bed  i tell you i will not replied mr clinton decisively go woman and leave me  well if i do i shant leave the light so there she said spitefully and taking the lamp left mr clinton in darkness  mrs clinton was not henceforth on the very best of terms with her husband but he always treated her with his accustomed gentleness though he insisted on spending his nights on the diningroom sofa  but perhaps the most objectionable to mrs clinton of all her good mans eccentricities was that he no longer gave her his weeks money every saturday afternoon as he had been accustomed to do the coldness between them made her unwilling to say anything about it but the approach of quarter day forced her to pocket her dignity and ask for the money  oh jamesshe no longer called him jimmywill you give me the money for the rent  money he answered with the usual smile on his lips i ave no money  what dyou mean youve not given me a farthing for ten weeks  i ave given it to those who want it more than i  you dont mean to tell me that youve given your salary away  yes dear  mrs clinton groaned  oh youre dotty i can understand giving a threepenny bit or even sixpence at the offertory on sunday at church and of course one as to give christmasboxes to the tradesmen but to give your whole salary away avent you got anything left  no  youyou aggravating fool and ill be bound you gave it to lazy loafers and tramps and lord knows what  mr clinton did not answer his wife walked rapidly backwards and forwards wringing her hands  well look here james she said at last its no use crying over spilt milk but from this day you just give me your salary the moment you receive it dyou hear i tell you i will not ave any more of your nonsense  i shall get no more salaries he quietly remarked  mrs clinton looked at him he was quite calm and smilingly returned her glance  what do you mean by that she asked  i am no longer at the office  james you avent been sacked she screamed  oh they said i did not any longer properly attend to my work they said i was careless and that i made mistakes they complained that i was unpunctual that i went late and came away early and one day because i adnt been there the day before they told me to leave i was watching at the bedside of a man who was dying and ad need of me so ow could i go but i didnt really mind the office indered me in my work  but what are you going to do now gasped mrs clinton  i ave my work that is more important than ten thousand offices  but ow are you going to earn your living whats to become of us  dont trouble me about those things come with me and work for the poor  james think of the children  what are your children to me more than any other children  but  woman i tell you not to trouble me about these things ave we not money enough and to spare  he waved his hand and putting on his top hat which looked more than ever in need of restoration went out leaving his wife in a perfect agony  there was worse to follow coming home a few days later mr clinton told his wife that he wished to speak with her  i ave been looking into my books he said and i find that we have invested in various securities a sum of nearly seven undred pounds  thank eaven for that answered his wife its the only thing thatll save us from starvation now that you moon about all day instead of working like a decent man  well i ave been thinking and i ave been reading and i ave found it writtengive all and follow me  well theres nothing new in that said mrs clinton viciously ive known that text ever since i was a child  and as it were a spirit as come to me and said that i too must give all in short i ave determined to sell out my stocks and my shares my breweries are seven points igher than when i bought them i knew it was a good investment i am going to realise everything i am going to take the money in my hand and i am going to give it to the poor  mrs clinton burst into tears  do not weep he said solemnly it is my duty and it is a pleasant one oh what joy to make a undred people appy to relieve a poor man who is starving to give a breath of country air to little children who are dying for the want of it to elp the poor to feed the ungry to clothe the naked oh if i only ad a million pounds he stretched out his arms in a gesture of embrace and looked towards heaven with an ecstatic smile upon his lips  it was too serious a matter for mrs clinton to waste any words on she ran upstairs put on her bonnet and quickly walked to her friend the doctor  he looked graver than ever when she told him  well he said im afraid its very serious ive never heard of anyone doing such a thing before of course ive known of people who have left all their money to charities after their death when they didnt want it but it couldnt ever occur to a normal healthy man to do it in his lifetime  but what shall i do doctor mrs clinton was almost in hysterics  well mrs clinton dyou know the clergyman of the parish  i know mr evans the curate very well hes a very nice gentleman  perhaps you could get him to have a talk with your husband the fact is its a sort of religious mania hes got and perhaps a clergyman could talk him out of it anyhow its worth trying  mrs clinton straightway went to mr evanss rooms explained to him the case and settled that on the following day he should come and see what he could do with her husband   x  in expectation of the curates visit mrs clinton tidied the house and adorned herself it has been said that she was a woman of taste and so she was the mantelpiece and looking glass were artistically draped with green muslin and this she proceeded to arrange tying and carefully forming the yellow satin ribbon with which it was relieved the chairs were covered with cretonne which might have come from the tottenham court road and these she placed in positions of careless and artistic confusion smoothing down the antimacassars which were now her pride as the silk petticoat from which she had manufactured them had been once her glory for the flowerpots she made fresh coverings of red tissue paper rearranged the ornaments gracefully scattered about on little japanese tables then after pausing a moment to admire her work and see that nothing had been left undone she went upstairs to perform her own toilet in less than half an hour she reappeared holding herself in a dignified posture with her head slightly turned to one side and her hands meekly folded in front of her stately and collected as juno a goddess in black satin her dress was very elegant it might have typified her own life for in its original state of virgin whiteness it had been her wedding garment then it was dyed purple and might have betokened a sense of change and coming responsibilities lastly it was black to signify the burden of a family and the seriousness of life no one had realised so intensely as mrs clinton the truth of the poets words life is not an empty dream she took out her handkerchief redolent with lascivious patchouli and placed it in her bosoma spot of whiteness against the black she sat herself down to wait  there was a knock and a ring at the door timid as befitted a clergyman and the servantgirl showed in mr evans he was a thin and short young man red faced with a long nose and weak eyes looking underfed and cold keeping his shoulders screwed up in a perpetual shiver he was an earnest godfearing man spending much money in charities and waging constant war against the encroachments of the scarlet woman  i think ill just take my coat off if you dont mind mrs clinton he said after the usual greetings he folded it carefully and hung it over the back of a chair then coming forward he sat down and rubbed the back of his hands  i asked my usband to stay in because you wanted to see im but he would go out owevermrs clinton always chose her language on such occasionsowever es promised to return at four and i will say this for im he never breaks is word  oh very well  may i ave the pleasure of offering you a cup of tea mr evans  the curates face brightened up  oh thank you so much and he rubbed his hands more energetically than ever  tea was brought in and they drank it talking of parish matters mrs clinton discreetly trying to pump the curate was it really true that mrs palmer of no 17 adonis road drank so terribly  at last mr clinton came and his wife glided out of the room leaving the curate to convert him there was a little pause while mr evans took stock of the clerk  well mr clinton he said finally ive come to talk to you about yourself your wife tells me that you have adopted certain curious views on religious matters and she wishes me to have some conversation with you about them  you are a man of god replied mr clinton i am at your service  mr evans on principle objected to the use of the deitys name out of church thinking it a little blasphemous but he said nothing  well he said of course religion is a very good thing in fact it is the very best thing but it must not be abused mr clinton and he repeated gravely as if his interlocutor were a naughty schoolboyit mustnt be abused now i want to know exactly what you views are  mr clinton smiled gently  i ave no views sir the only rule i ave for guidance is thislove thy neighbour as thyself  hum murmured the curate there was really nothing questionable in that but he was just slightly prejudiced against a man who made such a quotation it sounded a little priggish  but your wife tells me that youve been going about with all sorts of queer people  i found that there was misery and unappiness among people and i tried to relieve it  of course i strongly approve of district visiting i do a great deal of it myself but youve been going about with publichouse loafers andbad women  is it not said i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance  no doubt answered mr evans slightly frowning but obviously one isnt meant to do that to such an extent as to be dismissed from ones place  my wife as posted you well up in all my private affairs  well i dont think you can have done well to be sent away from your office  is it not said forsake all and follow me  decidedly this was bad form and mr evans pursing up his lips and raising his eyebrows was silent thats the worst of these halfeducated people he said to himself they get some idea in their heads which they dont understand and of course they do idiotic things  well to pass over all that he added out loud apparently youve been spending your money on these people to such an extent that your wife and children are actually inconvenienced by it  i ave clothed the naked said mr clinton looking into the curates eyes i ave visited the sick i ave given food to im that was an ungered and drink to im that was athirst  yes yes yes thats all very well but you should always remember that charity begins at home i shouldnt have anything to say to a rich mans doing these things but its positively wicked for you to do them dont you understand that and last of all your wife tells me that youre realising your property with the idea of giving it away  its perfectly true said mr clinton  mr evanss mind was too truly pious for a wicked expletive to cross it but a bad man expressing the curates feeling would have said that mr clinton was a damned fool  well dont you see that its a perfectly ridiculous and unheardof thing he asked emphatically  sell all that thou ast and distribute unto the poor it is in the gospel of st luke do you know it  of course i know it but naturally these things arent to be taken quite literally  it is clearly written what makes you say it is not to be taken literally  mr evans shrugged his shoulders impatiently  why dont you see it would be impossible the world couldnt go on how do you expect your children to live if you give this money away  look at the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin yet solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these  oh my dear sir you make me lose my patience youre full of the hellfire platitudes of a park spouter and you think its religion i tell you all these things are allegorical dont you understand that you mustnt carry them out to the letter they are not meant to be taken in that way  mr clinton smiled a little pitifully at the curate  and think of yourselfone must think of oneself god helps those who help themselves how are you going to exist when this little money of yours is gone youll simply have to go to the workhouse its absurd i tell you  mr clinton took no further notice of the curate but he broke into a loud chant  lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal then turning on the unhappy curate he stretched out his arm and pointed his finger at him last sunday he said i eard you read those very words from the chancel steps go go i tell you go you are a bad man a wolf in sheeps clothinggo mr clinton walked up to him threateningly and the curate with a gasp of astonishment and indignation fled from the room  he met mrs clinton outside  i cant do anything with him at all he said angrily ive never heard such things in my life hes either mad or hes got into the hands of the dissenters thats the only explanation i can offer  then to quiet his feelings he called on a wealthy female parishioner with whom he was a great favourite because she thought him such a really pious man and it was not till he had drunk two cups of tea that he recovered his equilibrium   xi  mrs clinton was at her wits end her husband had sold out his shares and the money was lying at the bank ready to be put to its destined use visions of debt and bankruptcy presented themselves to her she saw her black satin dress in the ruthless clutches of a pawnbroker the house and furniture sold over her head the children down at heel and herself driven to work for her livingneedlework nursing charingwhat might not things come to however she went to the doctor and told him of the failure of their scheme  ive come to the end of my tether mrs clinton i really dont know what to do the only thing i can suggest is that a mental specialist should examine into the state of his mind i really think hes wrong in his head and you know it may be necessary for your welfare and his own that he be kept under restriction  well doctor answered mrs clinton putting her handkerchief up to her eyes and beginning to cry well doctor of course i shouldnt like him to be shut upit seems a terrible thing and i shall never ave a moments peace all the rest of my life but if he must be shut up for heavens sake let it be done at once before the moneys gone and here she began to sob very violently  the doctor said he would immediately write to the specialist so that they might hold a consultation on mr clinton the very next day  so the following morning mrs clinton again put on her black satin dress and further sent to her grocers for a bottle of sherry her inner consciousness giving her to understand that specialists expected something of the kind  the specialist came he was a tall untidilydressed man with his hair wild and straggling as if he had just got out of bed he was very clever and very impatient of stupid people and he seldom met anyone whom he did not think in one way or another intensely stupid  mr clinton as before had gone out but mrs clinton did her best to entertain the two doctors the specialist who talked most incessantly himself was extremely impatient of other peoples conversation  why on earth dont people see that theyre much more interesting when they hold their tongues than when they speak he was in the habit of saying and immediately would pour out a deluge of words emphasising and explaining the point giving instances of its truth  you must see a lot of strange things doctor said mrs clinton amiably  yes answered the specialist  i think it must be very interesting to be a doctor said mrs clinton  yes yes  you must see a lot of strange things  yes yes repeated the doctor and as mrs clinton went on complacently he frowned and drummed his fingers on the table and looked to the right and left when is the man coming in he asked impatiently  and at last he could not contain himself  if you dont mind mrs clinton i should like to talk to your doctor alone about the case you can wait in the next room  im sure i dont wish to intrude said mrs clinton bridling up and she rose in a dignified manner from her chair she thought his manners were distinctly queer but of course she said to a friend afterwards hes a genius theres no mistaking it and people like that are always very eccentric  what an insufferable woman he began when the lady had retired talking very rapidly only stopping to take an occasional breath i thought she was going on all night shes enough to drive the man mad one couldnt get a word in edgeways why on earth doesnt this man come just like these people they dont think that my times valuable i expect she drinks shocking you know these women how they drink and still talking he looked at his watch for the eighth time in ten minutes  well my man he said as mr clinton at last came in what are you complaining of one moment he added as mr clinton was about to reply he opened his notebook and took out a stylographic pen now im ready for you what are you complaining of  im complaining that the world is out of joint answered mr clinton with a smile  the specialist raised his eyebrows and significantly looked at the family doctor  its astonishing how much you can get by a welldirected question he said to him taking no notice of mr clinton some people go floundering about for hours but you see by one question i get on the track turning to the patient again he said ah and do you see things  certainly i see you  i dont mean that impatiently said the specialist distinctly stupid you know he added to his colleague i mean do you see things that other people dont see  alas yes i see folly stalking abroad on a obby orse  do you really anything else said the doctor making a note of the fact  i see wickedness and vice beating the land with their wings  sees things beating with their wings wrote down the doctor  i see misery and unappiness everywhere  indeed said the doctor has delusions do you think your wife puts things in your tea  yes  ah joyfully uttered the doctor thats what i wanted to get atthinks people are trying to poison him what is it they put in my man  milk and sugar answered mr clinton  very dull mentally said the specialist in an undertone to his colleague well i dont think we need go into any more details theres no doubt about it you know that curious look in his eyes and the smilethe smiles quite typical it all clearly points to insanity and then that absurd idea of giving his money to the poor ive heard of people taking money away from the poor theres nothing mad in that but the other why its a proof of insanity itself and then your account of his movements his giving icecreams to children most pernicious things those icecreams the government ought to put a stop to them extraordinary idea to think of reforming the world with icecream postenteric insanity you know mad as a hatter well well i must be off still talking he put on his hat and talked all the way downstairs and finally talked himself out of the house  the family doctor remained behind to see mrs clinton  yes its just as i said he told her hes not responsible for his actions i think hes been insane ever since his illness when you think of his behaviour since thenhis going among those common people and trying to reform them and his ideas about feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and finally wanting to give his money to the poorit all points to a completely deranged mind  mrs clinton heaved a deep sigh and what do you think ad better be done now she asked  well im very sorry mrs clinton of course its a great blow to you but really i think arrangements had better be made for him to be put under restraint  mrs clinton began to cry and the doctor looked at her compassionately  ah well she said at last if it must be done i suppose it ad better be done at once and i shall be able to save the money after all at the thought of this she dried her tears  the moral is plain     de amicitia   i  they were walking home from the theatre  well mr white said valentia i think it was just fine  it was magnificent replied mr white  and they were separated for a moment by the crowd streaming up from the français towards the opera and the boulevards  i think if you dont mind she said ill take your arm so that we shouldnt get lost  he gave her his arm and they walked through the louvre and over the river on their way to the latin quarter  valentia was an art student and ferdinand white was a poet ferdinand considered valentia the only woman who had ever been able to paint and valentia told ferdinand that he was the only man she had met who knew anything about art without being himself an artist on her arrival in paris a year before she had immediately inscribed herself at the offices of the new york herald valentia stewart cincinnati ohio usa she settled down in a respectable pension and within a week was painting vigorously ferdinand white arrived from oxford at about the same time hired a dirty room in a shabby hotel ate his meals at cheap restaurants in the boulevard st michel read stephen mallarmé and flattered himself that he was leading la vie de bohême  after two months the fates brought the pair together and ferdinand began to take his meals at valentias pension they went to the museums together and in the sculpture gallery at the louvre ferdinand would discourse on ancient greece in general and on plato in particular while among the pictures valentia would lecture on tones and values and chiaroscuro ferdinand renounced ruskin and all his works valentia read the symposium frequently in the evening they went to the theatre sometimes to the français but more often to the odéon and after the performance they would discuss the play its art its techniqueabove all its ethics ferdinand explained the piece he had in contemplation and valentia talked of the picture she meant to paint for next years salon and the lady told her friends that her companion was the cleverest man she had met in her life while he told his that she was the only really sympathetic and intelligent girl he had ever known thus were united in bonds of amity great britain on the one side and the united states of america and ireland on the other  but when ferdinand spoke of valentia to the few frenchmen he knew they asked him  but this miss stewartis she pretty  certainlyin her american way a long face with the hair parted in the middle and hanging over the nape of the neck her mouth is quite classic  and have you never kissed the classic mouth  i never  has she a good figure  admirable  and yetoh you english and they smiled and shrugged their shoulders as they said how english  but my good fellow cried ferdinand in execrable french you dont understand we are friends the best of friends  they shrugged their shoulders more despairingly than ever   ii  they stood on the bridge and looked at the water and the dark masses of the houses on the latin side with the twin towers of notre dame rising dimly behind them ferdinand thought of the thames at night with the barges gliding slowly down and the twinkling of the lights along the embankment  it must be a little like that in holland she said but without the lights and with greater stillness  when do you start  she had been making preparations for spending the summer in a little village near amsterdam to paint  i cant go now cried valentia corrie sayles is going home and theres no one else i can go with and i cant go alone where are you going  i i have no plans i never make plans  they paused looking at the reflections in the water then she said  i dont see why you shouldnt come to holland with me  he did not know what to think he knew she had been reading the symposium  after all she said theres no reason why one shouldnt go away with a man as well as with a woman  his french friends would have suggested that there were many reasons why one should go away with a woman rather than a man but like his companion ferdinand looked at it in the light of pure friendship  when one comes to think of it i really dont see why we shouldnt and the mere fact of staying at the same hotel can make no difference to either of us we shall both have our workyou your painting and i my play  as they considered it the idea was distinctly pleasing they wondered that it had not occurred to them before sauntering homewards they discussed the details and in half an hour had decided on the plan of their journey the date and the train  next day valentia went to say goodbye to the old french painter whom all the american girls called popper she found him in a capacious dressinggown smoking cigarettes  well my dear he said what news  im going to holland to paint windmills  a very laudable ambition with your mother  my good popper my mothers in cincinnati im going with mr white  with mr white he raised his eyebrows you are very frank about it  whywhat do you mean  he put on his glasses and looked at her carefully  does it not seem to you a rathercurious thing for a young girl of your age to go away with a young man of the age of mr ferdinand white  good gracious me one would think i was doing something that had never been done before  oh many a young man has gone travelling with a young woman but they generally start by a night train and arrive at the station in different cabs  but surely popper you dont mean to insinuatemr white and i are going to holland as friends  friends  he looked at her more curiously than ever  one can have a man friend as well as a girl friend she continued and i dont see why he shouldnt be just as good a friend  the danger is that he become too good  you misunderstand me entirely popper we are friends and nothing but friends  you are entirely off your head my child  ah youre a frenchman you cant understand these things we are different  i imagine that you are human beings even though england and america respectively had the intense good fortune of seeing your birth  were human beingsand more than that were nineteenth century human beings love is not everything it is a part of oneperhaps the lower partan accessory to mans life needful for the continuation of the species  you use such difficult words my dear  there is something higher and nobler and purer than lovethere is friendship ferdinand white is my friend i have the amplest confidence in him i am certain that no unclean thought has ever entered his head  she spoke quite heatedly and as she flushed up the old painter thought her astonishingly handsome then she added as an afterthought  we despise passion passion is ugly it is grotesque  the painter stroked his imperial and faintly smiled  my child you must permit me to tell you that you are foolish passion is the most lovely thing in the world without it we should not paint beautiful pictures it is passion that makes a woman of a society lady it is passion that makes a man even ofan art critic  we do not want it she said we worship venus urania we are all spirit and soul  you have been reading plato soon you will read zola  he smiled again and lit another cigarette  do you disapprove of my going she asked after a little silence  he paused and looked at her then he shrugged his shoulders  on the contrary i approve it is foolish but that is no reason why you should not do it after all folly is the great attribute of man no judge is as grave as an owl no soldier fighting for his country flies as rapidly as the hare you may be strong but you are not so strong as a horse you may be gluttonous but you cannot eat like a boaconstrictor but there is no beast that can be as foolish as man and since one should always do what one can do bestbe foolish strive for folly above all things let the height of your ambition be the pointed cap with the golden bells so bon voyage i will come and see you off tomorrow  the painter arrived at the station with a box of sweets which he handed to valentia with a smile he shook ferdinands hand warmly and muttered under his breath  silly fool hes thinking of friendship too  then as the train steamed out he waved his hand and cried  be foolish be foolish  he walked slowly out of the station and sat down at a café he lit a cigarette and sipping his absinthe said  imbeciles   iii  they arrived at amsterdam in the evening and after dinner gathered together their belongings and crossed the ij as the moon shone over the waters then they got into the little steam tram and started for monnickendam they stood side by side on the platform of the carriage and watched the broad meadows bathed in moonlight the formless shapes of the cattle lying on the grass and the black outlines of the mills they passed by a long sleeping canal and they stopped at little silent villages at last they entered the dead town and the tram put them down at the hotel door  next morning when she was half dressed valentia threw open the window of her room and looked out into the garden ferdinand was walking about dressed as befitted the place and seasonin flannelswith a huge white hat on his head she could not help thinking him very handsomeand she took off the blue skirt she had intended to work in and put on a dress of muslin all bespattered with coloured flowers and she took in her hand a flat straw hat with red ribbons  you look like a dresden shepherdess he said as they met  they had breakfast in the garden beneath the trees and as she poured out his tea she laughed and with the american accent which he was beginning to think made english so harmonious said  i reckon this about takes the shine out of paris  they had agreed to start work at once losing no time for they wanted to have a lot to show on their return to france that their scheme might justify itself ferdinand wished to accompany valentia on her search for the picturesque but she would not let him so after breakfast he sat himself down in the summerhouse and spread out all round him his nice white paper lit his pipe cut his quills and proceeded to the evolution of a masterpiece valentia tied the red strings of her sunbonnet under her chin selected a sketchbook and sallied forth  at luncheon they met and valentia told of a little bit of canal with an old windmill on one side of it which she had decided to paint while ferdinand announced that he had settled on the names of his dramatis personæ in the afternoon they returned to their work and at night tired with the previous days travelling went to bed soon after dinner  so passed the second day and the third day and the fourth till the end of the week came and they had worked diligently they were both of them rather surprised at the ease with which they became accustomed to their life  how absurd all this fuss is said valentia that people make about the differences of the sexes i am sure it is only habit  we have ourselves to prove that there is nothing in it he replied you know it is an interesting experiment that we are making  she had not looked at it in that light before  perhaps it is we may be the forerunners of a new era  the edisons of a new communion  i shall write and tell monsieur rollo all about it  in the course of the letter she said       sex is a morbid instinct out here in the calmness of the canal      and the broad meadows it never enters ones head i do not think      of ferdinand as a man  she looked up at him as she wrote the words he was reading a book and she saw him in profile with the head bent down through the leaves the sun lit up his face with a soft light that was almost green and it occurred to her that it would be interesting to paint him       i do not think of ferdinand as a man to me he is a companion he      has a wider experience than a woman and he talks of different      things otherwise i see no difference on his part the idea of my      sex never occurs to him and far from being annoyed as an ordinary      woman might be i am proud of it it shows me that when i chose a      companion i chose well to him i am not a woman i am a man  and she finished with a repetition of ferdinands remark  we are the edisons of a new communion  when valentia began to paint her companions portrait they were naturally much more together and they never grew tired of sitting in the pleasant garden under the trees while she worked at her canvas and green shadows fell on the profile of ferdinand white they talked of many things after a while they became less reserved about their private concerns valentia told ferdinand about her home in ohio and about her people and ferdinand spoke of the country parsonage in which he had spent his childhood and the public school and lastly of oxford and the strange happy days when he had learnt to read plato and walter pater  at last valentia threw aside her brushes and leant back with a sigh  it is finished  ferdinand rose and stretched himself and went to look at his portrait he stood before it for a while and then he placed his hand on valentias shoulder  you are a genius miss stewart  she looked up at him  ah mr white i was inspired by you it is more your work than mine   iv  in the evening they went out for a stroll they wandered through the silent street in the darkness they lost the quaintness of the red brick houses contrasting with the bright yellow of the paving but it was even quieter than by day the street was very broad and it wound about from east to west and from west to east and at last it took them to the tiny harbour two fishing smacks were basking on the water moored to the side and the zuyder zee was covered with the innumerable reflections of the stars on one of the boats a man was sitting at the prow fishing and now and then through the darkness one saw the red glow of his pipe by his side huddled up on a sail lay a sleeping boy the other boat seemed deserted ferdinand and valentia stood for a long time watching the fisher and he was so still that they wondered whether he too were sleeping they looked across the sea and in the distance saw the dim lights of marken the island of fishers they wandered on again through the street and now the lights in the windows were extinguished one by one and sleep came over the town and the quietness was even greater than before they walked on and their footsteps made no sound they felt themselves alone in the dead city and they did not speak  at length they came to a canal gliding towards the sea they followed it inland and here the darkness was equal to the silence great trees that had been planted when william of orange was king in england threw their shade over the water shutting out the stars they wandered along on the soft earth they could not hear themselves walkand they did not speak  they came to a bridge over the canal and stood on it looking at the water and the trees above them and the water and the trees below themand they did not speak  then out of the darkness came another darkness and gradually loomed forth the heaviness of a barge noiselessly it glided down the stream very slowly at the end of it a boy stood at the tiller steering and it passed beneath them and beyond till it lost itself in the night and again they were alone  they stood side by side leaning against the parapet looking down at the water and from the water rose up love and love fluttered down from the trees and love was borne along upon the night air ferdinand did not know what was happening to him he felt valentia by his side and he drew closer to her till her dress touched his legs and the silk of her sleeve rubbed against his arm it was so dark that he could not see her face he wondered of what she was thinking she made a little movement and to him came a faint wave of the scent she wore presently two forms passed by on the bank and they saw a lover with his arm round a girls waist and then they too were hidden in the darkness ferdinand trembled as he spoke  only love is waking  and we she said  andyou  he wondered why she said nothing did she understand he put his hand on her arm  valentia  he had never called her by her christian name before she turned her face towards him  what do you mean  oh valentia i love you i cant help it  a sob burst from her  didnt you understand he said all those hours that i sat for you while you painted and these long nights in which we wandered by the water  i thought you were my friend  i thought so too when i sat before you and watched you paint and looked at your beautiful hair and your eyes i thought i was your friend and i looked at the lines of your body beneath your dress and when it pleased me to carry your easel and walk with you i thought it was friendship only tonight i know i am in love oh valentia i am so glad  she could not keep back her tears her bosom heaved and she wept  you are a woman he said did you not see  i am so sorry she said her voice all broken i thought we were such good friends i was so happy and now you have spoilt it all  valentia i love you  i thought our friendship was so good and pure and i felt so strong in it it seemed to me so beautiful  did you think i was less a man than the fisherman you see walking beneath the trees at night  it is all over now she sighed  what do you mean  i cant stay here with you alone  youre not going away  before there was no harm in our being together at the hotel but now  oh valentia dont leave me i canti cant live without you  she heard the unhappiness in his voice she turned to him again and laid her two hands on his shoulders  why cant you forget it all and let us be good friends again forget that you are a man a woman can remain with a man for ever and always be content to walk and read and talk with him and never think of anything else can you forget it ferdinand you will make me so happy  he did not answer and for a long time they stood on the bridge in silence at last he sigheda heartbroken sigh  perhaps youre right it may be better to pretend that we are friends if you like we will forget all this  her heart was too full she could not answer but she held out her hands to him he took them in his own and bending down kissed them  then they walked home side by side without speaking   v  next morning valentia received m rollos answer to her letter he apologised for his delay in answering       you are a philosopher he saidshe could see the little      snigger with which he had written the wordsyou are a      philosopher and i was afraid lest my reply should disturb the      course of your reflections on friendship i confess that i did not      entirely understand your letter but i gathered that the sentiments      were correct and it gave me great pleasure to know that your      experiment has had such excellent results i gather that you have      not yet discovered that there is more than a verbal connection      between friendship and love  the reference is to the french equivalents of those states of mind       but to speak seriously dear child you are young and beautiful      now but not so very many years shall pass before your lovely skin      becomes coarse and muddy and your teeth yellow and the wrinkles      appear about your mouth and eyes you have not so very many years      before you in which to collect sensations and the recollection of      ones loves is perhaps the greatest pleasure left to ones old      age to be virtuous my dear is admirable but there are so many      interpretations of virtue for myself i can say that i have never      regretted the temptations to which i succumbed but often the      temptations i have resisted therefore love love love and      remember that if love at sixty in a man is sometimes pathetic in a      woman at forty it is always ridiculous therefore take your youth      in both hands and say to yourself life is short but let me live      before i die  she did not show the letter to ferdinand                                       next day it rained valentia retired to a room at the top of the house and began to paint but the incessant patter on the roof got on her nerves the painting bored her and she threw aside the brushes in disgust she came downstairs and found ferdinand in the diningroom standing at the window looking at the rain it came down in one continual steady pour and the water ran off the raised brickwork of the middle of the street to the gutters by the side running along in a swift and murky rivulet the red brick of the opposite house looked cold and cheerless in the wet he did not turn or speak to her as she came in she remarked that it did not look like leaving off he made no answer she drew a chair to the second window and tried to read but she could not understand what she was reading and she looked out at the pouring rain and the red brick house opposite she wondered why he had not answered  the innkeeper brought them their luncheon ferdinand took no notice of the preparations  will you come to luncheon mr white she said to him it is quite ready  i beg your pardon he said gravely as he took his seat  he looked at her quickly and then immediately dropping his eyes began eating she wished he would not look so sad she was very sorry for him  she made an observation and he appeared to rouse himself he replied and they began talking very calmly and coldly as if they had not known one another five minutes they talked of art with the biggest of as and they compared dutch painting with italian they spoke of rembrandt and his life  rembrandt had passion said ferdinand bitterly and therefore he was unhappy it is only the sexless passionless creature the block of ice that can be happy in this world  she blushed and did not answer  the afternoon valentia spent in her room pretending to write letters and she wondered whether ferdinand was wishing her downstairs  at dinner they sought refuge in abstractions they talked of dykes and windmills and cigars the history of holland and its constitution the constitution of the united states and the edifying spectacle of the politics of that blessed country they talked of political economy and pessimism and cattle rearing the state of agriculture in england the foreign policy of the day anarchism the president of the french republic they would have talked of bimetallism if they could people hearing them would have thought them very learned and extraordinarily staid  at last they separated and as she undressed valentia told herself that ferdinand had kept his promise everything was just as it had been before and the only change was that he used her christian name and she rather liked him to call her valentia  but next day ferdinand did not seem able to command himself when valentia addressed him he answered in monosyllables with eyes averted but when she had her back turned she felt that he was looking at her after breakfast she went away painting haystacks and was late for luncheon  she apologised  it is of no consequence he said keeping his eyes on the ground and those were the only words he spoke to her during the remainder of the day once when he was looking at her surreptitiously and she suddenly turned round their eyes met and for a moment he gazed straight at her then walked away she wished he would not look so sad as she was going to bed she held out her hand to him to say goodnight and she added  i dont want to make you unhappy mr white im very sorry  its not your fault he said you cant help it if youre a stock and a stone  he went away without taking the proffered hand valentia cried that night  in the morning she found a note outside her door       pardon me if i was rude but i was not master of myself i am      going to volendam i hate monnickendam   vi  ferdinand arrived at volendam it was a fishing village only three miles across country from monnickendam but the route by steam tram and canal was so circuitous that with luggage it took one two hours to get from place to place he had walked over there with valentia and it had almost tempted them to desert monnickendam ferdinand took a room at the hotel and walked out trying to distract himself the village consisted of a couple of score of houses built round a semicircular dyke against the sea and in the semicircle lay the fleet of fishing boats men and women were sitting at their doors mending nets he looked at the fishermen great sturdy fellows with rough weatherbeaten faces huge earrings dangling from their ears he took note of their quaint costumeblack stockings and breeches the latter more baggy than a turks and the crushed strawberry of their high jackets cut close to the body he remembered how he had looked at them with valentia and the group of boys and men that she had sketched he remembered how they walked along peeping into the houses where everything was spick and span as only a dutch cottage can be with old delft plates hanging on the walls and pots and pans of polished brass and he looked over the sea to the island of marken with its masts crowded together like a forest without leaf or branch coming to the end of the little town he saw the church of monnickendam the red steeple halfhidden by the trees he wondered where valentia waswhat she was doing  but he turned back resolutely and going to his room opened his books and began reading he rubbed his eyes and frowned in order to fix his attention but the book said nothing but valentia at last he threw it aside and took his plato and his dictionary commencing to translate a difficult passage word for word but whenever he looked up a word he could only see valentia and he could not make head or tail of the greek he threw it aside also and set out walking he walked as hard as he couldaway from monnickendam  the second day was not quite so difficult and he read till his mind was dazed and then he wrote letters home and told them he was enjoying himself tremendously and he walked till he felt his legs dropping off  next morning it occurred to him that valentia might have written trembling with excitement he watched the postman coming down the streetbut he had no letter for ferdinand there would be no more post that day  but the next day ferdinand felt sure there would be a letter for him the postman passed by the hotel door without stopping ferdinand thought he should go mad all day he walked up and down his room thinking only of valentia why did she not write  the night fell and he could see from his window the moon shining over the clump of trees about monnickendam churchhe could stand it no longer he put on his hat and walked across country the three miles were endless the church and the trees seemed to grow no nearer and at last when he thought himself close he found he had a bay to walk round and it appeared further away than ever  he came to the mouth of the canal along which he and valentia had so often walked he looked about but he could see no one his heart beat as he approached the little bridge but valentia was not there of course she would not come out alone he ran to the hotel and asked for her they told him she was not in he walked through the town not a soul was to be seen he came to the church he walked round and thenright at the edge of the treeshe saw a figure sitting on a bench                                       she was dressed in the same flowered dress which she had worn when he likened her to a dresden shepherdess she was looking towards volendam  he went up to her silently she sprang up with a little shriek  ferdinand  oh valentia i cannot help it i could not remain away any longer i could do nothing but think of you all day all night if you knew how i loved you oh valentia have pity on me i cannot be your friend its all nonsense about friendship i hate it i can only love you i love you with all my heart and soul valentia  she was frightened  oh how can you stand there so coldly and watch my agony dont you see how can you be so cold  i am not cold ferdinand she said trembling do you think i have been happy while you were away  valentia  i thought of you too ferdinand all day all night and i longed for you to come back i did not know till you went thati loved you  oh valentia  he took her in his arms and pressed her passionately to him  no for gods sake  she tore herself away but again he took her in his arms and this time he kissed her on the mouth she tried to turn her face away  i shall kill myself ferdinand  what do you mean  in those long hours that i sat here looking towards you i felt i loved youi loved you as passionately as you said you loved me but if you came back andanything happenedi swore that i would throw myself in the canal  he looked at her  i could notlive afterwards she said hoarsely it would be too horrible i should beoh i cant think of it  he took her in his arms again and kissed her  have mercy on me she cried  you love me valentia  oh it is nothing to you afterwards you will be just the same as before why cannot men love peacefully like women i should be so happy to remain always as we are now and never change i tell you i shall kill myself  i will do as you do valentia  you  if anything happens valentia he said gravely we will go down to the canal together  she was horrified at the idea but it fascinated her  i should like to die in your arms she said  for the second time he bent down and took her hands and kissed them then she went alone into the silent church and prayed   vii  they went home ferdinand was so pleased to be at the hotel again near her his bed seemed so comfortable he was so happy and he slept dreaming of valentia  the following night they went for their walk arm in arm and they came to the canal from the bridge they looked at the water it was very dark they could not hear it flow no stars were reflected in it and the trees by its side made the depth seem endless valentia shuddered perhaps in a little while their bodies would be lying deep down in the water and they would be in one anothers arms and they would never be separated oh what a price it was to pay she looked tearfully at ferdinand but he was looking down at the darkness beneath them and he was intensely grave  and they wandered there by day and looked at the black reflection of the trees and in the heat it seemed so cool and restful  they abandoned their work what did pictures and books matter now they sauntered about the meadows along shady roads they watched the black and white cows sleepily browsing sometimes coming to the waters edge to drink and looking at themselves amazed they saw the hugelimbed milkmaids come along with their little stools and their pails deftly tying the cows hind legs that it might not kick and the steaming milk frothed into the pails and was poured into huge barrels and as each cow was freed she shook herself a little and recommenced to browse  and they loved their life as they had never loved it before  one evening they went again to the canal and looked at the water but they seemed to have lost their emotions before it they were no longer afraid ferdinand sat on the parapet and valentia leaned against him he bent his head so that his face might touch her hair she looked at him and smiled and she almost lifted her lips he kissed them  do you love me ferdinand  he gave the answer without words  their faces were touching now and he was holding her hands they were both very happy  you know ferdinand she whispered we are very foolish  i dont care  monsieur rollo said that folly was the chief attribute of man  what did he say of love  i forget  then after a pause he whispered in her ear  i love you  and she held up her lips to him again  after all she said were only human beings we cant help it i think  she hesitated what she was going to say had something of the anticlimax in it  i thinkit would be very silly ifif we threw ourselves in the horrid canal  valentia do you mean  she smiled charmingly as she answered  what you will ferdinand  again he took both her hands and bending down kissed them but this time she lifted him up to her and kissed him on the lips   viii  one night after dinner i told this story to my aunt  but why on earth didnt they get married she asked when i had finished  good heavens i cried it never occurred to me  well i think they ought she said  oh i have no doubt they did i expect they got on their bikes and rode off to the consulate at amsterdam there and then im sure it would have been his first thought  of course some girls are very queer said my aunt     faith   i  the moon shone fitfully through the clouds on to the weary face of brother jasper kneeling in his cell his hands were fervently clasped uplifted to the crucifix that hung on the bare wall and he was praying praying as he had never prayed before all through the hours of night while the monks were sleeping brother jasper had been supplicating his god for light but in his soul remained a darkness deeper than that of the blackest night at last he heard the tinkling of the bell that called the monks to prayers and with a groan lifted himself up he opened his cell door and went out into the cloister with downturned face he walked along till he came to the chapel and reaching his seat sank again heavily to his knees  the lights in the chapel were few enough for san lucido was nearly the poorest monastery in spain a few dim candles on the altar threw long shadows on the pavement and in the choir their yellow glare lit up uncouthly the pale faces of the monks when brother jasper stood up the taper at his back cast an unnatural light over him like a halo making his great black eyes shine strangely from their deep sockets while below them the dark lines and the black shadow of his shaven chin gave him an unearthly weirdness he looked like a living corpse standing in the brown franciscan cowla dead monk doomed for some sin to wander through the earth till the day the day of judgment and in the agony of that weary face one could almost read the terrors of eternal death  the monks recited the service with their heavy drone and the sound of the harsh mens voices ascended to the vault dragging along the roof but jasper heard not what they said he rose and knelt as they did he uttered the words he walked out of the church in his turn and through the cloister to his cell and he threw himself on the floor and beat his head against the hard stones weeping passionately and he cried out  what shall i do what shall i do  for brother jasper did not believe   ii  two days before the monk standing amid the stunted shrubs on the hill of san lucido had looked out on the arid plain before him it was all brown and grey the desolate ground strewn with huge granite boulders treeless and for the wretched sheep who fed there thin and scanty grass the shepherd in his tattered cloak sat on a rock moodily paying no heed to his flock dully looking at the desert round him brother jasper gazed at the scene as he had gazed for three years since he had come to san lucido filled with faith and great love for god in those days he had thought nothing of the cold waste as his eyes rested on it the light of heaven shed a wonderful glow on the scene and when at sunset the heavy clouds were piled one above the other like huge fantastic mountains turned into golden fire when he looked beyond them and saw the whole sky burning red and then a mass of yellow and gold he could imagine that god was sitting there on his throne of fire with christ on his right hand in robes of light and glory and mary the queen on his left and above them the dove with its outstretched wings the white bird hovering in a sea of light and it seemed so near brother jasper felt in him almost the power to go there to climb up those massy clouds of fire and attain the great joythe joy of the presence of god  the sun sank slowly the red darkened into purple and over the whole sky came a colour of indescribable softness while in the east very far away shone out the star and soon the soft faint blue sank before the night and the stars in the sky were countless but still in the west there was the shadow of the sun a misty gleam over the rocky plain the heavens seemed so great so high that brother jasper sank down in his insignificance yet he remembered the glories of the sunset and felt that he was almost at the feet of god  but now when he looked at the clouds and the sun behind them he saw no god he saw the desert plain the barrenness of the earth the overladen wretched donkey staggering under his pannier and the broadhatted peasant urging him on he looked at the sunset and tried to imagine the trinity that sat there but he saw nothing and he asked himself  why should there be a god  he started up with a cry of terror with his hands clasped to his head  my god what have i done  he sank to his knees humiliating himself what vengeance would fall on him he prayed passionately but again the thought came he shrieked with terror he invoked the mother of god to help him  why should there be a god  he could not help it the thought would not leave him that all this might exist without how did he know how could anyone be sure quite sure but he drove the thoughts away and in his cell imposed upon himself a penance it was satan that stood whispering in his ear satan lying in wait for his soul let him deny god and he would be damned for ever  he prayed with all his strength he argued with himself he cried out i believe i believe but in his soul was the doubt the terror made him tremble like a leaf in the wind and great drops of sweat stood on his forehead and ran heavily down his cheek he beat his head against the wall and in his agony swayed from side to side but he could not believe   iii  and for two days he had endured the torments of hellfire battling against himselfin vain the heavy lines beneath his eyes grew blacker than the night his lips were pale with agony and fasting he had not dared to speak to anyone he could not tell them and in him was the impulse to shout out why should there be now he could bear it no longer in the morning he went to the priors cell and falling on his knees buried his face in the old mans lap  oh father help me help me  the prior was old and wasted for fifty years he had lived in the desert castilian plain in the little monasteryall through his youth and manhood through his age and now he was older than anyone at san lucido white haired and wrinkled but with a clear rosy skin like a boys his soft blue eyes had shone with light but a cataract had developed and gradually his sight had left him till he could barely see the crucifix in his cell and the fingers of his hand at last he could only see the light but the prior did not lose the beautiful serenity of his life he was always happy and kind and feeling that his death could not now be very distant he was filled with a heavenly joy that he would shortly see the face of god long hours he sat in his chair looking at the light with an indescribably charming smile hovering on his lips  his voice broken by sobs brother jasper told his story while the prior gently stroked the young mans hands and face  oh father make me believe  one cannot force ones faith my dear it comes it goes and no man knows the wherefore faith does not come from reasoning it comes from god pray for it and rest in peace  i want to believe so earnestly i am so unhappy  you are not the only one who has been tried my son others have doubted before you and have been saved  but if i died tonighti should die in mortal sin  believe that god counts the attempt as worthy as the achievement  oh pray for me father pray for me i cannot stand alone give me your strength  go in peace my son i will pray for you and god will give you strength  jasper went away  day followed day and week followed week the spring came and the summer but there was no difference in the rocky desert of san lucido there were no trees to bud and burst into leaf no flowers to bloom and fade biting winds gave way to fiery heat the sun beat down on the plain and the sky was cloudless cloudlesseven the nights were so hot that the monks in their cells gasped for breath and brother jasper brooded over the faith that was dead and in his selftorment his cheeks became so hollow that the bones of his face seemed about to pierce the skin the flesh shrunk from his hands and the fingers became long and thin like the claws of a vulture he used to spend long hours with the prior while the old man talked gently trying to bring faith to the poor monk that his soul might rest but one day in the midst of the speaking the prior stopped and jasper saw an expression of pain pass over his face  what is it  nothing my son he replied smiling we enter the world with pain and with pain we leave it  what do you mean are you ill father father  the prior opened his mouth and showed a great sloughing sore he put jaspers fingers to his neck and made him feel the enlarged and hardened glands  what is it you must see a surgeon  no surgeon can help me brother jasper it is cancer the crabit is the way that god has sent to call me to himself  then the prior began to suffer the agonies of the disease terrible pains shot through his head and neck he could not swallow it was a slow starvation the torment kept him awake through night after night and only occasionally his very exhaustion gave him a little relief so that he slept thinner and thinner he became and his whole mouth was turned into a putrid horrible sore but yet he never murmured brother jasper knelt by his bed looking at him pitifully  how can you suffer it all what have you done that god should give you this was it not enough that you were blind  ah i saw such beautiful things after i became blindall heaven appeared before me  it is unjustunjust  my son all is just  you drive me mad do you still believe in the merciful goodness of god  a beautiful smile broke through the pain on the old mans face  i still believe in the merciful goodness of god  there was a silence brother jasper buried his face in his hands and thought brokenheartedly of his own affliction how happy he could be if he had that faith but the silence in the room was more than the silence of people who did not speak jasper looked up suddenly  the prior was dead  then the monk bent over the body and looked at the face into the opaque white eyes there was no difference the flesh was warmeverything was just the same and yet  and yet he was dead what did they mean by saying the soul had fled what had happened jasper understood nothing of it and afterwards before the funeral when he looked at the corpse again and it was cold and a horrible blackness stained the lips he felt sure  brother jasper could not believe in the resurrection of the dead and the soulwhat did they mean by the soul   iv  then a great loneliness came over him the hours of his life seemed endless and there was no one in whom he could find comfort the prior had given him a ray of hope but he was gone and now jasper was alone in the world and beyond oh how could one be certain it was awful this perpetual doubt recurring more strongly than ever men had believed so long think of all the beautiful churches that had been made in the honour of god and the pictures think of the works that had been done for his love the martyrs who had cheerfully given up their lives it seemed impossible that it should be all for nothing butbut jasper could not believe and he cried out to the soul of the prior resting in heaven to come to him and help him surely if he really were alive again he would not let the poor monk whom he had loved linger in this terrible uncertainty jasper redoubled his prayers for hours he remained on his knees imploring god to send him light but no light came and exhausted brother jasper sank into despair  the new prior was a tall gaunt man with a great hooked nose and heavy lips his keen dark eyes shone fiercely from beneath his shaggy brows he was still young full of passionate energy and with large gesture and loud metallic voice he loved to speak of hellfire and the pains of the damned hating the jews and heretics with a bitter personal hatred  to the stake he used to say the earth must be purged of this vermin and it must be purged by fire  he exacted the most absolute obedience from the monks and pitiless was the punishment for any infringement of his rules brother jasper feared the man with an almost unearthly terror when he felt resting upon him the piercing black eyes he trembled in his seat and a cold sweat broke out over him if the prior knewthe thought almost made him faint and yet the fear of it seemed to drag him on like a bird before a serpent he was fascinated sometimes he felt sudden impulses to tell himbut the vengeful eyes terrified him  one day he was in the cloister looking out at the little green plot in the middle where the monks were buried wondering confusedly whether all that prayer and effort had been offered up to empty images of whatof the fear of man turning round he started back and his heart beat for the prior was standing close by looking at him with those horrible eyes brother jasper trembled so that he could scarcely stand he looked down  brother jasper the priors voice seemed sterner than it had ever been before brother jasper  father  what have you to tell me  jasper looked up at him the blood fled from his lips  nothing my father the prior looked at him firmly and jasper thought he read the inmost secrets of his heart  speak brother jasper said the prior and his voice was loud and menacing  then hurriedly stuttering in his anxiety the monk confessed his misery a horror came over the priors face as he listened and jasper became so terrified that he could hardly speak but the prior seemed to recover himself and interrupted him with a furious burst of anger  you look over the plain and do not see god and for that you doubt him miserable fool  oh father have mercy on me i have tried so hard i want to believe but i cannot  i cannot i cannot what is that have men believed for a thousand yearshas god performed miracle after miracleand a miserable monk dares to deny him  i cannot believe  you must his voice was so loud that it rang through the cloisters he seized jaspers clasped hands raised in supplication before him and forced him to his knees i tell you you shall believe  quivering with wrath he looked at the prostrate form at his feet moved by convulsive weeping he raised his hand as if to strike the monk but with difficulty contained himself  then the prior bade brother jasper go to the church and wait the monks were gathered together all astonished they stood in their usual places but jasper remained in the middle away from them with head cast down the prior called out to them in his loud clear voice  pray my brethren pray for the soul of brother jasper which lies in peril of eternal death  the monks looked at him suddenly and brother jaspers head sank lower so that no one could see his face the prior sank to his knees and prayed with savage fervour afterwards the monks went their ways but when jasper passed them they looked down and when by chance he addressed a novice the youth hurried from him without answering they looked upon him as accursed the prior spoke no more but often jasper felt his stern gaze resting on him and a shiver would pass through him in the services jasper stood apart from the rest like an unclean thing he did not join in their prayers listening confusedly to their monotonous droning and when a pause came and he felt all eyes turn to him he put his hands to his face to hide himself  pray my brethren pray for the soul of brother jasper which lies in peril of eternal death   v  in his cell the monk would for days sit apathetically looking at the stone wall in front of him sore of heart the hours would pass by unnoticed and only the ringing of the chapel bell awoke him from his stupor and sometimes he would be seized with sudden passion and throwing himself on his knees pour forth a stream of eager vehement prayer he remembered the penances which the seraphic father imposed on his fleshbut he always had faith and jasper would scourge himself till he felt sick and faint and hoping to gain his soul by mortification of the body refuse the bread and water which was thrust into his cell and for a long while eat nothing he became so weak and ill that he could hardly stand and still no help came  then he took it into his head that god would pity him and send a miracle to drive away his uncertainty was he not anxious to believe if only he couldso anxious god would not send a miracle to a poor monk yet miracles had been performed for smaller folk than hefor shepherds and tenders of swine but christ himself had said that miracles only came by faith butjasper remembered that often the profligate and the harlot had been brought to repentance by a vision even the holy francis had been but a loose gallant till christ appeared to him yet if christ had appeared it showedah but how could one be sure it might only have been a dream let a vision appear to him and he would believe oh how enchanted he would be to believe to rest in peace to know that before him however hard the life were eternal joy and the kingdom of heaven  but brother jasper put his hands to his head cruelly aching he could not understand he could not knowthe doubt weighed on his brain like a sheet of lead he felt inclined to tear his skull apart to relieve the insupportable pressure how endless life was why could it not finish quickly and let him know but supposing there really was a god he would exact terrible vengeance what punishment would he inflict on the monk who had denied himwho had betrayed him like a second judas then a fantastic idea came into his crazy brain was it satan that put all these doubts into his head if it were satan must exist and if he did god existed too he knew that the devil stood ready to appear to all who called if christ would not appear let satan show himself it meant hellfire but if god were the monk felt he was damned alreadyfor the truth he would give his soul  the idea sent a coldness through him so that he shivered but it possessed him and he exulted thinking that he would know at last he rose from his bedit was the dead of night and all the monks were sleepingand trembling with cold began to draw with chalk strange figures on the floor he had seen them long ago in an old book of magic and their fantastic shapes fascinating him had remained in his memory  in the centre of the strange confusion of triangles he stood and uttered in a husky voice the invocation he murmured uncouth words in an unknown language and bade satan stand forth he expected a thunderclap the flashing of lightning sulphurous fumesbut the night remained silent and quiet not a sound broke the stillness of the monastery the snow outside fell steadily   vi  next day the prior sent for him and repeated his solemn question  brother jasper what have you to say to me  and absolutely despairing jasper answered  nothing nothing nothing  then the prior strode up to him in wrath and smote him on the cheek  it is a devil within youa devil of obstinacy and pride you shall believe  he cried to monks to lay hold of him they dragged him roughly to the cloisters and stripping him of his cowl tied it round his waist and bound him by the hands to a pillar and the prior ordered them to give jasper eightandthirty strokes with the scourgeone less than christthat the devil might be driven out the scourge was heavy and knotted and the porter bared his arms that he might strike the better the monks stood round in eager expectation the scourge whizzed through the air and came down with a thud on jaspers bare shoulders a tremor passed through him but he did not speak again it came down and as the porter raised it for the third time the monks saw great bleeding weals on brother jaspers back then as the scourge fell heavily a terrible groan burst from him the porter swung his arm and this time a shriek broke from the wretched monk the blows came pitilessly and jasper lost all courage he shrieked with agony imploring them to stop  but ferociously the prior cried  did christ bear in silence forty stripes save one and do you cry out like a woman before you have had ten  the porter went on and the priors words were interrupted by piercing shrieks  it is the devil crying out within him said the monks gloating on the bleeding back and the face of agony  heavy drops of sweat ran off the porters face and his arm began to tire but he seized the handle with both hands and swung the knotted ropes with all his strength  jasper fainted  see said the prior see the fate of him who has not faith in god  the cords with which he was tied prevented the monk from falling and stroke after stroke fell on his back till the number was completed then they loosed him from the column and he sank senseless and bleeding to the ground they left him brother jasper regained slowly his senses lying out in the cold cloister with the snow on the graves in the middle his hands and feet were stiff and blue he shivered and drew himself together for warmth then a groan burst from him feeling the wounds of his back painfully he lifted himself up and crawled to the chapel door he pushed it open and staggering forward fell on his face looking towards the altar he remained there long dazed and weary pulling his cowl close round him to keep out the bitter cold the pain of his body almost relieved the pain of his mind he wished dumbly that he could lie there and die and be finished with it all he did not know the time he wondered whether any service would soon bring the monks to disturb him he took sad pleasure in the solitude and in the great church the solitude seemed more intense oh and he hated the monks it was cruel cruel cruel he put his hands to his face and sobbed bitterly  but suddenly a warmth fell on him he looked up and the glow seemed to come from the crucified christ in the great painted window by the altar the monk started up with a cry and looked eagerly the bell began to ring the green colour of death was becoming richer the glass gained the fulness of real flesh now it was a soft round whiteness and brother jasper cried out in ecstasy  it is christ  then the glow deepened and from the crucified one was shed a wonderful light like the rising of the sun behind the mountains and the church was filled with its rich effulgence  oh god it is moving  the christ seemed to look at brother jasper and bow his head  two by two the monks walked silently in and brother jasper lifted up his arms crying  behold a miracle christ has appeared to me  a murmur of astonishment broke from them and they looked at jasper gazing in ecstasy at the painted window  christ has appeared to me i am saved  then the prior came up to him and took him in his arms and kissed him  my son praise be to god you are whole again  but jasper pushed him aside so that he might not be robbed of the sight which filled him with rapture the monks crowded round questioning but he took no notice of them he stood with outstretched arms looking eagerly his face lighted up with joy the monks began to kiss his cowl and his feet and they touched his hands  i am saved i am saved  and the prior cried to them  praise god my brethren praise god for we have saved the soul of brother jasper from eternal death  but when the service was over and the monks had filed out brother jasper came to himselfand he saw that the light had gone from the window the christ was cold and dead a thing of the handicraft of man what was it that had happened had a miracle occurred the question flashing through his mind made him cry out he had prayed for a miracle and a miracle had been shown himthe poor monk of san lucidoand now he doubted the miracle oh god must have ordained the damnation of his soul to give him so little strengthperhaps he had sent the miracle that he might have no answer at the day of judgment  faith thou hadst noti showed myself to thee in flesh and blood i moved my head thou didst not believe thine own eyes    vii  next day at vespers jasper anxiously fixed his gaze on the stainedglass windowagain a glow came from it and as he moved the head seemed to incline itself but now jasper saw it was only the sun shining through the windowonly the sun then the heaviness descended into the deepest parts of jaspers soul and he despaired  the night came and jasper returned to his cell he leant against the door looking out through the little window but he could only see the darkness and he likened it to the darkness in his own soul  what shall i do he groaned  he could not tell the monks that it was not a miracle he had seen he could not tell them that he had lost faith again and then his thoughts wandering to the future  must i remain all my life in this cold monastery if there is no god if i have but one life what is the good of it why cannot i enjoy my short existence as other men am not i youngam not i of the same flesh and blood as they  vague recollections came to him of those new lands beyond the ocean those lands of sunshine and sweet odours his mind became filled with a vision of broad rivers running slow and cool overshadowed by strange luxuriant trees and all was a wealth of beautiful colour  oh i cannot stay he cried i cannot stay  and it was a land of lovingkindness a land of softeyed gentle women  i cannot stay i cannot stay  the desire to go forth was overwhelming the walls of his cell seemed drawing together to crush him he must be free oh for life life he started up not seeing the madness of his adventure he did not think of the snowcovered desert the night the distance from a town he saw before him the glorious sunshine of a new life and he went towards it like a blind man with outstretched arms  everyone was asleep in the monastery he crept out of his cell and silently opened the door of the porters lodge the porter was sleeping heavily jasper took the keys and unlocked the gate he was free he took no notice of the keen wind blowing across the desert he hurried down the hill slipping on the frozen snow suddenly he stopped he had caught sight of the great crucifix which stood by the wayside at the bottom of the hill then the madness of it all occurred to him wherever he went he would find the crucifix even beyond the sea and nowhere would he be able to forget his god always the recollection always the doubt and he would never have rest till he was in the grave he went close to it and looked up it was one of those strange spanish crucifixesa wooden image with long thin arms and legs and protruding ribs with real hair hanging over the shoulders and a true crown of thorns placed on the head the ends of the tattered cloth fastened about the loins fluttered in the wind in the night the lifelikeness was almost ghastly it might have been a real man that hung there with great nails through his feet the common people paid superstitious reverence to it and jasper had often heard the peasants tell of the consolations they had received  why should not he too receive consolation was his soul not as worth saving as theirs a last spark of hope filled him and he lifted himself up on tiptoe to touch the feet  oh christ come down to me tell me whether thou art indeed a god oh christ help me  but the words lost themselves in the wind and night then a great rage seized him that he alone should receive no comfort he clenched his fists and beat passionately against the cross  oh you are a cruel god i hate you i hate you  if he could have reached it he would have torn the image down and beat it as he had been beaten in his impotent rage he shrieked out curses upon ithe blasphemed  but his strength spent itself and he sank to the foot of the cross bursting into tears in his selfpity he thought his heart was broken lifting himself to his knees he clasped the wood with his hands and looked up for the last time at the dead face of christ  it was the end a strange peace came over him as the anguish of his mind fell away before the cold his hands and his feet were senseless he felt his heart turning to iceand he felt nothing  in a little while the snow began to fall lightly covering his shoulders brother jasper knew the secret of death at last   viii  the day broke slowly dim and grey there was a hurried knocking at the porters door a peasant with white and startled face said that a brother was kneeling at the great cross in the snow and would not speak  the monks sallied forth anxiously and came to the silent figure clasping the cross in supplication  brother jasper  the prior touched his hands they were as cold as ice  he is dead  the villagers crowded round in astonishment whispering to one another the monks tried to move him but his hands frozen to the cross prevented them  he died in prayerhe was a saint  but a woman with a paralysed arm came near him and in her curiosity touched his ragged cowl suddenly she felt a warmth pass through her and the dead arm began to tingle she cried out in astonishment and as the people turned to look she moved the fingers  he has restored my arm she said look  a miracle they cried out a miracle he is a saint  the news spread like fire and soon they brought a youth lying on a bed wasted by a mysterious illness so thin that the bones protruding had formed angry sores on the skin they touched him with the hem of the monks garment and immediately he roused himself  i am whole give me to eat  a murmur of wonder passed through the crowd the monks sank to their knees and prayed                                       at last they lifted up the dead monk and bore him to the church but people all round the country crowded to see him the sick and the paralysed came from afar and often went away sound as when they were born  they buried him at last but still to his tomb they came from all sides rich and poor and the wretched monk who had not faith to cure the disease of his own mind cured the diseases of those who had faith in him     the choice of amyntas   i  often enough the lover of cities tires of their unceasing noise the din of the traffic buzzes perpetually in his ears and even in the silences of night he hears the footfalls on the pavement the dull stamping of horses the screeching of wheels the fog chokes up the lungs so that he cannot breathe he sees no longer any charms in the tall chimneys of the factory and the heavy smoke winding in curves against the leaden sky then he flies to countries where the greenness is like cold spring water where he can hear the budding of the trees and the stars tell him fantastic things the silence is full of mysterious new emotions and so the writer sometimes grows weary to death of the life he sees and he presses his hands before his eyes that he may hide from him the endless failure in the endless quest then he too sets sail for bohemia by the sea and the other countries of the frankly impossible where men are always brave and women ever beautiful there the tears of the morning are followed by laughter at night trials are easily surmountable virtue is always triumphant there no illusions are lost and lovers live ever happily in a world without end   ii  once upon a time very long ago when the world was younger and more wicked than it is now there lived in the west country a man called peter the schoolmaster but he was very different from ordinary schoolmasters for he was a scholar and a man of letters he was consequently very poor all his life he had pored over old books and musty parchments but from them he had acquired little wisdom for one bright springtime he fell in love with a farmers daughterand married her the farmers daughter was a buxom wench and to the schoolmasters delighthe had a careless charming soulshe presented him in course of time with a round dozen of sturdy children peter compared himself with priam of troy with jacob with king solomon of israel and with queen anne of england peter wrote a latin ode to each offspring in turn which he recited to the assembled multitude when the midwife put into his arms for the first time the new arrival there was great rejoicing over the birth of every one of the twelve children but as was most proper in a land of primogeniture the chiefest joy was the firstborn and to him peter wrote an horatian ode which was two stanzas longer than the longest horace ever wrote peter vowed that no infant had ever been given the worlds greeting in so magnificent a manner certainly he had never himself surpassed that first essay as he told the parson to write twelve odes on paternity twelve greetings to the newborn soul is a severe tax even on the most fertile imagination  but the object of all this eloquence was the cause of the first and only quarrel between the gentle schoolmaster and his spouse for the learned man had dug out of one of his old books the name of amyntas and amyntas he vowed should be the name of his son so with that trisyllable he finished every stanza of his ode his wife threw her head back and putting her hands on her hips stood with arms akimbo she said that never in all her born days had she heard of anyone being called by such a name which was more fit for a heathen idol than for a plain straightforward member of the church by law established in its stead she suggested that the boy be called peter after his father or john after hers the gentle schoolmaster was in the habit of giving way to his wife in all things and it may be surmised that this was the reason why the pair had lived in happiest concord but now he was firm he said it was impossible to call the boy by any other name than amyntas  the name is necessary to the metre of my ode he said it is its very life how can i finish my stanzas with petrus or johannes i would sooner die  his wife did not think the ode mattered a rap peter turned pale with emotion he could scarcely express himself  every mother in england has had a child children have been born since the days of cain and abel thicker than the sands of the sea what is a child but an odemy ode a child is but an ordinary product of man and woman but a poem is a divine product of the muses my poem is sacred it shall not be defiled by any petrus or johannes let my house fall about my head let my household gods be scattered abroad let the fates with their serpent hair render desolate my hearth but do not rob me of my verse i would sooner lose the light of my eyes than the light of my verse ah let me wander through the land like homer sightless homeless let me beg my bread from door to door and i will sing the ode the ode to amyntas   he said all this with so much feeling that mrs peter began to cry and with her apron up to her eyes said that she didnt want him to go blind but even if he did he should never want for she would work herself to the bone to keep him peter waved his hand in tragic deprecation no he would beg his bread from door to door he would sleep by the roadside in the bitter winter night  now the parson was present during this colloquy and he proposed an arrangement and finally it was settled that peter should have his way in this case but that mrs peter should have the naming of all subsequent additions to the family so of the rest one was called peter and one was called john and there was a mary and a jane and a sarah but the eldest according to agreement was christened amyntas although to her dying day notwithstanding the parsons assurances the mother was convinced in her heart of hearts that the name was papistical and not fit for a plain straightforward member of the church by law established   iii  now it was as clear as a pikestaff to peter the schoolmaster that a person called amyntas could not go through the world like any other ordinary being so he devoted particular care to his sons education teaching him which was the way of schoolmasters then as now very many entirely useless things and nothing that could be to him of the slightest service in earning his bread and butter  but twelve children cannot be brought up on limpid air and there were often difficulties when new boots were wanted sometimes indeed there were difficulties when bread and meat and puddings were wanted such things did not affect peter he felt not the pangs of hunger as he read his books and he vastly preferred to use the white and the yolk of an egg in the restoration of an old leather binding than to have it solemnly cooked and thrust into his belly what cared he for the rantings of his wife and the crying of the children when he could wander in imagination on mount ida clad only in his beauty and the three goddesses came to him promising wonderful things he was a tall lean man with thin white hair and blue eyes but his wrinkled cheeks were still rosy incessant snufftaking had given a special character to his nose and sometimes taking upon him the spirit of catullus he wrote verses to lesbia or beneath the breastplate of marcus aurelius he felt his heart beat bravely as he marched against the barbarians he was launcelot and he made charming speeches to guinevere as he kissed her long white hand  but now and then the clamour of the outer world became too strong and he had to face seriously the question of his childrens appetite  it was on one of these occasions that the schoolmaster called his son to his study and said to him  amyntas you are now eighteen years of age i have taught you all i know and you have profited by my teaching you know greek and latin as well as i do myself you are well acquainted with horace and tully you have read homer and aristotle and added to this you can read the bible in the original hebrew that is to say you have all knowledge at your fingers ends and you are prepared to go forth and conquer the world your mother will make a bundle of your clothes i will give you my blessing and a guinea and you can start tomorrow  then he returned to his study of an oration of isocrates amyntas was thunderstruck  but father where am i to go  the schoolmaster raised his head in surprise looking at his son over the top of his spectacles  my son he said with a wave of the arm my son you have the world before youis that not enough  yes father said amyntas who thought it was a great deal too much but what am i to do i cant get very far on a guinea  amyntas answered peter rising from his chair with great dignity have you profited so ill by the examples of antiquity which you have had placed before you from your earliest years do you not know that riches consist in an equal mind and happiness in golden mediocrity did the wise odysseus quail before the unknown because he had only a guinea in his pocket shame on the heart that doubts leave me my son and make ready  amyntas very crestfallen left the room and went to his mother to acquaint her with the occurrence she was occupied in the performance of the familys toilet  well my boy she said as she scrubbed the face of the last but one its about time that you set about doing something to earn your living i must say now if instead of learning all this popish stuff about greek and latin and lord knows what youd learnt to milk a cow or groom a horse youd be as right as a trivet now well ill put you up a few things in a bundle as your father says and you can start early tomorrow morning now then darling she added turning to her benjamin come and have your face washed theres a dear   iv  amyntas scratched his head and presently an inspiration came to him  i will go to the parson he said  the parson had been hunting and he was sitting in his study in a great oak chair drinking a bottle of port his huge body and his red face expressed the very completest satisfaction with the world in general one felt that he would go to bed that night with the cheerful happiness of duty performed and snore stentoriously for twelve hours he was troubled by no qualms of conscience the thirtynine articles caused him never a doubt and it had never occurred to him to concern himself with the condition of the working classes he lived in a golden age when the pauper was allowed to drink himself to death as well as the nobleman and no clergymans wife read tracts by his bedside  amyntas told his news  well my boyhe never spoke but he shoutedso youre going away well god bless you  amyntas looked at him expectantly and the parson wondering what he expected came to the conclusion that it was a glass of port for at that moment he was able to imagine nothing that man could desire more he smiled benignly upon amyntas and poured him out a glass  drink that my boy keep it in your memory its the finest thing in the world its port thats made england what she is  amyntas drank the port but his face did not express due satisfaction  damn the boy said the parson ports wasted on him  then thinking again what amyntas might want he rose slowly from his chair stretching his legs im not so young as i used to be i get stiff after a days hunting he walked round his room looking at his bookshelves at last he picked out a book and blew the dust off the edges heres a bible for you amyntas the two finest things in the world are port and the bible  amyntas thanked him but without great enthusiasm another idea struck the parson and he shouted out another question  have you any money  amyntas told him of the guinea  damn your father whats the good of a guinea he went to a drawer and pulled out a handful of goldthe tithes had been paid a couple of days before here are ten a man can go to hell on ten guineas  thank you very much sir said amyntas pocketing the money but i dont think i want to go quite so far just yet  then where the devil do you want to go shouted the parson  thats just what i came to ask you about  why didnt you say so at once i thought you wanted a glass of port id sooner give ten men advice than one man port he went to the door and called out jane bring me another bottle he drank the bottle in silence while amyntas stood before him resting now upon one leg now upon another turning his cap round and round in his hands at last the parson spoke  you may look upon a bottle of port in two ways he said you may take it as a symbol of a happy life or as a method of thought there are four glasses in a bottle the first glass is full of expectation you enter life with mingled feelings you cannot tell whether it will be good or no the second glass has the full savour of the grape it is youth with vineleaves in its hair and the passion of young blood the third glass is void of emotion it is grave and calm like middle age drink it slowly you are in full possession of yourself and it will not come again the fourth glass has the sadness of death and the bitter sweetness of retrospect  he paused a moment for amyntas to weigh his words  but a bottle of port is a better method of thought than any taught by the schoolmen the first glass is that of contemplationi think of your case the second is apprehensionan idea occurs to me the third is elaborationi examine the idea and weigh the pros and cons the fourth is realisationand here i give you the completed scheme look at this letter it is from my old friend van tiefel a dutch merchant who lives at cadiz asking for an english clerk one of his ships is sailing from plymouth next sunday and it will put in at cadiz on the way to turkey  amyntas thought the project could have been formed without a bottle of port but he was too discreet to say so and heartily thanked the parson the good man lived in a time when teetotalism had not ruined the clergys nerves and sanctity was not considered incompatible with a good digestion and common humanity   v  amyntas spent the evening bidding tender farewells to a round dozen of village beauties whose susceptible hearts had not been proof against the brown eyes and the dimples of the youth there was indeed woe when he spread the news of his departure and all those maiden eyes ran streams of salt tears as he bade them one by one goodbye and though he squeezed their hands and kissed their lips vowing them one and all the most unalterable fidelity they were perfectly inconsolable it is an interesting fact to notice that the instincts of the true hero are invariably polygamic  it was lucky for amyntas that the parson had given him money for his father though he gave him a copy of the ethics of aristotle and his blessing forgot the guinea and amyntas was too fearful of another reproach to remind him of it  amyntas was up with the lark and having eaten as largely as he could in his uncertainty of the future made ready to start the schoolmaster had retired to his study to conceal his agitation he was sitting like agamemnon with a dishcloth over his head because he felt his face unable to express his emotion but the boys mother stood at the cottage door wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron surrounded by her weeping children she threw her arms about her sons neck giving him a loud kiss on either cheek and amyntas went the round of his brothers and sisters kissing them and bidding them not forget him to console them he promised to bring back green parrots and golden bracelets and embroidered satins from japan as he passed down the village street he shook hands with the good folk standing at their doors to bid him goodbye and slowly made his way into the open country   vi  the way of the hero is often very hard and amyntas felt as if he would choke as he walked slowly along he looked back at every step wondering when he would see the old home again he loitered through the lanes taking a last farewell of the nooks and corners where he had sat on summer evenings with some fair female friend and he heartily wished that his name were james or john and that he were an ordinary farmers son who could earn his living without going out for it into the wide wide world so may dick whittington have meditated as he trudged the london road but amyntas had no talismanic cat and no church bells rang him inspiring messages besides dick whittington had in him from his birth the makings of a lord mayorhe had the golden mediocrity which is the surest harbinger of success but to amyntas the world seemed cold and grey notwithstanding the sunshine of the morning and the bare branches of the oak trees were gnarled and twisted like the fingers of evil fate at last he came to the top of a little hill whence one had the last view of the village he looked at the redroofed church nestling among the trees and in front of the inn he could still see the sign of the turks head a sob burst from him he felt he could not leave it all it would not be so bad if he could see it once more he might go back at night and wander through the streets he could stand outside his own home door and look up at his fathers light perhaps seeing his fathers shadow bent over his books he cared nothing that his name was amyntas he would go to the neighbouring farmers and offer his services as labourerthe village barber wanted an apprentice ah he would ten times sooner be a village hampden or a songless milton than any hero he hid his face in the grass and cried as if his heart were breaking  presently he cried himself to sleep and when he awoke the sun was high in the heavens and he had the very healthiest of appetites he repaired to a neighbouring inn and ordered bread and cheese and a pot of beer oh mighty is the power of beer why am i not a poet that i may stand with my hair dishevelled one hand in my manly bosom and the other outstretched with splendid gesture to proclaim the excellent beauty of beer avaunt ye sallow teetotalers ye manufacturers of lemonade ye cocoadrinkers you only see the sodden wretch who hangs about the publichouse door in filthy slums blinking his eyes in the glaze of electric light shivering in his scanty ragsand you do not know the squalor and the terrible despair of hunger which he strives to forget but above all you do not know the glorious ale of the country the golden brown ale with its scent of green hops its broad scents of the country its foam is whiter than snow and lighter than the almond blossoms and it is cold cold amyntas drank his beer and he sighed with great content the sun shone hopefully upon him now and the birds twittered all sorts of inspiring things still in his mouth was the delightful bitterness of the hops he threw off care as a mantle and he stepped forward with joyful heart spain was a wild country the land of the grave hidalgo and the haughty princess he felt in his strong right arm the power to fight and kill and conquer blackbearded villains should capture beautiful maidens on purpose for him to rescue van tiefel was but a steppingstone he was not made for the desk of a countinghouse no heights dazzled him he saw himself being made a peer or a prince being granted wide domains by a grateful monarch he was not too low to aspire to the hand of a kings fair daughter he was a hero every inch a hero great is the power of beer avaunt ye sallow teetotalers ye manufacturers of lemonade ye cocoadrinkers  at night he slept on a haystack with the blue sky starbespangled for his only roof and dreamed luxurious dreams the milestones flew past one another as he strode along two days three days four days on the fifth as he reached the summit of a little hill he saw a great expanse of light shining in the distance and the sea glittered before him like the bellies of innumerable little silver fishes he went down the hill up another and thence saw plymouth at his feet the masts of the ships were like a great forest of leafless trees he thanked his stars for ones imagination is all very well for a while and the thought of ones future prowess certainly shortens the time but roads are hard and hills are steep ones legs grow tired and ones feet grow sore and things are not so rosecoloured at the end of a journey as at the beginning amyntas could not for ever keep thinking of beautiful princesses and feats of arms and after the second day he had exhausted every possible adventure he had raised himself to the highest possible altitudes and his aristocratic amours had had the most successful outcome  he sat down by a little stream that ran along the roadside and bathed his aching feet he washed his face and hands starting down the hill he made his way towards the town and entered the gate   vii   amyntas discovered captain thorman of the good ship calderon drinking rum punch in a tavern parlour in those days all men were heroic he gave him the parsons letter  well my boy said the captain after twice reading it i dont mind taking you to cadiz i daresay youll be able to make yourself useful on board what can you do  please sir answered amyntas with some pride i know latin and greek i am well acquainted with horace and tully i have read homer and aristotle and added to this i can read the bible in the original hebrew  the captain looked at him  if you talk to me like that he said ill shy my glass at your head he shook with rage and the redness of his nose emitted lightning sparks of indignation when he had recovered his speech he asked amyntas why he stood there like an owl and told him to get on board  amyntas bowed himself meekly out of the room went down to the harbour and bearing in mind what he had heard of the extreme wickedness of plymouth held tightly on to his money he had been especially warned against the women who lure the unwary seaman into dark dens and rob him of money and life but no adventure befell him thanks chiefly to the swiftness of his heels for when a young lady of prepossessing appearance came up to him and inquired after his health affectionately putting her arm in his he promptly took to his legs and fled  amyntas was in lucks way for it was not often that an english ship carried merchandise to spain as a rule the two powers were at daggers drawn but at this period they had just ceased cutting one anothers throats and sinking one anothers ships joining together in fraternal alliance to cut the throats and sink the ships of a rival power which till the treaty had been a faithful and brotherly ally to his majesty of great britain and which our gracious king had abandoned with unusual dexterity just as it was preparing to abandon him  as amyntas stood on the deck of the ship and saw the grey cliffs of albion disappear into the sea he felt the emotions and sentiments which inevitably come to the patriotic englishman who leaves his native shore his melancholy became almost unbearable as the ship getting out into the open sea began to roll and he drank to the dregs the bitter cup of leaving england home beautyand terra firma he went below and climbing painfully into his hammock gave himself over to misery and maldemer  two days he spent of lamentation and gnashing of teeth wishing he had never been born and not till the third day did he come on deck he was pale and weak feeling ever so unheroic but the sky was blue and the ship bounded over the blue waves as if it were alive amyntas sniffed in the salt air and the rushing wind and felt alive again the days went by the sun became hotter and the sky a different deeper blue while its vault spread itself over the sea in a vaster expanse they came in sight of land again they coasted down a gloomy country with lofty cliffs going sheer into the sea they passed magnificent galleons laden with gold from america and one morning when amyntas came on deck at break of day he saw before him the white walls and red roofs of a southern city the ship slowly entered the harbour of cadiz   viii  at last amyntas went on shore immediately his spirit was so airy within him that he felt he could hover along in the air like mr langs spiritualistic butlers and it was only by a serious effort of will that he walked soberly down the streets like normal persons his soul shouted with the joy of living he took in long breaths as if to breathe in the novelty and the strangeness he walked along too excited to look at things only conscious of a glare of light and colour a thronging crowd life and joyousness on every side he walked through street after street almost sobbing with delight through narrow alleys down which the sun never fell into big squares hot as ovens and dazzling up hill and down hill past ragged slums past the splendid palaces of the rich past shops past taverns finally he came on to the shore again and threw himself down in the shade of a little grove of orange trees to sleep  when he awoke he saw standing motionless by his side a spanish lady he looked at her silently noting her olive skin her dark and lustrous eyes the luxuriance of her hair if she had only possessed a tambourine she would have been the complete realisation of his dreams he smiled  why do you lie here alone sweet youth she asked with an answering smile and who and what are you  i lay down here to rest lady he replied i have this day arrived from england and i am going to van tiefel the merchant  ah a young english merchant they are all very rich are you  yes lady frankly answered amyntas pulling out his handful of gold  the spaniard smiled on him and then sighed deeply  why do you sigh he asked  ah you english merchants are so fascinating she took his hand and pressed it amyntas was not a forward youth but he had some experience of english maidens and felt that there was but one appropriate rejoinder he kissed her  she sighed again as she relinquished herself to his embrace  you english merchants are so fascinatingand so rich  amyntas thought the spanish lady was sent him by the gods for she took him to her house and gave him melons and grapes which being young and of lusty appetite he devoured with great content she gave him winestrong red fiery wine that burned his throatand she gave him sundry other very delightful things which it does not seem necessary to relate  when amyntas on his departure shyly offered some remuneration for his entertainment it was with an exquisite southern grace that she relieved him of his ten golden guineas and he almost felt she was doing him a favour as she carelessly rattled the coins into a silken purse and if he was a little dismayed to see his treasure go so speedily he was far too delicateminded to betray any emotion but he resolved to lose no time in finding out the offices of the wealthy tiefel   ix   but van tiefel was no longer in cadiz on the outbreak of the treaty the spanish authorities had given the dutch merchant fourandtwenty hours to leave the country and had seized his property making him understand that it was only by a signal mercy that his life was spared amyntas rushed down to the harbour in dismay the good ship calderon had already sailed amyntas cursed his luck he cursed himself above all he cursed the lovely spanish lady whose charms had caused him to delay his search for van tiefel till the ship had gone on its eastward journey  after looking long and wistfully at the sea he turned back into the town and rambled melancholy through the streets wondering what would become of him soon the pangs of hunger assailed him and he knew the discomfort of a healthy english appetite he hadnt a single farthing and even scotch poets when they come to london to set the thames on fire are wont to put a halfcrown piece in their pockets amyntas meditated upon the folly of extravagance the indiscretion of youth and the wickedness of woman he tightened his belt and walked on at last feeling weary and faint with hunger he lay down on the steps of a church and there spent the night when he awoke next morning he soon remembered that he had slept supperless he was ravenous suddenly his eye looking across the square caught sight of a book shop and it occurred to him that he might turn to account the books which his father and the parson had given him he blessed their foresight the bible fetched nothing but the aristotle brought him enough to keep him from starvation for a week having satisfied his hunger he set about trying to find work he went to booksellers and told them his accomplishments but no one could see any use in a knowledge of greek latin and the hebrew bible he applied at shops growing bolder with necessity he went into merchants offices and to great mens porters but all with great civility sent him about his business and poor amyntas was no more able to get work than nowadays a professional tramp or the secretary of a trades union  four days he went on trying here and trying there eating figs and melons and bread drinking water sleeping beneath archways or on the steps of churches and he dreamed of the home of roast beef and ale which he had left behind him every day he became more disheartened but at last he rose up against fate he cursed it byronically every mans hand was against him his hand should be against every man he would be a brigand he shook off his feet the dust of cadiz and boldly went into the country to find a band of free companions he stopped herdsmen and pedlars and asked them where brigands were they pointed to the mountains and to the mountains he turned his face he would join the band provoke a quarrel with the chief kill him and be made chief in his stead then he would scour the country in a velvet mask and a peaked hat with a feather in it carrying fire and desolation everywhere a price would be set on his head but he would snap his fingers in the face of the prime minister he would rule his followers with an iron hand but now he was in the midst of the mountains and there were not the smallest signs of lawless folk not even a gibbet with a skeleton hanging in chains to show where lawless folk had been he sought high and low but he never saw a living soul besides a few shepherds clothed in skins it was most disheartening once he saw two men crouching behind a rock and approached them but as soon as they saw him they ran away and although he followed them shouting that they were not to be afraid since he wanted to be a brigand too they paid no attention but only ran the faster and at last he had to give up the chase for want of breath one cant be a robber chief all by oneself nor is it given to everyone in this world to be a brigand amyntas found that even heroes have their limitations   x  one day making his way along a rocky path he found a swineherd guarding his flock  goodmorrow said the man and asked amyntas whither he was bound  god knows answered amyntas i am wandering at chance and know not where i go  well youth stay the night with me and tomorrow you can set out again in return for your company i will give you food and shelter  amyntas accepted gratefully for he had been feeding on herbs for a week and the prospect of goats milk cheese and black bread was like the feast of trimalchion when amyntas had said his story the herdsman told him that there was a rich man in the neighbouring village who wanted a swineherd and in the morning showed him the way to the rich mans house  i will come a little way with you lest you take the wrong path   they walked along the rocky track and presently the way divided  this path to the right leads to the village said the man  and this one to the left swineherd  the swineherd crossed himself  ah that is the path of evil fortune it leads to the accursed cavern  a cold wind blew across their faces  come away said the herdsman shuddering do you not feel on your face the cold breath of it  tell me what it is said amyntas he stood looking at the opening between the low trees  it is a lake of deatha lake beneath the mountainand the roof of it is held up by marble columns which were never wrought by the hand of man come away do you not feel on your face the cold breath of it  he dragged amyntas away along the path that led to the village and when the way was clear before him turned back returning to his swine but amyntas ran after him  tell me what they say of the accursed cavern  they say many things some say it is a treasurehouse of the moors where they have left their wealth some say it is an entrance to the enchanted land some say it is an entrance to hell itself venturous men have gone in to discover the terrible secret but none has returned to tell it  amyntas wandered slowly towards the village were his dreams to end in the herding of swine what was this cavern of which the herdsman spoke he felt a strange impulse to go back and look at the dark opening between the little trees from which blew the cold wind but perhaps the rich man had a beauteous daughter history is full of the social successes of swine herds amyntas felt a strange thrill as the dark lake came before his mind he almost heard the lapping of the water kings daughters had often looked upon lowly swineherds and raised them to golden thrones but he could not help going to look again at the dark opening between the little trees he walked back and again the cold breath blew against his face he felt in it the icy coldness of the water it drew him in he separated the little trees on either side he walked on as if a hidden power urged him and now the path became less clear trees and bushes grew in the way and hindered him brambles and long creeping plants twisted about his legs and pulled him back but the wind with its coldness of the black water drew him on the birds of the air were hushed and not one of the thousand insects of the wood uttered a note great trees above him hid the light the silence was ghastly he felt as if he were the only person in the world  suddenly he gave a cry he had come to the end of the forest and before him he saw the opening of the cavern he looked in he saw black stagnant water motionless and heavy and as far as the eye could reach sombre pillars covered with green moist slime they stood half out of the water supporting the roof and from the roof oozed moisture which fell in heavy drops in heavy drops continually at the entrance was a little skiff with a paddle in it  amyntas stood at the edge dared he venture what could there be behind that darkness the darkness was blacker than the blackest night he stepped into the boat should he go with beating heart he untied the rope he hardly dared to breathe he pushed away   xi  he looked to the right and left paddling slowly on all sides he saw the slimy columns stretching regularly into the darkness the light of the open day grew dimmer as he advanced the air became colder he looked eagerly around him paddling slowly already he half repented the attempt the boat went along easily and the black and heavy water hardly splashed as he drew his paddle through it still nothing could be seen but the even ranks of pillars then all at once the night grew blacker and again the cold wind arose and blew in his face everywhere was the ghastly silence and the darkness a shiver went through him he could not bear it in an agony of terror he turned his paddle to go back whatever might be the secret of the cavern or the reward of the adventure he dared go no further he must get back quickly to the open air and the blue sky he drew his paddle through the water the boat did not turn he gave a cry he pulled with all his might the boat only lurched a little and went on its way he set his teeth and backed his life depended upon it the boat swam on a cold sweat broke out over him he put all his strength in his stroke the boat went on into the darkness swiftly and silently he paused a little to regain force he stifled a sob of horror and despair then he made a last effort the skiff whirled round into another avenue of columns and the paddle shivered into atoms against a pillar the little light of the cavern entrance was lost and there was utter darkness  amyntas cowered down in the boat he gave up hope of life and lay there for long hours awaiting his end the water carried the skiff along swiftly silently the darkness was so heavy that the columns were invisible heavy drops fell into the water from the roof how long would it last would the boat go on till he died and then speed on for ever he thought of the others who had gone into the cavern were there other boats hurrying eternally along the heavy waters bearing cold skeletons  he covered his face with his hands and moaned but he started up the night seemed less black he looked intently yes he could distinguish the outlines of the pillars dimly so dimly that he thought he saw them only in imagination and soon he could see distinctly their massive shapes against the surrounding darkness and as gradually the night thinned away into dim twilight he saw that the columns were different from those at the entrance of the cavern they were no longer covered with weed and slime the marble was polished and smooth and the water beneath him appeared less black the skiff went on so swiftly that the perpetual sequence of the pillars tired his eyes but their grim severity gave way to round columns less forbidding and more graceful as the light grew clearer there was almost a tinge of blue in the water amyntas was filled with wonder for the columns became lighter and more decorated surmounted by capitals adorned with strange sculptures some were green and some were red others were yellow or glistening white they mirrored themselves in the sapphire water gradually the roof raised itself and the columns became more slender from them sprang lofty arches gorgeously ornamented and all was gold and silver and rich colour the water turned to a dazzling translucent blue so that amyntas could see hundreds of feet down to the bottom and the bottom was covered with golden sand and the light grew and grew till it was more brilliant than the clearest day gradually the skiff slowed down and it swam leisurely towards the lights source threading its way beneath the horseshoe arches among the columns and these gathered themselves into two lines to form a huge avenue surmounted by a vast span and at the end in a splendour of light amyntas saw a wondrous palace with steps leading down to the water the boat glided towards it and at the steps ceased moving   xii  at the same moment the silver doors of the palace were opened and from them issued black slaves magnificently apparelled they descended to amyntas and with courteous gestures assisted him out of the boat then two other slaves even more splendidly attired than their fellows came down and led amyntas slowly and with great state into the court of the palace at the end of which was a great chamber into this they motioned the youth to enter they made him the lowest possible bows and retired letting a curtain fall over the doorway but immediately the curtain was raised and other slaves came in bearing gorgeous robes and all kinds of necessaries for the toilet with much ceremony they proceeded to bathe and scent the fortunate creature they polished and dyed his finger nails they pencilled his eyebrows and faintly darkened his long eyelashes they put precious balsam on his hair then they clothed him in silken robes glittering with gold and silver they put the daintiest red morocco shoes on his feet a jewelled chain about his neck rings on his fingers and in his turban a rich diamond finally they placed before him a gigantic mirror and left him  everything had been conducted in complete silence and amyntas throughout had preserved the most intense gravity but when he was alone he gave a little silent laugh of delight it was obvious that at last he was to be rewarded according to his deserts he looked at the rings on his fingers resisting a desire to put one or two of them in his pocket in case of a future rainy day then catching sight of himself in the mirror he started was that really himself how very delightful he made sure that no one could see and then began to make bows to himself in the mirror he walked up and down the room observing the stateliness of his gesture he waved his hands in a lordly and patronising fashion he turned himself round to look at his back he was very annoyed that he could not see his profile he came to the conclusion that he looked every inch a kings son and his inner consciousness told him that consequently the kings daughter could not be far off  but he would explore his palace he girded his sword about him it was a scimitar of beautiful workmanship and the scabbard was incrusted with precious stones from the court he passed into many wonderful rooms one leading out of the other there were rich carpets on the marble floors and fountains played softly in the centre the walls were inlaid with rare marbles but he never saw a living soul  in the last hour amyntas had become fully alive to his great importance and carried himself accordingly he took long dignified steps and held one hand on the jewelled hilt of his sword with his elbows stuck out at right angles to his body his head was thrown back proudly and his nostrils dilated with appropriate scorn at last he came to a door closed by a curtain he raised it but he started back and was so surprised that he found no words to express his emotions four maidens were sitting in the room more beautiful than he had thought possible in his most extravagant dreams the gods had evidently not intended amyntas for single blessedness the young persons appeared not to have noticed him two of them were seated on rugs playing a languid game of chess the others were lazily smoking cigarettes  mate murmured one of the players  oh sighed the other yawning another game finished that makes five million and twentythree games against your five million and seventynine  they all yawned  but amyntas felt he must give notice of his presence and suddenly remembering an expression he had learnt on board ship he put on a most ferocious look and cried out  shiver my timbers  the maidens turned towards him with a little cry but they quickly recovered themselves and one of them came towards him  you speak like a kings son oh youth she said  there was a moments hesitation and the lady with a smile added oh ardently expected one you are a compendium of the seven excellences  then they all began to pay him compliments each one capping the others remark  you have a face like the full moon oh youth your eyes are the eyes of the gazelle your walk is like the gait of the mountain partridge your chin is as an apple your cheeks are pomegranates  but amyntas interrupted them  for gods sake madam he said let us have no palavering and if you love me give me some victuals  immediately female slaves came in with salvers laden with choice food and the four maidens plied amyntas with delicacies at the end of the repast they sprinkled him with rosewater and the eldest of them put a crown of roses on his hair amyntas thought that after all life was not an empty dream   xiii  and now may it please you oh stranger to hear our story  know then that our father was a moor one of the wealthiest of his people and he dwelt with his fellows in spain honoured and beloved now when allahwhose name be exalteddecreed that our nation should be driven from the country he unwilling to leave the land of his birth built him with the aid of magic arts this palace here he brought us his four daughters and all his riches he peopled it with slaves and filled it with all necessary things and here we lived in peace and prosperity for many years but at last a great misfortune befell us for our father who was a very learned man and accustomed to busy himself with many abstruse matters one day got lost in a metaphysical speculationand has never been found again  here she stopped and they all sighed deeply  we searched high and low but in vain and he has not been found to this day so we took his will and having broken the seal read the followingmy daughters i know by my wisdom that the time will come when i shall be lost to you then you will live alone enjoying the riches and the pleasures which i have put at your disposal but i foresee that at the end of many years a youth will find his way to this your palace and though my magic arts have been able to build this paradise for your habitation though they have endowed you with perpetual youth and loveliness and greatest deed of all have banished hence the dark shadow of death yet have they not the power to make four maidens live in happiness and unity with but one man therefore i have given unto each of you certain gifts and of you four the youth shall choose one to be his love and to him and her shall belong this palace and all my riches and all my power while the remaining three shall leave everything here to these two and depart hence for ever  now gentle youth it is with you to choose which of us four you will have remain  amyntas looked at the four damsels standing before him and his heart beat violently  i resumed the speakeri am the eldest of the four and it is my right to speak first  she stepped forward and stood alone in front of amyntas her aspect was most queenly her features beautiful and clear her eyes proud and fiery and masses of raven hair contrasted with the red flaming of her garments with an imperious gesture she flung back her hair and spoke thus  know youth that the gift which my father gave me was the gift of war and i have the power to make a great warrior of him whose love i am i will make you a king youth you shall command mighty armies and you shall lead them to battle on a prancing horse your enemies shall quail before your face and at last you shall die no sluggards death but pierced by honourable wounds and the field of battle shall be your deathbed a nation shall mourn your loss and your name shall go down famous to after ages  you are very beautiful said amyntas but i am not so eager for warlike exploits as when i wandered through the green lanes of my native land let me hear the others  a second stepped forward she was clad most gorgeously of all a crown of diamonds was on her head and her robes were of cloth of gold sewn with rubies and emeralds and sapphires  the gift i have to give is wealth richesriches innumerable riches greater than man can dream of do you want to be a king the riches i can give will make you one do you want armies riches can procure them do you want victory riches can buy itall these that my sister offers you can i with my riches give you and more than that for everything in the world can be got with riches and you shall be allpowerful take me to be your love and i will make you the lord of gold  amyntas smiled  you forget lady that i am but twenty  the third stepped forward she was beautiful and pale and thoughtful her hair was yellow like corn when the sun is shining on it and her dress was green like the young grass of the spring she spoke without the animation of the others mournfully rather than proudly and she looked at amyntas with melancholy eyes  i am the lady of art all that is beautiful and good and wise is in my province live with me i will make you a poet and you shall sing beautiful songs you shall be wise and in perfect wisdom oh youth is perfect happiness  the poet has said that wisdom is weariness oh lady said amyntas my father is a poet he has written ten thousand latin hexameters and a large number of greek iambics   then came forward the last as she stood before amyntas a cry burst from him he had never in his life seen anyone so ravishingly beautiful she was looking down and her long eyelashes prevented her eyes from being seen but her lips were like a perfect rose and her skin was like a peach her hair fell to her waist in great masses of curls and their sparkling auburn manyhued and indescribable changed in the sunbeams from richest brown to gold tinged with deep red she wore a simple tunic of thin silk clasped at her waist with a jewelled belt of gold  she stood before amyntas letting him gaze then suddenly she lifted her eyes to his amyntass heart gave a mighty beat against his chest her eyes her eyes were the very lights of love carrying passionate kisses on their beams a sob of ecstasy choked the youth and he felt that he could kneel down and worship before them  slowly her lips broke into a smile and her voice was soft and low  i am the lady of love she said look she raised her arms and the thin loose sleeves falling back displayed their roundness and exquisite shape she lifted her head and amyntas thrilled to cover her neck with kisses at last she loosened her girdle and when the silken tunic fell to her feet she stood before him in perfect loveliness  i cannot give you fame or riches or wisdom i can only give you love love love oh what an eternity of delight shall we enjoy in one anothers arms come my beloved come  yes i come my darling amyntas stepped forward with outstretched arms and took her hands in his i take you for my love i want not wealth nor great renown but only you you will give me lovealluring kisses and we will live in neverending bliss  he drew her to him and with his arms around her pressed back her head and covered her lips with kisses   xiv   and while amyntas lost his soul in the eyes of his beloved the three sisters went sadly away they ascended the stately barge which awaited them and the water bore them down the long avenue of columns into the darkness after a long time they reached the entrance of the cavern and having placed a great stone against it that none might enter more they separated wandering in different directions  the lady of war passed through spain finding none there worthy of her she crossed the mountains and presently she fell in love with a little artillery officer and raised him to dignity and power and together they ran through the lands wasting and burning making women widows and children orphans ruthless unsparing caring for naught but the voluptuousness of blood but she sickened of the man at last and left him then the blood he had spilt rose up against him and he was cast down and died an exile on a lonely isle and now they say she dwells in the palaces of a youth with a withered hand together they rule a mighty empire and their people cry out at the oppression but the ruler heeds nothing but the burning kisses of his love  the lady of riches too passed out of spain but she was not content with one love nor with a hundred she gave her favours to the first comer and everyone was welcome she wandered carelessly through the world but chiefly she loved an island in the north and in its capital she has her palace and the inhabitants of the isle have given themselves over body and soul to her domination they pander and lie and cheat and forswear themselves to gain her smile they will shrink from no base deed no meanness and she too makes women widows and children orphans but her subjects care not they are fat and wellcontent the goddess smiles on them and they are the richest in the world  the lady of art has not found an emperor nor a mighty people to be her lovers she wanders lonely through the world now and then a youthful dreamer sees her in his sleep and devotes his life to her pursuit but the way is hard very hard so he turns aside to worship at the throne of her sister of riches and she repays him for the neglect he has suffered she showers gold upon him and makes him one of her knights but sometimes the youth remains faithful and goes through his life in the endless search and at last when his end has come she comes down to the garret in which he lies cold and dead and stooping down kisses him gentlyand lo he is immortal  but as for amyntas when the sisters had retired he again took his bride in his arms and covered her lips with kisses and she putting her arms round his neck said with a smile  i have waited for you so long my love so long  and here it is fit that we should follow the example of the three sisters and retire also  the moral of this story is that if your godfathers and godmothers at your baptism give you a pretty name you will probably marry the most beautiful woman in the world and live happily ever afterwards and the platitudinous philosopher may marvel at the tremendous effects of the most insignificant causes for if amyntas had been called peter or john as his mother wished william ii might be eating sauerkraut as peacefully as his ancestors the lord mayor of london might not drive about in a gilded carriage and possibly evenmr alfred austin might not be poet laureate     daisy   i  it was sunday morninga damp warm november morning with the sky overhead grey and low miss reed stopped a little to take breath before climbing the hill at the top of which in the middle of the churchyard was blackstable church miss reed panted and the sultriness made her loosen her jacket she stood at the junction of the two roads which led to the church one from the harbour end of the town and the other from the station behind her lay the houses of blackstable the windbeaten houses with slate roofs of the old fishing village and the red brick villas of the seaside resort which blackstable was fast becoming in the harbour were the masts of the ships colliers that brought coal from the north and beyond the grey sea very motionless mingling in the distance with the sky the peal of the church bells ceased and was replaced by a single bell ringing a little hurriedly querulously which denoted that there were only ten minutes before the beginning of the service miss reed walked on she looked curiously at the people who passed her wondering  goodmorning mr golding she said to a fisherman who pounded by her ungainly in his sunday clothes  goodmorning miss reed he replied warm this morning  she wondered whether he knew anything of the subject which made her heart beat with excitement whenever she thought of it and for thinking of it she hadnt slept a wink all night  have you seen mr griffith this morning she asked watching his face  no i saw mrs griffith and george as i was walking up  oh they are coming to church then miss reed cried with the utmost surprise  mr golding looked at her stupidly not understanding her agitation but they had reached the church miss reed stopped in the porch to wipe her boots and pass an arranging hand over her hair then gathering herself together she walked down the aisle to her pew  she arranged the hassock and knelt down clasping her hands and closing her eyes she said the lords prayer and being a religious woman she did not immediately rise but remained a certain time in the same position of worship to cultivate a proper frame of mind her long sallow face upraised her mouth firmly closed and her eyelids quivering a little from the devotional force with which she kept her eyes shut her thin bust very erect was encased in a black jacket as in a coat of steel but when miss reed considered that a due period had elapsed she opened her eyes and as she rose from her knees bent over to a lady sitting just in front of her  have you heard about the griffiths mrs howlett  no what is it answered mrs howlett half turning round intensely curious  miss reed waited a moment to heighten the effect of her statement  daisy griffith has elopedwith an officer from the dépôt at tercanbury  mrs howlett gave a little gasp  you dont say so  its all they could expect whispered miss reed they ought to have known something was the matter when she went into tercanbury three or four times a week  blackstable is six miles from tercanbury which is a cathedral city and has a cavalry dépôt  ive seen her hanging about the barracks with my own eyes said mrs howlett but i never suspected anything  shocking isnt it said miss reed with suppressed delight  but how did you find out asked mrs howlett  ssh whispered miss reedthe widow in her excitement had raised her voice a little and miss reed could never suffer the least irreverence in church she never came back last night and george browning saw them get into the london train at tercanbury  well i never exclaimed mrs howlett  dyou think the griffithsll have the face to come to church  i shouldnt if i was them said miss reed  but at that moment the vestry door was opened and the organ began to play the hymn  ill see you afterwards miss reed whispered hurriedly and rising from their seats both ladies began to sing      o jesu thou art standing        outside the fast closed door     in lowly patience waiting        to pass the threshold oer     we bear the name of christians  miss reed held the book rather close to her face being shortsighted but without even lifting her eyes she had become aware of the entrance of mrs griffith and george she glanced significantly at mrs howlett mr griffith hadnt come although he was churchwarden and mrs howlett gave an answering look which meant that it was then evidently quite true but they both gathered themselves together for the last verse taking breath      o jesus thou art pleading     in accents meek and low  aamen the congregation fell to its knees and the curate rolling his eyes to see who was in church began gabbling the morning prayersdearly beloved brethren    ii   at the sunday dinner the vacant place of daisy griffith stared at them her father sat at the head of the table looking down at his plate in silence every now and then without raising his head he glanced up at the empty space filled with a madness of grief he had gone into tercanbury in the morning inquiring at the houses of all daisys friends imagining that she had spent the night with one of them he could not believe that george brownings story was true he could so easily have been mistaken in the semidarkness of the station and even he had gone to the barrackshis cheeks still burned with the humiliationasking if they knew a daisy griffith  he pushed his plate away with a groan he wished passionately that it were monday so that he could work and the post would surely bring a letter explaining  the vicar asked where you were said mrs griffith  robert the father looked at her with his pained eyes but her eyes were hard and shining her lips almost disappeared in the tight closing of the mouth she was willing to believe the worst he looked at his son he was frowning he looked as coldly angry as the mother he too was willing to believe everything and they neither seemed very sorry perhaps they were even glad  i was the only one who loved her he muttered to himself and pushing back his chair he got up and left the room he almost tottered he had aged twenty years in the night  arent you going to have any pudding asked his wife  he made no answer  he walked out into the courtyard quite aimlessly but the force of habit took him to the workshop where every sunday afternoon he was used to going after dinner to see that everything was in order and today also he opened the window put away a tool which the men had left about examined the saturdays work  mrs griffith and george stiff and ill at ease in his clumsy sunday clothes went on with their dinner  dyou think the vicar knew he asked as soon as the father had closed the door  i dont think hed have asked if he had mrs gray might but hes too simpleunless she put him up to it  i thought i should never get round with the plate said george mr griffith being a carpenter which is respectable and welltodo which is honourable had been made churchwarden and part of his duty was to take round the offertory plate this duty george performed in his fathers occasional absences as when a coffin was very urgently required  i wasnt going to let them get anything out of me said mrs griffith defiantly  all through the service a number of eyes had been fixed on them eager to catch some sign of emotion full of horrible curiosity to know what the griffiths felt and thought but mrs griffith had been inscrutable   iii  next day the griffiths lay in wait for the postman george sat by the parlour window peeping through the muslin curtains  fannings just coming up the street he said at last until the post had come old griffith could not work in the courtyard at the back was heard the sound of hammering  there was a rattat at the door the sound of a letter falling on the mat and fanning the postman passed on george leaned back quickly so that he might not see him mr griffith fetched the letter opened it with trembling hands he gave a little gasp of relief  shes got a situation in london  is that all she says asked mrs griffith give me the letter and she almost tore it from her husbands hand  she read it through and uttered a little ejaculation of contemptalmost of triumph you dont mean to say you believe that she cried  lets look mother said george he read the letter and he too gave a snort of contempt  she says shes got a situation repeated mrs griffith with a sneer at her husband and were not to be angry or anxious and shes quite happyand we can write to charing cross post office i know what sort of a situation shes got  mr griffith looked from his wife to his son  dont you think its true he asked helplessly at the first moment he had put the fullest faith in daisys letter he had been so anxious to believe it but the scorn of the others  theres miss reed coming down the street said george shes looking this way and shes crossing over i believe shes coming in  what does she want asked mrs griffith angrily  there was another knock at the door and through the curtains they saw miss reeds eyes looking towards them trying to pierce the muslin mrs griffith motioned the two men out of the room and hurriedly put antimacassars on the chairs the knock was repeated and mrs griffith catching hold of a duster went to the door  oh miss reed whod have thought of seeing you she cried with surprise  i hope im not disturbing answered miss reed with an acid smile  oh dear no said mrs griffith i was just doing the dusting in the parlour come in wont you the place is all upside down but you wont mind that will you  miss reed sat on the edge of a chair  i thought id just pop in to ask about dear daisy i met fanning as i was coming along and he told me youd had a letter  oh daisy mrs griffith had understood at once why miss reed came but she was rather at a loss for an answer yes we have had a letter from her shes up in london  yes i knew that said miss reed george browning saw them get into the london train you know  mrs griffith saw it was no good fencing but an idea occurred to her  yes of course her father and i are very distressed abouther eloping like that  i can quite understand that said miss reed  but it was on account of his family he didnt want anyone to know about it till he was married  oh said miss reed raising her eyebrows very high  yes said mrs griffith thats what she said in her letter they were married on saturday at a registry office  but mrs griffith im afraid shes been deceiving you its captain hogan and hes a married man  she could have laughed outright at the look of dismay on mrs griffiths face the blow was sudden and notwithstanding all her power of selfcontrol mrs griffith could not help herself but at once she recovered an angry flush appeared on her cheek bones  you dont mean it she cried  im afraid its quite true said miss reed humbly in fact i know it is  then shes a lying deceitful hussy and shes made a fool of all of us i give you my word of honour that she told us she was married ill fetch you the letter mrs griffith rose from her chair but miss reed put out a hand to stop her  oh dont trouble mrs griffith of course i believe you she said and mrs griffith immediately sat down again  but she burst into a storm of abuse of daisy for her deceitfulness and wickedness she vowed she should never forgive her she assured miss reed again and again that she had known nothing about it finally she burst into a perfect torrent of tears miss reed was mildly sympathetic but now she was anxious to get away to impart her news to the rest of blackstable mrs griffith sobbed her visitor out of the front door but when she had closed it dried her tears she went into the parlour and flung open the door that led to the back room griffith was sitting with his face hidden in his hands and every now and then a sob shook his great frame george was very pale biting his nails  you heard what she said cried mrs griffith hes married  she looked at her husband contemptuously its all very well for you to carry on like that now it was you who did it it was all your fault if shed been brought up as i wanted her to be this wouldnt ever have happened  again there was a knock and george going out ushered in mrs gray the vicars wife she rushed in when she heard the sound of voices  oh mrs griffith its dreadful simply dreadful miss reed has just told me all about it what is to be done and whatll the dissenters make of it oh dear its simply dreadful  youve just come in time mrs gray said mrs griffith angrily its not my fault i can tell you that its her father whos brought it about he would have her go into tercanbury to be educated and he would have her take singing lessons and dancing lessons the church school was good enough for george its been daisy this and daisy that all through me and george have been always put by for daisy i didnt want her brought up above her station i can assure you its him who would have her brought up as a lady and see whats come of it and he let her spend any money she liked on her dress it wasnt me that let her go into tercanbury every day in the week if she wanted to i knew she was up to no good there you see what youve brought her to its you whos disgraced us all  she hissed out the words with intense malignity nearly screaming in the bitterness she felt towards the beautiful daughter of better education than herself almost of different station it was all but a triumph for her that this had happened it brought her daughter down she turned the tables and now from the superiority of her virtue she looked down upon her with utter contempt   iv   on the following sunday the people of blackstable enjoyed an emotion as miss reed said  it was worth going to church this morning even for a dissenter  the vicar was preaching and the congregation paid a very languid attention but suddenly a curious little sound went through the churchone of those scarcely perceptible noises which no comparison can explain it was a quick attraction of all eyes an arousing of somnolent intelligences a slight quick drawingin of the breath the listeners had heeded very indifferently mr grays admonitions to brotherly love and charity as matters which did not concern them other than abstractedly but quite suddenly they had realised that he was bringing his discourse round to the subject of daisy griffith and they pricked up both ears they saw it coming directly along the highways of vanity and luxuriousness and everyone became intensely wide awake  and we have in all our minds he said at last the terrible fall which has almost broken the hearts of sorrowing parents and brought bitter griefbitter grief and shame to all of us  he went on hinting at the scandal in the manner of the personal columns in newspapers and drawing a number of obvious morals the griffith family were sitting in their pew well in view of the congregation and losing even the shadow of decency the people turned round and stared at them ghoullike robert griffith sat in the corner with his head bent down huddled up his rough face speaking in all its lines the terrible humiliation his hair was all dishevelled he was not more than fifty and he looked an old man but mrs griffith sat next him very erect not leaning against the back with her head well up her mouth firmly closed and she looked straight in front of her her little eyes sparkling as if she had not an idea that a hundred people were staring at her in the other corner was george very white looking up at the roof in simulation of indifference suddenly a sob came from the griffiths pew and people saw that the father had broken down he seemed to forget where he was and he cried as if indeed his heart were broken the great tears ran down his cheeks in the sight of allthe painful tears of men he had not even the courage to hide his face in his hands still mrs griffith made no motion she never gave a sign that she heard her husbands agony but two little red spots appeared angrily on her cheek bones and perhaps she compressed her lips a little more tightly   v  six months passed one evening when mr griffith was standing at the door after work smoking his pipe the postman handed him a letter he changed colour and his hand shook when he recognised the handwriting he turned quickly into the house  a letter from daisy he said they had not replied to her first letter and since then had heard nothing  give it me said his wife  he drew it quickly towards him with an instinctive gesture of retention  its addressed to me  well then youd better open it  he looked up at his wife he wanted to take the letter away and read it alone but her eyes were upon him compelling him there and then to open it  she wants to come back he said in a broken voice  mrs griffith snatched the letter from him  that means hes left her she said  the letter was all incoherent nearly incomprehensible covered with blots every other word scratched out one could see that the girl was quite distraught and mrs griffiths keen eyes saw the trace of tears on the paper it was a long bitter cry of repentance she begged them to take her back repeating again and again the cry of penitence piteously beseeching them to forgive her  ill go and write to her said mr griffith  write what  whythat its all right and she isnt to worry and we want her back and that ill go up and fetch her  mrs griffith placed herself between him and the door  what dyou mean she cried shes not coming back into my house  mr griffith started back  you dont want to leave her where she is she says shell kill herself  yes i believe that she replied scornfully and then gathering up her anger dyou mean to say you expect me to have her in the house after what shes done i tell you i wont shes never coming in this house again as long as i live im an honest woman and she isnt shes a mrs griffith called her daughter the foulest name that can be applied to her sex  mr griffith stood indecisively before his wife  but think what a state shes in mother she was crying when she wrote the letter  let her cry shell have to cry a lot more before shes done and it serves her right and it serves you right shell have to go through a good deal more than that before god forgives her i can tell you  perhaps shes starving  let her starve for all i care shes dead to us ive told everyone in blackstable that i havent got a daughter now and if she came on her bended knees before me id spit on her  george had come in and listened to the conversation  think what people would say father he said now as it is its jolly awkward i can tell you no one would speak to us if she was back again its not as if people didnt know everyone in blackstable knows what shes been up to  and what about george put in mrs griffith dyou think the polletts would stand it george was engaged to edith pollett  shed be quite capable of breaking it off if daisy came back said george shes said as much  quite right too cried his mother and im not going to be like mrs jay with lottie everyone knows about lotties goingson and you can see how people treat themher and her mother when mrs gray passes them in the street she always goes on the other side no ive always held my head high and im always going to ive never done anything to be ashamed of as far as i know and im not going to begin now everyone knows it was no fault of mine what daisy did and all through ive behaved so that no one should think the worse of me  mr griffith sank helplessly into a chair the old habit of submission asserted itself and his weakness gave way as usual before his wifes strong will he had not the courage to oppose her  what shall i answer then he asked  answer nothing  i must write something shell be waiting for the letter and waiting and waiting  let her wait   vi  a few days later another letter came from daisy asking pitifully why they didnt write begging them again to forgive her and take her back the letter was addressed to mr griffith the girl knew that it was only from him she might expect mercy but he was out when it arrived mrs griffith opened it and passed it on to her son they looked at one another guiltily the same thought had occurred to both and each knew it was in the others mind  i dont think wed better let father see it mrs griffith said a little uncertainly itll do no good and itll only distress him  and its no good making a fuss because we cant have her back  shell never enter this door as long as im in the world i think ill lock it up  id burn it if i was you mother its safer  then every day mrs griffith made a point of going to the door herself for the letters two more came from daisy       i know its not you its mother and george theyve always hated      me oh dont be so cruel father you dont know what ive gone      through ive cried and cried till i thought i should die for      gods sake write to me they might let you write just once im      alone all day day after day and i think i shall go mad you might      take me back im sure ive suffered enough and you wouldnt know      me now im so changed tell mother that if shell only forgive me      ill be quite different ill do the housework and anything she      tells me ill be a servant to you and you can send the girl      away if you knew how i repent do forgive me and have me back oh      i know that no one would speak to me but i dont care about that      if i can only be with you  she doesnt think about us said georgewhat we should do if she was back no one would speak to us either  but the next letter said that she couldnt bear the terrible silence if her father didnt write shed come down to blackstable mrs griffith was furious  id shut the door in her face i wonder how she can dare to come  its jolly awkward said george supposing father found out wed kept back the letters  it was for his own good said mrs griffith angrily im not ashamed of what ive done and ill tell him so to his face if he says anything to me  well it is awkward you know what father is if he saw her  mrs griffith paused a moment  you must go up and see her george  me he cried in astonishment a little in terror  you must go as if you came from your father to say we wont have anything more to do with her and shes not to write   vii  next day george griffith on getting out of the station at victoria jumped on a fulham bus taking his seat with the selfassertiveness of the countryman who intends to show the londoners that hes as good as they are he was in some trepidation and his best clothes he didnt know what to say to daisy and his hands sweated uncomfortably when he knocked at the door he wished she might be outbut that would only be postponing the ordeal  does mrs hogan live here  yes who shall i say  say a gentleman wants to see her  he followed quickly on the landladys heels and passed through the door the woman opened while she was giving the message daisy sprang to her feet with a cry  george  she was very pale her blue eyes dim and lifeless with the lids heavy and red she was in a dressing gown her beautiful hair dishevelled wound loosely into a knot at the back of her head she had not half the beauty of her old self george to affirm the superiority of virtue over vice kept his hat on  she looked at him with frightened eyes then her lips quivered and turning away her head she fell on a chair and burst into tears george looked at her sternly his indignation was greater than ever now that he saw her his old jealousy made him exult at the change in her  shes got nothing much to boast about now he said to himself noting how ill she looked  oh george she began sobbing but he interrupted her  ive come from father he said and we dont want to have anything more to do with you and youre not to write  oh she looked at him now with her eyes suddenly quite dry they seemed to burn her in their sockets did he send you here to tell me that  yes and youre not to come down  she put her hand to her forehead looking vacantly before her  but what am i to do i havent got any money ive pawned everything  george looked at her silently but he was horribly curious  why did he leave you he said  she made no answer she looked before her as if she were going out of her mind  has he left you any money asked george  then she started up her cheeks flaming red  i wouldnt touch a halfpenny of his id rather starve she screamed  george shrugged his shoulders  well you understand he said  oh how can you its all you and mother youve always hated me but ill pay you out by god ill pay you out i know what you are all of youyou and mother and all the blackstable people youre a set of damned hypocrites  look here daisy im not going to stand here and hear you talk like that of me and mother he replied with dignity and as for the blackstable people youre not fit toto associate with them and i can see where you learnt your language  daisy burst into hysterical laughter george became more angryvirtuously indignant  oh you can laugh as much as you like i know your repentance is a lot of damned humbug youve always been a conceited little beast and youve been stuck up and cocky because you thought yourself nicelooking and because you were educated in tercanbury and no one was good enough for you in blackstable and im jolly glad that all this has happened to you it serves you jolly well right and if you dare to show yourself at blackstable well send for the police  daisy stepped up to him  im a damned bad lot she said but i swear im not half as bad as you are you know what youre driving me to  you dont think i care what you do he answered as he flung himself out of the door he slammed it behind him and he also slammed the front door to show that he was a man of high principles and even george washington when he said i cannot tell a lie i did it with my little hatchet did not feel so righteous as george griffith at that moment  daisy went to the window to see him go and then throwing up her arms she fell on her knees weeping weeping and she cried  my god have pity on me   viii  i wouldnt go through it again for a hundred pounds said george when he recounted his experience to his mother and she wasnt a bit humble as youd expect  oh thats daisy all over whatever happens to her shell be as bold as brass  and she didnt choose her language he said with mingled grief and horror                                       they heard nothing more of daisy for over a year when george went up to london for the choir treat he did not come back till three oclock in the morning but he went at once to his mothers room  he woke her very carefully so as not to disturb his father she started up about to speak but he prevented her with his hand  come outside ive got something to tell you  mrs griffith was about to tell him rather crossly to wait till the morrow but he interrupted her  ive seen daisy  she quickly got out of bed and they went together into the parlour  i couldnt keep it till the morning he said what dyou think shes doing now well after we came out of the empire i went down piccadilly andwell i saw daisy standing there it did give me a turn i can tell you i thought some of the chaps would see her i simply went cold all over but they were on ahead and hadnt noticed her  thank god for that said mrs griffith piously  well what dyou think i did i went straight up to her and looked her full in the face but dyou think she moved a muscle she simply looked at me as if shed never set eyes on me before well i was taken aback i can tell you i thought shed faint not a bit of it  no i know daisy said mrs griffith you think shes this and that because she looks at you with those blue eyes of hers as if she couldnt say bo to a goose but shes got the very devil inside her well i shall tell her father that just so as to let him see what she has come to                                       the existence of the griffith household went on calmly husband and wife and son led their life in the dull little fishing town the seasons passed insensibly into one another one year slid gradually into the next and the five years that went by seemed like one long long day mrs griffith did not alter an atom she performed her housework went to church regularly and behaved like a christian woman in that state of life in which a merciful providence had been pleased to put her george got married and on sunday afternoons could be seen wheeling an infant in a perambulator along the street he was a good husband and an excellent father he never drank too much he worked well he was careful of his earnings and he also went to church regularly his ambition was to become churchwarden after his father and even in mr griffith there was not so very much change he was more bowed his hair and beard were greyer his face was set in an expression of passive misery and he was extremely silent but as mrs griffith said  of course hes getting old one cant expect to remain young for evershe was a woman who frequently said profound thingsand ive known all along he wasnt the sort of man to make old bones hes never had the go in him that i have why id make two of him  the griffiths were not so welltodo as before as blackstable became a more important health resort a regular undertaker opened a shop there and his window with two little model coffins and an arrangement of black prince of waless feathers surrounded by a white wreath took the fancy of the natives so that mr griffith almost completely lost the most remunerative part of his business other carpenters sprang into existence and took away much of the trade  ive no patience with him said mrs griffith of her husband he lets these newcomers come along and just take the bread out of his hands oh if i was a man id make things different i can tell you he doesnt seem to care                                       at last one day george came to his mother in a state of tremendous excitement  i say mother you know the pantomime theyve got at tercanbury this week  yes  well the principal boys daisy  mrs griffith sank into a chair gasping  harry fernes been and he recognised her at once its all over the town  mrs griffith for the first time in her life was completely at a loss for words  tomorrows the last night added her son after a little while and all the blackstable people are going  to think that this should happen to me said mrs griffith distractedly what have i done to deserve it why couldnt it happen to mrs garman or mrs jay if the lord had seen fit to bring it upon themwell i shouldnt have wondered  edith wants us to go said georgeedith was his wife  you dont mean to say youre going with all the blackstable people there  well edith says we ought to go just to show them we dont care  well i shall come too cried mrs griffith   ix  next evening half blackstable took the special train to tercanbury which had been put on for the pantomime and there was such a crowd at the doors that the impresario half thought of extending his stay the rev charles gray and mrs gray were there also james their nephew mr gray had some scruples about going to a theatre but his wife said a pantomime was quite different besides curiosity may gently enter even a clerical bosom miss reed was there in black satin with her friend mrs howlett mrs griffith sat in the middle of the stalls flanked by her dutiful son and her daughterinlaw and george searched for female beauty with his operaglass which is quite the proper thing to do on such occasions  the curtain went up and the villagers of dick whittingtons native place sang a chorus  now shes coming whispered george  all those blackstable hearts stood still and daisy as dick whittington bounded on the stagein fleshcoloured tights with particularly scanty trunks and her bodicerather low the vicars nephew sniggered and mrs gray gave him a reproachful glance all the other blackstable people looked pained miss reed blushed but as daisy waved her hand and gave a kick the audience broke out into prolonged applause tercanbury people have no moral sense although tercanbury is a cathedral city  daisy began to sing      im a jolly sort of boy tol lol       and i dont care a damn who knows it     im fond of every joy tol lol       as you may very well suppose it                 tol lol lol                 tol lol lol  then the audience the audience of a cathedral city as mr gray said took up the refrain      tol lol lol     tol lol lol  however the piece went on to the bitter end and dick whittington appeared in many different costumes and sang many songs and kicked many kicks till he was finally made lord mayorin tights  ah it was an evening of bitter humiliation for blackstable people some of them as miss reed said behaved scandalously they really appeared to enjoy it and even george laughed at some of the jokes the cat made though his wife and his mother sternly reproved him  im ashamed of you george laughing at such a time they said  afterwards the grays and miss reed got into the same railway carriage with the griffiths  well mrs griffith said the vicars wife what do you think of your daughter now  mrs gray replied mrs griffith solemnly i havent got a daughter  thats a very proper spirit in which to look at it answered the lady she was simply covered with diamonds  they must be worth a fortune said miss reed  oh i daresay theyre not real said mrs gray at that distance and with the limelight you know its very difficult to tell  im sorry to say said mrs griffith with some asperity feeling the doubt almost an affront to herim sorry to say that i know theyre real  the ladies coughed discreetly scenting a little scandalous mystery which they must get out of mrs griffith at another opportunity  my nephew james says she earns at least thirty or forty pounds a week  miss reed sighed at the thought of such depravity  its very sad she remarked to think of such things happening to a fellowcreature                                       but what i cant understand said mrs gray next morning at the breakfasttable is how she got into such a position we all know that at one time she was to be seen inwell in a very questionable place at an hour which left no doubt about herher means of livelihood i must say i thought she was quite lost  oh well i can tell you that easily enough replied her nephew shes being kept by sir somebody something and hes running the show for her  james i wish you would be more careful about your language its not necessary to call a spade a spade and you can surely find a less objectionable expression to explain the relationship between the persons dont you remember his name  no i heard it but ive really forgotten  i see in this weeks tercanbury times that theres a sir herbert ouslyfarrowham staying at the george just now  thats it sir herbert ouslyfarrowham  how sad ill look him out in burke  she took down the reference book which was kept beside the clergy list  dear me hes only twentynine and hes got a house in cavendish square and a house in the country he must be very welltodo and he belongs to the junior carlton and two other clubs and hes got a sister whos married to lord edward lake mrs gray closed the book and held it with a finger to mark the place like a bible its very sad to think of the dissipation of so many members of the aristocracy it sets such a bad example to the lower classes   x   they showed old griffith a portrait of daisy in her theatrical costume  has she come to that he said  he looked at it a moment then savagely tore it in pieces and flung it in the fire  oh my god he groaned he could not get out of his head the picture the shamelessness of the costume the smile the evident prosperity and content he felt now that he had lost his daughter indeed all these years he had kept his heart open to her and his heart had bled when he thought of her starving ragged perhaps dead he had thought of her begging her bread and working her beautiful hands to the bone in some factory he had always hoped that some day she could return to him purified by the fire of suffering but she was prosperous and happy and rich she was applauded worshipped the papers were full of her praise old griffith was filled with a feeling of horror of immense repulsion she was flourishing in her sin and he loathed her he had been so ready to forgive her when he thought her despairing and unhappy but now he was implacable                                       three months later mrs griffith came to her husband trembling with excitement and handed him a cutting from a paper       we hear that miss daisy griffith who earned golden opinions in      the provinces last winter with her dick whittington is about to be      married to sir herbert ouslyfarrowham her friends and their name      is legion will join with us in the heartiest congratulations  he returned the paper without answering  well asked his wife  it is nothing to me i dont know either of the parties mentioned  at that moment there was a knock at the door and mrs gray and miss reed entered having met on the doorstep mrs griffith at once regained her selfpossession  have you heard the news mrs griffith said miss reed  dyou mean about the marriage of sir herbert ouslyfarrowham she mouthed the long name  yes replied the two ladies together  it is nothing to me i have no daughter mrs gray  im sorry to hear you say that mrs griffith said mrs gray very stiffly i think you show a most unforgiving spirit  yes said miss reed i cant help thinking that if youd treated poor daisy in awell in a more christian way you might have saved her from a great deal  yes added mrs gray i must say that all through i dont think youve shown a nice spirit at all i remember poor dear daisy quite well and she had a very sweet character and im sure that if shed been treated a little more gently nothing of all this would have happened  mrs gray and miss reed looked at mrs griffith sternly and reproachfully they felt themselves like god almighty judging a miserable sinner mrs griffith was extremely angry she felt that she was being blamed most unjustly and moreover she was not used to being blamed  im sure youre very kind mrs gray and miss reed but i must take the liberty of saying that i know best what my daughter was  mrs griffith all i say is thisyou are not a good mother  excuse me madam said mrs griffith having grown red with anger but mrs gray interrupted  i am truly sorry to have to say it to one of my parishioners but you are not a good christian and we all know that your husbands business isnt going at all well and i think its a judgment of providence  very well maam said mrs griffith getting up youre at liberty to think what you please but i shall not come to church again mr friend the baptist minister has asked me to go to his chapel and im sure he wont treat me like that  im sure we dont want you to come to church in that spirit mrs griffith thats not the spirit with which you can please god mrs griffith i can quite imagine now why dear daisy ran away youre no christian  im sure i dont care what you think mrs gray but im as good as you are  will you open the door for me mrs griffith said mrs gray with outraged dignity  oh you can open it yourself mrs gray replied mrs griffith   xi  mrs griffith went to see her daughterinlaw  ive never been spoken to in that way before she said fancy me not being a christian im a better christian than mrs gray any day i like mrs gray with the airs she gives herselfas if shed got anything to boast about no edith ive said it and im not the woman to go back on what ive saidill not go to church again from this day i go to chapel                                       but george came to see his mother a few days later  look here mother edith says youd better forgive daisy now  george cried his mother ive only done my duty all through and if you think its my duty to forgive my daughter now shes going to enter the bonds of holy matrimony i will do so no one can say that im not a christian and i havent said the lords prayer night and morning ever since i remember for nothing  mrs griffith sat down to write looking up to her son for inspiration  dearest daisy he said  no george she replied im not going to cringe to my daughter although she is going to be a lady i shall simply say daisy  the letter was very dignified gently reproachful for daisy had undoubtedly committed certain peccadilloes although she was going to be a baronets wife but still it was completely forgiving and mrs griffith signed herself your loving and forgiving mother whose heart you nearly broke  but the letter was not answered and a couple of weeks later the same sunday paper contained an announcement of the date of the marriage and the name of the church mrs griffith wrote a second time       my darling daughteri am much surprised at receiving no answer      to my long letter all is forgiven i should so much like to see      you again before i die and to have you married from your fathers      house all is forgivenyour loving mother  mary ann griffith  this time the letter was returned unopened  george cried mrs griffith shes got her back up  and the weddings tomorrow he replied  its most awkward george ive told all the blackstable people that ive forgiven her and that sir herbert has written to say he wants to make my acquaintance and ive got a new dress on purpose to go to the wedding oh shes a cruel and exasperating thing george i never liked her you were always my favourite  well i do think shes not acting as she should replied george and im sure i dont know whats to be done  but mrs griffith was a woman who made up her mind quickly  i shall go up to town and see her myself george and you must come too  ill come up with you mother but youd better go to her alone because i expect shes not forgotten the last time i saw her  they caught a train immediately and having arrived at daisys house mrs griffith went up the steps while george waited in a neighbouring publichouse the door was opened by a smart maidmuch smarter than the vicarage maid at blackstable as mrs griffith remarked with satisfaction on finding that daisy was at home she sent up a message to ask if a lady could see her  the maid returned  would you give your name madam miss griffith cannot see you without  mrs griffith had foreseen the eventuality and unwilling to give her card had written another little letter using edith as amanuensis so that daisy should at least open it she sent it up in a few minutes the maid came down again  theres no answer and she opened the door for mrs griffith to go out  that lady turned very red her first impulse was to make a scene and call the housemaid to witness how daisy treated her own mother but immediately she thought how undignified she would appear in the maids eyes so she went out like a lamb  she told george all about it as they sat in the private bar of the publichouse drinking a little scotch whisky  all i can say she remarked is that i hope shell never live to repent it fancy treating her own mother like that  but i shall go to the wedding i dont care i will see my own daughter married  that had been her great ambition and she would have crawled before daisy to be asked to the ceremony but george dissuaded her from going uninvited there were sure to be one or two blackstable people present and they would see that she was there as a stranger the humiliation would be too great  i think shes an ungrateful girl said mrs griffith as she gave way and allowed george to take her back to blackstable   xii  but the prestige of the griffiths diminished everyone in blackstable came to the conclusion that the new lady ouslyfarrowham had been very badly treated by her relatives and many young ladies said they would have done just the same in her place also mrs gray induced her husband to ask griffith to resign his churchwardenship  you know mr griffith said the vicar deprecatingly now that your wife goes to chapel i dont think we can have you as churchwarden any longer and besides i dont think youve behaved to your daughter in a christian way  it was in the carpenters shop the business had dwindled till griffith only kept one man and a boy he put aside the saw he was using  what ive done to my daughter im willing to take the responsibility for i ask no ones advice and i want no ones opinion and if you think im not fit to be churchwarden you can find someone else better  why dont you make it up with your daughter griffith  mind your own business  the carpenter had brooded and brooded over his sorrow till now his daughters name roused him to fury he had even asserted a little authority over his wife and she dared not mention her daughter before him daisys marriage had seemed like the consummation of her shame it was vice riding triumphant in a golden chariot  but the name of lady ouslyfarrowham was hardly ever out of her mothers lips and she spent a good deal more money in her dress to keep up her dignity  why thats another new dress youve got on said a neighbour  yes said mrs griffith complacently you see were in quite a different position now i have to think of my daughter lady ouslyfarrowham i dont want her to be ashamed of her mother i had such a nice long letter from her the other day shes so happy with sir herbert and sir herberts so good to her   oh i didnt know you were   oh yes of course she was a littlewell a little wild when she was a girl but ive forgiven that its her father wont forgive her he always was a hard man and he never loved her as i did she wants to come and stay with me but he wont let her isnt it cruel of him i should so like to have lady ouslyfarrowham down here    xiii  but at last the crash came to pay for the new things which mrs griffith felt needful to preserve her dignity she had drawn on her husbands savings in the bank and he had been drawing on them himself for the last four years without his wifes knowledge for as his business declined he had been afraid to give her less money than usual and every week had made up the sum by taking something out of the bank george only earned a pound a weekhe had been made clerk to a coal merchant by his mother who thought that more genteel than carpenteringand after his marriage he had constantly borrowed from his parents at last mrs griffith learnt to her dismay that their savings had come to an end completely she had a talk with her husband and found out that he was earning almost nothing he talked of sending his only remaining workman away and moving into a smaller place if he kept his one or two old customers they might just manage to make both ends meet  mrs griffith was burning with anger she looked at her husband sitting in front of her with his helpless look  you fool she said  she thought of herself coming down in the world living in a pokey little house away from the high street unable to buy new dresses unnoticed by the chief people of blackstableshe who had always held up her head with the best of them  george and edith came in and she told them hurling contemptuous sarcasms at her husband he sat looking at them with his pained unhappy eyes while they stared back at him as if he were some despicable noxious beast  but why didnt you say how things were going before father george asked him  he shrugged his shoulders  i didnt like to he said hoarsely those cold angry eyes crushed him he felt the stupid useless fool he saw they thought him  i dont know whats to be done said george  his wife looked at old griffith with her hard grey eyes the sharpness of her features the firm clear complexion with all softness blown out of it by the east winds expressed the coldest resolution  father must get daisy to help shes got lots of money she may do it for him  old griffith broke suddenly out of his apathy  id sooner go to the workhouse ill never touch a penny of hers  now then father said mrs griffith quickly understanding you drop that youll have to  george at the same time got pen and paper and put them before the old man they stood round him angrily he stared at the paper a look of horror came over his face  go on dont be a fool said his wife she dipped the pen in the ink and handed it to him  ediths steelgrey eyes were fixed on him coldly compelling  dear daisy she began  father always used to call her daisy darling said george hed better put that so as to bring back old times  they talked of him strangely as if he were absent or had not ears to hear  very well replied edith and she began again the old man wrote bewilderedly as if he were asleep daisy darling  forgive me i have been hard and cruel towards you on my knees i beg your forgiveness the business has gone wrong  and i am ruined if you dont help me  we shall have the brokers in  and have to go to the workhouse for gods sake  have mercy on me you cant let me starve i know i have sinned towards youyour brokenhearted  father  she read through the letter i think thatll do now the envelope and she dictated the address  when it was finished griffith looked at them with loathing absolute loathingbut they paid no more attention to him they arranged to send a telegram first in case she should not open the letter       letter coming for gods sake open in great distressfather  george went out immediately to send the wire and post the letter   xiv  the letter was sent on a tuesday and on thursday morning a telegram came from daisy to say she was coming down mrs griffith was highly agitated  ill go and put on my silk dress she said  no mother that is a silly thing be as shabby as you can  howll father be asked george youd better speak to him edith  he was called the stranger in his own house  look here father daisys coming this morning now youll be civil wont you  im afraid hell go and spoil everything said mrs griffith anxiously  at that moment there was a knock at the door its her  griffith was pushed into the back room mrs griffith hurriedly put on a ragged apron and went to the door  daisy she cried opening her arms she embraced her daughter and pressed her to her voluminous bosom oh daisy  daisy accepted passively the tokens of affection with a little sad smile she tried not to be unsympathetic mrs griffith led her daughter into the sittingroom where george and edith were sitting george was very white  you dont mean to say you walked here said mrs griffith as she shut the front door fancy that when you could have all the carriages in blackstable to drive you about  welcome to your home again said george with somewhat the air of a dissenting minister  oh george she said with the same sad halfironical smile allowing herself to be kissed  dont you remember me said edith coming forward im georges wife i used to be edith pollett  oh yes daisy put out her hand  they all three looked at her and the women noticed the elegance of her simple dress she was no longer the merry girl they had known but a tall dignified woman and her great blue eyes were very grave they were rather afraid of her but mrs griffith made an effort to be cordial and at the same time familiar  fancy you being a real lady she said  daisy smiled again  wheres father she asked  in the next room they moved towards the door and entered old griffith rose as he saw his daughter but he did not come towards her she looked at him a moment then turned to the others  please leave me alone with father for a few minutes  they did not want to knowing that their presence would restrain him but daisy looked at them so firmly that they were obliged to obey she closed the door behind them  father she said turning towards him  they made me write the letter he said hoarsely  i thought so she said wont you kiss me  he stepped back as if in replusion she looked at him with her beautiful eyes full of tears  im so sorry ive made you unhappy but ive been unhappy toooh you dont know what ive gone through wont you forgive me  i didnt write the letter he repeated hoarsely they stood over me and made me  her lips trembled but with an effort she commanded herself they looked at one another steadily it seemed for a very long time in his eyes was the look of a hunted beast at last she turned away without saying anything more and left him  in the next room the three were anxiously waiting she contemplated them a moment and then sitting down asked about the affairs they explained how things were  i talked to my husband about it she said hes proposed to make you an allowance so that you can retire from business  oh thats sir herbert all over said mrs griffith greasilyshe knew nothing about him but his name  how much do you think you could live on asked daisy  mrs griffith looked at george and then at edith what should they ask edith and george exchanged a glance they were in agonies lest mrs griffith should demand too little  well said that lady at last with a little cough of uncertainty in our best years we used to make four pounds a week out of the businessdidnt we george  quite that answered he and his wife in a breath  then shall i tell my husband that if he allows you five pounds a week you will be able to live comfortably  oh thats very

then mrs griffith again enveloped her daughter in her arms and told her she had always loved her and that she was her only daughter after which daisy allowed herself to be embraced by her brother and his wife finally they shut the door on her and watched her from the window walk slowly down the high street  if youd asked it i believe shed have gone up to six quid a week said george   xv  daisy walked down the high street slowly looking at the houses she remembered and her lips quivered a little at every step smells blew across to her full of memoriesthe smell of a tannery the blood smell of a butchers shop the seaodour from a shop of fishermens clothes at last she came on to the beach and in the darkening november day she looked at the booths she knew so well the boats drawn up for the winter whose names she knew whose owners she had known from her childhood she noticed the new villas built in her absence and she looked at the grey sea a sob burst from her but she was very strong and at once she recovered herself she turned back and slowly walked up the high street again to the station the lamps were lighted now and the street looked as it had looked in her memory through the years between the green dragon and the duke of kent were the same groups of menfarmers townsfolk fishermentalking in the glare of the rival inns and they stared at her curiously as she passed a tall figure closely veiled she looked at the wellremembered shops the stationery shop with its oldfashioned flyblown knickknacks the milliners with cheap gaudy hats the little tailors with his antiquated fashion plates at last she came to the station and sat in the waitingroom her heart full of infinite sadnessthe terrible sadness of the past  and she could not shake it off in the train she could only just keep back the tears  at victoria she took a cab and finally reached home the servants said her husband was in his study  hulloa he said i didnt expect you tonight  i couldnt stay it was awful then she went up to him and looked into his eyes you do love me herbert dont you she said her voice suddenly breaking i want your love so badly  i love you with all my heart he said putting his arms round her  but she could restrain herself no longer the strong arms seemed to take away the rest of her strength and she burst into tears  i will try and be a good wife to you herbert she said as he kissed them away  the end  colston  coy limited printers edinburgh
