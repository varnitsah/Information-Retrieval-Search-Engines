football variety the world is peopled by three classes firstly the keen and regular player next the partial slacker thirdly and lastly the entire abject and absolute slacker  of the first class the keen and regular player little need be said a keen player is a gem of purest rays serene and when to his keenness he adds regularity and punctuality life ceases to become the mere hollow blank that it would otherwise become and joy reigns supreme  the absolute slacker to take the worst at once and have done with it needs the pen of a swift before adequate justice can be done to his enormities he is a blot an excrescence all those moments which are not spent in avoiding games by means of that leave which is unanimously considered the peculiar property of the french nation he uses in concocting ingenious excuses armed with these he faces with calmness the disgusting curiosity of the gamecaptain who officiously desires to know the reason of his nonappearance on the preceding day these excuses are of the hadtogoandseeamanaboutadog type and rarely meet with that success for which their author hopes in the end he discovers that his chest is weak or his heart is subject to palpitations and he forthwith produces a document to this effect signed by a doctor this has the desirable result of muzzling the tyrannical gamecaptain whose sole solace is a look of intense and withering scorn but this is seldom fatal and generally we rejoice to say ineffectual  the next type is the partial slacker he differs from the absolute slacker in that at rare intervals he actually turns up changed withal into the garb of the game and thirsting for the fray at this point begins the time of trouble for the gamecaptain to begin with he is forced by stress of ignorance to ask the newcomer his name this is of course an insult of the worst kind a being who does not know my name argues the partial slacker must be something not far from a criminal lunatic the name is however extracted and the partial slacker strides to the arena now arises insult no 2 he is wearing his cap a hint as to the advisability of removing this pièce de résistance not being taken he is ordered to assume a capless state and by these means a coolness springs up between him and the g c of this the gamecaptain is made aware when the game commences the partial slacker scorning to insert his head in the scrum assumes a commanding position outside and from this point criticises the gamecaptains decisions with severity and pith the last end of the partial slacker is generally a sad one stung by some pungent homethrust the gamecaptain is fain to try chastisement and by these means silences the enemys battery  sometimes the classes overlap as for instance a keen and regular player may by some more than usually gross bit of bungling on the part of the gc be moved to a fervour and eloquence worthy of juvenal or again even the absolute slacker may for a time emulate the keen player provided an opponent plant a shrewd kick on a tender spot but broadly speaking there are only three classes     an unfinished collection   a silence had fallen upon the smoking room the warrior just back from the front had enquired after george vanderpoop and we who knew that georges gentle spirit had to use a metaphor after his own heart long since been withdrawn from circulation were feeling uncomfortable and wondering how to break the news  smithson is our specialist in tact and we looked to him to be spokesman  george said smithson at last the late george vanderpoop  late exclaimed the warrior is he dead  as a doornail replied smithson sadly perhaps you would care to hear the story it is sad but interesting you may recollect that when you sailed he was starting his journalistic career for a young writer he had done remarkably well the daily telephone had printed two of his contributions to their correspondence column and a bright pen picture of his describing how lees lozenges for the liver had snatched him from almost certain death had quite a vogue lee i believe actually commissioned him to do a series on the subject  well said the warrior  well he was as i say prospering very fairly when in an unlucky moment he began to make a collection of editorial rejection forms he had always been a somewhat easy prey to scourges of that description but when he had passed safely through a sharp attack of philatelism and a rather nasty bout of autographomania everyone hoped and believed that he had turned the corner the progress of his last illness was very rapid within a year he wanted but one specimen to make the complete set this was the one published from the offices of the scrutinizer all the rest he had obtained with the greatest ease i remember his telling me that a single short story of his called the vengeance of vera dalrymple had been instrumental in securing no less than thirty perfect specimens poor george i was with him when he made his first attempt on the scrutinizer he had baited his hook with an essay on evolution he read me one or two passages from it i stopped him at the third paragraph and congratulated him in advance little thinking that it was sympathy rather than congratulations that he needed when i saw him a week afterwards he was looking haggard i questioned him and by slow degrees drew out the story the article on evolution had been printed  never say die george i said send them vera dalrymple no paper can take that  he sent it the scrutinizer which had been running for nearly a century without publishing a line of fiction took it and asked for more it was as if there were an editorial conspiracy against him  well said the man of war  then said smithson george pulled himself together he wrote a parody of the minstrel boy i have seen a good many parodies but never such a parody as that by return of post came a long envelope bearing the crest of the scrutinizer at last he said as he tore it open  george old man i said your hand  he looked at me a full minute then with a horrible mirthless laugh he fell to the ground and expired almost instantly you will readily guess what killed him the poem had been returned but without a rejection form     the new advertising   in denmark said the man of ideas coming into the smoking room i see that they have original ideas on the subject of advertising according to the usually wellinformed daily lyre all bombastic advertising is punished with a fine the advertiser is expected to describe his wares in restrained modest language in case this idea should be introduced into england i have drawn up a few specimen advertisements which in my opinion combine attractiveness with a shrinking modesty at which no censor could cavil  and in spite of our protests he began to read us his first effort descriptive of a patent medicine  it runs like this he said       timsons tonic for distracted deadbeats      has been known to cure      we hate to seem to boast      but      many who have tried it are still      alive                                            take a dose or two in your spare time      its not bad stuff                                            read what an outside stockbroker says      sirafter three months steady absorption of your tonic      i was no worse                                            we do not wish to thrust ourselves forward in any way if      you prefer other medicines by all means take them only we      just thought wed mention itcasually as it werethat timsons      is pretty good  hows that inquired the man of ideas attractive i fancy without being bombastic now one about a new novel ready         mr lucien logrollers latest           the dyspepsia of the soul          the dyspepsia of the soul          the dyspepsia of the soul      dont buy it if you dont want to but just     listen to a few of the criticisms           the dyspepsia of the soul      rather  rubbishspectator      we advise all insomniacs to read mr logrollers soporific      pagesoutlook      rotpelican          the dyspepsia of the soul       already in its first edition  what do you think of that asked the man of ideas  we told him     the secret pleasures of reginald   i found reggie in the club one saturday afternoon he was reclining in a long chair motionless his eyes fixed glassily on the ceiling he frowned a little when i spoke you dont seem to be doing anything i said  its not what im doing its what i am not doing that matters  it sounded like an epigram but epigrams are so little associated with reggie that i ventured to ask what he meant  he sighed ah well he said i suppose the sooner i tell you the sooner youll go do you know bodfish  i shuddered wilkinson bodfish i do  have you ever spent a weekend at bodfishs place in the country  i shuddered again i have  well im not spending the weekend at bodfishs place in the country  i see youre not but  you dont understand i do not mean that i am simply absent from bodfishs place in the country i mean that i am deliberately not spending the weekend there when you interrupted me just now i was not strolling down to bodfishs garage listening to his prattle about his new car  i glanced around uneasily  reggie old man youreyoure notthis hot weather  i am perfectly well and in possession of all my faculties now tell me can you imagine anything more awful than to spend a weekend with bodfish  on the spur of the moment i could not  can you imagine anything more delightful then than not spending a weekend with bodfish well thats what im doing now soon when you have goneif you have any other engagements please dont let me keep youi shall not go into the house and not listen to mrs bodfish on the subject of young willie bodfishs premature intelligence  i got his true meaning i see you mean that you will be thanking your stars that you arent with bodfish  that is it put crudely but i go further i dont indulge in a mere momentary selfcongratulation i do the thing thoroughly if i were weekending at bodfishs i should have arrived there just half an hour ago i therefore selected that moment for beginning not to weekend with bodfish i settled myself in this chair and i did not have my back slapped at the station a few minutes later i was not whirling along the country roads trying to balance the car with my legs and an elbow time passed and i was not shaking hands with mrs bodfish i have just had the most corking halfhour and shortlywhen you have remembered an appointmenti shall go on having it what i am really looking forward to is the happy time after dinner i shall pass it in not playing bridge with bodfish mrs bodfish and a neighbor sunday morning is the best part of the whole weekend though that is when i shall most enjoy myself do you know a man named pringle next saturday i am not going to stay with pringle i forget who is not to be my host the saturday after that i have so many engagements of this kind that i lose track of them  but reggie this is genius you have hit on the greatest idea of the age you might extend this system of yours  i do some of the jolliest evenings i have spent have been not at the theatre  i have often wondered what it was that made you look so fit and happy  yes these little nonvisits of mine pick me up and put life into me for the coming week i get up on monday morning feeling like a lion the reason i selected bodfish this week though i was practically engaged to a man named stevenson who lives out in connecticut was that i felt rundown and needed a real rest i shall be all right on monday  and so shall i i said sinking into the chair beside him  youre not going to the country he asked regretfully  i am not i too need a tonic i shall join you at bodfishs i really feel a lot better already  i closed my eyes and relaxed and a great peace settled upon me     my battle with drink   i could tell my story in two wordsthe two words i drank but i was not always a drinker this is the story of my downfalland of my risefor through the influence of a good woman i have thank heaven risen from the depths  the thing stole upon me gradually as it does upon so many young men as a boy i remember taking a glass of root beer but it did not grip me then i can recall that i even disliked the taste i was a young man before temptation really came upon me my downfall began when i joined the yonkers shorthand and typewriting college  it was then that i first made acquaintance with the awful power of ridicule they were a hardliving set at collegereckless youths they frequented movie palaces they thought nothing of winding up an evening with a couple of eggphosphates and a chocolate fudge they laughed at me when i refused to join them i was only twenty my character was undeveloped i could not endure their scorn the next time i was offered a drink i accepted they were pleased i remember they called me good old plum and a good sport and other complimentary names i was intoxicated with sudden popularity  how vividly i can recall that day the shining counter the placards advertising strange mixtures with ice cream as their basis the busy men behind the counter the halfcynical halfpitying eyes of the girl in the cage where you bought the soda checks she had seen so many happy healthy boys through that little hole in the wire netting so many thoughtless boys all eager for their first soda clamoring to set their foot on the primrose path that leads to destruction  it was an apple marshmallow sundae i recollect i dug my spoon into it with an assumption of gaiety which i was far from feeling the first mouthful almost nauseated me it was like cold hairoil but i stuck to it i could not break down now i could not bear to forfeit the newlywon esteem of my comrades they were gulping their sundaes down with the speed and enjoyment of old hands i set my teeth and persevered and by degrees a strange exhilaration began to steal over me i felt that i had burnt my boats and bridges that i had crossed the rubicon i was reckless i ordered another round i was the life and soul of that party  the next morning brought remorse i did not feel well i had pains physical and mental but i could not go back now i was too weak to dispense with my popularity i was only a boy and on the previous evening the captain of the checkers club to whom i looked up with an almost worshipping reverence had slapped me on the back and told me that i was a corker i felt that nothing could be excessive payment for such an honor that night i gave a party at which orange phosphate flowed like water it was the turning point  i had got the habit  i will pass briefly over the next few years i continued to sink deeper and deeper into the slough i knew all the drugstore clerks in new york by their first names and they called me by mine i no longer even had to specify the abomination i desired i simply handed the man my ten cent check and said the usual jimmy and he understood  at first considerations of health did not trouble me i was young and strong and my constitution quickly threw off the effects of my dissipation then gradually i began to feel worse i was losing my grip i found a difficulty in concentrating my attention on my work i had dizzy spells i became nervous and distrait eventually i went to a doctor he examined me thoroughly and shook his head  if i am to do you any good he said you must tell me all you must hold no secrets from me  doctor i said covering my face with my hands i am a confirmed sodafiend  he gave me a long lecture and a longer list of instructions i must take air and exercise and i must become a total abstainer from sundaes of all descriptions i must avoid limeade like the plague and if anybody offered me a bulgarzoon i was to knock him down and shout for the nearest policeman  i learned then for the first time what a bitterly hard thing it is for a man in a large and wicked city to keep from soda when once he has got the habit everything was against me the old convivial circle began to shun me i could not join in their revels and they began to look on me as a grouch in the end i fell and in one wild orgy undid all the good of a months abstinence i was desperate then i felt that nothing could save me and i might as well give up the struggle i drank two pinapolades three grapefruitolas and an eggzoolak before pausing to take breath  and then the next day i met may the girl who effected my reformation she was a clergymans daughter who to support her widowed mother had accepted a nonspeaking part in a musical comedy production entitled oh joy oh pep our acquaintance ripened and one night i asked her out to supper  i look on that moment as the happiest of my life i met her at the stage door and conducted her to the nearest sodafountain we were inside and i was buying the checks before she realized where she was and i shall never forget her look of mingled pain and horror  and i thought you were a live one she murmured  it seemed that she had been looking forward to a little lobster and champagne the idea was absolutely new to me she quickly convinced me however that such was the only refreshment which she would consider and she recoiled with unconcealed aversion from my suggestion of a mocha malted and an eva tanguay that night i tasted wine for the first time and my reformation began  it was hard at first desperately hard something inside me was trying to pull me back to the sundaes for which i craved but i resisted the impulse always with her divinely sympathetic encouragement i gradually acquired a taste for alcohol and suddenly one evening like a flash it came upon me that i had shaken off the cursed yoke that held me down that i never wanted to see the inside of a drugstore again cocktails at first repellent have at last become palatable to me i drink highballs for breakfast i am saved     in defense of astigmatism   this is peculiarly an age where novelists pride themselves on the breadth of their outlook and the courage with which they refuse to ignore the realities of life and never before have authors had such scope in the matter of the selection of heroes in the days of the oldfashioned novel when the hero was automatically lord blank or sir ralph asterisk there were of course certain rules that had to be observed but todaywhy you can hardly hear yourself think for the uproar of earnest young novelists proclaiming how free and unfettered they are and yet no writer has had the pluck to make his hero wear glasses  in the old days as i say this was all very well the hero was a young lordling sprung from a line of ancestors who had never done anything with their eyes except wear a piercing glance before which lesser men quailed but now novelists go into every class of society for their heroes and surely at least an occasional one of them must have been astigmatic kipps undoubtedly wore glasses so did bunker bean so did mr polly clayhanger bibbs sheridan and a score of others then why not say so  novelists are moving with the times in every other direction why not in this  it is futile to advance the argument that glasses are unromantic they are not i know because i wear them myself and i am a singularly romantic figure whether in my rimless my oxford goldbordered or the plain gents spectacles which i wear in the privacy of my study  besides everybody wears glasses nowadays that is the point i wish to make for commercial reasons if for no others authors ought to think seriously of this matter of goggling their heroes it is an admitted fact that the reader of a novel likes to put himself in the heros placeto imagine while reading that he is the hero what an audience the writer of the first romance to star a spectacled hero will have all over the country thousands of shortsighted men will polish their glasses and plunge into his pages it is absurd to go on writing in these days for a normalsighted public the growing tenseness of life with its small print its newspapers read by artificial light and its flickering motion pictures is whittling down the section of the populace which has perfect sight to a mere handful  i seem to see that romance in fact i think i shall write it myself evadne murmured clarence removing his pincenez and polishing them tenderly see cried clarence how clearly every leaf of yonder tree is mirrored in the still water of the lake i cant see myself unfortunately for i have left my glasses on the parlor piano but dont worry about me go ahead and see  clarence adjusted his tortoiseshellrimmed spectacles with a careless gesture and faced the assassins without a tremor hot stuff got the punch i should say so do you imagine that there will be a single man in this country with the price of the book in his pocket and a pair of pincenez on his face who will not scream and kick like an angry child if you withhold my novel from him  and just pause for a moment to think of the serial and dramatic rights of the story all editors wear glasses so do all theatrical managers my appeal will be irresistible all i shall have to do will be to see that the check is for the right figure and to supervise the placing of the electric sign      spectacles of fate      by p g wodehouse  over the doors of whichever theatre i happen to select for the production of the play  have you ever considered the latent possibilities for dramatic situations in short sight you know how your glasses cloud over when you come into a warm room out of the cold well imagine your hero in such a position he has been waiting outside the murderers den preparatory to dashing in and saving the heroine he dashes in hands up you scoundrels he cries and then his glasses get all misty and there he is temporarily blind with a fullsize desperado backing away and measuring the distance in order to hand him one with a pickaxe  or would you prefer something less sensational something more in the romantic line very well hero on his way to the dowager duchesss ball slips on a bananapeel and smashes his only pair of spectacles he dare not fail to attend the ball for the dear duchess would never forgive him so he goes in and proposes to a girl he particularly dislikes because she is dressed in pink and the heroine told him that she was going to wear pink but the heroines pink dress was late in coming home from the modistes and she had to turn up in blue the heroine comes in just as the other girl is accepting him and there you have a nice live peppy kickoff for your tale of passion and human interest  but i have said enough to show that the time has come when novelists if they do not wish to be left behind in the race must adapt themselves to modern conditions one does not wish to threaten but as i say we astigmatics are in a large minority and can if we get together make our presence felt roused by this article to a sense of the injustice of their treatment the great army of glasswearing citizens could very easily make novelists see reason a boycott of nonspectacled heroes would soon achieve the necessary reform perhaps there will be no need to let matters go as far as that i hope not but if this warning should be neglected if we have any more of these novels about men with keen gray eyes or snapping black eyes or cheerful blue eyesany sort of eyes in fact lacking some muscular affliction we shall know what to do     photographers and me   i look in my glass dear reader and what do i see nothing so frightfully hot believe me the face is slablike the ears are large and fastened on at rightangles above the eyebrows comes a stagnant sea of bald forehead stretching away into the distance with nothing to relieve it but a few wisps of lonely hair the nose is blobby the eyes dull like those of a fish not in the best of health a face in short taking it for all in all which should be reserved for the gaze of my nearest and dearest who through long habit have got used to it and can see through to the pure white soul beneath at any rate a face not to be scattered about at random and come upon suddenly by nervous people and invalids  and yet just because i am an author i have to keep on being photographed it is the fault of publishers and editors of course really but it is the photographer who comes in for the authors hate  something has got to be done about this practice of publishing authors photographs we have to submit to it because editors and publishers insist they have an extraordinary superstition that it helps an authors sales the idea is that the public sees the photograph pauses spellbound for an instant and then with a cry of ecstasy rushes off to the bookshop and buys copy after copy of the gargoyles latest novel  of course in practice it works out just the other way people read a review of an authors book and are told that it throbs with a passion so intense as almost to be painful and are on the point of digging sevenandsixpence out of their childs moneybox to secure a copy when their eyes fall on the mans photograph at the side of the review and they find that he has a face like a rabbit and wears spectacles and a low collar and this man is the man who is said to have laid bare the soul of a woman as with a scalpel  naturally their faith is shaken they feel that a man like that cannot possibly know anything about woman or any other subject except where to go for a vegetarian lunch and the next moment they have put down the hairpin and the child is sevenandsix in hand and the author his ten per cent or whatever it is to the bad and all because of a photograph  for the ordinary man the recent introduction of highart methods into photography has done much to diminish the unpleasantness of the operation in the old days of crude and direct posing there was no escape for the sitter he had to stand up backed by a rustic stile and a flabby canvas sheet covered with exotic trees glaring straight into the camera to prevent any eleventhhour retreat a sort of spiky thing was shoved firmly into the back of his head leaving him with the choice of being taken as he stood or having an inch of steel jabbed into his skull modern methods have changed all that  there are no photographs nowadays only camera portraits and lens impressions the full face has been abolished the ideal of the presentday photographer is to eliminate the sitter as far as possible and concentrate on a general cloudy effect i have in my possession two studies of my uncle theodoreone taken in the early nineties the other in the present year the first shows him evidently in pain staring before him with a fixed expression in his right hand he grasps a scroll his left rests on a mosscovered wall two seagulls are flying against a stormy sky  as a likeness it is almost brutally exact my uncle stands forever condemned as the wearer of a madeup tie  the second is different in every respect not only has the sitter been taken in the popular modern onetwentieth face showing only the back of the head the left ear and what is either a pimple or a flaw in the print but the whole thing is plunged in the deepest shadow it is as if my uncle had been surprised by the camera while chasing a black cat in his coalcellar on a moonlight night there is no question as to which of the two makes the more attractive picture my family resemble me in that respect the less you see of us the better we look     a plea for indoor golf   indoor golf is that which is played in the home whether you live in a palace or a hovel an indoor golfcourse be it only of nine holes is well within your reach a house offers greater facilities than an apartment and i have found my game greatly improved since i went to live in the country i can perhaps scarcely do better than give a brief description of the sporting ninehole course which i have recently laid out in my present residence  all authorities agree that the first hole on every links should be moderately easy in order to give the nervous player a temporary and fictitious confidence  at wodehouse manor therefore we drive off from the front doorin order to get the benefit of the doormatdown an entry fairway carpeted with rugs and without traps the holea lovingcupis just under the stairs and a good player ought to have no difficulty in doing it in two  the second hole a short and simple one takes you into the telephone booth trouble begins with the third a long dogleg hole through the kitchen into the diningroom this hole is well trapped with tablelegs kitchen utensils and a moving hazard in the person of clarence the cat who is generally wandering about the fairway the hole is under the glassandchina cupboard where you are liable to be bunkered if you loft your approachshot excessively  the fourth and fifth holes call for no comment they are without traps the only danger being that you may lose a stroke through hitting the maid if she happens to be coming down the back stairs while you are taking a mashieshot this is a penalty under the local rule  the sixth is the indispensable waterhole it is short but tricky teeing off from just outside the bathroom door you have to loft the ball over the side of the bath holing out in the little vent pipe at the end where the water runs out  the seventh is the longest hole on the course starting at the entrance of the best bedroom a full drive takes you to the head of the stairs whence you will need at least two more strokes to put you dead on the pin in the drawingroom in the drawingroom the fairway is trapped with photograph frameswith glass completethese serving as casual water and anyone who can hole out on the piano in five or under is a player of class bogey is six and i have known even such a capable exponent of the game as my uncle reginald who is plus two on his home links on park avenue to take twentyseven at the hole but on that occasion he had the misfortune to be bunkered in a photograph of my aunt clara and took no fewer than eleven strokes with his niblick to extricate himself from it  the eighth and ninth holes are straightforward and can be done in two and three respectively provided you swing easily and avoid the canarys cage once trapped there it is better to give up the hole without further effort it is almost impossible to get out in less than fiftysix and after you have taken about thirty the bird gets visibly annoyed     the alarming spread of poetry   to the thinking man there are few things more disturbing than the realization that we are becoming a nation of minor poets in the good old days poets were for the most part confined to garrets which they left only for the purpose of being ejected from the offices of magazines and papers to which they attempted to sell their wares nobody ever thought of reading a book of poems unless accompanied by a guarantee from the publisher that the author had been dead at least a hundred years poetry like wine certain brands of cheese and public buildings was rightly considered to improve with age and no connoisseur could have dreamed of filling himself with raw indigestible verse warm from the maker  today however editors are paying real money for poetry publishers are making a profit on books of verse and many a young man who had he been born earlier would have sustained life on a crust of bread is now sending for the manager to find out how the restaurant dares try to sell a fellow champagne like this as genuine pommery brut naturally this is having a marked effect on the life of the community our children grow to adolescence with the feeling that they can become poets instead of working many an embryo bill clerk has been ruined by the heady knowledge that poems are paid for at the rate of a dollar a line all over the country promising young plasterers and rising young motormen are throwing up steady jobs in order to devote themselves to the new profession on a sunny afternoon down in washington square ones progress is positively impeded by the swarms of young poets brought out by the warm weather it is a horrible sight to see those unfortunate youths who ought to be sitting happily at desks writing dear sir your favor of the tenth inst duly received and contents noted in reply we beg to state wandering about with their fingers in their hair and their features distorted with the agony of composition as they try to find rhymes to cosmic and symbolism  and as if matters were not bad enough already along comes mr edgar lee masters and invents vers libre it is too early yet to judge the full effects of this mans horrid discovery but there is no doubt that he has taken the lid off and unleashed forces over which none can have any control all those decent restrictions which used to check poets have vanished and who shall say what will be the outcome  until mr masters came on the scene there was just one thing which like a salient fortress in the midst of an enemys advancing army acted as a barrier to the youth of the country when ones son came to one and said father i shall not be able to fulfill your dearest wish and start work in the fertilizer department i have decided to become a poet although one could no longer frighten him from his purpose by talking of garrets and starvation there was still one weapon left what about the rhymes willie you replied and the eager light died out of the boys face as he perceived the catch in what he had taken for a good thing you pressed your advantage think of having to spend your life making one line rhyme with another think of the bleak future when you have used up moon and june love and dove may and gay think of the moment when you have ended the last line but one of your poem with windows or warmth and have to buckle to trying to make the thing couple up in accordance with the rules what then willie  next day a new hand had signed on in the fertilizer department  but now all that has changed not only are rhymes no longer necessary but editors positively prefer them left out if longfellow had been writing today he would have had to revise the village blacksmith if he wanted to pull in that dollar a line no editor would print stuff like      under the spreading chestnut tree       the village smithy stands     the smith a brawny man is he       with large and sinewy hands  if longfellow were living in these hyphenated free and versy days he would find himself compelled to take his pen in hand and dictate as follows      in life i was the village smith     i worked all day     but     i retained the delicacy of my complexion     because     i worked in the shade of the chestnut tree     instead of in the sun     like nicholas blodgett the expressman     i was large and strong     because     i went in for physical culture     and deep breathing     and all those stunts     i had the biggest biceps in spoon river  who can say where this thing will end vers libre is within the reach of all a sleeping nation has wakened to the realization that there is money to be made out of chopping its prose into bits something must be done shortly if the nation is to be saved from this menace but what it is no good shooting edgar lee masters for the mischief has been done and even making an example of him could not undo it probably the only hope lies in the fact that poets never buy other poets stuff when once we have all become poets the sale of verse will cease or be limited to the few copies which individual poets will buy to give to their friends     my life as a dramatic critic   i had always wanted to be a dramatic critic a taste for sitting back and watching other people work so essential to the makeup of this subspecies of humanity has always been one of the leading traits in my character  i have seldom missed a first night no sooner has one periodical got rid of me than another has had the misfortune to engage me with the result that i am now the foremost critic of the day read assiduously by millions fawned upon by managers courted by stagehands my lightest word can make or mar a new production if i say a piece is bad it dies it may not die instantly generally it takes forty weeks in new york and a couple of seasons on the road to do it but it cannot escape its fate sooner or later it perishes that is the sort of man i am  whatever else may be charged against me i have never deviated from the standard which i set myself at the beginning of my career if i am called upon to review a play produced by a manager who is considering one of my own works i do not hesitate i praise that play  if an actor has given me a lunch i refuse to bite the hand that has fed me i praise that actors performance i can only recall one instance of my departing from my principles that was when the champagne was corked and the man refused to buy me another bottle  as is only natural i have met many interesting people since i embarked on my career i remember once lunching with rare ben jonson at the mermaid tavernthis would be back in queen elizabeths time when i was beginning to be known in the theatrical worldand seeing a young man with a nobby forehead and about three inches of beard doing himself well at a neighboring table at the expense of burbage the manager  ben i asked my companion who is that youth he told me that the fellow was one bacon a new dramatist who had learned his technique by holding horses heads in the strand and who for some reason or other wrote under the name of shakespeare you must see his hamlet said ben enthusiastically he read me the script last night they start rehearsals at the globe next week its a pippin in the last act every blamed character in the cast who isnt already dead jumps on everyone elses neck and slays him its a skit you know on these foolish tragedies which every manager is putting on just now personally i think its the best thing since the prunehaters daughter  i was skeptical at the moment but time proved the correctness of my old friends judgment and having been present after the opening performance at a little supper given by burbage at which sack ran like water and anybody who wanted another malvoisie and seltzer simply had to beckon to the waiter i was able to conscientiously praise it in the highest terms  i still treasure the faded newspaper clipping which contains the advertisement of the play with the legend shakespeare has put one over a scream from start to finishwodehouse in the weekly bearbaiter with which is incorporated the scurvy knaves gazette  the lot of a dramatic critic is in many respects an enviable one lately there has been the growing practice among critics of roasting a play on the morning after production and then having another go at it in the sunday edition under the title of second swats or the past week in the theatre which has made it pretty rocky going for dramatists who thus get it twice in the same place and experience the complex emotions of the commuter who coming home in the dark trips over the babys cart and bumps his head against the hat stand  there is also no purer pleasure than that of getting into a theatre on what the poet milton used to call the nod i remember brigham young saying to me once with not unnatural chagrin youre a lucky man wodehouse it doesnt cost you a nickel to go to a theatre when i want to take in a show with the wife i have to buy up the whole of the orchestra floor and even then its a tight fit  my fellow critics and i escape this financial trouble and it gives us a good deal of pleasure when the male star is counting the house over the heroines head during their big love scene to see him frown as he catches sight of us and hastily revise his original estimate     the agonies of writing a musical comedy  which shows why librettists pick at the coverlet   the trouble about musical comedy and the reason why a great many otherwise kindly and broadminded persons lie in wait round the corner with sudden scowls their whole being intent on beating it with a brick the moment it shows its head is that from outside it looks too easy  you come into the crowded theatre and consider that each occupant of an orchestra chair is contributing three or four cents to the upkeep of a fellow who did nothing but dash off the stuff that keeps the numbers apart and your blood boils a glow of honest resentment fills you at the thought of anyone having such an absolute snap you little know what the poor bird has suffered and how inadequate a reward are his few yens per week for what he has been through musical comedy is not dashed off it growsslowly and painfully and each step in its growth either bleaches another tuft of the authors hair or removes it from the parent skull altogether  the average musical comedy comes into being because somebodynot the public but a managerwants one we will say that mr and mrs whoosis the eminent ballroom dancers have decided that they require a different sphere for the exhibition of their talents they do not demand a drama they commission somebody to write them a musical comedy some poor misguided creature is wheedled into signing a contract and from that moment his troubles begin  an inspiration gives him a pleasing and ingenious plot full of optimism he starts to write it by the time he has finished an excellent first act he is informed that mr and mrs whoosis propose to sing three solos and two duets in the first act and five in the second and will he kindly build his script accordingly this baffles the author a little he is aware that both artistes though extremely gifted northward as far as the anklebone go all to pieces above that level with the result that by the time you reach the zone where the brains and voice are located there is nothing stirring whatever and he had allowed for this in his original conception of the play by making mrs whoosis a deafmute and mr whoosis a trappist monk under the perpetual vow of silence the unfolding of the plot he had left to the other characters with a few ingenious gaps where the two stars could come on and dance  he takes a stiff bracer ties a vinegarsoaked handkerchief round his forehead and sets to work to remodel his piece he is a trifle discouraged but he perseveres with almost superhuman toil he contrives the only possible story which will fit the necessities of the case he has wrapped up the script and is about to stroll round the corner to mail it when he learns from the manager who is acting as intermediary between the parties concerned in the production that there is a slight hitch instead of having fifty thousand dollars deposited in the bank to back the play it seems that the artistes merely said in their conversation that it would be awfully jolly if they did have that sum or words to that effect  by this time our author has got the thing into his system or rather he has worked so hard that he feels he cannot abandon the venture now he hunts for another manager who wants something musical and at length finds one the only proviso is that this manager does not need a piece built around two stars but one suited to the needs of jasper cutup the wellknown comedian whom he has under contract the personality of jasper is familiar to the author so he works for a month or two and remoulds the play to fit him with the script under his arm he staggers to the managers office the manager reads the scriptsmileschucklesthoroughly enjoys it then a cloud passes athwart his brow theres only one thing the matter with this piece he says you seem to have written it to star a comedian but you said you wanted it for jasper cutup gasps the author supporting himself against the watercooler well yes that is so replies the manager i remember i did want a piece for him then but hes gone and signed up with k and lee what i wish you would do is to take this script and twist it to be a vehicle for pansy glucose  pansy glucose moans the author the ingenue yes says the manager it wont take long just turn your milwaukee pickle manufacturer into a debutante and the thing is done get to work as soon as you can i want this rushed  all this is but a portion of the musical comedy authors troubles we will assume that he eventually finds a manager who really does put the piece into rehearsal we will even assume that he encounters none of the trials to which i have alluded we will even go further and assume that he is commissioned to write a musical comedy without any definite stellar personality in mind and that when he has finished it the manager will do his share by providing a suitable cast is he in soft no dear reader he is not in soft you have forgotten the gurls critics are inclined to reproach deride blame and generally hammer the author of a musical comedy because his plot is not so consecutive and unbroken as the plot of a farce or a comedy they do not realize the conditions under which he is working it is one of the immutable laws governing musical plays that at certain intervals during the evening the audience demand to see the chorus they may not be aware that they so demand but it is nevertheless a fact that unless the chorus come on at these fixed intervals the audiences interest sags the raciest farcescenes cannot hold them nor the most tender love passages they want the gurls the whole gurls and nothing but the gurls  thus it comes about that the author having at last finished his first act is roused from his dream of content by a horrid fear he turns to the script and discovers that his panic was well grounded he has carelessly allowed fully twenty pages to pass without once bringing on the chorus  this is where he begins to clutch his forehead and to grow gray at the temples he cannot possibly shift musical number four which is a chorus number into the spot now occupied by musical number three which is a duet because three is a situation number rooted to its place by the exigencies of the story the only thing to do is to pull the act to pieces and start afresh and when you consider that this sort of thing happens not once but a dozen times between the start of a musical comedy book and its completion can you wonder that this branch of writing is included among the dangerous trades and that librettists always end by picking at the coverlet  then there is the question of cast the author builds his hero in such a manner that he requires an actor who can sing dance be funny and carry a love interest when the time comes to cast the piece he finds that the only possible man in sight wants fifteen hundred a week and anyway is signed up for the next five years with the rival syndicate he is then faced with the alternative of revising his play to suit either a jones who can sing and dance but is not funny b smith who is funny but cannot sing and dance c brown who is funny and can sing and dance but who cannot carry a loveinterest and through working in revue has developed a habit of wandering down to the footlights and chatting with the audience whichever actor is given the job it means more rewriting  overcome this difficulty and another arises certain scenes are constructed so that a gets a laugh at the expense of b but b is a fivehundredaweek comedian and a is a twohundredaweek juvenile and b refuses to play straight even for an instant for a social inferior the original line is such that it cannot be simply switched from one to the other the scene has to be entirely reconstructed and further laugh lines thought of multiply this by a hundred and you will begin to understand why when you see a librettist he is generally lying on his back on the sidewalk with a crowd standing round saying give him air  so do not grudge the librettist his thousand a week or whatever it is remember what he has suffered and consider his emotions on the morning after the production when he sees lines which he invented at the cost of permanently straining his brain attributed by the critics to the impromptu invention of the leading comedian of all the saddest words of tongue or pen the saddestto a musical comedy authorare these in the morning paper the bulk of the humor was sustained by walter wiffle who gagged his way merrily through the piece     on the writing of lyrics   the musical comedy lyric is an interesting survival of the days long since departed when poets worked as everyone knows the only real obstacle in the way of turning out poetry by the mile was the fact that you had to make the darned stuff rhyme  many lyricists rhyme as they pronounce and their pronunciation is simply horrible they can make home rhyme with alone and saw with more and go right off and look their innocent children in the eye without a touch of shame  but let us not blame the erring lyricist too much it isnt his fault that he does these things it is the fault of the english language whoever invented the english language must have been a prosewriter not a versifier for he has made meagre provision for the poets indeed the word you is almost the only decent chance he has given them you can do something with a word like you it rhymes with sue eyes of blue woo and all sorts of succulent things easily fitted into the fabric of a lyric and it has the enormous advantage that it can be repeated thrice at the end of a refrain when the composer has given you those three long notes which is about all a composer ever thinks of when a composer hands a lyricist a dummy for a song ending thus      tiddleytum tiddleytum            pompompom pompompom                  tum tum tum  the lyricist just shoves down you you you for the last line and then sets to work to fit the rest of the words to it i have dwelled on this for it is noteworthy as the only bright spot in a lyricists life the only real cinch the poor man has  but take the word love  when the board of directors or whoever it was was arranging the language you would have thought that if they had had a spark of pity in their systems they would have tacked on to that emotion of thoughts of which the young mans fancy lightly turns in spring some word ending in an open vowel they must have known that lyricists would want to use whatever word they selected as a label for the abovementioned emotion far more frequently than any other word in the language it wasnt much to ask of them to choose a word capable of numerous rhymes but no they went and made it love causing vast misery to millions  love rhymes with dove glove above and shove it is true that poets who print their stuff instead of having it sung take a mean advantage by ringing in words like prove and move but the lyricist is not allowed to do that this is the wretched unfairness of the lyricists lot the language gets him both ways it wont let him rhyme love with move and it wont let him rhyme maternal with colonel if he tries the first course he is told that the rhyme though all right for the eye is wrong for the ear if he tries the second course they say that the rhyme though more or less ninetynine percent pure for the ear falls short when tested by the eye and when he is driven back on one of the regular guaranteed rhymes he is taunted with triteness of phrase  no lyricist wants to keep linking love with skies above and turtle dove but what can he do you cant do a thing with shove and glove is one of those aloof words which are not good mixers andmark the brutality of the thingthere is no word you can substitute for love it is just as if they did it on purpose  home is another example it is the lyricists staff of life but all he can do is to roam across the foam if he wants to use it he can put in nome of course as a pinchhitter in special crises but very seldom with the result that his poetic soul straining at its bonds goes and uses alone bone tone and thrown exciting hoots of derision  but it is not only the paucity of rhymes that sours the lyricists life he is restricted in his use of material as well if every audience to which a musical comedy is destined to play were a metropolitan audience all might be well but there is the road to consider and even a metropolitan audience likes its lyrics as much as possible in the language of everyday that is one of the thousand reasons why new gilberts do not arise gilbert had the advantage of being a genius but he had the additional advantage of writing for a public which permitted him to use his full vocabulary and even to drop into foreign languages even latin and a little greek when he felt like it i allude to that song in the grand duke  and yet the modern lyricist to look on the bright side has advantages that gilbert never had gilbert never realised the possibilities of hawaii with its admirably named beaches shores and musical instruments hawaiicapable as it is of being rhymed with higherhas done much to sweeten the lotand increase the annual income of an industrious and highly respectable but downtrodden class of the community     the past theatrical season  and the six best performances by unstarred actors   what lessons do we draw from the past theatrical season  in the first place the success of the wanderer proves that the day of the small and intimate production is over and that what the public wants is the large spectacle in the second place the success of oh boyi hate to refer to it as i am one of the trio who perpetrated it but honestly were simply turning them away in droves and rockefeller has to touch morgan for a bit if he wants to buy a ticket from the speculatorsproves that the day of the large spectacle is over and that what the public wants is the small and intimate production  then the capacity business done by the thirteenth chair shows clearly that what the proletariat demands nowadays is the plotty piece and that the sun of the bright dialogue comedy has set while the capacity business done by a successful calamity shows clearly that the number of the plotty piece is up  you will all feel better and more able to enjoy yourselves now that a trained critical mind has put you right on this subtle point  no review of a theatrical season would be complete without a tabulated listor even an untabulated oneof the six best performances by unstarred actors during the past season  the present past seasonthat is to say the past season which at present is the last seasonhas been peculiarly rich in hot efforts by all sorts of performers my own choice would be 1 anna wheaton in oh boy 2 marie carroll in the piece at the princess theatre 3 edna may oliver in comstock and elliotts new musical comedy 4 tom powers in the show on the south side of 39th street 5 hal forde in the successor to very good eddie 6 stephen maley in oh boy  you would hardly credit the agony it gives me to allude even in passing to the above musical mélange but one must be honest to ones public in case there may be any who dissent from my opinion i append a supplementary list of those entitled to honorable mention 1 the third sheep from the o p side in the wanderer 2 the trick lamp in magic 3 the pink pajamas in youre in love 4 the knife in the thirteenth chair 5 the confused noise without in the great divide 6 jack merritts hair in oh boy  there were few discoveries among the dramatists of the older playwrights barrie produced a new one and an ancient one but the shakespeare boom so strong last year petered out there seems no doubt that the man in spite of a flashy start had not the stuff i understand that some of his things are doing fairly well on the road clare kummer whose dearie i have so frequently sung in my bath to the annoyance of all suddenly turned right round dropped songwriting and ripped a couple of hot ones right over the plate mr somerset maugham succeeded in shocking broadway so that the sidewalks were filled with blushing ticketspeculators  most of the critics have done good work during this season as for myself i have guided the public mind in this magazine soundly and with few errors if it were not for the fact that nearly all the plays i praised died before my review appeared while the ones i said would not run a week are still packing them in i could look back to a flawless season  as you can see i have had a very pleasant theatrical season the weather was uniformly fine on the nights when i went to the theatre i was particularly fortunate in having neighbors at most of the plays who were not afflicted with coughs or a desire to explain the plot to their wives i have shaken hands with a l erlanger and been nodded to on the street by lee shubert i have broadened my mind by travel on the road with a theatrical company with the result that if you want to get me out of new york you will have to use dynamite  take it for all in all a most satisfactory

    her eyes in aspect dreamy       in colour greyish blue      for her i sighed i panted       i saw her in my dreams     i vowed protested ranted       i sent her chocolate creams     until methought one morning       i seemed to hear a voice     a still small voice of warning       does jones approve your choice      to jones of my affection       i spoke that very night     if he had no objection       i said id wed miss white     i asked him for his blessing       but turning rather blue     he said its most distressing       but i adore her too      then jones i answered sobbing       my wooings at an end     i couldnt think of robbing       my best my only friend     the notion makes me furious       id much prefer to die     perhaps youll think it curious       said jones but so should i      nor he nor i would falter       in our resolve one jot     i bade him seek the altar       he vowed that he would not     shes yours old fellow make her       as happy as you can     not so said i you take her       you are the lucky man      at lengththe situation       had lasted now a year     i had an inspiration       which seemed to make things clear     supposing i suggested       we ask miss white to choose     i should be interested       to hear her private views      perhaps she has a preference       i own it sounds absurd     but i submit with deference       that she might well be heard     in clear commercial diction       the case in point well state     disclose the cause of friction       and leave the rest to fate      we did and on the morrow       the postman brought us news     miss white expressed her sorrow       at having to refuse     of all her many reasons       this seemed to me the pith     six months before or rather more       shed married mr smith      the haunted tram       ghosts of the towers the grange the court        ghosts of the castle keep     ghosts of the finicking highlife sort        are growing a trifle cheap     but here is a spook of another stamp        no thin theatrical sham     but a spectre who fears not dirt nor damp        he rides on a london tram      by the curious glance of a mortal eye        he is not seen hes heard     his steps go acreeping creeping by        he speaks but a single word     you may hear his feet you may hear them plain        forits odd in a ghostthey crunch     you may hear the whirr of his rattling chain        and the ting of his ringing punch      the gathering shadows of night fall fast        the lamps in the street are lit     to the roof have the eerie footsteps passed        where the outside passengers sit     to the passengers side has the spectre paced        for a moment he halts they say     then a ring from the punch at the unseen waist        and the footsteps pass away      that is the tale of the haunted car        and if on that car you ride     you wont believe me have journeyed far        ere the spectre seeks your side     ay all unseen by your seat hell stand        and unless its a wig your hair     will rise at the touch of his icy hand        and the sound of his whispered fare      at the end of the trip when youre getting down        and youll probably simply fly     just give the conductor halfacrown        ask who is the ghost and why     and the man will explain with bated breath        and point you a moral thus     es a pore young bloke wot wos crushed to death              by people as fought              as they didnt ought     for seats on a crowded bus      stories     when papa swore in hindustani   sylvia  yes papa  that infernal dog of yours  oh papa  yes that infernal dog of yours has been at my carnations again  colonel reynolds vc glared sternly across the table at miss sylvia reynolds and miss sylvia reynolds looked in a deprecatory manner back at colonel reynolds vc while the dog in questiona foppish pughappening to meet the colonels eye in transit crawled unostentatiously under the sideboard and began to wrestle with a bad conscience  oh naughty tommy said miss reynolds mildly in the direction of the sideboard  yes my dear assented the colonel and if you could convey to him the information that if he does it once moreyes just once morei shall shoot him on the spot you would be doing him a kindness and the colonel bit a large crescent out of his toast with all the energy and conviction of a man who has thoroughly made up his mind at six oclock this morning continued he in a voice of gentle melancholy i happened to look out of my bedroom window and saw him he had then destroyed two of my best plants and was commencing on a third with every appearance of selfsatisfaction i threw two large brushes and a boot at him  oh papa they didnt hit him  no my dear they did not the brushes missed him by several yards and the boot smashed a fourth carnation however i was so fortunate as to attract his attention and he left off  i cant think what makes him do it i suppose its bones hes got bones buried all over the garden  well if he does it again youll find that there will be a few more bones buried in the garden said the colonel grimly and he subsided into his paper  sylvia loved the dog partly for its own sake but principally for that of the giver one reginald dallas whom it had struck at an early period of their acquaintance that he and miss sylvia reynolds were made for one another on communicating this discovery to sylvia herself he had found that her views upon the subject were identical with his own and all would have gone well had it not been for a melancholy accident  one day while out shooting with the colonel with whom he was doing his best to ingratiate himself with a view to obtaining his consent to the match he had allowed his sporting instincts to carry him away to such a degree that in sporting parlance he wiped his eye badly now the colonel prided himself with justice on his powers as a shot but on this particular day he had a touch of liver which resulted in his shooting over the birds and under the birds and on each side of the birds but very rarely at the birds dallas being in especially good form it was found when the bag came to be counted that while he had shot seventy brace the colonel had only managed to secure five and a half  his bad marksmanship destroyed the last remnant of his temper he swore for half an hour in hindustani and for another halfhour in english after that he felt better and when at the end of dinner sylvia came to him with the absurd request that she might marry mr reginald dallas he did not have a fit but merely signified in fairly moderate terms his entire and absolute refusal to think of such a thing  this had happened a month before and the pug which had changed hands in the earlier days of the friendship still remained at the imminent risk of its life to soothe sylvia and madden her father  it was generally felt that the way to find favour in the eyes of sylviawhich were a charming blue and well worth finding favour inwas to show an intelligent and affectionate interest in her dog this was so up to a certain point but no farther for the mournful recollection of mr dallas prevented her from meeting their advances in quite the spirit they could have wished  however they persevered and scarcely a week went by in which thomas was not rescued from an artfully arranged horrible fate by somebody  but all their energy was in reality wasted for sylvia remembered her faithful reggie who corresponded vigorously every day and refused to be put off with worthless imitations the lovesick swains however could not be expected to know of this and the rescuing of tommy proceeded briskly now one now another playing the rôle of hero  the very day after the conversation above recorded had taken place a terrible tragedy occurred  the colonel returning from a poor days shooting observed through the mist that was beginning to rise a small form busily engaged in excavating in the precious carnationbed slipping in a cartridge he fired and the skill which had deserted him during the day came back to him there was a yelp then silence and sylvia rushing out from the house found the luckless thomas breathing his last on a heap of uprooted carnations  the news was not long in spreading the cook told the postman and the postman thoughtfully handed it on to the servants at the rest of the houses on his round by noon it was public property and in the afternoon at various times from two to five nineteen young men were struck quite independently of one another with a brilliant idea  the results of this idea were apparent on the following day  is this all asked the colonel of the servant as she brought in a couple of letters at breakfasttime  theres a hamper for miss sylvia sir  a hamper is there well bring it in  if you please sir theres several of them  what several how many are there  nineteen sir said mary restraining with some difficulty an inclination to giggle  eh what nineteen nonsense where are they  weve put them in the coachhouse for the present sir and if you please sir cook says she thinks theres something alive in them  something alive  yes sir and john says he thinks its dogs sir  the colonel uttered a sound that was almost a bark and followed by sylvia rushed to the coachhouse there sure enough as far as the eye could reach were the hampers and as they looked a sound proceeded from one of them that was unmistakably the plaintive note of a dog that has been shut up and is getting tired of it  instantly the other eighteen hampers joined in until the whole coachhouse rang with the noise  the colonel subsided against a wall and began to express himself softly in hindustani  poor dears said sylvia how stuffy they must be feeling  she ran to the house and returned with a basin of water  poor dears she said again youll soon have something to drink  she knelt down by the nearest hamper and cut the cord that fastened it a pug jumped out like a jackinthebox and rushed to the water sylvia continued her work of mercy and by the time the colonel had recovered sufficiently to be able to express his views in english eighteen more pugs had joined their companion  get out you brute shouted the colonel as a dog insinuated itself between his legs sylvia put them back again this minute you had no business to let them out put them back  but i cant papa i cant catch them  she looked helplessly from him to the seething mass of dogs and back again  wheres my gun began the colonel  papa dont you couldnt be so cruel they arent doing any harm poor things  if i knew who sent them  perhaps theres something to show yes heres a visitingcard in this hamper  whose is it bellowed the colonel through the din  j darcy henderson the firs read sylvia at the top of her voice  young blackguard bawled the colonel  i expect theres one in each of the hampers yes heres another w k ross the elms  the colonel came across and began to examine the hampers with his own hand each hamper contained a visitingcard and each card bore the name of a neighbour the colonel returned to the breakfastroom and laid the nineteen cards out in a row on the table  hm he said at last mr reginald dallas does not seem to be represented  sylvia said nothing  no he seems not to be represented i did not give him credit for so much sense then he dropped the subject and breakfast proceeded in silence  a young gentleman met the colonel on his walk that morning  morning colonel said he  goodmorning said the colonel grimly  ercolonel iersuppose miss reynolds got that dog all right  to which dog do you refer  it was a pug you know it ought to have arrived by this time  yes i am inclined to think it has had it any special characteristics  no i dont think so just an ordinary pug  well young man if you will go to my coachhouse you will find nineteen ordinary pugs and if you would kindly select your beast and shoot it i should be much obliged  nineteen said the other in astonishment why are you setting up as a dogfancier in your old age colonel  this was too much for the colonel he exploded  old age confound your impudence dogfancier no sir i have not become a dogfancier in what you are pleased to call my old age but while there is no law to prevent a lot of dashed young puppies like yourself sirlike yourselfsending your confounded pugdogs to my daughter who ought to have known better than to have let them out of their dashed hampers i have no defence  dogfancier gad unless those dogs are removed by this time tomorrow sir they will go straight to the battersea home where i devoutly trust they will poison them here are the cards of the other gentlemen who were kind enough to think that i might wish to set up for a dogfancier in my old age perhaps you will kindly return them to their owners and tell them what i have just said and he strode off leaving the young man in a species of trance  sylvia said the colonel on arriving home  yes papa  do you still want to marry that dallas fellow now for heavens sake dont start crying goodness knows ive been worried enough this morning without that please answer a plain question in a fairly sane manner do you or do you not  of course i do papa  then you may hes the furthest from being a fool of any of the young puppies who live about here and he knows one end of a gun from the other ill write to him now      dear dallas wrote the coloneli find on consideration     that you are the only sensible person in the neighbourhood i hope     you will come to lunch today and if you still want to marry     my daughter you may  to which dallas replied by return of messenger      thanks for both invitations i will  an hour later he arrived in person and the course of true love pulled itself together and began to run smooth again     tom dick and harry   this story will interest and amuse all cricketers and while from the male point of view it may serve as a good illustration of the fickleness of woman and the impossibility of forecasting what course she will take the fair sex will find in it an equally shining proof of the colossal vanity of man  its like this  tom ellison sat down on the bed and paused  whack it out said dick henley encouragingly  were all friends here and the passwords portland whats the matter  i hate talking to a man when hes shaving i dont want to have you cutting your head off  dont worry about me this is a safety razor and anyhow whats the excitement going to make my flesh creep  tom ellison kicked uncomfortably at the chair he was trying to balance on one leg  its so hard to explain  have a dash at it  well look here dick weve always been pals what  of course we have  we went to the empire last boatrace night together  and got chucked out simultaneously  in fact weve always been pals what  of course we have  then whenever there was a rag on and a bonner in the quad you always knew you could help yourself to my chairs  you had the run of mine  weve shared each others baccy  and whisky  in short weve always been pals what  of course we have  then said tom ellison what are you trying to cut me out for  cut you out  you know what i mean what do you think i came here for to play cricket rot id much rather have gone on tour with the authentics i came here to propose to dolly burn  dick henley frowned  i wish youd speak of her as miss burn he said austerely  there you are you see said tom with sombre triumph you oughtnt to have noticed a thing like that it oughtnt to matter to you what i call her i always think of her as dolly  youve no right to  i shall have soon  ill bet you wont  how much  ten to one in anything  done said tom i mean he added hastily dont be a fool there are some things one cant bet on as you ought to have known he said primly  now look here said dick this thing has got to be settled you say im trying to cut you out i like that we may fairly describe that as rich as if my love were the same sort of passing fancy that yours is you know you fall in love as you call it with every girl you meet  i dont  very well if the subject is painful we wont discuss it still how about that girl you used to rave about last summer ethel something  tom blushed  a mere platonic friendship we both collected autographs and if it comes to that how about dora thingummy you had enough to say about her last winter  dick reddened  we were on good terms nothing more she always sliced with her brassy so did i it formed a sort of bond  there was a pause  after all resumed dick i dont see the point of all this why rake up the past you arent writing my life  you started raking  well to drop that what do you propose to do about this youre a good chap tom when you arent making an ass of yourself but im hanged if im going to have you interfering between me and dolly  miss burn  another pause  look here said dick cards on the table ive loved her since last commem  so have i  we went up the char together in a canader alone  she also did the trip with me no chaperone  twice with me  same here  she gave me a couple of dances at the oriel ball  so she did me she said my dancing was so much better than the average young mans  she told me i must have had a great deal of practice at waltzing  in the matter of photographs said tom she gave me one  me too  do you mean also or a brace inquired tom anxiously  also confessed dick with reluctance  signed  rather  a third pause  i tell you what it is said tom we must agree on something or we shall both get left all were doing now is to confuse the poor girl she evidently likes us both the same what i mean is were both so alike that she cant possibly make a choice unless one of us chucks it you dont feel like chucking it dick what  you neednt be more of an idiot than you can help  i only asked so we are evidently both determined to stick to it we shall have to toss then to settle which is to back out and give the other man a show  toss shouted dick for dolly never  but we must do something you wont back out like a sensible man we must settle it somehow  its all right said dick ive got it we both seem to have come here and let ourselves in for this rotten little village match on a wicket which will probably be all holes and hillocks simply for dollys sake so its only right that we should let the match decide this thing for us it wont be so coldblooded as tossing see  you mean  whichever of us makes the bigger score today wins the loser has to keep absolutely off the grass not so much as a look or a remark about the weather then of course after the winner has had his innings if he hasnt brought the thing off and she has chucked him the loser can have a look in but not a moment before understand  all right  itll give an interest to a rotten match said dick  tom rose to a point of order  theres one objection you being a stodgy sort of bat and having a habit of sitting on the splice always get put in first im a hitter so they generally shove me in about fourth wicket in this sort of match the man who goes in fourth wicket is likely to be not out half a dozen at the end of the innings nobody stays in more than three balls whereas you going in first will have time for a decent knock before the rot starts follow  i dont want to take any advantage of you said dick condescendingly i shant need it well see drew after breakfast and get him to put us both in first  the rev henry drew cricketing curate was the captain of the side  consulted on the matter after breakfast the rev henry looked grave he was taking this match very seriously and held decided views on the subject of managing his team  the point is my dear ellison he said that i want the bowling broken a bit before you go in then your free aggressive style would have a better chance i was thinking of putting you in fourth wicket would not that suit you  i thought so tell him dick  look here drew said dick youll regard what im going to say as said under seal of the confessional and that sort of thing wont you  i shall of course respect any confidence you impart to me my dear henley what is this dreadful secret  dick explained  so you see he concluded its absolutely necessary that we should start fair  the rev henry looked as disturbed as if he had suddenly detected symptoms of pelagianism in a member of his sundayschool class  is such a contest quite is it not a littleum he said  not at all said dick hastening to justify himself and friend we must settle the thing somehow and neither of us will back out if we didnt do this we should have to toss  heaven forbid said the curate shocked  well is it a deal will you put us in first  very well  thanks said tom  good of you said dick  dont mention it said harry                                       there are two sorts of country cricket there is the variety you get at a countryhouse where the wicket is prepared with a care as meticulous as that in fashion on any county ground where red marl and suchlike aids to smoothness have been injected into the turf all through the winter and where the outfielding is good and the boundaries spacious and there is the village match where cows are apt to stroll on to the pitch before the innings and coverpoint stands up to his neck in a furzebush  the game which was to decide the fate of tom and dick belonged to the latter variety a pitch had been mown in the middle of a meadow kindly lent by farmer rollitt on condition that he should be allowed to umpire and his eldest son ted put on to bowl first the team consisted of certain hornyhanded sons of toil with terrific golfshots in the direction of squareleg and the enemys ranks were composed of the same material tom and dick in ordinary circumstances would have gone in to bat in such a match with a feeling of lofty disdain as befitting experts from the civilised world come to teach the rustic mind what was what  but on the present occasion the thought of all that depended on their bats induced a state of nerves which would have done credit to a test match  would you mind taking first bbball old man said tom  all rright said dick he had been on the point of making the request himself but it would not do to let tom see that he was nervous  he took guard from farmer rollitt and settled himself into position to face the first delivery  whether it is due to the pure air of the country or to daily manual toil is not known but the fact remains that bowlers in village matches whatever their other shortcomings seldom fall short in the matter of speed the present trundler having swung his arm round like a flail bounded to the crease and sent down a ball which hummed in the air it pitched halfway between the wickets in a slight hollow caused by the foot of a cow and shot dick reached blindly forward and the next moment his offstump was out of the ground  a howl of approval went up from the supporters of the enemy lying under the trees  tom sat down limp with joy dick out for a duck what incredible good fortune he began to frame in his mind epigrammatic sentences for use in the scene which would so shortly take place between miss dolly burn and himself the next man came in and played flukily but successfully through the rest of the over just a single said tom to himself as he faced the bowler at the other end just one solitary single miss burnmay i call you dolly do you remember that moonlight night on the char in my canadian canoe we two  s that shrieked bowler and wicketkeeper as one man  tom looked blankly at them he had not gone within a mile and a half of the ball he was certain and yetthere was the umpire with his hand raised as if he were the pope bestowing a blessing  he walked quickly back to the trees flung off his pads and began to smoke furiously  well said a voice  dick was standing before him grinning like a gargoyle  of all the absolutely delirious decisions began tom  oh yes said dick rudely i know all about that why i could hear the click from where i was sitting the point is whats to be done now we shall have to settle it on the second innings  if there is one  oh therell be a second innings all right theres another man out on a wicket like this we shall all be out in an hour and well have the other side out in another hour and then well start again on this business i shall play a big game next innings it was only that infernal ball shooting that did me  and i said tom if the umpire has got over his fit of delirium tremens or been removed to colney hatch shall almost certainly make a century  it was four oclock by the time tom and dick went to the wickets for the second time their side had been headed by their opponents by a dozen on the first innings68 to 56  a splendid spirit of confidence animated the two batsmen the umpire who had effected toms downfall in the first innings had since received a hard drive in the small of the back as he turned coyly away to avoid the ball and was now being massaged by strong men in the taproom of the village inn it was the sort of occurrence said tom which proved once and for all the existence of an allseeing benevolent providence  as for dick he had smoothed out a few of the more important mountainranges which marred the smoothness of the wicket and was feeling that all was right with the world  the pair started well the demon bowler of the enemy having been fêted considerably under the trees by enthusiastic admirers during the innings of his side was a little incoherent in his deliveries four fullpitches did he send down to dick in his first over and dick had placed 16 to his credit before tom who had had to look on anxiously had opened his account dick was a slow scorer as a rule but he knew a fullpitch to leg when he saw one  from his place at the other crease tom could see miss burn and her mother sitting under the trees watching the game  the sight nerved him by the time he had played through his first over he had reduced dicks lead by half an oyster would have hit out in such circumstances and tom was always an aggressive batsman by the end of the third over the scores were level each had made 20  enthusiasm ran high amongst the spectators or such of them as were natives of the village such a stand for the first wicket had not been seen in all the matches ever played in the neighbourhood when tom with a nice straight drive which should have been a 4 but was stopped by a cow and turned into a single brought up the century small boys burst buttons and octogenarians wept like babes  the bowling was collared the demon had long since retired grumbling to the deep field weird trundlers with actions like nothing else on earth had been tried had fired their ringing shot and passed one individual had gone on with lobs to the acute delight of everybody except the fieldsmen who had to retrieve the balls and the abovementioned cow and still tom and dick stayed in and smote while in the west the sun slowly sank  the rev henry looked anxious it was magnificent but it must not be overdone a little more and they would not have time to get the foe out for the second time in which case the latter would win on the first innings and this thought was as gall to him  he walked out and addressed the rival captain  i think said he we will close our innings  tom and dick made two beelines for the scorer and waited palpitatingly for the verdict  whats my score panted tom  fiftyfower sur  and mine gasped dick  fiftyfower too sur                                       you see my dear fellows said the rev henry when they had finishedand his voice was like unto oil that is poured into a woundwe had to win this match and if you had gone on batting we should not have had time to get them out as it is we shall have to hurry  but hang it said tom  but look here said dick  yes  what on earth are we to do said tom  were in precisely the same hole as we were before said dick  we dont know how to manage it  were absolutely bunkered  our competition you see  about miss burn dont you know  which is to propose first  we cant settle it  the rev henry smiled a faint saintly smile and raised a protesting hand  my advice he said is that both of you should refrain from proposing  what said dick  whaat said tom  you see purred the rev henry you are both very young fellows probably you do not know your own minds you take these things too seri  now look here said tom  none of that rot said dick  i shall propose tonight  i shall propose this evening  i shouldnt said the rev henry the fact is  well  well  i didnt tell you before for fear it should put you off your game but miss burn is engaged already and has been for three days  the two rivals started  engaged cried tom  whom to hissed dick  me murmured harry     jeeves takes charge   now touching this business of old jeevesmy man you knowhow do we stand lots of people think im much too dependent on him my aunt agatha in fact has even gone so far as to call him my keeper well what i say is why not the mans a genius from the collar upward he stands alone i gave up trying to run my own affairs within a week of his coming to me that was about half a dozen years ago directly after the rather rummy business of florence craye my uncle willoughbys book and edwin the boy scout  the thing really began when i got back to easeby my uncles place in shropshire i was spending a week or so there as i generally did in the summer and i had had to break my visit to come back to london to get a new valet i had found meadowes the fellow i had taken to easeby with me sneaking my silk socks a thing no bloke of spirit could stick at any price it transpiring moreover that he had looted a lot of other things here and there about the place i was reluctantly compelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten and go to london to ask the registry office to dig up another specimen for my approval they sent me jeeves  i shall always remember the morning he came it so happened that the night before i had been present at a rather cheery little supper and i was feeling pretty rocky on top of this i was trying to read a book florence craye had given me she had been one of the houseparty at easeby and two or three days before i left we had got engaged i was due back at the end of the week and i knew she would expect me to have finished the book by then you see she was particularly keen on boosting me up a bit nearer her own plane of intellect she was a girl with a wonderful profile but steeped to the gills in serious purpose i cant give you a better idea of the way things stood than by telling you that the book shed given me to read was called types of ethical theory and that when i opened it at random i struck a page beginning      the postulate or common understanding involved in speech is     certainly coextensive in the obligation it carries with the     social organism of which language is the instrument and the     ends of which it is an effort to subserve  all perfectly true no doubt but not the sort of thing to spring on a lad with a morning head  i was doing my best to skim through this bright little volume when the bell rang i crawled off the sofa and opened the door a kind of darkish sort of respectful johnnie stood without  i was sent by the agency sir he said i was given to understand that you required a valet  id have preferred an undertaker but i told him to stagger in and he floated noiselessly through the doorway like a healing zephyr that impressed me from the start meadowes had had flat feet and used to clump this fellow didnt seem to have any feet at all he just streamed in he had a grave sympathetic face as if he too knew what it was to sup with the lads  excuse me sir he said gently  then he seemed to flicker and wasnt there any longer i heard him moving about in the kitchen and presently he came back with a glass on a tray  if you would drink this sir he said with a kind of bedside manner rather like the royal doctor shooting the bracer into the sick prince it is a little preparation of my own invention it is the worcester sauce that gives it its colour the raw egg makes it nutritious the red pepper gives it its bite gentlemen have told me they have found it extremely invigorating after a late evening  i would have clutched at anything that looked like a lifeline that morning i swallowed the stuff for a moment i felt as if somebody had touched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my throat with a lighted torch and then everything seemed suddenly to get all right the sun shone in through the window birds twittered in the treetops and generally speaking hope dawned once more  youre engaged i said as soon as i could say anything  i perceived clearly that this cove was one of the worlds wonders the sort no home should be without  thank you sir my name is jeeves  you can start in at once  immediately sir  because im due down at easeby in shropshire the day after tomorrow  very good sir he looked past me at the mantelpiece that is an excellent likeness of lady florence craye sir it is two years since i saw her ladyship i was at one time in lord worplesdons employment i tendered my resignation because i could not see eye to eye with his lordship in his desire to dine in dress trousers a flannel shirt and a shooting coat  he couldnt tell me anything i didnt know about the old boys eccentricity this lord worplesdon was florences father he was the old buster who a few years later came down to breakfast one morning lifted the first cover he saw said eggs eggs eggs damn all eggs in an overwrought sort of voice and instantly legged it for france never to return to the bosom of his family this mind you being a bit of luck for the bosom of the family for old worplesdon had the worst temper in the county  i had known the family ever since i was a kid and from boyhood up this old boy had put the fear of death into me time the great healer could never remove from my memory the occasion when he found methen a stripling of fifteensmoking one of his special cigars in the stables he got after me with a huntingcrop just at the moment when i was beginning to realise that what i wanted most on earth was solitude and repose and chased me more than a mile across difficult country if there was a flaw so to speak in the pure joy of being engaged to florence it was the fact that she rather took after her father and one was never certain when she might erupt she had a wonderful profile though  lady florence and i are engaged jeeves i said  indeed sir  you know there was a kind of rummy something about his manner perfectly all right and all that but not what youd call chirpy it somehow gave me the impression that he wasnt keen on florence well of course it wasnt my business i supposed that while he had been valeting old worplesdon she must have trodden on his toes in some way florence was a dear girl and seen sideways most awfully goodlooking but if she had a fault it was a tendency to be a bit imperious with the domestic staff  at this point in the proceedings there was another ring at the front door jeeves shimmered out and came back with a telegram i opened it it ran      return immediately extremely urgent catch first train     florence  rum i said  sir  oh nothing  it shows how little i knew jeeves in those days that i didnt go a bit deeper into the matter with him nowadays i would never dream of reading a rummy communication without asking him what he thought of it and this one was devilish odd what i mean is florence knew i was going back to easeby the day after tomorrow anyway so why the hurry call something must have happened of course but i couldnt see what on earth it could be  jeeves i said we shall be going down to easeby this afternoon can you manage it  certainly sir  you can get your packing done and all that  without any difficulty sir which suit will you wear for the journey  this one  i had on a rather sprightly young check that morning to which i was a good deal attached i fancied it in fact more than a little it was perhaps rather sudden till you got used to it but nevertheless an extremely sound effort which many lads at the club and elsewhere had admired unrestrainedly  very good sir  again there was that kind of rummy something in his manner it was the way he said it dont you know he didnt like the suit i pulled myself together to assert myself something seemed to tell me that unless i was jolly careful and nipped this lad in the bud he would be starting to boss me he had the aspect of a distinctly resolute blighter  well i wasnt going to have any of that sort of thing by jove id seen so many cases of fellows who had become perfect slaves to their valets i remember poor old aubrey fothergill telling mewith absolute tears in his eyes poor chapone night at the club that he had been compelled to give up a favourite pair of brown shoes simply because meekyn his man disapproved of them you have to keep these fellows in their place dont you know you have to work the good old ironhandinthevelvetglove wheeze if you give them a whatsitsname they take a thingummy  dont you like this suit jeeves i said coldly  oh yes sir  well what dont you like about it  it is a very nice suit sir  well whats wrong with it out with it dash it  if i might make the suggestion sir a simple brown or blue with a hint of some quiet twill  what absolute rot  very good sir  perfectly blithering my dear man  as you say sir  i felt as if i had stepped on the place where the last stair ought to have been but wasnt i felt defiant if you know what i mean and there didnt seem anything to defy  all right then i said  yes sir  and then he went away to collect his kit while i started in again on types of ethical theory and took a stab at a chapter headed idiopsychological ethics                                       most of the way down in the train that afternoon i was wondering what could be up at the other end i simply couldnt see what could have happened easeby wasnt one of those country houses you read about in the society novels where young girls are lured on to play baccarat and then skinned to the bone of their jewellery and so on the houseparty i had left had consisted entirely of lawabiding birds like myself  besides my uncle wouldnt have let anything of that kind go on in his house he was a rather stiff precise sort of old boy who liked a quiet life he was just finishing a history of the family or something which he had been working on for the last year and didnt stir much from the library he was rather a good instance of what they say about its being a good scheme for a fellow to sow his wild oats id been told that in his youth uncle willoughby had been a bit of a rounder you would never have thought it to look at him now  when i got to the house oakshott the butler told me that florence was in her room watching her maid pack apparently there was a dance on at a house about twenty miles away that night and she was motoring over with some of the easeby lot and would be away some nights oakshott said she had told him to tell her the moment i arrived so i trickled into the smokingroom and waited and presently in she came a glance showed me that she was perturbed and even peeved her eyes had a goggly look and altogether she appeared considerably pipped darling i said and attempted the good old embrace but she sidestepped like a bantam weight  dont  whats the matter  everythings the matter bertie you remember asking me when you left to make myself pleasant to your uncle  yes  the idea being of course that as at that time i was more or less dependent on uncle willoughby i couldnt very well marry without his approval and though i knew he wouldnt have any objection to florence having known her father since they were at oxford together i hadnt wanted to take any chances so i had told her to make an effort to fascinate the old boy  you told me it would please him particularly if i asked him to read me some of his history of the family  wasnt he pleased  he was delighted he finished writing the thing yesterday afternoon and read me nearly all of it last night i have never had such a shock in my life the book is an outrage it is impossible it is horrible  but dash it the family werent so bad as all that  it is not a history of the family at all your uncle has written his reminiscences he calls them recollections of a long life  i began to understand as i say uncle willoughby had been somewhat on the tabasco side as a young man and it began to look as if he might have turned out something pretty fruity if he had started recollecting his long life  if half of what he has written is true said florence your uncles youth must have been perfectly appalling the moment we began to read he plunged straight into a most scandalous story of how he and my father were thrown out of a musichall in 1887  why  i decline to tell you why  it must have been something pretty bad it took a lot to make them chuck people out of musichalls in 1887  your uncle specifically states that father had drunk a quart and a half of champagne before beginning the evening she went on the book is full of stories like that there is a dreadful one about lord emsworth  lord emsworth not the one we know not the one at blandings  a most respectable old johnnie dont you know doesnt do a thing nowadays but dig in the garden with a spud  the very same that is what makes the book so unspeakable it is full of stories about people one knows who are the essence of propriety today but who seem to have behaved when they were in london in the eighties in a manner that would not have been tolerated in the focsle of a whaler your uncle seems to remember everything disgraceful that happened to anybody when he was in his early twenties there is a story about sir stanley gervasegervase at rosherville gardens which is ghastly in its perfection of detail it seems that sir stanleybut i cant tell you  have a dash  no  oh well i shouldnt worry no publisher will print the book if its as bad as all that  on the contrary your uncle told me that all negotiations are settled with riggs and ballinger and hes sending off the manuscript tomorrow for immediate publication they make a special thing of that sort of book they published lady carnabys memories of eighty interesting years  i read em  well then when i tell you that lady carnabys memories are simply not to be compared with your uncles recollections you will understand my state of mind and father appears in nearly every story in the book i am horrified at the things he did when he was a young man  whats to be done  the manuscript must be intercepted before it reaches riggs and ballinger and destroyed  i sat up  this sounded rather sporting  how are you going to do it i enquired  how can i do it didnt i tell you the parcel goes off tomorrow i am going to the murgatroyds dance tonight and shall not be back till monday you must do it that is why i telegraphed to you  what  she gave me a look  do you mean to say you refuse to help me bertie  no buti say  its quite simple  but even if iwhat i mean isof course anything i can dobutif you know what i mean  you say you want to marry me bertie  yes of course but still  for a moment she looked exactly like her old father  i will never marry you if those recollections are published  but florence old thing  i mean it you may look on it as a test bertie if you have the resource and courage to carry this thing through i will take it as evidence that you are not the vapid and shiftless person most people think you if you fail i shall know that your aunt agatha was right when she called you a spineless invertebrate and advised me strongly not to marry you it will be perfectly simple for you to intercept the manuscript bertie it only requires a little resolution  but suppose uncle willoughby catches me at it hed cut me off with a bob  if you care more for your uncles money than for me  no no rather not  very well then the parcel containing the manuscript will of course be placed on the hall table tomorrow for oakshott to take to the village with the letters all you have to do is to take it away and destroy it then your uncle will think it has been lost in the post  it sounded thin to me  hasnt he got a copy of it  no it has not been typed he is sending the manuscript just as he wrote it  but he could write it over again  as if he would have the energy  but  if you are going to do nothing but make absurd objections bertie  i was only pointing things out  well dont once and for all will you do me this quite simple act of kindness  the way she put it gave me an idea  why not get edwin to do it keep it in the family kind of dont you know besides it would be a boon to the kid  a jolly bright idea it seemed to me edwin was her young brother who was spending his holidays at easeby he was a ferretfaced kid whom i had disliked since birth as a matter of fact talking of recollections and memories it was young blighted edwin who nine years before had led his father to where i was smoking his cigar and caused all of the unpleasantness he was fourteen now and had just joined the boy scouts he was one of those thorough kids and took his responsibilities pretty seriously he was always in a sort of fever because he was dropping behind schedule with his daily acts of kindness however hard he tried hed fall behind and then you would find him prowling about the house setting such a clip to try and catch up with himself that easeby was rapidly becoming a perfect hell for man and beast  the idea didnt seem to strike florence  i shall do nothing of the kind bertie i wonder you cant appreciate the compliment i am paying youtrusting you like this  oh i see that all right but what i mean is edwin would do it so much better than i would these boy scouts are up to all sorts of dodges they spoor dont you know and take cover and creep about and what not  bertie will you or will you not do this perfectly trivial thing for me if not say so now and let us end this farce of pretending that you care a snap of the fingers for me  dear old soul i love you devotedly  then will you or will you not  oh all right i said all right all right all right  and then i tottered forth to think it over i met jeeves in the passage just outside  i beg your pardon sir i was endeavouring to find you  whats the matter  i felt that i should tell you sir that somebody has been putting black polish on our brown walking shoes  what who why  i could not say sir  can anything be done with them  nothing sir  damn  very good sir                                       ive often wondered since then how these murderer fellows manage to keep in shape while theyre contemplating their next effort i had a much simpler sort of job on hand and the thought of it rattled me to such an extent in the night watches that i was a perfect wreck next day dark circles under the eyesi give you my word i had to call on jeeves to rally round with one of those lifesavers of his  from breakfast on i felt like a bagsnatcher at a railway station i had to hang about waiting for the parcel to be put on the hall table and it wasnt put uncle willoughby was a fixture in the library adding the finishing touches to the great work i supposed and the more i thought the thing over the less i liked it the chances against my pulling it off seemed about three to two and the thought of what would happen if i didnt gave me cold shivers down the spine uncle willoughby was a pretty mild sort of old boy as a rule but ive known him to cut up rough and by jove he was scheduled to extend himself if he caught me trying to get away with his life work  it wasnt till nearly four that he toddled out of the library with the parcel under his arm put it on the table and toddled off again i was hiding a bit to the southeast at the moment behind a suit of armour i bounded out and legged it for the table then i nipped upstairs to hide the swag i charged in like a mustang and nearly stubbed my toe on young blighted edwin the boy scout he was standing at the chest of drawers confound him messing about with my ties  hallo he said  what are you doing here  im tidying your room its my last saturdays act of kindness  last saturdays  im five days behind i was six till last night but i polished your shoes  was it you  yes did you see them i just happened to think of it i was in here looking round mr berkeley had this room while you were away he left this morning i thought perhaps he might have left something in it that i could have sent on ive often done acts of kindness that way  you must be a comfort to one and all  it became more and more apparent to me that this infernal kid must somehow be turned out eftsoons or right speedily i had hidden the parcel behind my back and i didnt think he had seen it but i wanted to get at that chest of drawers quick before anyone else came along  i shouldnt bother about tidying the room i said  i like tidying it its not a bit of troublereally  but its quite tidy now  not so tidy as i shall make it  this was getting perfectly rotten i didnt want to murder the kid and yet there didnt seem any other way of shifting him i pressed down the mental accelerator the old lemon throbbed fiercely i got an idea  theres something much kinder than that which you could do i said you see that box of cigars take it down to the smokingroom and snip off the ends for me that would save me no end of trouble stagger along laddie  he seemed a bit doubtful but he staggered i shoved the parcel into a drawer locked it trousered the key and felt better i might be a chump but dash it i could outgeneral a mere kid with a face like a ferret i went downstairs again just as i was passing the smokingroom door out curveted edwin it seemed to me that if he wanted to do a real act of kindness he would commit suicide  im snipping them he said  snip on snip on  do you like them snipped much or only a bit  medium  all right ill be getting on then  i should  and we parted  fellows who know all about that sort of thingdetectives and so onwill tell you that the most difficult thing in the world is to get rid of the body i remember as a kid having to learn by heart a poem about a bird by the name of eugene aram who had the deuce of a job in this respect all i can recall of the actual poetry is the bit that goes      tumtum tumtum tumtumtytum     i slew him tumtumtum  but i recollect that the poor blighter spent much of his valuable time dumping the corpse into ponds and burying it and what not only to have it pop out at him again it was about an hour after i had shoved the parcel into the drawer when i realised that i had let myself in for just the same sort of thing  florence had talked in an airy sort of way about destroying the manuscript but when one came down to it how the deuce can a chap destroy a great chunky mass of paper in somebody elses house in the middle of summer i couldnt ask to have a fire in my bedroom with the thermometer in the eighties and if i didnt burn the thing how else could i get rid of it fellows on the battlefield eat dispatches to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy but it would have taken me a year to eat uncle willoughbys recollections  im bound to say the problem absolutely baffled me the only thing seemed to be to leave the parcel in the drawer and hope for the best  i dont know whether you have ever experienced it but its a dashed unpleasant thing having a crime on ones conscience towards the end of the day the mere sight of the drawer began to depress me i found myself getting all on edge and once when uncle willoughby trickled silently into the smokingroom when i was alone there and spoke to me before i knew he was there i broke the record for the sitting high jump  i was wondering all the time when uncle willoughby would sit up and take notice i didnt think he would have time to suspect that anything had gone wrong till saturday morning when he would be expecting of course to get the acknowledgment of the manuscript from the publishers but early on friday evening he came out of the library as i was passing and asked me to step in he was looking considerably rattled  bertie he saidhe always spoke in a precise sort of pompous kind of wayan exceedingly disturbing thing has happened as you know i dispatched the manuscript of my book to messrs riggs and ballinger the publishers yesterday afternoon it should have reached them by the first post this morning why i should have been uneasy i cannot say but my mind was not altogether at rest respecting the safety of the parcel i therefore telephoned to messrs riggs and ballinger a few moments back to make enquiries to my consternation they informed me that they were not yet in receipt of my manuscript  very rum  i recollect distinctly placing it myself on the hall table in good time to be taken to the village but here is a sinister thing i have spoken to oakshott who took the rest of the letters to the post office and he cannot recall seeing it there he is indeed unswerving in his assertions that when he went to the hall to collect the letters there was no parcel among them  sounds funny  bertie shall i tell you what i suspect  whats that  the suspicion will no doubt sound to you incredible but it alone seems to fit the facts as we know them i incline to the belief that the parcel has been stolen  oh i say surely not  wait hear me out though i have said nothing to you before or to anyone else concerning the matter the fact remains that during the past few weeks a number of objectssome valuable others nothave disappeared in this house the conclusion to which one is irresistibly impelled is that we have a kleptomaniac in our midst it is a peculiarity of kleptomania as you are no doubt aware that the subject is unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of objects he will purloin an old coat as readily as a diamond ring or a tobacco pipe costing but a few shillings with the same eagerness as a purse of gold the fact that this manuscript of mine could be of no possible value to any outside person convinces me that  but uncle one moment i know all about those things that were stolen it was meadowes my man who pinched them i caught him snaffling my silk socks right in the act by jove  he was tremendously impressed  you amaze me bertie send for the man at once and question him  but he isnt here you see directly i found that he was a socksneaker i gave him the boot thats why i went to londonto get a new man  then if the man meadowes is no longer in the house it could not be he who purloined my manuscript the whole thing is inexplicable  after which we brooded for a bit uncle willoughby pottered about the room registering baffledness while i sat sucking at a cigarette feeling rather like a chappie id once read about in a book who murdered another cove and hid the body under the diningroom table and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party with it there all the time my guilty secret oppressed me to such an extent that after a while i couldnt stick it any longer i lit another cigarette and started for a stroll in the grounds by way of cooling off  it was one of those still evenings you get in the summer when you can hear a snail clear its throat a mile away the sun was sinking over the hills and the gnats were fooling about all over the place and everything smelled rather toppingwhat with the falling dew and so onand i was just beginning to feel a little soothed by the peace of it all when suddenly i heard my name spoken  its about bertie  it was the loathsome voice of young blighted edwin for a moment i couldnt locate it then i realised that it came from the library my stroll had taken me within a few yards of the open window  i had often wondered how those johnnies in books did iti mean the fellows with whom it was the work of a moment to do about a dozen things that ought to have taken them about ten minutes but as a matter of fact it was the work of a moment with me to chuck away my cigarette swear a bit leap about ten yards dive into a bush that stood near the library window and stand there with my ears flapping i was as certain as ive ever been of anything that all sorts of rotten things were in the offing  about bertie i heard uncle willoughby say  about bertie and your parcel i heard you talking to him just now i believe hes got it  when i tell you that just as i heard these frightful words a fairly substantial beetle of sorts dropped from the bush down the back of my neck and i couldnt even stir to squash the same you will understand that i felt pretty rotten everything seemed against me  what do you mean boy i was discussing the disappearance of my manuscript with bertie only a moment back and he professed himself as perplexed by the mystery as myself  well i was in his room yesterday afternoon doing him an act of kindness and he came in with a parcel i could see it though he tried to keep it behind his back and then he asked me to go to the smokingroom and snip some cigars for him and about two minutes afterwards he came downand he wasnt carrying anything so it must be in his room  i understand they deliberately teach these dashed boy scouts to cultivate their powers of observation and deduction and what not devilish thoughtless and inconsiderate of them i call it look at the trouble it causes  it sounds incredible said uncle willoughby thereby bucking me up a trifle  shall i go and look in his room asked young blighted edwin im sure the parcels there  but what could be his motive for perpetrating this extraordinary theft  perhaps hes awhat you said just now  a kleptomaniac impossible  it might have been bertie who took all those things from the very start suggested the little brute hopefully he may be like raffles  raffles  hes a chap in a book who went about pinching things  i cannot believe that bertie wouldahgo about pinching things  well im sure hes got the parcel ill tell you what you might do you might say that mr berkeley wired that he had left something here he had berties room you know you might say you wanted to look for it  that would be possible i  i didnt wait to hear any more things were getting too hot i sneaked softly out of my bush and raced for the front door i sprinted up to my room and made for the drawer where i had put the parcel and then i found i hadnt the key it wasnt for the deuce of a time that i recollected i had shifted it to my evening trousers the night before and must have forgotten to take it out again  where the dickens were my evening things i had looked all over the place before i remembered that jeeves must have taken them away to brush to leap at the bell and ring it was with me the work of a moment i had just rung it when there was a footstep outside and in came uncle willoughby  oh bertie he said without a blush i haveahreceived a telegram from berkeley who occupied this room in your absence asking me to forward him hiserhis cigarettecase which it would appear he inadvertently omitted to take with him when he left the house i cannot find it downstairs and it has therefore occurred to me that he may have left it in this room i willerjust take a look around  it was one of the most disgusting spectacles ive ever seenthis whitehaired old man who should have been thinking of the hereafter standing there lying like an actor  i havent seen it anywhere i said  nevertheless i will search i mustahspare no effort  i should have seen it if it had been herewhat  it may have escaped your notice it iserpossibly in one of the drawers  he began to nose about he pulled out drawer after drawer pottering around like an old bloodhound and babbling from time to time about berkeley and his cigarettecase in a way that struck me as perfectly ghastly i just stood there losing weight every moment  then he came to the drawer where the parcel was  this appears to be locked he said rattling the handle  yes i shouldnt bother about that one ititserlocked and all that sort of thing  you have not the key  a soft respectful voice spoke behind me  i fancy sir that this must be the key you require it was in the pocket of your evening trousers  it was jeeves he had shimmered in carrying my evening things and was standing there holding out the key i could have massacred the man  thank you said my uncle  not at all sir  the next moment uncle willoughby had opened the drawer i shut my eyes  no said uncle willoughby there is nothing here the drawer is empty thank you bertie i hope i have not disturbed you i fancyerberkeley must have taken his case with him after all  when he had gone i shut the door carefully then i turned to jeeves the man was putting my evening things out on a chair  erjeeves  sir  oh nothing  it was deuced difficult to know how to begin  erjeeves  sir  did youwas therehave you by chance  i removed the parcel this morning sir  ohahwhy  i considered it more prudent sir  i mused for a while  of course i suppose all this seems tolerably rummy to you jeeves  not at all sir i chanced to overhear you and lady florence speaking of the matter the other evening sir  did you by jove  yes sir  wellerjeeves i think that on the whole if you were toas it werefreeze on to that parcel until we get back to london  exactly sir  and then we mighterso to speakchuck it away somewherewhat  precisely sir  ill leave it in your hands  entirely sir  you know jeeves youre by way of being rather a topper  i endeavour to give satisfaction sir  one in a million by jove  it is very kind of you to say so sir  well thats about all then i think  very good sir  florence came back on monday i didnt see her till we were all having tea in the hall it wasnt till the crowd had cleared away a bit that we got a chance of having a word together  well bertie she said  its all right  you have destroyed the manuscript  not exactly but  what do you mean  i mean i havent absolutely  bertie your manner is furtive  its all right its this way  and i was just going to explain how things stood when out of the library came leaping uncle willoughby looking as braced as a twoyearold the old boy was a changed man  a most remarkable thing bertie i have just been speaking with mr riggs on the telephone and he tells me he received my manuscript by the first post this morning i cannot imagine what can have caused the delay our postal facilities are extremely inadequate in the rural districts i shall write to headquarters about it it is insufferable if valuable parcels are to be delayed in this fashion  i happened to be looking at florences profile at the moment and at this juncture she swung round and gave me a look that went right through me like a knife uncle willoughby meandered back to the library and there was a silence that you could have dug bits out of with a spoon  i cant understand it i said at last i cant understand it by jove  i can i can understand it perfectly bertie your heart failed you rather than risk offending your uncle you  no no absolutely  you preferred to lose me rather than risk losing the money perhaps you did not think i meant what i said i meant every word our engagement is ended  buti say  not another word  but florence old thing  i do not wish to hear any more i see now that your aunt agatha was perfectly right i consider that i have had a very lucky escape there was a time when i thought that with patience you might be moulded into something worth while i see now that you are impossible  and she popped off leaving me to pick up the pieces when i had collected the debris to some extent i went to my room and rang for jeeves he came in looking as if nothing had happened or was ever going to happen he was the calmest thing in captivity  jeeves i yelled jeeves that parcel has arrived in london  yes sir  did you send it  yes sir i acted for the best sir i think that both you and lady florence overestimated the danger of people being offended at being mentioned in sir willoughbys recollections it has been my experience sir that the normal person enjoys seeing his or her name in print irrespective of what is said about them i have an aunt sir who a few years ago was a martyr to swollen limbs she tried walkinshaws supreme ointment and obtained considerable reliefso much so that she sent them an unsolicited testimonial her pride at seeing her photograph in the daily papers in connection with descriptions of her lower limbs before taking which were nothing less than revolting was so intense that it led me to believe that publicity of whatever sort is what nearly everybody desires moreover if you have ever studied psychology sir you will know that respectable old gentlemen are by no means averse to having it advertised that they were extremely wild in their youth i have an uncle  i cursed his aunts and his uncles and him and all the rest of the family  do you know that lady florence has broken off her engagement with me  indeed sir  not a bit of sympathy i might have been telling him it was a fine day  youre sacked  very good sir  he coughed gently  as i am no longer in your employment sir i can speak freely without appearing to take a liberty in my opinion you and lady florence were quite unsuitably matched her ladyship is of a highly determined and arbitrary temperament quite opposed to your own i was in lord worplesdons service for nearly a year during which time i had ample opportunities of studying her ladyship the opinion of the servants hall was far from favourable to her her ladyships temper caused a good deal of adverse comment among us it was at times quite impossible you would not have been happy sir  get out  i think you would also have found her educational methods a little trying sir i have glanced at the book her ladyship gave youit has been lying on your table since our arrivaland it is in my opinion quite unsuitable you would not have enjoyed it and i have it from her ladyships own maid who happened to overhear a conversation between her ladyship and one of the gentlemen staying heremr maxwell who is employed in an editorial capacity by one of the reviewsthat it was her intention to start you almost immediately upon nietzsche you would not enjoy nietzsche sir he is fundamentally unsound  get out  very good sir                                       its rummy how sleeping on a thing often makes you feel quite different about it its happened to me over and over again somehow or other when i woke next morning the old heart didnt feel half so broken as it had done it was a perfectly topping day and there was something about the way the sun came in at the window and the row the birds were kicking up in the ivy that made me half wonder whether jeeves wasnt right after all though she had a wonderful profile was it such a catch being engaged to florence craye as the casual observer might imagine wasnt there something in what jeeves had said about her character i began to realise that my ideal wife was something quite different something a lot more clinging and drooping and prattling and what not  i had got as far as this in thinking the thing out when that types of ethical theory caught my eye i opened it and i give you my honest word this was what hit me      of the two antithetic terms in the greek philosophy one only     was real and selfsubsisting and that one was ideal thought as     opposed to that which it has to penetrate and mould the other     corresponding to our nature was in itself phenomenal unreal     without any permanent footing having no predicates that held     true for two moments together in short redeemed from negation     only by including indwelling realities appearing through  welli mean to saywhat and nietzsche from all accounts a lot worse than that  jeeves i said when he came in with my morning tea ive been thinking it over youre engaged again  thank you sir  i sucked down a cheerful mouthful a great respect for this blokes judgment began to soak through me  oh jeeves i said about that check suit  yes sir  is it really a frost  a trifle too bizarre sir in my opinion  but lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is  doubtless in order to avoid him sir  hes supposed to be one of the best men in london  i am saying nothing against his moral character sir  i hesitated a bit i had a feeling that i was passing into this chappies clutches and that if i gave in now i should become just like poor old aubrey fothergill unable to call my soul my own on the other hand this was obviously a cove of rare intelligence and it would be a comfort in a lot of ways to have him doing the thinking for me i made up my mind  all right jeeves i said you know give the bally thing away to somebody  he looked down at me like a father gazing tenderly at the wayward child  thank you sir i gave it to the undergardener last night a little more tea sir     disentangling old duggie   doesnt some poet or philosopher fellow say that its when our intentions are best that we always make the worst breaks i cant put my hand on the passage but youll find it in shakespeare or somewhere im pretty certain  at any rate its always that way with me and the affair of douglas craye is a case in point  i had dined with duggie a dear old pal of mine one night at his club and as he was seeing me out he said reggie old topmy names reggie pepperreggie old top im rather worried  are you duggie old pal i said  yes reggie old fellow he said i am its like this the booles have asked me down to their place for the weekend and i dont know whether to go or not you see they have early breakfast and besides that theres a frightful risk of music after dinner on the other hand young roderick boole thinks he can play piquet  i should go i said  but im not sure rodericks going to be there this time  it was a problem and i didnt wonder poor old dug had looked pale and tired at dinner  then i had the idea which really started all the trouble  why dont you consult a palmist i said  that sounds a good idea said duggie  go and see dorothea in fortysecond street shes a wonder shell settle it for you in a second shell see from your lines that you are thinking of making a journey and shell either tell you to get a move on which will mean that roderick will be there or else to keep away because she sees disaster  you seem to be next to the game all right  ive been to a good many of them youll like dorothea  what did you say her name wasdorothea what do i do do i just walk in shant i feel a fearful chump how much do i give her  five bucks youd better write and make a date  all right said duggie but i know i shall look a frightful fool  about a week later i ran into him between the acts at the knickerbocker the old boy was beaming  reggie he said you did me the best turn anyones ever done me sending me to mrs darrell  mrs darrell  you know dorothea her real names darrell shes a widow her husband was in some regiment and left her without a penny its a frightfully pathetic story havent time to tell you now my boy shes a marvel she had hardly looked at my hand when she said you will prosper in any venture you undertake and next day by george i went down to the booles and separated young roderick from seventy dollars shes a wonderful woman did you ever see just that shade of hair  i didnt notice her hair  he gaped at me in a sort of petrified astonishment  youdidntnoticeherhair he gasped  i cant fix the dates exactly but it must have been about three weeks after this that i got a telegram      call madison avenue immediatelyflorence craye  she neednt have signed her name i should have known who it was from by the wording ever since i was a kid duggies sister florence has oppressed me to the most fearful extent not that im the only one her brothers live in terror of her i know especially edwin hes never been able to get away from her and its absolutely broken his spirit hes a mild hopeless sort of chump who spends all his time at homethey live near philadelphiaand has never been known to come to new york hes writing a history of the family or something i believe  you see events have conspired so to speak to let florence do pretty much as she likes with them originally there was old man craye duggies father who made a fortune out of the soup trust duggies elder brother edwin florence and duggie mrs craye has been dead some years then came the smash it happened through the old man most people if you ask them will tell you that he ought to be in bloomingdale and im not sure theyre not right at any rate one morning he came down to breakfast lifted the first cover on the sideboard said in a sort of despairing way eggs eggs eggs curse all eggs and walked out of the room nobody thought much of it till about an hour afterward when they found that he had packed a grip left the house and caught the train to new york next day they got a letter from him saying that he was off to europe never to return and that all communications were to be addressed to his lawyers and from that day on none of them had seen him he wrote occasionally generally from paris and that was all  well directly news of this got about down swooped a series of aunts to grab the helm they didnt stay long florence had them out one after the other in no time if any lingering doubt remained in their minds dont you know as to who was going to be boss at home it wasnt her fault since then she has run the show  i went to madison avenue it was one of the aunts houses there was no sign of the aunt when i calledshe had probably climbed a tree and pulled it up after herbut florence was there  she is a tall woman with what i believe is called a presence her eyes are bright and black and have a way of getting right inside you dont you know and running up and down your spine she has a deep voice she is about ten years older than duggies brother edwin who is six years older than duggie  good afternoon she said sit down  i poured myself into a chair  reginald she said what is this i hear about douglas  i said i didnt know  he says that you introduced him  eh  to this womanthis mrs darrell  mrs darrell  my memorys pretty rocky and the name conveyed nothing to me  she pulled out a letter  yes she said mrs dorothy darrell  great scott dorothea  her eyes resumed their spine drill  who is she  only a palmist  only a palmist her voice absolutely boomed well my brother douglas is engaged to be married to her  many happy returns of the day i said  i dont know why i said it it wasnt what i meant to say im not sure i meant to say anything  she glared at me by this time i was pure jelly i simply flowed about the chair  you are facetious reginald she said  no no no i shouted it slipped out i wouldnt be facetious for worlds  i am glad it is no laughing matter have you any suggestions  suggestions  you dont imagine it can be allowed to go on the engagement must be broken of course but how  why dont you tell him he mustnt  i shall naturally express my strong disapproval but it may not be effective when out of the reach of my personal influence my wretched brother is selfwilled to a degree  i saw what she meant good old duggie wasnt going to have those eyes patrolling his spine if he knew it he meant to keep away and conduct this business by letter there was going to be no personal interview with sister if he had to dodge about america like a snipe  we sat for a long time without speaking then i became rather subtle i had a brainwave and saw my way to making things right for dug and at the same time squaring myself with florence after all i thought the old boy couldnt keep away from home for the rest of his life he would have to go there sooner or later and my scheme made it pleasant and easy for him  ill tell you what i should do if i were you i said im not sure i didnt read some book or see some play somewhere or other where they tried it on and it worked all right fellow got engaged to a girl and the family didnt like it but instead of kicking they pretended to be tickled to pieces and had the fellow and the girl down to visit them and then after the fellow had seen the girl with the home circle as a background dont you know he came to the conclusion that it wouldnt do and broke off the engagement  it seemed to strike her  i hardly expected so sensible a suggestion from you reginald she said it is a very good plan it shows that you really have a definite substratum of intelligence and it is all the more deplorable that you should idle your way through the world as you do when you might be performing some really useful work  that was florence all over even when she patted you on the head she had to do it with her knuckles  i will invite them down next week she went on you had better come too  its awfully kind of you but the fact is  next wednesday take the threefortyseven  i met duggie next day he was looking happy but puzzled like a man who has found a dime on the street and is wondering if theres a string tied to it i congratulated him on his engagement  reggie he said a queer thing has happened i feel as if id trodden on the last step when it wasnt there ive just had a letter from my sister florence asking me to bring dorothy home on wednesday florence doesnt seem to object to the idea of the engagement at all and id expected that id have to call out the police reserves when she heard of it i believe theres a catch somewhere  i tapped him on the breastbone  there is dug i said and ill tell you what it is i saw her yesterday and i can put you next to the game she thinks that if you see mrs darrell mingling with the home circle youll see flaws in her which you dont see when you dont see her mingling with the home circle dont you see do you see now  he laughedheroically dont you know  im afraid shell be disappointed love like mine is not dependent on environment  which wasnt bad i thought if it was his own  i said goodby to him and toddled along rather pleased with myself it seemed to me that i had handled his affairs in a pretty masterly manner for a chap whos supposed to be one of the biggest chumps in new york  well of course the thing was an absolute fliver as i ought to have guessed it would be whatever could have induced me to think that a fellow like poor old dug stood a dogs chance against a determined female like his sister florence i cant imagine it was like expecting a rabbit to put up a show with a python from the very start there was only one possible end to the thing to a woman like florence who had trained herself as tough as whalebone by years of scrapping with her father and occasional bybattles with aunts it was as easy as killing rats with a stick  i was sorry for mrs darrell she was a really good sort and as a matter of fact just the kind of wife who would have done old duggie a bit of good and on her own ground i shouldnt wonder if she might not have made a fight for it but now she hadnt a chance poor old duggie was just like so much putty in florences hands when he couldnt get away from her you could see the sawdust trickling out of loves young dream in a steady flow  i took mrs darrell for a walk one afternoon to see if i couldnt cheer her up a bit but it wasnt much good she hardly spoke a word till we were on our way home then she said with a sort of jerk im going back to new york tomorrow mr pepper  i suppose i ought to have pretended to be surprised but i couldnt work it  im afraid youve had a bad time i said im very sorry  she laughed  thank you she said its nice of you to be sympathetic instead of tactful youre rather a dear mr pepper  i hadnt any remarks to make i whacked at a nettle with my stick  i shall break off my engagement after dinner so that douglas can have a good nights rest im afraid he has been brooding on the future a good deal it will be a great relief to him  oh no i said  oh yes i know exactly how he feels he thought he could carry me off but he finds he overestimated his powers he has remembered that he is a craye i imagine that the fact has been pointed out to him  if you ask my opinion i saidi was feeling pretty sore about itthat woman florence is an absolute cat  my dear mr pepper i wouldnt have dreamed of asking your opinion on such a delicate subject but im glad to have it thank you very much do i strike you as a vindictive woman mr pepper  i dont think you do i said  by nature i dont think i am but im feeling a little vindictive just at present  she stopped suddenly  i dont know why im boring you like this mr pepper she said for goodness sake lets be cheerful say something bright  i was going to take a whirl at it but she started in to talk and talked all the rest of the way she seemed to have cheered up a whole lot  she left next day i gather she fired duggie as per schedule for the old boy looked distinctly brighter and florence wore an offduty expression and was quite decently civil mrs darrell bore up all right she avoided duggie of course and put in most of the time talking to edwin he evidently appreciated it for i had never seen him look so nearly happy before  i went back to new york directly afterward and i hadnt been there much more than a week when a most remarkably queer thing happened turning in at hammersteins for half an hour one evening whom should i meet but brother edwin quite fairly festive with a fat cigar in his mouth hello reggie he said  what are you doing here i said  i had to come up to new york to look up a life of hilary de craye at the library i believe mister man was a sort of ancestor  this isnt the library  i was beginning to guess as much the difference is subtle but well marked  it struck me that there was another difference that was subtle but well marked and that was the difference between the edwin id left messing about over his family history a week before and the jovial rounder who was blowing smoke in my face now  as a matter of fact he said the library would be all the better for a little of this sort of thing its too conservative thats whats the trouble with the library whats the matter with having a crosstalk team and a few performing dogs there it would brighten the place up and attract custom reggie youre looking fatigued ive heard theres a place somewhere in this city if you can only find it expressly designed for supplying firstaid to the fatigued lets go and look for it  im not given to thinking much as a rule but i couldnt help pondering over this meeting with edwin its hard to make you see the remarkableness of the whole thing for of course if you look at it in one way theres nothing so recordbreaking in smoking a cigar and drinking a highball but then you have never seen edwin there are degrees in everything dont you know for edwin to behave as he did with me that night was simply nothing more nor less than a frightful outburst and it disturbed me not that i cared what edwin did as a rule but i couldnt help feeling a sort of whatdyoucallita presentiment that somehow in some way i didnt understand i was mixed up in it or was soon going to be i think the whole fearful family had got on my nerves to such an extent that the mere sight of any of them made me jumpy  and by george i was perfectly right dont you know in a day or two along came the usual telegram from florence telling me to come to madison avenue  the mere idea of madison avenue was beginning to give me that tired feeling and i made up my mind i wouldnt go near the place but of course i did when it came to the point i simply hadnt the common manly courage to keep away  florence was there as before  reginald she said i think i shall go raving mad  this struck me as a mighty happy solution of everybodys troubles but i felt it was too good to be true  over a week ago she went on my brother edwin came up to new york to consult a book at the library i anticipated that this would occupy perhaps an afternoon and was expecting him back by an early train next day he did not arrive he sent an incoherent telegram but even then i suspected nothing she paused yesterday morning she said i had a letter from my aunt augusta  she paused again she seemed to think i ought to be impressed  her eyes tied a bowknot in my spine  let me read you her letter no i will tell you its contents aunt augusta had seen edwin lunching at the waldorf with a creature  a what  my aunt described her her hair was of a curious dull bronze tint  your aunts  the womans it was then that i began to suspect how many women with dull bronze hair does edwin know  great scott why ask me  i had got used to being treated as a sort of hey bill by florence but i was darned if i was going to be expected to be an encyclopedia as well  one she said that appalling darrell woman  she drew a deep breath  yesterday evening she said i saw them together in a taximeter cab they were obviously on their way to some theatre  she fixed me with her eye  reginald she said you must go and see her the first thing tomorrow  what i cried me why why me  because you are responsible for the whole affair you introduced douglas to her you suggested that he should bring her home go to her tomorrow and ascertain her intentions  but  the very first thing  but wouldnt it be better to have a talk with edwin  i have made every endeavour to see edwin but he deliberately avoids me his answers to my telegrams are willfully evasive  there was no doubt that edwin had effected a thorough bolt he was having quite a pleasant little vacation two weeks in sunny new york and from what id seen of him he seemed to be thriving on it i didnt wonder florence had got rather anxious shed have been more anxious if she had seen him when i did hed got a sort of newyorkissobracing look about him which meant a whole heap of trouble before he trotted back to the fold  well i started off to interview mrs darrell and believe me i didnt like the prospect i think they ought to train a d t messengers to do this sort of thing i found her alone the rush hour of clients hadnt begun  how do you do mr pepper she said how nice of you to call  very friendly and all that it made the situation darned difficult for a fellow if you see what i mean  say i said what about it dont you know  i certainly dont she said what ought i to know about what  well about edwinedwin craye i said  she smiled  oh so youre an ambassador mr pepper  well as a matter of fact i did come to see if i could find out how things were running whats going to happen  are you consulting me professionally if so you must show me your hand or perhaps you would rather i showed you mine  it was subtle but i got on to it after a bit  yes i said i wish you would  very well do you remember a conversation we had mr pepper my last afternoon at the crayes we came to the conclusion that i was rather a vindictive woman  by george youre stringing old edwin so as to put one over on florence  she flushed a little  how very direct you are mr pepper how do you know im not very fond of mr craye at any rate im very sorry for him  hes such a chump  but hes improving every day have you seen him you must notice the difference  there is a difference  he only wanted taking out of himself i think he found his sister florences influence a little oppressive sometimes  no but see here i said are you going to marry him  im only a palmist i dont pretend to be a clairvoyant a marriage may be indicated in mr crayes hand but i couldnt say without looking at it  but i shall have to tell her something definite or she wont give me a moments peace  tell her her brother is of age surely thats definite enough  and i couldnt get any more out of her i went back to florence and reported she got pretty excited about it  oh if i were a man she said  i didnt see how that would have helped i said so  id go straight to edwin and drag him away he is staying at his club if i were a man i could go in and find him  not if you werent a member i said  and tell him what i thought of his conduct as im only a woman i have to wait in the hall while a deceitful small boy pretends to go and look for him  it had never struck me before what a splendid institution a club was only a few days back id been thinking that the subscription to mine was a bit steep but now i saw that the place earned every cent of the money  have you no influence with him reginald  i said i didnt think i had she called me something invertebrate or something i didnt catch it  then theres only one thing to do you must find my father and tell him all perhaps you may rouse him to a sense of what is right you may make him remember that he has duties as a parent  i thought it far more likely that i should make him remember that he had a foot i hadnt a very vivid recollection of old man craye i was quite a kid when he made his great speech on the egg question and beat it for europebut what i did recollect didnt encourage me to go and chat with him about the duties of a parent  as i remember him he was a rather large man with elephantiasis of the temper i distinctly recalled one occasion when i was spending a school vacation at his home and he found me trying to shave old duggie then a kid of fourteen with his razor  i shouldnt be able to find him i said  you can get his address from his lawyers  he may be at the north pole  then you must go to the north pole  but say  reginald  oh all right  i knew just what would happen parbury and stevens the lawyers simply looked at me as if i had been caught snatching bags at least stevens did and parbury would have done it too only he had been dead a good time finally after drinking me in for about a quarter of an hour stevens said that if i desired to address a communication to his client care of this office it would be duly forwarded good morning good morning anything further no thanks good morning good morning  i handed the glad news on to florence and left her to do what she liked about it she went down and interviewed stevens i suppose hed had experience of her at any rate he didnt argue he yielded up the address in level time old man craye was living in paris but was to arrive in new york that night and would doubtless be at his club  it was the same club where edwin was hiding from florence i pointed this out to her  theres no need for me to butt in after all i said hell meet edwin there and they can fight it out in the smoking room youve only to drop him a line explaining the facts  i shall certainly communicate with him in writing but nevertheless you must see him i cannot explain everything in a letter  but doesnt it strike you that he may think it pretty bad gallimpertinence dont you know for a comparative stranger like me to be tackling a delicate family affair like this  you will explain that you are acting for me  it wouldnt be better if old duggie went along instead  i wish you to go reginald  well of course it was all right dont you know but i was losing several pounds a day over the business i was getting so light that i felt that when the old man kicked me i should just soar up to the ceiling like an air balloon  the club was one of those large clubs that look like prisons i used to go there to lunch with my uncle the one who left me his money and i always hated the place it was one of those clubs that are all red leather and hushed whispers  im bound to say though there wasnt much hushed whispering when i started my interview with old man craye his voice was one of my childhoods recollections  he was most extraordinarily like florence he had just the same eyes i felt boneless from the start  good morning i said  what he said speak up dont mumble  i hadnt known he was deaf the last time wed had any conversationon the subject of razorshe had done all the talking this seemed to me to put the lid on it  i only said good morning i shouted  good what speak up i believe youre sucking candy oh good morning i remember you now youre the boy who spoiled my razor  i didnt half like this reopening of old wounds i hurried on  i came about edwin i said  who  edwin your son  what about him  florence told me to see you  who  florence your daughter  what about her  all this vaudeville team business mind you as if we were bellowing at each other across the street all round the room you could see old gentlemen shooting out of their chairs like rockets and dashing off at a gallop to write to the governing board about it thousands of waiters had appeared from nowhere and were hanging about dusting table legs if ever a business wanted to be discussed privately this seemed to me to be it and it was just about as private as a conversation through megaphones in longacre square  didnt she write to you  i got a letter from her i tore it up i didnt read it  pleasant was it not it was not i began to understand what a shipwrecked sailor must feel when he finds theres something gone wrong with the life belt  i thought i might as well get to the point and get it over  edwins going to marry a palmist i said  who the devils harry  not harry marry hes going to marry a palmist  about four hundred waiters noticed a speck of dust on an ash tray at the table next to ours and swooped down on it  edwin is going to marry a palmist  yes  she must be mad hasnt she seen edwin  and just then who should stroll in but edwin himself i sighted him and gave him a hail  he curveted up to us it was amazing the way the fellow had altered he looked like a twoyearold flower in his buttonhole and a sixinch grin and all that the old man seemed surprised too i didnt wonder the edwin he remembered was a pretty different kind of a fellow  hullo dad he said fancy meeting you here have a cigarette  he shoved out his case old man craye helped himself in a sort of dazed way  you are edwin he said slowly  i began to sidle out they didnt notice me they had moved to a settee and edwin seemed to be telling his father a funny story  at least he was talking and grinning and the old man was making a noise like distant thunder which i supposed was his way of chuckling i slid out and left them  some days later duggie called on me the old boy was looking scared  reggie he said what do doctors call it when you think you see things when you dont halsomething ive got it whatever it is its sometimes caused by overwork but it cant be that with me because ive not been doing any work you dont think my brains going or anything like that do you  what do you mean whats been happening  its like being haunted i read a story somewhere of a fellow who kept thinking he saw a battleship bearing down on him ive got it too four times in the last three days i could have sworn i saw my father and edwin i saw them as plainly as i see you and of course edwins at home and fathers in europe somewhere do you think its some sort of a warning do you think im going to die  its all right old top i said as a matter of fact they are both in new york just now  you dont mean that great scot what a relief but reggie old fox it couldnt have been them really the last time was at louis martins and the fellow i mistook for edwin was dancing all by himself in the middle of the floor  i admitted it was pretty queer  i was away for a few days after that in the country when i got back i found a pile of telegrams waiting for me they were all from florence and they all wanted me to go to madison avenue the last of the batch which had arrived that morning was so peremptory that i felt as if something had bitten me when i read it  for a moment i admit i hung back then i rallied there are times in a mans life when he has got to show a flash of the old bulldog pluck dont you know if he wants to preserve his selfrespect i did then my grip was still unpacked i told my man to put it on a cab and in about two ticks i was bowling off to the club i left for england next day by the lusitania  about three weeks later i fetched up at nice you cant walk far at nice without bumping into a casino the one i hit my first evening was the casino municipale in the place masséna it looked more or less of a home from home so i strolled in  there was quite a crowd round the boule tables and i squashed in and when id worked through into the front rank i happened to look down the table and there was edwin with a green tyrolese hat hanging over one ear clutching out for a lot of fivefranc pieces which the croupier was steering toward him at the end of a rake  i was feeling lonesome for i knew no one in the place so i edged round in his direction  halfway there i heard my name called and there was mrs darrell  i saw the whole thing in a flash old man craye hadnt done a thing to prevent itapart from being eccentric he was probably glad that edwin had had the sense to pick out anybody half as good a sortand the marriage had taken place and here they were on their honeymoon  i wondered what florence was thinking of it  well well well here we all are i said ive just seen edwin he seems to be winning  dear boy she said he does enjoy it so i think he gets so much more out of life than he used to dont you  sure thing may i wish you happiness why didnt you let me know and collect the silver fishslice  thank you so much mr pepper i did write to you but i suppose you never got the letter  mr craye didnt make any objections then  on the contrary he was more in favor of the marriage than anyone  and ill tell you why i said im rather a chump you know but i observe things i bet he was most frightfully grateful to you for taking edwin in hand and making him human  why youre wonderful mr pepper that is exactly what he said himself it was that that first made us friends  anderflorence  she sighed  im afraid florence has taken the thing a little badly but i hope to win her over in time i want all my children to love me  all your what  i think of them as my children you see mr pepper i adopted them as my own when i married their father did you think i had married edwin what a funny mistake i am very fond of edwin but not in that way no i married mr craye we left him at our villa tonight as he had some letters to get off you must come and see us mr pepper i always feel that it was you who brought us together you know i wonder if you will be seeing florence when you get back will you give her my very best love
