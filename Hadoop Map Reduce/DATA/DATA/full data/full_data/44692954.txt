44692954	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     book iv  friedrichs apprenticeship first stage  17131728     chapter i  childhood double educational element   of friedrichs childhood there is not after all our reading much that it would interest the english public to hear tell of perhaps not much of knowable that deserves anywhere to be known books on it expressly handling it and books on friedrich wilhelms court and history of which it is always a main element are not wanting but they are mainly of the sad sort which with pain and difficulty teach us nothing books done by pedants and tenebrific persons under the name of men dwelling not on things but at endless length on the outer husks of things of unparalleled confusion toonot so much as an index granted you to the poor halfpeck of cinders hidden in these wagonloads of ashes no sieve allowed books tending really to fill the mind with mere dustwhirlwindsif the mind did not straightway blow them out again which it does of these let us say nothing seldom had so curious a phenomenon worse treatment from the dryasdust species  among these books touching on friedrichs childhood and treating of his fathers court there is hardly above one that we can characterize as fairly human the book written by his little sister wilhelmina when she grew to size and knowledge of good and evil memoires de frederique sophie wilhelmine de prusse margrave de bareith brunswick paris et londres l8l2 2 vols 8voand this of what flighty uncertain nature it is the world partly knows a human book however not a pedant one there is a most shrill female soul busy with intense earnestness here looking and teaching us to look we find it a veracious book done with heart and from eyesight and insight of a veracity deeper than the superficial sort it is full of mistakes indeed and exaggerates dreadfully in its shrill female way but is above intending to deceive deduct the due subtrahendsay perhaps twentyfive per cent or in extreme cases as high as seventyfiveyou will get some human image of credible actualities from wilhelmina practically she is our one resource on this matter of the strange king friedrich wilhelm and his strange court with such an heirapparent growing up in it there is no real light to be had except what wilhelmina givesor kindles dark books of others into giving for that too on long study is the result of her here and there with so flickery a waxtaper held over friedrichs childhoodand the other dirty tallowdips all going out in intolerable odorjudge if our success can be very triumphant  we perceive the little creature has got much from nature not the big arena only but fine inward gifts for he is wellborn in more senses than oneand that in the breeding of him there are two elements noticeable widely diverse the french and the german this is perhaps the chief peculiarity best worth laying hold of with the due comprehension if our means allow     first educational element the french one  his nurses governesses simultaneous and successive mostly of french breed are duly set down in the prussian books and held in mind as a point of duty by prussian men but in foreign parts cannot be considered otherwise than as a group and merely with generic features he had a frau von kamecke for head governessthe lady whom wilhelmina in her famed memoires always writes kamken and of whom except the floating gossip found in that book there is nothing to be remembered under her as practical superintendent sousgouvernante and quasimother was the dame de roucoulles a more important person for us here dame de roucoulles once de montbail the same respectable edictofnantes french lady who fiveandtwenty years ago had taken similar charge of friedrich wilhelm a fact that speaks well for the character of her performance in that office she had done her first edition of a prussian prince in a satisfactory manner and not without difficult accidents and singularities as we have heard the like of which were spared her in this her second edition so we may call it a second and in all manner of ways an improved one the young fritz swallowed no shoebuckles did not leap out of window hanging on by the hands nor achieve anything of turbulent or otherwise memorable in his infantine history the course of which was in general smooth and runs happily for it below the ken of rumor the boy it is said and is easily credible was of extraordinary vivacity quick in apprehending all things and gracefully relating himself to them one of the prettiest vividest little boys with eyes with mind and ways of uncommon brilliancyonly he takes less to soldiering than the paternal heart could wish and appears to find other things in the world fully as notable as loud drums and stiff men drawn up in rows moreover he is apt to be a little unhealthy now and then and requires care from his nurses over whom the judicious roucoulles has to be very vigilant  of this respectable madame de roucoulles i have read at least seven times what the prussian books say of her by way of biography but it is always given in their dull tombstone style it has moreover next to no importance and ialas i do not yet too well remember it she was from normandy of gentle blood never very rich protestant in the edictofnantes time and had to fly her country a young widow with daughter and motherinlaw hanging on her the whole of them almost penniless however she was kindly received at the court of berlin as usual in that sad case and got some practical help towards living in her new country queen sophie charlotte had liked her society and finding her of prudent intelligent turn and with the style of manners suitable had given her friedrich wilhelm to take charge of she was at that time madame de montbail widow as we said she afterwards wedded roucoulles a refugee gentleman of her own nation who had gone into the prussian army as was common for the like of him she had again become a widow madame de roucoulles this time with her daughter montbail still about her when by the grateful good sense of friedrich wilhelm she was again intrusted as we seeand so had the honor of governessing frederick the great for the first seven years of his life respectable lady she oversaw his nurses papboatsbeersoup and bread he himself tells us once was his main diet in boyhoodbeersoups dressfrocks first attempts at walking and then also his little bits of intellectualities moralities his incipiencies of speech demeanor and spiritual development and did her function very honestly there is no doubt  wilhelmina mentions her at a subsequent period and we have a glimpse of this same roucoulles gliding about among the royal youngfolk with only one tooth left figuratively speaking and somewhat given to tattle in princess wilhelminas opinion grown very old now poor lady and the dreadfulest bore when she gets upon hanover and her experiences and queen sophie charlottes in that stupendously magnificent court under gentleman ernst shun that topic if you love your peace of mind memoires above citedshe did certainly superintend the boy fritzkin for his first seven years that is a glory that cannot be taken from her and her pupil too we agreeably perceive was always grateful for her services in that capacity once a week if he were in berlin during his youthful time he was sure to appear at the roucoulles soiree and say and look various pleasant things to his cher maman dear mamma as he used to call her and to the respectable small parts she had not to speak of other more substantial services which also were not wanting  roucoulles and the other female souls mainly french among whom the incipient fritz now was appear to have done their part as well as could be looked for respectable edictofnantes french ladies with high headgear wide hoops a clear correct but somewhat barren and meagre species tightlaced and highfrizzled in mind and body it is not a very fertile element for a young soul not very much of silent piety in it and perhaps of vocal piety more than enough in proportion an element founding on what they call enlightened protestantism freedom of thought and the like which is apt to become loquacious and too conscious of itself terming on the whole rather to contempt of the false than to deep or very effective recognition of the true  but it is in some important senses a clear and pure element withal at lowest there are no conscious semifalsities or volunteer hypocrisies taught the poor boy honor clearness truth of word at least a decorous dignified bearing various thin good things are honestly inculcated and exemplified nor is any bad ungraceful or suspicious thing permitted there if recognized for such it might have been a worse element and we must be thankful for it friedrich through life carries deep traces of this frenchprotestant incipiency a very big widebranching royal tree in the end but as small and flexible a seedling once as any one of us  the good old dame de roucoulles just lived to witness his accession on which grand juncture and afterwards as he had done before he continued to express in graceful and useful ways his gratitude and honest affection to her and hers tea services presents in cutglass and other kinds with letters that were still more precious to the old lady had come always at due intervals and one of his earliest kingly gifts was that of some suitable small pension for montbail the elderly daughter of this poor old roucoulles preuss friedrich der grosse eine

who was just singing her dimittaes as it were still in a blithe and pious manner for she saw now in 1740 her little nursling grown to be a brilliant man and king king gone out to the wars too with all europe inquiring and wondering what the issue would be as for her she closed her poor old eyes at this stage of the business piously in foreign parts far from her native normandy and did not see farther what the issue was good old dame i have as was observed read some seven times over what they call biographical accounts of her but have seven times by heavens favor i do partly believe mostly forgotten them again and would not without cause inflict on any reader the like sorrow to remember one worthy thing how many thousand unworthy things must a man be able to forget  from this edictofmantes environment which taught our young fritz his first lessons of human behaviora polite sharp little boy we do hope and understandhe learned also to clothe his bits of notions emotions and garrulous utterabilities in the french dialect learned to speak and likewise what is more important to think in french which was otherwise quite domesticated in the palace and became his second mothertongue not a bad dialect yet also none of the best very lean and shallow if very clear and convenient leaving much in poor fritz unuttered unthought unpractised which might otherwise have come into activity in the course of his life he learned to read very soon i presume but he did not now or afterwards ever learn to spell he spells indeed dreadfully ill at his first appearance on the writing stage as we shall see by and by and he continued to the last one of the bad spellers of his day a circumstance which i never can fully account for and will leave to the readers study  from all manner of sourcesfrom inferior valetaille prussian officials royal majesty itself when not in galahe learned not less rootedly the corrupt prussian dialect of german and used the same all his days among his soldiers native officials common subjects and wherever it was most convenient speaking it and writing and misspelling it with great freedom though always with a certain aversion and undisguised contempt which has since brought him blame in some quarters it is true the prussian form of german is but rude and probably friedrich except sometimes in luthers bible never read any german book what if we will think of it could he know of his first mothertongue german to this day is a frightful dialect for the stupid the pedant and dullard sort only in the hands of the gifted does it become supremely good it had not yet been the language of any goethe any lessing though it stood on the eve of becoming such it had already been the language of luther of ulrich hutten friedrich barbarossa charlemagne and others and several extremely important things had been said in it and some pleasant ones even sung in it from an old date in a very appropriate mannerhad crownprince friedrich known all that but he could not reasonably be expected to knowand the wiser germans now forgive him for not knowing and are even thankful that he did not     chapter ii  the german element  so that as we said there are two elements for young fritz and highly diverse ones from both of which he is to draw nourishment and assimilate what he can besides that edictofnantes french element and in continual contact and contrast with it which prevails chiefly in the female quarters of the palacethere is the native german element for young fritz of which the centre is papa now come to be king and powerfully manifesting himself as such an abrupt peremptory young king and german to the bone along with whom companions to him in his social hours and fellowworkers in his business are a set of very rugged german sons of nature differing much from the french sons of art baron grumkow leopold prince of anhaltdessau not yet called the old dessauer being under forty yet general glasenap colonel derschau general flans these and the other nameless generals and officials are a curious counterpart to the camases the hautcharmoys and forcades with their nimble tongues and rapiers still more to the beausobres achards full of ecclesiastical logic made of bayle and calvin kneaded together and to the highfrizzled ladies rustling in stiff silk with the shadow of versailles and of the dragonnades alike present to them  born hyperboreans these others rough as hemp and stout of fibre as hemp native products of the rigorous north of whom after all our reading we know littleo heaven they have had long lines of rugged ancestors cast in the same rude stalwart mould and leading their rough life there of whom we know absolutely nothing dumb all those preceding busy generations and this of friedrich wilhelm is grown almost dumb grim semiarticulate prussian men gone all to pipeclay and mustache for us strange blondcomplexioned not unbeautiful prussian honorable women in hoops brocades and unintelligible headgear and hairtowersach gott they too are gone and their musical talk in the french or german language that also is gone and the hollow eternities have swallowed it as their wont is in a very surprising manner  grumkow a cunning greedyhearted longheaded fellow of the old pomeranian nobility by birth has a kind of superficial polish put upon his hyperboreanisms he has been in foreign countries doing legations diplomacies for which at least for the vulpine parts of which he has a turn he writes and speaks articulate grammatical french but neither in that nor in native pommerish plattdeutsch does he show us much except the depths of his own greed of his own astucities and stealthy audacities of which we shall hear more than enough by and by     of the dessauer not yet old  as to the prince of anhaltdessau rugged man whose very face is the color of gunpowder he also knows french and can even write in it if he likehaving duly had a tutor of that nation and strange adventures with him on the grand tour and elsewherebut does not much practise writing when it can be helped his children i have heard he expressly did not teach to read or write seeing no benefit in that effeminate art but left them to pick it up as they could his princess all rightly ennobled nowwhom he would not but marry though sent on the grand tour to avoid itwas the daughter of one fos an apothecary at dessau and is still a beautiful and prudent kind of woman who seems to suit him well enough no worse than if she had been born a princess much talk has been of her in princely and other circles nor is his marriage the only strange thing leopold has done he is a man to keep the worlds tongue wagging not too musically always though himself of very unvocal nature perhaps the biggest mass of inarticulate human vitality certainly one of the biggest then going about in the world a man of vast dumb faculty dumb but fertile deep no end of ingenuities in the rough head of himas much motherwit there i often guess as could be found in whole talking parliaments spouting themselves away in vocables and eloquent wind  a man of dreadful impetuosity withal set upon his will as the one law of nature storming forward with incontrollable violence a very whirlwind of a man he was left a minor his mother guardian nothing could prevent him from marrying this fos the apothecarys daughter no tears nor contrivances of his mother whom he much loved and who took skilful measures fourteen months of travel in italy grand tour with eligible french tutorwhom he once drew sword upon getting some rebuke from him one night in venice and would have killed had not the man been nimble at once dexterous and sublimeit availed not the first thing he did on reentering dessau with his tutor was to call at apothecary foss and see the charming mamsell to go and see his mother was the second thing not even his grand passion for war could eradicate those he went to his grand passion for dutch williams wars the wise mother still counselling who was own aunt to dutch william and liked the scheme he besieged namur fought and besieged up and downwith insatiable appetite for fighting and sieging with great honor too and ambitions awakening in himcampaign after campaign but along with the flamythundery ideal bride figuratively called bellona there was always a soft real one mamsell fos of dessau to whom he continued constant the government of his dominions he left cheerfully to his mother even when he came of age i am for learning war as the one right trade do with all things as you please mamma only not with mamsell not with her  readers may figure this scene too and shudder over it some rather handsome male cousin of mamsell medical graduate or whatever he was had appeared in dessauseems to admire mamsell much of course in a platonic way said rumorhe admire thinks leopoldthinks a good deal of it not in the philosophic mood as he was one day passing foss mamsell and the medical graduate are visible standing together at the window inside pleasantly looking out upon natureof course quite casually say some histories with a sneer in fact it seems possible this medical graduate may have been set to act shoeinghorn but he had better not leopold storms into the house draw scandalous canaille and defend yourselfand in this or some such way a confident tradition says he killed the poor medical graduate there and then one tries always to hope not but varnhagen is positive though the other histories say nothing of it god knows the man was a prince no reichshofrath speyerwetzlar kammer or other supreme court would much trouble itself except with formal shakings of the wig about such a peccadillo in fine it was better for leopold to marry the miss fos which he actually did 1698 in his twentysecond year with the lefthandand then with the right and both hands having got her properly ennobled before long by his splendid military services she made as we have hinted an excellent wife to him for the fifty or sixty ensuing years  this is a strange rugged specimen this inarticulate leopold already getting mythic as we can perceive to the polished vocal ages which mix all manner of fables with the considerable history he has readers will see him turn up again in notable forms a man hitherto unknown except in his own country and yet of very considerable significance to all european countries whatsoever the fruit of his activities without his name attached being now manifest in all of them he invented the iron ramrod he invented the equal step in fact he is the inventor of modern military tactics even so if we knew it the soldiery of every civilized country still receives from this man on paradefields and battlefields its word of command out of his rough head proceeded the essential of all that the innumerable drillsergeants in various languages daily repeat and enforce such a man is worth some transient glance from his fellowcreaturesespecially with a little fritz trotting at his foot and drawing inferences from him  dessau we should have said for the english readers behoof was and still is a little independent principality about the size of huntingdonshire but with woods instead of bogsrevenue of it at this day is 60000 pounds was perhaps not 20 or even 10000 in leopolds first time it

the great electors first wife his sister is wedded to the margraf of schwedt friedrich wilhelms halfuncle lying in such neighborhood and being in such affinity to the prussian house the dessauers may be said to have in late times their headquarters at berlin leopold and leopolds sons as his father before him had done without neglecting their dessau and principality hold by the prussian army as their main employment not neglecting dessau either but going thither in winter or on call otherwise leopold least of all neglecting it who neglects nothing that can be useful to him  he is general fieldmarshal of the prussian armies the foremost man in warmatters with this new king and well worthy to be so he is inventing or brooding in the way to invent a variety of thingsiron ramrods for one a very great improvement on the fragile ineffective wooden implement say all the books but give no date to it that is the first thing and there will be others likewise undated but posterior requiring mention by and by inventing many thingsand always well practising what is already invented and known for certain in a word he is drilling to perfection with assiduous rigor the prussian infantry to be the wonder of the world he has fought with them too in a conclusive manner and is at all times ready for fighting  he was in malplaquet with them if only as volunteer on that occasion he commanded them in blenheim itself stood in the right or eugene wing of that famed battle of blenheim fiercely at bay when the austrian cavalry had all fledfiercely volleying charging dexterously wheeling and manoeuvring sticking to his ground with a mastifflike tenacitytill marlborough and victory from the left relieved him and others he was at the bridge of cassano where eugene and vendome came to handgripswhere mirabeaus grandfather coldargent got his sixandthirty wounds and was killed as he used to term it carlyles miscellanies v  mirabeau the hottest fire i ever saw said eugene who had not seen malplaquet at that time while coldargent sank collapsed upon the bridge and the horse charged over him and again charged and beat and were beaten three several timesanhaltdessau impatient of such fiddling hither and thither swashed into the stream itself with his prussian foot swashed through it waistdeep or breastdeep and might have settled the matter had not his cartridges got wetted old king friedrich rebuked him angrily for his impetuosity in this matter and the sad loss of men  then again he was at the storming of the lines of turineugenes feat of 1706 and a most volcanic businesswas the first man that gotover the entrenchment there foremost man face all black with the smoke of gunpowder only channelled here and there with rivulets of sweatnot a lovely phenomenon to the french in the interior who still fought like madmen but were at length driven into heaps and obliged to run a while before they ran anhaltdessau noticing some captain posted with his company in a likely situation stept aside to him for a moment and asked am i wounded think youno then have you anything to drink and deliberately drank a glass of aquavitae the judicious captain carrying a

nature but he has not muchon the doctrinal side very little luthers hymn eine feste burg ist unser gott he calls god almightys grenadiermarch on joining battle he audibly utters with bared head some growl of rugged prayer far from orthodox at times but much in earnest that lifting of his hat for prayer is his last signal on such occasions he is very cunning as required withal not disdaining the serpentine method when no other will do with friedrich wilhelm who is his secondcousin mothers grandnephew if the reader can count that he is from of old on the best footing and contrives to be his mentor in many things besides war till his quarrel with grumkow of which we shall hear he took the lead in political advising too and had schemes or was thought to have of which queen sophie was in much terror  a tall strongboned hairy man with cloudy brows vigilant swift eyes has a bluish tint of skin says wilhelmina as if the gunpowder still stuck to him he wears long mustaches triangular hat plume and other equipments are of thrifty practical size can be polite enough in speech but hides much of his meaning which indeed is mostly inarticulate and not always joyful to the bystander he plays rough pranks too on occasion and has a big horselaugh in him where there is a fop to be roasted or the like we will leave him for the present in hope of other meetings  remarkable men many of those old prussian soldiers of whom one wishes to no purpose that there had more knowledge been attainable but the books are silent no painter no genial seeingman to paint with his pen was there grim hirsute hyperborean figures they pass mostly mute before us burly surly in mustaches in dim uncertain garniture of which the buffbelts and the steel are alone conspicuous growling in guttural teutsoh what little articulate meaning they had spending of the inarticulate a proportion in games of chance probably too in drinking beer yet having an immense overplus which they do not so spend but endeavor to utter in such working as there may be so have the hyperboreans lived from of old from the times of tacitus and pytheas not to speak of odin and japhet what hosts of them have marched across existence in that mannerand where is the memory that would even if it could speak of them all  we will hope the mind of our little fritz has powers of assimilation baylecalvin logics and shadows of versailles on this hand and gunpowder leopolds and inarticulate hyperboreans on that here is a wide diversity of nutriment all rather tough in quality provided for the young soul innumerable unconscious inferences he must have drawn in his little head prince leopolds face with the whiskers and blue skin i find he was wont at after periods to do in caricature under the figure of a catshorror and admiration not the sole feelings raised in him by the fieldmarshalfor bodily nourishment he had beersoup a decided spartan tone prevailing wherever possible in the breeding and treatment of him  and we need not doubt by far the most important element of his education was the unconscious apprenticeship he continually served to such a spartan as king friedrich wilhelm of whose works and ways he could not help taking note angry or other every day and hour nor in the end if he were intelligent help understanding them and learning from them a harsh master and almost halfmad as it many times seemed to the poor apprentice yet a true and solid one whose real wisdom was worth that of all the others as he came at length to recognize     chapter iii  friedrich wilhelm is king  with the death of old king friedrich there occurred at once vast changes in the court of berlin a total and universal change in the mode of living and doing business there friedrich wilhelm out of filial piety wore at his fathers funeral the grand french peruke and other sublimities of french costume but it was for the last time that sad duty once done he flung the whole aside not without impatience and on no occasion wore such costume again he was not a friend to french fashions nor had ever been far the contrary in his boyhood say the biographers there was once a grand embroidered clothofgold or otherwise supremely magnificent little dressinggown given him but he would at no rate put it on or be concerned with it on the contrary stuffed it indignantly into the fire and demanded wholesome useful duffel instead  he began his reform literally at the earliest moment being summoned into the apartment where his poor father was in the last struggle he could scarcely get across for kammerjunker kammerherrn goldsticks silversticks and the other solemn histrionic functionaries all crowding there to do their sad mimicry on the occasion not a lovely accompaniment in friedrich wilhelms eyes his poor fathers deathstruggle once done and all reduced to everlasting rest there friedrich wilhelm looked in silence over the unutterable for a short space disregardful of the goldsticks and their eager new homaging walked swiftly away from it to his own room shut the door with a slam and there shaking the tears from his eyes commenced by a notable dutythe duty nearest hand and therefore first to be done as it seemed to him it was about one in the afternoon 25th february 1713 his father dead half an hour before tears at a fathers deathbed must they be dashed with rage by such a set of greedy histrios thought friedrich wilhelm he summoned these his courtpeople that is to say summoned their oberhofmarschall and representative and through him signified to them that till the funeral was over their service would continue and that on the morrow after the funeral they were every soul of them discharged and from the highest goldstick down to the lowest pageinwaiting the kings house should be swept entirely clean of themsaid house intending to start afresh upon a quite new footing forster i 174 pollnitz memoiren ii 4 which spread such a consternation among the courtier people say the histories as was never seen before  the thing was done however and nobody durst whisper discontent with it this rugged young king with his plangent metallic voice with his steadybeaming eyes seeming dreadfully in earnest about it and a person that might prove dangerous if you crossed him he reduced his household accordingly at once to the lowest footing of the indispensable and discharged a whole regiment of superfluous official persons courtflunkies inferior superior and supreme in the most ruthless manner he does not intend keeping any oberhofmarschall or the like idle person henceforth thinks a minimum of the goldsticks ought to suffice every man  eight lackeys in the antechambers and elsewhere these with each a jagerbursch what we should call an underkeeper to assist when not hunting will suffice lackeys at eight thalers monthly which is six shillings a week three active pages sometimes two instead of perhaps three dozen idle that there used to be in king friedrichs time there were wont to be a thousand saddlehorses at corn and hay but how many of them were in actual use very many of them were mere imaginary quadrupeds their price and keep pocketed by some knavish stallmeister equerry or headgroom friedrich wilhelm keeps only thirty horses but these are very actual not imaginary at all their corn not running into any knaves pocket but lying actually in the mangers here getting ground for you into actual fourfooted speed when on turf or highway you require such a thing about thirty for the saddlewith a few carriageteams are what friedrich wilhelm can employ in any reasonable measure and more he will not have about him  in the like ruthless humor he goes over his pensionlist strikes three fourths of that away reduces the remaining fourth to the very bone in like humor he goes over every department of his administrative household and other expenses shears everything down here by the hundred thalers there by the ten willing even to save half a thaler he goes over all this three several timeshis papers the three successive lists he used on that occasion have been printed rodenbeck beitrage zur bereicherung der lebembeschreibungen friedrich wilhelms i und friedrichs des grossen berlin 1836 pp 99127 he has satisfied himself in about two months what the effective minimum is and leaves it so reduced to below the fifth of what it was 55000 thalers instead of 276000 stenzel iii 237  by degrees he went over went into and through every department of prussian business in that fashion steadily warily irresistibly compelling every item of it large and little to take that same character of perfect economy and solidity of utility pure and simple needful work is to be rigorously well done needless work and ineffectual or imaginary workers to be rigorously pitched out of doors what a blessing on this earth worth purchasing almost at any price the money saved is something nothing if you will but the amount of mendacity expunged has any one computed that mendacity not of tongue but the far feller sort of hand and of heart and of head short summary of all devilsworship whatsoever which spreads silently along once you let it in with full purse or with empty some fools even praising it the quiet dryrot of nations to expunge such is greatly the duty of every man especially of every king unconsciously not thinking of devilsworship or spiritual dryrot but of money chiefly and led by nature and the ways she has with us it was the task of friedrich wilhelms life to bring about this beneficent result in all departments of prussian business great and little public and even private year after year he brings it to perfection pushes it unweariedly forward every day and hour so that he has prussia at last all a prussia made after his own image the most thrifty hardy rigorous and spartan country any modern king ever tied over and himself if he thought of that a king indeed he that models nations according to his own image he is a king though his sceptre were a walkingstick and properly no other is  friedrich wilhelm was wondered at and laughed at by innumerable mortals for his ways of doing which indeed were very strange not that he figured much in what is called public history or desired to do so for though a vigilant ruler he did not deal in protocolling and campaininghe let a minimum of that suffice him but in court soirees where elegant empty talk goes on and of all materials for it scandal is found incomparably the most interesting i suppose there turned up no name oftener than that of his prussian majesty and during these twentyseven years of his reign his wild pranks and explosions gave food for continual talk in such quarter  for he was like no other king that then existed or had ever been discovered wilder son of nature seldom came into the artificial world into a royal throne there probably never a wild man wholly in earnest veritable as the old rocksand with a terrible volcanic fire in him too he would have been strange anywhere but among the dapper royal gentlemen of the eighteenth century what was to be done with such an orson of a kingclap him in bedlam and bring out the ballotboxes instead the modern generation too still takes its impression of him from these rumorsstill more now from wilhelminas book which paints the outside savagery of the royal man in a most striking manner and leaves the inside vacant undiscovered by wilhelmina or the rumors  nevertheless it appears there were a few observant eyes even of contemporaries who discerned in him a surprising talent for national economics at least one leipzig professor saxon not prussian by nation or interest recognizes in friedrich wilhelm den grossen wirth the great manager husbandryman or landlord of the epoch and lectures on his admirable works arrangements and institutions in that kind rodenbecks beitrage p 14year or name of lecturer not mentioned nay the dapper royal gentlemen saw with envy the indubitable growth of this mad savage brother and ascribed it to his avarice to his mean ways which were in such contrast to their sublime ones that he understood national economics has now become very certain his grim semiarticulate papers and rescripts on these subjects are still almost worth reading by a lover of genuine human talent in the dumb form for spelling grammar penmanship and composition they resemble nothing else extant are as if done by the paw of a bear indeed the utterance generally sounds more like the growling of a bear than anything that could be handily spelt or parsed but there is a decisive human sense in the heart of it and there is such a dire hatred of empty bladders unrealities and hypocritical forms and pretences what he calls wind and humbug wind und blauer dunst as is very strange indeed strange among all mankind doubly and trebly strange among the unfortunate species called kings in our time to whomfor sad reasons that could be givenwind and blue vapor blauer dunst artistically managed by the rules of acoustics and optics seem to be all we have left us  it must be owned that this man is inflexibly and with a fierce slow inexorable determination set upon having realities round him there is a divine idea of fact put into him the genus sham was never hatefuler to any man let it keep out of his way well beyond the swing of that rattan of his or it may get something to remember a just man too would not wrong any man nor play false in word or deed to any man what is justice but another form of the reality we love a truth acted out of all the humbugs or painted vapors known injustice is the least capable of profiting men or kings a just man i say and a valiant and veracious but rugged as a wild bear entirely inarticulate as if dumb no bursts of parliamentary eloquence in him nor the least tendency that way his talent for stumporatory may be reckoned the minimum conceivable or practically noted a zero a man who would not have risen in modern political circles man unchoosable at hustings or in caucus man forever invisible and very unadmirable if seen to the able editor and those that hang by him in fact a kind of savage man as we say but highly interesting if you can read dumb human worth and of inexpressible profit to the prussian nation  for the first ten years of his reign he had a heavy continual struggle getting his finance and other branches of administration extricated from their strangling imbroglios of coiled nonsense and put upon a rational footing his labor in these years the first of little fritzs life must have been great the pushing and pulling strong and continual the good plan itself this comes not of its own accord it is the fruit of genius which means transcendent capacity of taking trouble first of all given a huge stack of tumbled thrums it is not in your sleep that you will find the vital centre of it or get the first thrum by the end and then the execution the realizing amid the contradiction silent or expressed of men and things explosive violence was by no means friedrich wilhelms method the amount of slow stubborn broadshouldered strength in all kinds expended by the man strikes us as very great the amount of patience even though patience is not reckoned his forte  that of the ritterdienst knightsservice for example which is but one small item of his business the commuting of the old feudal duty of his landholders to do service in wartime into a fixed money payment nothing could be fairer more clearly advantageous to both parties and most of his knights gladly accepted the proposal yet a certain factious set of them the magdeburg set stirred up by some seven or eight of their number hardly above seven or eight really against me saw good to stand out remonstrated recalcitrated complained in the diet kaiser too happy to hear of it that he might have a hook on friedrich wilhelm and for long years that paltry matter

natures plan persist in it like a law of nature this secret too was known to friedrich wilhelm in the space of ten years by actual human strength loyally spent he had managed many things saw all things in a course towards management all things as it were fairly on the road the multiplex team pulling one way in rational human harness not in imbroglios of coiled thrums made by the nightmares  how he introduced a new mode of farming his domain lands which are a main branch of his revenue and shall be farmed on regular lease henceforth and not wasted in peculation and indolent mismanagement as heretofore forster ii 206 216 new modes of levying his taxes and revenues of every kind ib ii 190 195 how he at last concentrated and harmonized into one easygoing effective general directory

denkwurdigkeiten meiner zeit lemgo und hanover 18141819 iv 88 how he insisted on having daylight introduced to the very bottom of every business fairandsquare observed as the rule of it and the shortest road adopted for doing it how he drained bogs planted colonies established manufactures made his own uniforms of prussian wool in a lagerhaus of his own how he dealt with the jew gompert about farming his tobacoohow from many a crooked case and character he by slow or short methods brought out something straight would take no denial of what was his nor make any demand of what was not and did prove really a terror to evildoers of various kinds especially to prevaricators defalcators imaginary workers and slippery unjust persons how he urged diligence on all mortals would not have the very applewomen sit without knitting at their stalls and brandished his stick or struck it fiercely down over the incorrigibly idleall this as well as his ludicrous explosions and unreasonable violences is on record concerning friedrich wilhelm though it is to the latter chiefly that the world has directed its unwise attention in judging of him he was a very arbitrary king yes but then a good deal of his arbitrium or sovereign will was that of the eternal heavens as well and did exceedingly behoove to be done if the earth would prosper which is an immense consideration in regard to his sovereign will and him he was prompt with his rattan in urgent cases had his gallows also prompt enough where needful let him see that no mistakes happen as certainly he means that none shall  yearly he made his country richer and this not in money alone which is of very uncertain value and sometimes has no value at all and even less but in frugality diligence punctuality veracitythe grand fountains from which money and all real values and valors spring for men to friedrich wilhelm in his rustio simplicity money had no lack of value rather the reverse to the homespun man it was a success of most excellent quality and the chief symbol of success in all kinds yearly he made his own revenues and his peoples along with them and as the source of them larger and in all states of his revenue he had contrived to make his expenditure less than it and yearly saved masses of coin and reposited them in barrels in the cellars of his schlosswhere they proved very useful one day much in friedrich wilhelm proved useful beyond even his expectations as a nations husband he seeks his fellow among kings ancient and modern happy the nation which gets such a husband once in the halfthousand years the nation as foolish wives and nations do repines and grudges a good deal its weak whims and will being thwarted very often but it advances steadily with consciousness or not in the way of welldoing and afterlong times the harvest of this diligent sowing becomes manifest to the nation and to all nations  strange as it sounds in the republic of letters we are tempted to call friedrich wilhelm a man of geniusgenius fated and promoted to work in national husbandry not in writing verses or threevolume novels a silent genius his melodious stanza which he cannot bear to see halt in any syllable is a rough fact reduced to order fact made to stand firm on its feet with the worldrocks under it and looking free towards all the winds and all the stars he goes about suppressing platitudes ripping off futilities turning deceptions inside out the realm of disorder which is unveracity unreality what we call chaos has no fiercer enemy honest soul and he seemed to himself such a stupid fellow often no tonguelearning at all little capable to give a reason for the faith that was in him he cannot argue in articulate logic only in inarticulate bellowings or worse he must do a thing leave it undemonstrated once done it will itself tell what kind of thing it is by and by men of genius have a hard time i perceive whether born on the throne or off it and must expect contradictions next to unendurablethe plurality of blockheads being so extreme  i find except samuel johnson no man of equal veracity with friedrich wilhelm in that epoch and johnson too with all his tonguelearning had not logic enough in fact it depends on how much conviction you have blessed be heaven there is here and there a man born who loves truth as truth should be loved with all his heart and all his soul and hates untruth with a corresponding perfect hatred such men in polite circles which understand that certainly truth is better than untruth but that you must be polite to both are liable to get to the end of their logic even johnson had a bellow in him though johnson could at any time withdraw into silence his kingdom lying all under his own hat how much more friedrich wilhelm who had no logic whatever and whose kingdom lay without him far and wide a thing he could not withdraw from the rugged orson he needed to be right from utmost memel down to wesel again ranked in a straggling manner round the halfcircumference of europe all manner of things and persons were depending on him and on his being right not wrong in his notion  a man of clear discernment very good natural eyesight and irrefragably confident in what his eyes told him in what his belief wasyet of huge simplicity withal capable of being coaxed about and led by the nose to a strange degree if there were an artist dexterous enough daring enough his own natural judgment was good and though apt to be hasty and headlong was always likely to come right in the end but internally we may perceive his modesty selfdistrust anxiety and other unexpected qualities must have been great and then his explosiveness impatience excitability his conscious dumb ignorance of all things beyond his own small horizon of personal survey an orson capable enough of being coaxed and tickled by some firstrate conjurerfirstrate a secondrate might have failed and got torn to pieces for his pains but seckendorf and grumkow what a dance they led him on some mattersas we shall see and as poor fritz and others will see  he was full of sensitiveness rough as he was and shaggy of skin his wild imaginations drove him hither and thither at a sad rate he ought to have the privileges of genius his tall potsdam regiment his madlooking passion for enlisting tall men this also seems to me one of the whims of geniusan exaggerated notion to have his stanza polished to the last punctilio of perfection and might be paralleled in the history of poets stranger man of genius or in more peculiar circumstances the world never saw  friedrich wilhelm in his crownprince days and now still more when he was himself in the sovereign place had seen all along with natural arithmetical intellect that his strength in this world as at present situated would very much depend upon the amount of potentialbattle that lay in himon the quantity and quality of soldiers he could maintain and have ready for the field at any time a most indisputable truth and a heartfelt one in the present instance to augment the quantity to improve the quality in this thriceessential particular here lay the keystone and crowning summit of all friedrich wilhelms endeavors to which he devoted himself as only the best spartan could have done of which there will be other opportunities to speak in detail for it was a thing worldnotable worldlaughable as was then thought the extremely serious fruit of which did at length also become notable enough  in the malplaquet time once on some occasion it is said two english officers not well informed upon the matter and provoking enough in their contemptuous ignorance were reasoning with one another in friedrich wilhelms hearing as to the warlike powers of the prussian state and whether the king of prussia could on his own strength maintain a standing army of 15000 without subsidies do you think so many as 15000 friedrich wilhelm incensed at the thing and at the tone is reported to have said with heat yes 30000 forster i 138 whereat the military men slightly wagged their heads letting the matter drop for the present but he makes it good by degrees twofold or threefoldand will have an army of from seventy to a hundred thousand before he dies 72000 fieldtroops 30000 garrisontroops gestandnisse eines oester reichischen veterans breslau 1788 i 64 the bestdrilled of fighting men and what adds much to the wonder a full treasury withal this is the brandenburg spartan king acquainted with national economics alone of existing kings he lays by money annually and is laying by many other and far more precious things for prussia and the little boy he has here  friedrich wilhelms passion for drilling recruiting and perfecting his army attracted much notice laughing satirical notice in the hundred months of common rumor which he regarded little and notice iracund and minatory when it led him into collision with the independent portions of mankind now and then this latter sort was not pleasant and sometimes looked rather serious but this too he contrived always to digest in some tolerable manner he continued drilling and recruitingwe may say not his army only but his nation in all departments of itas no man before or since ever did increasing by every devisable method the amount of potentialbattle that lay in him and it  in a military and also in a much deeper sense he may be defined as the great drillsergeant of the prussian nation indeed this had been the function of the hohenzollerns all along this difficult unpleasant and indispensable one of drilling from the first appearance of burggraf friedrich with good words and with heavy peg in the wreck of anarchic brandenburg and downwards ever since this has steadily enough gone on and not a little good drilling these populations have had first and last just orders given them wise and just which to a respectable degree were heavens orders as well and certainly heavy peg for instanceheavy peg bringing quitzows strong house about his earswas a respectable drummers cat to enforce the same this has been going on these three hundred years but friedrich wilhelm completes the process finishes it off to the last pitch of perfection friedrich wilhelm carries it through every fibre and cranny of prussian business and so far as possible of prussian life so that prussia is all a drilled phalanx ready to the word of command and what we see in the army is but the last consummate essence of what exists in the nation everywhere that was friedrich wilhelms function made ready for him laid to his hand by his hohenzollern foregoers and indeed it proved a most beneficent function  for i have remarked that of all things a nation needs first to be drilled and no nation that has not first been governed by socalled tyrants and held tight to the curb till it became perfect in its paces and thoroughly amenable to rule and law and heartily respectful of the same and totally abhorrent of the want of the same ever came to much in this world england itself in foolish quarters of england still howls and execrates lamentably over its william conqueror and rigorous line of normans and plantagenets but without them if you will consider well what had it ever been a gluttonous race of jutes and angles capable of no grand combinations lumbering about in potbellied equanimity not dreaming of heroic toil and silence and endurance such as leads to the high places of this universe and the golden mountaintops where dwell the spirits of the dawn their very ballotboxes and suffrages what they call their liberty if these mean liberty and are such a road to heaven anglosaxon highroad thithercould never have been possible for them on such terms how could they nothing but collision intolerable interpressure as of men not perpendicular and consequent battle often supervening could have been appointed those undrilled anglosaxons their potbellied equanimity itself continuing liable to perpetual interruptions as in the heptarchy time an enlightened public does not reflect on these things at present but will again by and by looking with human eyes over the england that now is and over the america and the australia from pole to pole and then listening to the constitutional litanies of dryasaust and his lamentations on the old norman and plantagenet kings and his recognition of departed merit and causes of effectsthe mind of man is struck dumb     chapter iv  his majestys ways  friedrich wilhelms history is one of economics which study so soon as there are kings again in this world will be precious to them in that happy state of matters friedrich wilhelms history will well reward study and teach by example in a very simple and direct manner in what is called the political diplomatic honortobe department there is not nor can ever be much to be said of him this economist king having always kept himself well at home and looked steadily to his own affairs so that for the present he has as a king next to nothing of what is called history and it is only as a fellowman of singular faculty and in a most peculiar and conspicuous situation that he can be interesting to mankind to us he has as father and daily teacher and master of young fritz a continual interest and we must note the masters ways and the main phenomena of the workshop as they successively turned up for the sake of the notable apprentice serving there  he was not tall of stature this arbitrary king a floridcomplexioned stoutbuilt man of serious sincere authoritative face his attitudes and equipments very spartan in type man of short firm stature stands in pesnes best portraits of him at his ease and yet like a tower most solid plumb and rather more eyes steadfastly awake cheeks slightly compressed too which fling the mouth rather forward as if asking silently anything astir then all right here face figure and bearing all in him is expressive of robust insight and direct determination of healthy energy practicality unquestioned authoritya certain air of royalty reduced to its simplest form the face in pictures by pesne and others is not beautiful or agreeable healthy genuine authoritative is the best you can say of it yet it may have been what it is described as being originally handsome high enough arched brow rather copious cheeks and jaws nose smallish inclining to be stumpy large gray eyes bright with steady fire and life often enough gloomy and severe but capable of jolly laughter too eyes naturally with a kind of laugh in them says pollnitzwhich laugh can blaze out into fearful thunderous rage if you give him provocation especially if you lie to him for that he hates above all things look him straight in the face he fancies he can see in your eyes if there is an internal mendacity in you wherefore you must look at him in speaking such is his standing order  his hair is flaxen falling into the ashgray or darker fine copious flowing hair while he wore it natural but it soon got tied into clubs in the military style and at length it was altogether cropped away and replaced by brown and at last by white round wigs which latter also though bad wigs became him not amiss under his cockedhat and cockade says pollnitz pollnitz memoiren berlin 1791 ii 568 the voice i guess even when not loud was of clangorous and penetrating quasimetallic nature and i learn expressly once that it had a nasal quality in it busching beitrage i 568 his majesty spoke through the nose snuffled his speech in an earnest ominously plangent manner in angry moments which were frequent it must have beenunpleasant to listen to for the rest a handsome man of his inches conspicuously wellbuilt in limbs and body and delicately finished off to the very extremities his feet and legs says pollnitz were very fine the hands if he would have taken care of them were beautifully white fingers long and thin a hand at once nimble to grasp delicate to feel and strong to clutch and hold what may be called a beautiful hand because it is the usefulest  nothing could exceed his majestys simplicity of habitudes but one loves especially in him his scrupulous attention to cleanliness of person and of environment he washed like a very mussulman five times a day loved cleanliness in all things to a superstitious extent which trait is pleasant in the rugged man and indeed of a piece with the rest of his character he is gradually changing all his silk and other cloth roomfurniture in his hatred of dust he will not suffer a floorcarpet even a stuffed chair but insists on having all of wood where the dust may be prosecuted to destruction forster i 208 wife and womankind and those that take after them let such have stuffing and sofas he for his part sits on mere wooden chairssits and also thinks and acts after the manner of a hyperborean spartan which he was he ate heartily but as a rough farmer and hunter eats country messes good roast and boiled despising the french cook as an entity without meaning for him his favorite dish at dinner was bacon and greens rightly dressed what could the french cook do for such a man he ate with rapidity almost with indiscriminate violence his object not quality but quantity he drank too but did not get drunk at the doctors order he could abstain and had in later years abstained pollnitz praises his fineness of complexion the originally eminent whiteness of his skin which he had tanned and bronzed by hard riding and hunting and otherwise worse discolored by his manner of feeding and digesting alas at last his waistcoat came to measure i am afraid to say how many prussian ellsa very considerable diameter indeed ib i 163  for some years after his accession he still appeared occasionally in burgher dress or unmilitary clothes brown english coat yellow waistcoat and the other indispensables but this fashion became rarer with him every year and ceased altogether say chronologists about the year 1719 after which he appeared always simply as colonel of the potsdam guards his own lifeguard regiment in simple prussian uniform close military coat blue with red cuffs and collar buff waistcoat and breeches white linen gaiters to the knee he girt his sword about the loins well out of the mud walked always with a thick bamboo in his hand steady not slow of step with his triangular hat creamwhite round wig in his older days and face tending to purplethe eyes looking out mere investigation sharp swift authority and dangerous readiness to rebuke and set the cane in motionit was so he walked abroad in this earth and the common run of men rather fled his approach than courted it  for in fact he was dangerous and would ask in an alarming manner who are you any fantastic much more any suspiciouslooking person might fare the worse an idle lounger at the streetcorner he has been known to hit over the crown and peremptorily despatch home sirrah and take to some

got examined by the consistoriums and authorities proper in that matter and put into a chaplaincy  this king did not love the french or their fashions at all we said he dismissed the big perukeput it on for the last time at his fathers funeral so far did filial piety go and then packed it aside dismissing it nay banishing and proscribing it never to appear more the peruke and as it were all that the peruke symbolized for this was a king come into the world with quite other aims than that of wearing big perukes and regardless of expense playing burstfrog to the ox of versailles which latter is itself perhaps a rather useless animal of friedrich wilhelms taxes upon wigs of the old wiginspectors and the feats they did plucking off mens periwigs on the street to see if the governmentstamp were there and to discourage wiggery at least all but the simple scratch or useful welshwig among mankind of these and of other similar things i could speak but do not this little incident which occurred once in the reviewground on the outskirts of berlin will suffice to mark his temper in that respect it was in the spring of 1719 our little fritz then six years old who of course heard much temporary confused commentary direct and oblique triumphant male laughter and perhaps rebellious female sighs on occasion of such a feat  count rothenburg prussian by birth buchholz neueste preuwssischbrandenburgische geschichte i 28 an accomplished and able person in the diplomatic and other lines of business but much used to paris and its ways had appeared lately in berlin as french envoyand not unnaturally in high french costume cockedhat peruke laced coat and the other trimmings he and a group of dashing followers and adherents were accustomed to go about in that guise very capable of proving infectious to mankind what is to be done with them thinks the anxious father of his people they were to appear at the ensuing grand review as friedrich wilhelm understood whereupon friedrich wilhelm took his measures in private dressed up namely his scavengerexecutioner people what they call profossen in prussian regiments in an enormous exaggeration of that costume cockedhats about an ell in diameter wigs reaching to the houghs with other fittings to match these when count rothenburg and his company appeared upon the ground friedrich wilhelm summoned out with some trumpetpeal or burst of fieldmusic and they solemnly crossed count rothenburgs field of vision the strangest set of phantasms he had seen lately awakening salutary reflections in him forster i 165

dramaturgist gods and men or at least houyhnhnm horses might have saluted it with a homeric laughso huge and vacant is it with a suspicion of real humor toobut the men were not permitted on parade more than a silent grin or general irrepressible rustling murmur and only the gods laughed inextinguishably if so disposed the scavengerexecutioners went back to their place and count rothenburg took a plain german costume so long as he continued in those parts  friedrich wilhelm has a dumb rough wit and mockery of that kind on many occasions not without geniality in its brobdignag exaggeration and simplicity like a wild bear of the woods taking his sport with some sense of humor in the rough skin of him very capable of seeing through sumptuous costumes and respectful of realities alone not in french sumptuosity but in native german thrift does this king see his salvation so as nature constructed him and the world which has long lost its spartans will see again an original northgerman spartan and shriek a good deal over him nature keeping her own counsel the while and as it were laughing in her sleeve at the shrieks of the flunky world for nature when she makes a spartan means a good deal by it and does not expect instant applauses but only gradual and lasting  for my own part exclaims a certain editor once i perceive well there was never yet any great empire founded roman english down to prussian or dutch nor in fact any great mass of work got achieved under the sun but it was founded even upon this humblelooking quality of thrift and became achievable in virtue of the same which will seem a strange doctrine in these days of goldnuggets railwayfortunes and miraculous sumptuosities regardless of expense earnest readers are invited to consider it nevertheless though new it is very old and a sad meaning lies in it to us of these times that you have squandered in idle fooleries building where there was no basis your hundred thousand sterling your eight hundred million sterling is to me a comparatively small matter you may still again become rich if you have at last become wise but if you have wasted your capacity of strenuous devoutly valiant labor of patience perseverance selfdenial faith in the causes of effects alas if your once just judgment of what is worth something and what is worth nothing has been wasted and your silent steadfast reliance on the general veracities of yourself and of things is no longer therethen indeed you have had a loss you are in fact an entirely bankrupt individual as you will find by and by yes and though you had california in feesimple and could buy all the upholsteries groceries fundedproperties temporary very temporary landed properties of the world at one swoop it would avail you nothing henceforth for you no harvests in the seedfield of this universe which reserves its salutary bounties and noble heavensent gifts for quite other than you and i would not give a pins value for all you will ever reap there mere imaginary harvests sacks of nuggets and the like empty as the eastwindwith all the demons laughing at you do you consider that nature too is a swollen flunky hungry for veils and can be taken in with your sublime airs of sumptuosity and the large balance you actually have in lombard street go to thegeneral cesspool with your nuggets and your ducats  the flunky world much stript of its plush and fat perquisites accuses friedrich wilhelm bitterly of avarice and the cognate vices but it is not so intrinsically in the main his procedure is to be defined as honorable thriftverging towards avarice here and there as poor human virtues usually lean to one side or the other he can be magnificent enough too and grudges no expense when the occasion seems worthy if the occasion is inevitable and yet not quite worthy i have known him have recourse to strange shifts the czar peter for example used to be rather often in the prussian dominions oftenest on business of his own such a man is to be royally defrayed while with us yet one would wish it done cheap posthorses two hundred and eightyseven at every station he has from the community but the rest of his expenses from memel all the way to wesel friedrich wilhelms marginal response to his finanzdirectorium requiring orders once on that subject runs in the following strange tenor yes all the way except berlin which i take upon myself and observe you contrive to do it for 6000 thalers 900 poundswhich is uncommonly cheap about 1 pound per milewont allow you one other penny nit einen pfennig gebe mehr dazu but you are sollen sie this is the remarkable point to give out in the world that it costs me from thirty to forty thousand 1717 forster i 213 so that here is the majesty of prussia who beyond all men abhors lies giving orders to tell one alas yes a kind of lie or fib white fib or even gray the pinch of thrift compelling but what a window into the artless innerman of his majesty even that gray fibnot done by oneself but ordered to be done by the servant as if that were cheaper  verging upon avarice sure enough but unless we are unjust and unkind he can by no means be described as a miser king he collects what is his gives you accurately what is yours for wages paid he will see work done he will ascertain more and more that the work done be work needful for him and strike it off if not a spartan man as we saidthough probably he knew as little of the spartans as the spartans did of him but nature is still capable of such products if in hellas long ages since why not in brandenburg now     chapter v  friedrich wilhelms one war  one of fritzs earliest strong impressions from the outer world chanced to be of warso it chanced though he had shown too little taste that way and could not as yet understand such phenomenaand there must have been much semiarticulate questioning and dialoguing with dame de roucoulles on his part about the matter now going on  in the year 1715 little fritzs third year came grand doings not of drill only but of actual war and fighting the stralsund expedition friedrich wilhelms one feat in that kind huge rumor of which fills naturally the maternal heart the berlin palace drawingrooms and occupies with new vivid interests all imaginations young and old for the actual battledrums are now beating the big cannonwains are creaking under way and military men take farewell and march tramp tramp majesty in grenadierguard uniform at their head horse foot and artillery northward to stralsund on the baltic shore where a terrible human lion has taken up his lair lately charles xii of sweden namely he has broken out of turkish bender or demotica and ended his obstinate torpor at last has ridden fourteen or sixteen days he and a groom or two through desolate steppes and mountain wildernesses through crowded dangerous citiescame by vienna and by cassel then through pommern leaving his royal train of two thousand persons to follow at its leisure he for his part has ridden without pause forward ever forward in darkest incognito the indefatigable manand finally on oldhallowmas eve 22d11th november 1714 far in the night a horseman with two others still following him travelsplashed and white with snow drew bridle at the gate of stralsund and to the surprise of the swedish sentinel there demanded instant admission to the governor the governor at first a little surly of humor saw gradually how it was sprang out of bed and embraced the knees of the snowy man stralsund in general sprang out of bed and illuminated itself that same halloweveand in brief charles xii after five years of eclipse has reappeared upon the stage of things and menaces the world in his old fashion from that city from which it becomes urgent to many parties and at last to friedrich wilhelm himself that he be dislodged  the root of this stralsund story belongs to the former reign as did the grand apparition of charles xii on the theatre of european history and the terror and astonishment he created there he is now thirtythree years old and only the winding up both of him and of the stralsund story falls within our present field fifteen years ago it was like the bursting of a cataract of bombshells in a dull ballroom the sudden appearance of this young fighting swede among the luxurious kings and kinglets of the north all lounging about and languidly minuetting in that manner regardless of expense friedrich iv of denmark rejoicing over red wine august the strong gradually producing his three hundred and fiftyfour bastards memoires de bareith wilhelminas book londres 1812 i 111 these and other neighbors had confidently stept in on various pretexts thinking to help themselves from the young mans properties who was still a minor when the young minor suddenly developed himself as a major and maximus and turned out to be such a fireking among them  in consequence of which there had been no end of northern troubles and all through the louisfourteenth or marlborough grand succession war a special northern war had burnt or smouldered on its own score swedes versus saxons russians and danes bickering in weary intricate contest and keeping those northern regions in smoke if not on fire charles xii for the last five years ever since pultawa and the summer of 1709 had lain obstinately dormant in turkey urging the turks to destroy czar peter which they absolutely could not though they now and then tried and viziers not a few lost their heads in consequence charles lay sullenly dormant danes meanwhile operating upon his holstein interests and adjoining territories saxons russians battering continually at swedish pommern continually marching thither and then marching home again without successalways through the brandenburg territory as they needs must which latter circumstance friedrich wilhelm while yet only crownprince had seen with natural displeasure could that have helped it but charles xii would not yield a whit sent orders peremptorily from his bed at bender or demotica that there must be no surrender neither could the sluggish enemy compel surrender  so that at length it had grown a feeble wearisome welter of inextricable strifes with wornout combatants exhausted of all but their animosity and seemed as if it would never end inveterate ineffective war ruinous to all good interests in those parts what miseries had holstein from it which last to our own day mecklenburg also it involved in sore troubles which lasted long enough as we shall see but brandenburg above all may be impatient brandenburg which has no business with it except that of unlucky neighborhood one of friedrich wilhelms very first operations as king was to end this ugly state of matters which he had witnessed with impatience as prince for a long while  he had hailed even the treaty of utrecht with welcome in hopes it might at least end these northern brabbles this the treaty of utrecht tried to do but could not however it gave him back his prussian fighting men which he has already increased by six regiments raised we may perceive on the ruins of his late courtflunkies and dismissed goldstickswith these friedrich wilhelm will try to end it himself these he at once ordered to form a camp on his frontier close to that theatre of contest and signified now with emphasis in the beginning of 1713 that he decidedly wished there were peace in those pommern regions negotiations in consequence 10th june 1713 buchholz i 21 very wide negotiations louis xiv and the kaiser lending hand to pacify these fighting northern kings and their czar at length the holstein government representing their sworn ally charles xii on the occasion made an offer which seemed promising they proposed that stettin and its dependencies the strong frontier town and as it were key of swedish pommern should be evacuated by the swedes and be garrisoned by neutral troops prussians and holsteiners in equal number which neutral troops shall prohibit any hostile attack of pommern from without sweden engaging not to make any attack through pommern from within that will be as good as peace in pommern till we get a general swedish peace with which friedrich wilhelm gladly complies 22d june 1713 buchholz i 21  unhappily however the swedish commandant in stettin would not give up the place on any representative or secondary authority not without an express order in his kings own hand which as his king was far away in abstruse turkish circumstances and localities could not be had at the moment and involved new difficulties and uncertainties new delay which might itself be fatal the end was the russians and saxons had to cannonade the man out by regular siege they then gave up the town to prussia and holstein but required first to be paid their expenses incurred in sieging it400000 thalers as they computed and demonstrated or some where about 60000 pounds of our money  friedrich wilhelm paid the money holstein not having a groschen took possession of the town and dependent towns and forts intending well to keep them till repaid this was in october 1713 and ever since there has been actual tranquillity in those parts the embers of the northern war may still burn or smoulder elsewhere but here they are quite extinct at first it was a joint possession of stettin holsteiners and prussians in equal number and if friedrich wilhelm had been sure of his money so it would have continued but the holsteiners had paid nothing charles xiis sanction never could be expressly got and the holsteiners were mere dependents of his better to increase our prussian force by degrees and in some good way with a minimum of violence get the holsteiners squeezed out of stettin friedrich wilhelm has so ordered and contrived the prussian force having now gradually increased to double in this important garrison the holsteiners are quietly disarmed one night and ordered to depart under penaltieswhich was done holding such a pawnticket as stettin buttoned in our own pocket we count now on being paid our 60000 pounds before parting with it  matters turned out as friedrich wilhelm had dreaded they might here is charles xii come back inflexible as cold swedish iron will not hear of any treaty dealing with his properties in that manner is he a bankrupt then that you will sell his towns by auction charles does not at heart believe that friedrich wilhelm ever really paid the 60000 pounds charles demands for his own part to have his own swedish town of stettin restored to him and has not the least intention or indeed ability to pay money vain to answer stettin for the present is not a swedish town it is a prussian pawnticketthere was much negotiation correspondence louis xiv and the kaiser stepping in again to produce settlement to no purpose louis gallant old bankrupt tried hard to take charless part with effect but he had himself no money now could only try finessing by ambassadors try a little menacing by them neither of which profited friedrich wilhelm wanting only peace on his borders after fifteen years of extraneous uproar there has paid 60000 pounds in hard cash to have it repay him that sum with promise of peace on his borders he will then quit stettin till then not big words from a french ambassador in big wig will not suffice bullying goes for nothing bange machen gilt nichtthe thing covenanted for will need to be done poor louis the great whom we now call bankruptgreat died while these affairs were pending while charles his ally was arguing and

and successor i have been too fond of war do not imitate me in that ne mimitez pas en cela 1st september 1715 which counsel also as we shall see was considerably lost in air  friedrich wilhelm had a true personal regard for charles xii a man made in many respects after his own heart and would fain have persuaded him into softer behavior but it was to no purpose charles would not listen to reasons of policy or believe that his estate was bankrupt or that his towns could be put in pawn danes saxons russians even george i of england georgehaving just bought of the danish king who had got hold of

concern us here it lasted till midwinter under continual fierce countermovements and desperate sallies from the swedish lion standing at bay there against all the world but friedrich wilhelm was

the besiegers lines the king of denmark saw it and brought a battery to bear upon it his thought had always been that charles should be captured or killed in stralsund and not allowed to get away friedrich wilhelm was of quite another mind and had even used secret influences to that effect eager that charles should escape it is said he remonstrated very passionately with the danish king and this battery of his nay some add since remonstrances did not avail and the battery still threatened to fire friedrich wilhelm drew up a prussian regiment or two at the muzzles of it and said you shall shoot us first then buchholz p 138 which is a pleasant myth at least and symbolical of what the reality was  charles reached his frigate about nightfall but made little way from the place owing to defect of wind they say he even heard the chamade beating in stralsund next day and that a danish frigate had nearly taken him both which statements are perhaps also a little mythical certain only that he vanished at this point into scandinavia and general europe never saw him more vanished into a cloud of untenable schemes guided by alberoni baron gortz and others wild schemes financial

surprised to find that it was a spectre evident spectre seen to pass this way and glide along that gallery as if towards the apartments of the queens ladies captain of the guard could find nothing in that gallery or anywhere and withdrew againbut lo it returns the way it went stalwart sentries were found melted into actual delirium of swooning as the preternatural swept by this second time they

financeminister or has she not has beyond doubt the spectrescullion hopes he has discovered before exorcism upon which grumkow essentially illuminated as to the required particular manages to get the spectrescullion loose again not quite hanged glozing the matter off to his majesty on his return for the rest ruins entirely the creutz speculation and has the nomaid called of honorwith whom creutz thought to have seduced the young king also and made the young king amenabledismissed from court in a peremptory irrefragable manner this is the secret of the spectrescullion fully revealed by

human realities or of any part of them who have sprung not from the idle brains of dreaming dilettanti but from the head of god almighty to make this poor authentic earth a little memorable for us and to do a little work that may be eternal therein those expensive halls of high art at berlin there were to my experience few pictures more agreeable than this of pesnes welcome like one tiny islet of

nothing but a general extract and average of all the faces of friedrich such as has been tacitly agreed upon and is definable as a received pictorialmyth by no means as a fact or credible resemblance of life  but enough now of pictures this of the little drummer the painting and the thing painted which remain to us may be taken as friedrichs first appearance on the stage of the world and welcomed accordingly it is one of the very few visualities or definite certainties we can lay hold of in those young years of his and bring conclusively home to our imagination out of the waste prussian dustclouds of uninstructive garrulity which pretend to record them for us whether it came into existence as a shadowy emanation from the stralsund expedition can only be matter of conjecture to judge by size these figures must have been painted about the year 1715 fritz some three or four years old his sister wilhelmina seven  it remains only to be intimated that friedrich wilhelm for his part had got all he claimed from this expedition namely stettin with the dependent towns and quietness in pommern stettin was from of old the capital of his own part of pommern thrown in along with the other parts of pommern and given to sweden from sheer necessity it was avowed at the peace of westphalia sixty years ago or moreand now by good chance it has come back wait another hundred years and perhaps swedish pommern altogether will come back but from all this friedrich wilhelm is still far stettin and quiet are all he dreams of demanding there  stralsund he did not reckon his left it with the danes to hold in pawn till some general treaty nor was there farther outbreak of war in those regions though actual treaty of peace did not come till 1720 and make matters sure it was the new queen of sweden ulrique eleonora charless younger sister wedded to the young landgraf of hessencasselmuch aided by an english envoywho made this peace with friedrich wilhelm a young english envoy called lord carteret was very helpful in this matter one of his first feats in the diplomatic world for which peace stockholm 21st january 1720 in mauvillon i 380417 the document itself at large friedrich wilhelm

and became notable in sweden herself by and by louisa ulrique born 24th july 1720 queen of sweden in time coming     chapter vii  transit of czar peter  in the autumn of 1717 peter the great coming home from his celebrated french journey paid friedrich wilhelm a visit and passed four days at berlin of which let us give one glimpse if we can with brevity  friedrich wilhelm and the czar like in several points though so dissimilar in others had always a certain regard for one another and at this time they had been brought into closer intercourse by their common peril from charles xii ever since that stralsund business the peril was real especially with a gortz and alberoni putting hand to it and the alarm the rumor and uncertainty were great in those years the wounded lion driven indignant into his lair with plotting artists now operating upon the rage of the noble animal who knows what spring he will next take george i had a fleet cruising in the baltic sounds and again a fleetpaying in that oblique way for bremen and verden which were got otherwise such a bargain to his hanover czar peter had marched an army into denmark united russians and danes count fifty thousand there for a conjunct invasion and probable destruction of sweden but that came to nothing charles looking across upon it too dangerously visible in clear weather over from the danish side 1716

not admiral norris with his cannon been there perhaps and the pretender is coming again they say and who knows what is cominghow gortz in about a year hence was laid hold of and let go and then ultimately tried and beheaded once his lion master was disposed of 19th march 1719 see kohler munzbelustiggungen vi 233240 xvii 297304 for many curious details of gortz and his end how ambassador cellamare and the spanish part of the plot having been discovered in paris cardinal alberoni at madrid was discovered and the whole mystery laid bare all that mad business of bringing the pretender into england throwing out george i throwing out the regent dorleans and much moreis now sunk silent enough not worthy of reawakening but it was then a most loud matter filling the european courts and especially that of berlin with rumors and apprehensions no wonder friedrich wilhelm was grateful for that swedish peace of his and named his little daughter ulrique in honor of it tumultuous cloudworld of lapland witchcraft had ceased hereby and daylight had begun old women or old cardinals riding through the sky on broomsticks to meet satan where now are they the fact still dimly perceptible is europe thanks to that pair of blackartists gortz and alberoni not to mention law the financewizard and his french incantations had been kept generally for these three or four years past in the state of a haunted house riotous goblins of unknown dire intent walking now in this apartment of it now in that no rest anywhere for the perturbed inhabitants  as to friedrich wilhelm his plan in 1717 as all along in this bewitched state of matters was to fortify his frontier towns memel wesel to the right and left especially to fortify stettin his new acquisitionand to put his army and his treasury or armychest more and more in order in that way we shall better meet whatever goblins there may be thinks friedrich wilhelm count lottum hero of the prussians at malplaquet is doing his scientific uttermost in stettin and those frontier towns for the rest his majesty invited by the czar and france has been found willing to make paction with them as he is with all pacific neighbors in

23d28th november 1716 fassmann p 172privately agreeing there about many points conducive to tranquillity and it was on that same errand though ostensibly to look after art and the higher forms of civilization so called that peter had been to france on this celebrated occasion of 1717 we know he saw much art withal saw marly trianon and the grandeurs and politenessessaw among other things a

withal the czar wished to make his bargain with the regent dorleans as to these goblins walking in the northern and southern parts and what was to be done with them and the result has been the czar friedrich wilhelm and the said regent have just concluded an agreement 4th august 1717 buchholz i 43 undertaking in general that the goblins shall be well watched that they three will stand by one another in watching them and now the czar will visit berlin in passing homewards again that is the position of affairs when he pays this visit peter had been in berlin more than once before but almost always in a succinct rapid condition never with his court about him till now this is his last and by far his greatest appearance in berlin  such a transit of the barbaric semifabulous sovereignties could not but be wonderful to everybody there it evidently struck wilhelminas fancy now in her ninth year very much what her little brother did in it or thought of it i nowhere find hinted conclude only that it would remain in his head too visible occasionally to the end of his life wilhelminas narrative very loose dateless or misdated plainly wrong in various particulars has still its value for us human eyes even a childs are worth something in comparison to human wantofeyes which is too frequent in historybooks and elsewhereczar peter is now fortyfive his czarina catherine about thirtyone it was in 1698 that he first passed this way going towards saardam and practical shipbuilding within which twenty years what a spell of work done victory of pultawa is eight years behind him 27th june 1709 victories in many kinds are behind him by this time he is to be reckoned a triumphant czar and is certainly the strangest mixture of heroic virtue and brutish samoeidic savagery the world at any time had  it was sunday 19th september 1717 when the czar arrived in berlin being already sated with scenic parades he had begged to be spared all ceremony begged to be lodged in monbijou the queens little gardenpalace with river and trees round it where he hoped to be quietest monbijou has been set apart accordingly the queen not in the benignest humor sweeping all her crystals and brittle things away knowing the manners of the muscovites nor in the way of ceremony was there much king and queen drove out to meet him rampartguns gave three big salvos as the czarish majesty stept forth i am glad to see you my brother friedrich said peter in german his only intelligible language shaking hands with the brother majesty in a cordial human manner the queen he still more cordially would have kissed but this she evaded in some graceful effective way as to the czarinawho for obstetric and other reasons of no moment to us had stayed in wesel all the time he was in franceshe followed him now at two days distance not along with him as wilhelmina has it wilhelmina says she kissed the queens hand and again and again kissed it begged to present her ladiesabout four hundred socalled ladies who were of her suitesurely not so many as four hundred you too witty princess mere german servingmaids for the most part says the witty princess ladies when there is occasion then acting as chambermaids cooks washerwomen when that is over  queen sophie was averse to salute these creatures but the czarina catherine making reprisals upon our margravines and the king looking painfully earnest in it she prevailed upon herself was there ever seen such a travelling tagraggery of a sovereign court before several of these creatures presque toutes says the exaggerative princess had in their arms a baby in rich dress and if you asked is that yours then they answered making salaams in russian style the czar did me the honor ma fait lhonneur de me faire cet enfant   which statement if we deduct the due 25 per cent is probably not mythic after all a day or two ago the czar had been at magdeburg on his way hither intent upon inspecting matters there and the official gentlemenpresident cocceji afterwards a very celebrated man at the head of themwaited on the czar to do what was needful on entering with the proper address or complimentary harangue they found his czarish majesty standing between two russian ladies clearly ladies of the above sort for they stood close by him one of his arms was round the neck of each and his hands amused themselves by taking liberties in that posture all the time cocceji spoke nay even this was as nothing among the magdeburg phenomena next day for instance there appeared in the audiencechamber a certain serene highpacing duke of mecklenburg with his duchessthriceunfortunate duke of whom we shall too often hear again who after some adventures under charles xii first of all and then under the enemies of charles had about a year ago after divorcing his first wife married a niece of petersduke and duchess arrive now by order or gracious invitation of their sovereign uncle to accompany him in those parts and are announced to an eager czar giving audience to his select magdeburg public at sight of which most desirable duchess and brothers daughter how peter started up satyrlike clasping her in his arms and snatching her into an inner room with the door left ajar and thereit is too samoeidic for human speech and would excel belief were not the testimony so strong pollnitz memoiren ii 95 gives friedrich wilhelm as voucher who used to relate it as from eyeandear witnesses a duke of mecklenburg it would appear who may count himself the nonplusultra of husbands in that epochas among sovereign rulers too in a small or great way he seeks his fellow for illluck  duke and duchess accompanied the czar to berlin where wilhelmina mentions them as presentees part of those four hundred anomalies they took the czar home with them to mecklenburg where indeed some russian regiments of his left here on their return from denmark had been very useful in coercing the rebellious ritterschaft knightage or landedgentry of this duketill at length the general outcry and voice of the reich itself had ordered the said regiments to get on march again and take themselves away the last of them july 1717 two months ago michaelis ii 418 for all is rebellion passive rebellion in mecklenburg taxes being so indispensable and the knights so disinclined and this duke a sovereignsuch as we may construe from his quarrelling with almost everybody and his not quarrelling with an uncle peter of that kind one poor hint on his behalf let us not omit wife quitted him in 1719 and lived at moscow afterwards general mannstein memoirs of russia london 1770 p 27 n his troubles as sovereign duke his flights to dantzig oustings returns lawpleadings and foolish confusions lasted all his life thirty years to come and were bequeathed as a sorrowful legacy to posterity and the neighboring countries voltaire says the czar wished to buy his duchy from him ubi supra xxxi 414 and truly for this wretched duke it would have been good to sell it at any price but there were other words than his to such a bargain had it ever been seriously meditated by this extraordinary duchess he becomes father real or putative of a certain princess whom we may hear of and through her again is grandfather of an unfortunate russian prince much bruited about as the murdered iwan in subsequent times with such a duke and duchess let our acquaintance be the minimum of what necessity compels  wilhelmina goes by hearsay hitherto and it is to be hoped had heard nothing of these magdeburgmecklenburg phenomena but after the czarinas arrival the little creature saw with her own eyes  next day that is wednesday 22d the czar and his spouse came to return the queens visit and i saw the court myself palace grandapartments queen advancing a due length even to the outer guardroom giving the czarina her right hand and leading her into her audiencechamber in that distinguished manner king and czar followed closeand here it was that wilhelminas personal experiences began the czar at once recognized me having seen me before five years ago march 1713 he caught me in his arms fell to kissing me like to flay the skin off my face i boxed his ears sprawled and struggled with all my strength saying i would not allow such familiarities and that he was dishonoring me he laughed greatly at this idea made peace and talked a long time with me i had got my lesson i spoke of his fleet and his conquestswhich charmed him so much that he said more than once to the czarina if he could have a child like me he would willingly give one of his provinces in exchange the czarina also caressed me a good deal the queen mamma and she placed themselves under the dais each in an armchair of proper dignity i was at the queens side and the princesses of the blood margravines above spoken of were opposite to herall in a standing posture as is proper  the czarina was a little stumpy body very brown and had neither air nor grace you needed only look at her to guess her low extraction it is no secret she had been a kitchenwench in her lithuanian native country afterwards a female of the kind called unfortunate under several figures however she saved the czar once by her readywit and courage from a devouring turkish difficulty and he made her fortunate and a czarina to sit under the dais as now with her huddle of clothes she looked for all the world like a german playactress her dress you would have said had been bought at a secondhand shop all was out of fashion all was loaded with silver and greasy dirt the front of her bodice she had ornamented with jewels in a very singular pattern a doubleeagle in embroidery and the plumes of it set with poor little diamonds of the smallest possible carat and very ill mounted all along the facing of her gown were orders and little things of metal a dozen orders and as many portraits of saints of relics and the like so that when she walked it was with a jingling as if you heard a mule with bells to its harnesspoor little czarina shifty nutbrown fellowcreature strangely chased about from the bottom to the top of this world it is evident she does not succeed at queen sophie dorothees court  the czar on the other hand was very tall and might be called handsome continues wilhelmina his countenance was beautiful but had something of savage in it which put you in fear partly a kind of miltonsdevil physiognomy the portraits give it rather so archangel not quite ruined yet in sadly ruinous condition its heroism so bemiredwith a turn for strong drink too at times a physiognomy to make one reflect his dress was of sailor fashion coat altogether plain  the czarina who spoke german very ill herself and did not understand well what the queen said beckoned to her fool to come neara poor female creature who had once been a princess galitzin but having got into mischief had been excused to the czar by her high relations as mad and saved from death or siberia into her present strange harbor of refuge with her the czarina talked in unknown russ evidently laughing much and loud till supper was announced  at table continues wilhelmina the czar placed himself beside the queen it is understood this prince was attempted with poison in his youth and that something of it had settled on his nerves ever after one thing is certain there took him very often a sort of convulsion like tic or stvitus which it was beyond his power to control that happened at table now he got into contortions gesticulations and as the knife was in his hand and went dancing about within armslength of the queen it frightened her and she motioned several times to rise the czar begged her not to mind for he would do her no ill at the same time he took her by the hand which he grasped with such violence that the queen was forced to shriek out this set him heartily laughing saying she had not bones of so hard a texture as his catherines supper done a grand ball had been got ready but the czar escaped at once and walked home by himself to monbijou leaving the others to dance  wilhelminas story of the cabinet of antiques of the indecent little statue there and of the orders catherine got to kiss it with a kopf ab head off if you wont from the bantering czar whom she had to obeyis not incredible after what we have seen it seems he begged this bit of antique indecency from friedrich wilhelm who we may fancy would give him such an article with especial readiness that same day fourth of the visit thursday 23d of the month the august party went its ways again friedrich wilhelm convoying as far as potsdam czar and suite taking that route towards mecklenburg where he still intends some little pause before proceeding homeward friedrich wilhelm took farewell and never saw the czar again  it was on this journey best part of which is now done that the famous order bore do it for six thousand thalers wont allow you one other penny nit einen pfennig gebe mehr dazu  but give out to the world that it costs me thirty or forty thousand nay it is on record that the sum proved abundant and even superabundant near half of it being left as overplus forster i 215 the hospitalities of berlin friedrich wilhelm took upon himself and he has done them as we see you shall defray his czarish majesty to the last prussian milestone punctually properly though with thrift  peters viaticum the antique indecency friedrich wilhelm did not grudge to part with glad to purchase the czars goodwill by coin of that kind last year at havelberg he had given the czar an entire cabinet of amber articles belonging to his late father amber cabinet in the lump and likewise such a yacht for shape splendor and outfit as probably holland never launched beforeyacht also belonging to his late father and without value to friedrich wilhelm the old king had got it built in holland regardless of expense15000 pounds they say perhaps as good as 50000 pounds nowand it lay at potsdam good for what friedrich wilhelm sent it down the havel down the elbe silk sailors and all towards hamburg and petersburg with a great deal of pleasure for the czar and peace and goodwill with the czar was of essential value to him neither at any rate is the czar a man to take gifts without return tall fellows for soldiers that is always one prime object with friedrich wilhelm for already these potsdam guards of his are getting ever more gigantic not less an object though less an ideal or poetic one as we once defined was this other to find buyers for the manufactures new and old which he was so bent on encouraging it is astonishing what quantities of cloth of hardware salt and all kinds of manufactured articles the russians buy from us say the old bookssee how our russian company flourishes in both these objects not to speak of peace and goodwill in general the czar is our man  thus this very autumn there arrive astonished and astonishing no fewer than a hundred and fifty human figures one half more than were promised probably from seven to eight feet high the tallest the czar could riddle out from his dominions what a windfall to the potsdam guard and its colonelking and all succeeding autumns the like so long as friedrich wilhelm lived every autumn out of russia a hundred of the tallest mortals living invaluableto a man of genius mounted on his hobby ones stanza can be polished at this rate  in return for these russian sons of anak friedrich wilhelm grudged not to send german smiths millwrights drillsergeants cannoneers engineers having plenty of them by whom as peter well calculated the inert opaque russian mass might be kindled into luminosity and vitality and drilled to know the art of war for one thing which followed accordingly and it is observable ever since that the russian art of war has a tincture of german in it solid german as contradistinguished from unsolid revolutionaryfrench and hints to us of friedrich wilhelm and the old dessauer to this hourexeant now the barbaric semifabulous sovereignties till wanted again     chapter viii  the crownprince is put to his schooling  in his seventh year young friedrich was taken out of the hands of the women and had tutors and subtutors of masculine gender who had been nominated for him some time ago actually set to work upon their function these we have already heard of they came from stralsund siege all the principal hands  duhan de jandun the young french gentleman who had escaped from grammarlessons to the trenches he is the practical teacher lieutenantgeneral graf fink von finkenstein and lieutenantcolonel von kalkstein they are head tutor oberhofmeister and subtutor military men both who had been in many wars besides stralsund by these three he was assiduously educated subordinate schoolmasters working under them when needful in such branches as the paternal judgment would admit the paternal object and theirs being to infuse useful knowledge reject useless and wind up the whole into a military finish these appointments made at different precise dates took effect all of them in the year 1719  duhan independently of his experience in the trenches appears to have been an accomplished ingenious and conscientious man who did credit to friedrich wilhelms judgment and to whom friedrich professed himself much indebted in after life their progress in some of the technical branches as we shall perceive was indisputably unsatisfactory but the mind of the boy seems to have been opened by this duhan to a lively and in some sort genial perception of things round himof the strange confusedly opulent universe he had got into and of the noble and supreme function which intelligence holds there supreme in art as in nature beyond all other functions whatsoever duhan was now turned of thirty a cheerful amiable frenchman poor though of good birth and acquirements originally from champagne friedrich loved him very much always considered him his spiritual father and to the end of duhans life twenty years hence was eager to do him any good in his power anxious always to repair for poor duhan the great sorrows he came to on his account as we shall see  of graf fink von finkenstein who has had military experiences of all kinds and all degrees from marching as prisoner into france wounded and without his hat to fighting at malplaquet at blenheim even at steenkirk as well as stralsund who is now in his sixtieth year and seems to have been a gentleman of rather high solemn manners and indeed of undeniable perfectionsof this supreme count fink we learn almost nothing farther in the books except that his little pupil did not dislike him either the little pupil took not unkindly to fink welcoming any benignant human ray across these lofty gravities of the oberhofmeister went often to his house in berlin and made acquaintance with two young finks about his own age whom he found there and who became important to him especially the younger of them in the course of the future zedlitzneukirch preussisches adelslexikon  leipzig 1836 ii 168 militairlexicon  i 420 this pupil it may be said is creditably known for his attachment to his teachers and others an attached and attaching little boy of kalkstein a rational experienced and earnest kind of man though as yet but young it is certain also that the little fritz loved him and furthermore that the great friedrich was grateful to him and had a high esteem of his integrity and sense my master kalkstein used to be his designation of him when the name chanced to be mentioned in after times they continued together with various passages of mutual history for forty years afterwards till kalksteins death kalkstein is at present twentyeight the youngest of the three tutors then and ever after an altogether downright correct soldier and man he is of preussen or prussia proper this kalksteinof the same kindred as that mutinous kalkstein whom we once heard of who was rolled in a carpet and kidnapped out of warsaw in the great electors time not a direct descendant of that beheaded kalksteins but as it were his nephew so many times removed preussen is now far enough from mutiny subdued with all its kalksteins into a respectful silence not lightly using the right even of petition or submissive remonstrance which it may still have nor except on the score of parliamentary eloquence and newspaper copyright does it appear that preussen has suffered by the change  how these finkkalkstein functionaries proceeded in the great task they had gotvery great task had they known what pupil had fallen to themis not directly recorded for us with any sequence or distinctness we infer only that everything went by inflexible routine not asking at all what pupilnor much whether it would suit any pupil duhan with the tendencies we have seen in him who is willing to soften the inflexible when possible and to guide nature by a rather loose rein was probably a genial element in the otherwise strict affair fritz had one unspeakable advantage rare among princes and even among peasants in these ruined ages that of not being taught or in general not by the kind called hypocrites and even sincerehypocritesfatalest species of the class hypocrite we perceive he was lessoned all along not by enchanted phantasms of that dangerous sort breathing mendacity of mind unconsciously out of every look but by real men who believed from the heart outwards and were daily doing what they taught to which unspeakable advantage we add a second likewise considerable that his masters though rigorous were not unlovable to himthat his affections at least were kept alive that whatever of seed or of chaff and hail as was likelier fell on his mind had sunshine to help in dealing with it these are two advantages still achievable though with difficulty in our epoch by an earnest father in behalf of his poor little son and these are at present nearly all with these well achieved the earnest father and his son ought to be thankful alas in matter of education there are no highroads at present or there are such only as do not lead to the goal fritz like the rest of us had to struggle his way nature and didactic art differing very much from one another and to do battle incessant partial battle with his schoolmasters for any education he had  a very rough document giving friedrich wilhelms regulations on this subject from his own hand has come down to us most dull embroiled heavy document intricate gnarled and in fine rough and stiff as natural bullheadedness helped by prussian pipeclay can make itcontains some excellent hints too and will show us something of fritzchen and of friedrich wilhelm both at once that is to say always if it can be read if by aid of abridging elucidating and arranging we can get the reader engaged to peruse it patientlywhich seems doubtful the points insisted on in a ponderous but straggling confused manner by his didactic majesty are chiefly these  1 must impress my son with a proper love and fear of god as the foundation and sole pillar of our temporal and eternal welfare no false religions or sects of atheist arian arrian socinian or whatever name the poisonous things have which can so easily corrupt a young mind are to be even named in his hearing on the other hand a proper abhorrence abscheu of papistry and insight into its baselessness and nonsensicality ungrund und absurditat is to be communicated to himpapistry which is false enough like the others but impossible to be ignored like them mention that and give him due abhorrence for it for we are protestant to the bone in this country and cannot stand absurditat least of all hypocritically religious ditto but the grand thing will be to impress on him the true religion which consists essentially in this that christ died for all men and generally that the almightys justice is eternal and omnipresentwhich consideration is the only means of keeping a sovereign person souveraine macht or one freed from human penalties in the right way  2 he is to learn no latin observe that however it may surprise you what has a living german man and king of the eighteenth christian soeculum to do with dead old heathen latins romans and the lingo they spoke their fraction of sense and nonsense in frightful how the young years of the european generations have been wasted for ten centuries back and the thinkers of the world have become mere walking sacks of marinestores gelehrten learned as they call themselves and gone lost to the world in that manner as a set of confiscated pedantsbabbling about said heathens and their extinct lingo and fraction of sense and nonsense for the thousand years last past heathen latins romanswho perhaps were no great things of heathen after all if well seen into i have heard judges say they were inferior in real worth and grist to german homegrowths we have had if the confiscated pedants could have discerned it at any rate they are dead buried deep these two thousand years well out of our wayand nonsense enough of our own left to keep sweeping into corners silence about their lingo and them to this new crownprince let the prince learn french and german so as to write and speak with brevity and propriety in these two languages which may be useful to him in life that will suffice

highest measure to make it your care to infuse into my son einzupragen stamp into him a true love for the soldier business and to impress on him that as there is nothing in the world which can bring a

which is an extreme statement of the case showing how much we have it at heart  these are the chief friedrichwilhelm traits the rest of the document corresponds in general to what the late majesty had written for friedrich wilhelm himself on the like occasion stenzel iii 572 ruthless contempt of useless knowledge and passionate insight into the distinction between useful and useless especially into the worth of soldiering as a royal accomplishment are the chief peculiarities here in which latter point too friedrich wilhelm himself the most pacific of men unless you pulled the whiskers of him or broke into his goods and chattels knew very well what he was meaningmuch better than we of the peace society and philanthropic movement could imagine at first sight it is a thing he for his part is very decided upon  already a year before this time 1st september 1717 preuss i 13 there had been instituted for express behoof of little fritz a miniature soldier company above a hundred strong which grew afterwards to be near three hundred and indeed rose to be a permanent institution by degrees called kompagnie der kronprinzlichen kadetten company of crownprince cadets a hundred and ten boys about his own age sons of noble families had been selected from the three military schools then extant as a kind of tiny regiment for him where if he was by no means commander all at once he might learn his exercise in fellowship with others czar peter it is likely took a glance of this tiny regiment just getting into rank and file there which would remind the czar of his own young days an experienced lieutenantcolonel was appointed to command in chief a certain handy and correct young fellow rentsel by name about seventeen who already knew his fugling to a hairsbreadth was drillmaster and exercised them all fritz especially with due strictness till in the course of time and of attainments fritz could himself take the head charge which he did duly in a year or two a little soldier thenceforth properly strict though of small dimensions in tight blue bit of coat and cockedhatminiature image of papa it is fondly hoped and expected resembling him as a sixpence does a halfcrown in

engineerteacher one major von senning limping about on cork leg and superintending if needful  rentzel it is known proved an excellent drillsergeanthad good talents every way and was a man of probity and sense he played beautifully on the flute too and had a cheerful conversible turn which naturally recommended him still farther to fritz and awoke or encouraged among other faculties the musical faculty in the little boy rentzel continued about him or in sight of him through life advancing gradually not too fast according to real merit and service colonel in 1759 and never did discredit to the choice friedrich wilhelm had made of him of senning too engineermajor von senning who gave fritz his lessons in mathematics fortification and the kindred branches the like or better can be said he was of graver years had lost a leg in the marlborough campaigns poor gentleman but had abundant sense native worth and cheery rational talk in him so that he too could never be parted with by friedrich but was kept on hand to the last a permanent and variously serviceable acquisition  thus at least is the military education of our crownprince cared for and we are to fancy the little fellow from his tenth year or earlier going about in miniature soldier figure for most part in strict spartanbrandenburg costume of body as of mind costume little flattering to his own private taste for finery yet by no means unwholesome to him as he came afterwards to know in october 1723 it is on record when george i came to visit his soninlaw and daughter at berlin his britannic majesty looking out from his new quarters on the morrow saw fritzchen drilling his cadet company a very pretty little phenomenon drilling with clear voice military sharpness and the precision of clockwork on the esplanade lustgarten thereand doubtless the britannic majesty gave some grunt of acquiescence perhaps even a smile rare on that square heavyladen countenance of his that is the record forster i 215 and truly it forms for us by far the liveliest little picture we have got from those dull old years of european history years already sunk or sinking into lonesome unpeopled dusk for all men and fast

satisfaction in shooting partridges and baiting sowswith such an expenditure of industry and such damage to the seedfields he would sometimes allege in extenuation in later years he has been known to retire into some glade of the thickets and hold a little flutehautbois concert with his musical comrades while the sows were getting baited or he would converse with mamma and her ladies if her

familiesit will then be a quarter to 8 all the domestics then withdraw again and duhan now reads with my son the gospel of the sunday expounds it a little adducing the main points of christianityquestioning from nolteniuss catechism which fritz knows by heartit will then be 9 oclock  at 9 he brings my son down to me who goes to church and dines along with me dinner at the stroke of noon the rest of the day is then his own fritzs and duhans at halfpast 9 in the evening he shall come and bid me goodnight shall then directly go to his room very rapidly sehr geschwind get off his clothes wash his hands get into some tiny dressinggown or cassaquin no doubt and so soon as that is done duhan makes a prayer on his knees and sings a hymn all the servants being again there instantly after which my son shall get into bed shall be in bed at halfpast 10and fall asleep how soon your majesty this is very strict work  monday on monday as on all weekdays he is to be called at 6 and so

domestics with worship bible hymn all as on sunday this is done by 7 and the servants go again  from 7 till 9 duhan takes him on history at 9 comes noltenius a sublime clerical gentleman from berlin with the christian religion till a quarter to 11 then fritz rapidly geschwind washes his face with water hands with soapandwater clean shirt powders and puts on his coatabout 11 comes to the king stays with the king till 2perhaps promenading a little dining always at noon after which majesty is apt to be slumberous and light amusements are over  directly at 2 he goes back to his room duhan is there ready takes him upon the maps and geography from 2 to 3giving account gradually of all the european kingdoms their strength and weakness size riches and poverty of their towns from 3 to 4 duhan treats of morality soll die moral tractiren  from 4 to 5 duhan shall write german letters with him and see that he gets a good stylum which he never in the least did about 5 fritz shall wash his hands and go to the kingride out divert himself in the air and not in his room and do what he likes if it is not against god  there then is a sunday and there is one weekday which latter may serve for all the other fivethough they are strictly specified in the royal monograph and every hour of them marked out how and at what points of time besides this of history of morality and writing in german of maps and geography with the strength and weakness of kingdoms you are to take up arithmetic more than once writing of french letters so as to acquire a good stylum in what nook you may intercalate a little getting by heart of something in order to strengthen the memory how instead of noltenius panzendorf another sublime reverend gentleman from berlin who comes out express gives the clerical drill on tuesday morningwith which two onslaughts of an hourandhalf each the clerical gentlemen seem to withdraw for the week and we hear no more of them till monday and tuesday come round again  on wednesday we are happy to observe a liberal slice of holiday come in at halfpast 9 having done his history and got something by heart to strengthen the memory very little it is to be feared fritz shall rapidly dress himself and come to the king and the rest of the day belongs to little fritz gehort vor fritzchen on saturday too there is some fair chance of halfholiday  saturday forenoon till halfpast 10 come history writing and ciphering especially repetition of what was done through the week and in morality as well adds the rapid majesty to see whether he has profited and general graf von finkenstein with colonel von kalkstein shall be present during this if fritz has profited the afternoon shall be his own if he has not profited he shall from 2 to 6 repeat and learn rightly what he has forgotten on the past days and so the laboring week winds itself up here however is one general rule which cannot be too much impressed upon you with which we conclude  in undressing and dressing you must accustom him to get out of and into his clothes as fast as is humanly possible  hurtig so viel als menschenmoglich ist you will also look that he learn to put on and put off his clothes himself without help from others and that he be clean and neat and not so dirty nicht so schmutzig not so dirty that is my last word and here is my signmanual  friedrich wilhelm preuss i 21     chapter ix  wusterhausen  wusterhausen where for the present these operations go on lies about twenty english miles southeast of berlin as you go towards schlesien silesiaon the old silesian road in a flat moory country made of peat and sandand is not distinguished for its beauty at all among royal huntinglodges the gohrde at hanover for example what a splendor there in comparison but it serves friedrich wilhelms simple purposes there is game abundant in the scraggy woodlands otterpools fishpools and miry thickets of that old schenkenland belonged all once to the schenken family till old king friedrich bought it for his prince retinue sufficient find nooks for lodgment in the poor old schloss so called and noltenius and panzendorf drive out each once a week in some light vehicle to drill fritz in his religious exercises  one zollner a tourist to silesia confesses himself rather pleased to find even wusterhausen in such a country of sandy bentgrass lean cattle and flat desolate languor  getting to the top of the ridge most insignificant ridge made by hand wilhelmina satirically says tourist zollner can discern with pleasure a considerable brookvisible not audible smooth stream or chain of meres and lakelets flowing languidly northward towards kopenik inaudible big brook or stream which we perceive drains a slightly hollowed tract too shallow to be called valleyof several miles in width of several yards in depthtract with wood here and there on it and signs of grass and culture welcome after what you have passed on the foreground close to you is the hamlet of konigswusterhausen with tolerable limetree avenue leading to it and the air of something sylvan from your hilltop konigswusterhausen was once wendishwesterhausen and not far off is deutschwusterhausen famed i suppose by factionfights in the vandalic times both of them are now kingswusterhausen since the king came thither to distinguish them from other wusterhausens that there are  descending advancing through your limetree avenue you come upon the backs of officehouses outhouses stables or the likeon your left hand i have guessedextending along the highway and in the middle of these you come at last to a kind of gate or vaulted passage art von thor says zollner where if you have liberty you face to the left and enter here once through into the free light again you are in a court foursquare space not without prospect right side and left side are lodgings for his majestys gentlemen behind you well in their view are stables and kitchens in the centre of the place is a fountain with hewn steps and iron railings where his simple majesty has been known to sit and smoke on summer evenings the fourth side of your square again is a palisade beyond which over bridge and moat and intervening apparatus you perceive on its trim terraces the respectable old schloss itself a rectangular mass not of vast proportions with tower in the centre of it tower for screwstair the general roadway of the house and looking though weatherbeaten yet weathertight and as dignified as it can this is wusterhausen friedrich wilhelms huntingseat from of old  a dreadfully crowded place says wilhelmina where you are stuffed into garrets and have not room to turn the terraces are of some magnitude trimmed all round with a row of little clipped trees one big limetree at each cornerunder one of these big limetrees aided by an awning it is his majestys delight to spread his frugal but substantial dinner fourandtwenty covers at the stroke of 12 and so dine sub dio if rain come on says wilhelmina you are wet to midleg the ground being hollow in that placeand indeed in all weathers your situation every way to a vehement young princesss idea is rather of the horrible sort after dinner his majesty sleeps stretched perhaps on some wooden settle or gardenchair for about an hour regardless of the flaming heat under his awning or not and we poor princesses have to wait praying all the saints that they would resuscitate him soon this is about 2 pm happier fritz is gone to his lessons in the interim  these four terraces this rectangular schloss with the four big lindens at the corners are surrounded by a moat black abominable ditch wilhelmina calls it of the hue of tartarean styx and of a far worse smell in fact enough to choke one in hot days after dinner thinks the vehement princess three bridges cross this moat or ditch from the middle of three several terraces or sides of the schloss and on the fourth it is impassable bridge first coming from the palisade and officehouse court has not only human sentries walking at it but two white eagles perch near it and two black ditto symbols of the heraldic prussian eagle screeching about in their littery way item two black bears ugly as sin which are vicious wretches withal and many times do passengers a mischief as perhaps we shall see on some occasion this is bridge first leading to the court and to the outer highway a kings gentleman going to bed at night has always to pass these bears bridge second leads us southward to a common mill which is near by its clacking audible upon the common stream of the region and not unpleasant to his majesty among its meadows fringed with alders in a country of mere and moor bridge third directly opposite to bridge first and its bears leads you to the garden whither mamma playing tocadille all day with her women will not or will not often enough let us poor girls go zollner briefe uber schlesien berlin 1792 i 2 3 wilhelmina i 364 365  such is wusterhausen as delineated by a vehement princess some years hencewho becomes at last intelligible by study and the aid of our silesian tourist it is not distinguished among country palaces but the figure of friedrich wilhelm asleep there after dinner regardless of the flaming sun should he sleep too long and the shadow of his linden quit himthis is a sight which no other palace in the world can match this will long render wusterhausen memorable to me his majesty early always as the swallows hunts i should suppose in the morning dines and sleeps we may perceive till towards three or later his official business he will not neglect nor shirk the hours due to it towards sunset there may be a walk or ride with fritz or feekin and the womankind and always in the evening his majesty holds tabagie tabakscollegium smoking college kind of tobaccoparliament as we might name it an institution punctually attended to by his majesty of which we shall by and by speak more at wusterhausen his majesty holds his smoking session mostly in the open air oftenest on the steps of the great fountain how arranged as to seating and canvasscreening i cannot saysmokes there with his grumkows derschaus anhaltdessaus and select friends in various slow talk till night kindle her mild starlights shake down her dark curtains over all countries and admonish weary mortals that it is now bedtime  not much of the picturesque in this autumnal life of our little boy but he has employments in abundance and these make the permitted open air under any terms a delight he can rove about with duhan among the gorse and heath and their wild summer tenantry winged and wingless in the woodlands are wild swine in the meres are fishes otters the drowsy hamlets scattered round awaken in an interested manner at the sound of our ponyhoofs and dogs mittenwalde where are shops is within riding distance we could even stretch to kopenik and visit in the big schloss there if duhan were willing and the cattle fresh from some churchsteeple or sandknoll it is to be hoped some blue streak of the lausitz hills may be visible the sun and the moon and the heavenly hosts these full certainly are visible and on an earth which everywhere produces miracles of all kinds from the daisy or heatherbell up to the man one place is nearly equal to another for a brisk little boy  fine palaces if wusterhausen be a sorry one are not wanting to our young friend whatsoever it is in the power of architecture and upholstery to do for him may be considered withal as done wusterhausen is but a huntinglodge for some few autumn weeks the berlin palace and the potsdam grand buildings both few palaces in the world surpass them and there in one or the other of these is our usual residencelittle fritz besides his young finkensteins and others of the like has cousins children of his grandfathers halfbrothers who are comrades of his for the great elector as we saw was twice wedded and had a second set of sons and daughters two of the sons had children certain of these are about the crownprinces own age cousins of his strictly speaking halfcousins of his fathers who are much about him in his young daysand more or less afterwards according to the worth they proved to have margraves and margravines of schwedtthere are five or six of such young cousins not to mention the eldest friedrich wilhelm by name who is now come to manhood born 1700who wished much in after years to have had wilhelmina to wife but had to put up with a younger princess of the house and ought to have been thankful this one has a younger brother heinrich slightly fritzs senior and much his comrade at one time of whom we shall transiently hear again of these two the old dessauer is uncle if both his majesty and the crownprince should die one of these would be king a circumstance which wilhelmina and the queen have laid well to heart and build many wild suspicions upon in these years as that the old dessauer with his gunpowder face has a plot one day to assassinate his majestyplot evident as sunlight to wilhelmina and mamma which providentially came to nothingand other spectral notions of theirs wilhelmina i 35 41 the father of these two margraves elder of the two halfbrothers that have children died in the time of old king friedrich eight or nine years ago their mother the scheming old margravine whom i always fancy to dress in high colors is still livingas wilhelmina well knows  then by another the younger of those old halfbrothers there is a karl a second friedrich wilhelm cousin margraves plenty of cousinsand two

pleasantly their various qualities which were good in most in some not so good and did not turn out supreme in any case but for the rest sister wilhelmina is his grand confederate and companion true in sport and in earnest in joy and in sorrow their truthful love to one another now and till death is probably the brightest element their life yielded to either of them  what might be the date of fritzs first appearance in the roucoulles soiree held on wednesdays in the finkenstein or any other soiree as an independent figure i do not know but at the proper time he does appear there and with distinction not extrinsic alonetalks delightfully in such places can discuss even with french divines in a charmingly ingenious manner another of his elderly consorts i must mention colonel camas a highly cultivated frenchman french altogether by parentage and breeding though born on prussian land who was tutor at one time to some of those young margraves he has lost an armleft it in those

wisdom and goodness could not readily be paralleled in france or elsewhere of both these camases there will be honorable and important mention by and by especially of the lady whom he continues to call mamma for fifty years to come and corresponds with in a very beautiful and human fashion  under these auspices in such environment dimly visible to us at wusterhausen and elsewhere is the remarkable little crownprince of his century growing upprosperously as yet     chapter x  the heidelberg protestants  friedrich wilhelm holds tabagie nightly but at wusterhausen or wherever he may be there is no lack of intricate official labor which even in the tabagie friedrich wilhelm does not forget at the time he was concocting those instructions for his little princes schoolmasters and smoking meditative under the stars with magdeburg ritterdienst and much else of his own to think ofthere is an extraneous political intricacy making noise enough in the world much in his thoughts withal and no doubt occasionally murmured of amid the tobaccoclouds the business of the heidelberg protestants which is just coming to a height in those autumn months of 1719  indeed this year 1719 was a particularly noisy one for him this is the year of the nephritic colic which befell at brandenburg on some journey of his majestys with alarm of immediate death queen sophie sent for by express testament made in her favor and intrigues very black ones wilhelmina thinks following thereupon memoires de bareith i 2629 and the affair of clement on which the old books are so profuse falls likewise the crisis of it falls in 1719 of clement the hungarian nobleman who was a mere hungarian swindler and forger of royal letters sowing mere discords black suspicions between friedrich wilhelm and the neighboring courts imperial and saxon your majesty to be snapt up some day by hired ruffians and spirited away for behoof of those treacherous courts so that friedrich wilhelm fell into a gloom of melancholy and for long weeks never slept but with a pair of loaded pistols under his pillowof this clement an adroit phenomenon of the kind and intensely agitating to friedrich wilhelmwhom friedrich wilhelm had at last to lay hold of try this very year and ultimately hang had arrived in berlin end of 1717 stayed about a year often privately in the kings company poisoning the royal mind withdrew to the hague suspecting berlin might soon grow dangerousis wiled out of that territory into the prussian and arrested by one of friedrich wilhelms colonels end of 1718 lies in spandau getting

noisy as he was and still filling many pages of the old books a hint shall suffice and we will say nothing farther but this of the heidelberg protestants though also rather an extinct business has still some claims on us this in justice to the inarticulate man of genius and for other reasons we must endeavor to resuscitate a little     of kurpfalz karl philip how he got a wife long since and did feats in the world  there reigns in these years at heidelberg as elector palatine a kindtempered but abrupt and somewhat unreasonable old gentleman now verging towards sixty karl philip by name who has come athwart the berlin court and its affairs more than once and will again do so in a singularly disturbing way from before friedrich wilhelms birth all through friedrich wilhelms life and farther this karl philip is a stoneofstumbling there his first feat in life was that of running off with a prussian princess from berlin the rumor of which was still at its height when friedrich wilhelm a fortnight after came into the worldthe gossips still talking of it we may fancy when friedrich wilhelm was first swaddled an unheardof thing the manner of which was this  readers have perhaps forgotten that old king friedrich i once had a brother elder brother who died to the fathers great sorrow and made way for friedrich as crownprince this brother had been married a short time he left a widow without children a beautiful lithuanian princess born radzivil and of great possessions in her own country she in her crapes and closecap remained an ornament to the new berlin court for some timenot too long the mourningyear once out a new marriage came on foot for the brilliant widow the bridegroom a james sobieski eldest prince of the famous john king sobieski prince with fair outlooks towards polish sovereignty and handy for those lithuanian possessions of hers altogether an eligible match  this marriage was on foot not quite completed when karl philip cadet of the pfalz came to berlina rather idle young man once in the clerical way now gone into the military with secular outlooks his elder brother heirapparent of the pfalz having no childrencame to berlin in the course of visiting and roving about the beautiful widowprincess seemed very charming to karl philip he wooed hard threw the princess into great perplexity she had given her yes to james sobieski inevitable weddingday was coming on with james and here was karl philip wooing soin brief the result was she galloped off with karl philip on the eve of said weddingday married karl philip 24th july 1688 and left prince james standing there too much like lots wife in the astonished court of berlin michaelis ii 93 judge if the berlin public talkedunintelligible to friedrioh wilhelm then safe in swaddlingclothes  king sobieski the father famed deliverer of vienna was in high dudgeon but karl philip apologized to all lengths made his peace at last giving a sister of his own to be wife to the injured james this was karl philips first outbreak in life and it was not his only one a man not illdisposed all grant but evidently of headlong turn with a tendency to leap fences in this world he has since been soldiering about in a loose way governing innspruck fighting the turks but lately his elder brother died childless year 1716 and left him kurfurst of the pfalz his fair radzivil is dead long ago she and a successor or it may be two except one daughter whom the fair radzivil left him he has no children and in these times i think lives with a third wife of the lefthand kind  his scarcity of progeny is not so indifferent to my readers as they might suppose this new kurpfalz electorpalatine karl philip is by genealogywho thinks the reader pfalzneuburg by line own grandson of that wolfgang wilhelm who got the slap on the face long since on account of the clevejulich matter so it has come round the line of simmern died out winterkings grandson the last of that and then as right was the line of neuburg took the top place and became kurpfalz the first of these was this karl philips father son of the beslapped an old man when he succeeded karl philip is the third kurpfalz of the neuburg line his childless elder brother he who collected the pictures at dusseldorf once notable there was second of the neuburgs they now we say are electorspalatine head of the houseand we need not add along with their electorate and neuburg country possess the clevejulioh moiety of heritage about which there was such worrying in time past nay the last kurpfalz resided there and collected the dusseldorf gallery as we have just said though karl philip prefers heidelberg hitherto  to friedrich wilhelm the scarcity of progeny is a thriceinteresting fact for if this actual neuburg should leave no male heir as is now humanly probablethe line of neuburg too is out and then great things ought to follow for our prussian house then by the last bargain made in 1666 with all solemnity between the great elector our grandfather of famous memory and your serene father the then pfalzneuburg subsequently kurpfalz likewise of famous memory son of the beslappedthe whole heritage falls to prussia no other pfalz branch having thenceforth the least claim to it bargain was express signed sealed sanctioned drawn out on the due extent of sheepskin which can still be read bargain clear enough but will this karl philip incline to keep it  that may one day be the interesting question but that is not the question of controversy at present not that but another for karl philip it would seem is to be a frequent stoneofstumbling to the prussian house the present question is of a protestantpapist matter into which friedrich wilhelm has been drawn by his public spirit alone     karl philip and his heidelberg protestants  the pfalz population was from of old protestantcalvinist the electorspalatine used to be distinguished for their forwardness in that matter so it still is with the pfalz population but with the electors now that the house of simmern is out and that of neuburg in it is not so the neuburgs ever since that slap on the face have continued popish a sore fact for this protestant population when it got them for sovereigns karl philips father an old soldier at vienna and the elder brother a collector of pictures at dusseldorf did not outwardly much molest the creed of their subjects protestants and the remnant of catholics remnant naturally rather expanding now that the court shone on it were allowed to live in peace according to the treaty of westphalia or nearly so dividing the churches and churchrevenues equitably between them as directed there but now that karl philip is come in there is no mistaking his procedures he has come home to heidelberg with a retinue of jesuits about him to whom the poor old gentleman looking before and after on this troublous world finds it salutary to give ear  his nibblings at protestant rights his contrivances to slide catholics into churches which were not theirs and the like foulplay in that matter had been sorrowful to see for some time past the elector of mainz chiefpriest of germany is busy in the same bad direction he and others indeed ever since the peace of ryswick where louis xiv surreptitiously introduced a certain clause which could never be got rid of again clause of the fourth article is the technical name of it fourth article stipulates that king louis xiv shall punctually restore all manner of towns and places in the palatinate c much burnt somewhat bejesuited too in late wars by the said king during his occupancy clause of fourth article added to it by a quirk at midnight say the books contains merely these words religione tamen catholica romana in locis sic restitutis in statu quo nunc est remanente romancatholic religion to continue as it now is as we have made it to be in such towns and placeswhich clause gave rise to very great but ineffectual lamenting and debating scholl traites de paix par 1817 i 433438 buchholz spittler geschichte wurtembergs c nibbling aggressions of this kind have gone on more and more always too sluggishly resisted by the corpus evangelicorum in the diets or otherwise the united protestant sovereigns not being an active body there and now more sluggishly than eversaid corpus having august elector of saxony catholic shamcatholic king of poland for its official head august the physically strong a man highly unconcerned for matters evangelical so that the nibblings go on worse and worse an offence to all protestant rulers who had any conscience at length an unbearable on to friedrich wilhelm who alone of them all decided to intervene effectually and say at whatever risk there might be we will not stand it  karl philip after some nibblings took up the heidelberg catechism which candidly calls the mass idolatrous and ordered said catechism an authorized book to cease in his dominions hessencassel a protestant neighbor pleaded remonstrated friedrich wilhelm glooming in the rear but to no purpose our old gentleman his priests being very diligent upon him decided next to get possession of the heiligegeist kirche church of the holy ghost principal place of worship at heidelberg and make it his principal cathedral church there by treaty of westphalia or peaceably otherwise the catholics are already in possession of the choir but the whole church would be so much better was it not catholic once thought karl philip to himself built by our noble ancestor kaiser rupert of the pfalz rupert klemm pincers so named for his firmness of mindwhy should these heretics have it i will build them another these thoughts in 1719 the third year of karl philips rule had broken out into open action 29th august 4th september the consummation of it mauvillon i 340345 and precisely in the ime when friedrich wilhelm was penning that first didactic morsel which we read grave clouds from the palatinate were beginning to overshadow the royal mind more or less  for the poor heidelberg consistorium as they could not undertake to give up their church on request of his serenityhow dare we or can we answered theyhad been driven out by compulsion and stratagem partly strategic was the plan adopted to avoid violence smiths picklocks being employed and also masons crowbars but the end was on the 31st of august 1719 consistorium and congregation found themselves fairly in the street and the heiligegeist kirche clean gone from them screen of the choir is torn down one big catholic edifice now getting decorated into a court church where serene highness may feel his mind comfortable  the poor heidelbergers thus thrown into the street made applications lamentations but with small prospect of help to whom apply with any sure prospect remonstrances from hessencassel have proved unavailing with his bigoted serene highness corps evangelicorum so presided over as at present what can be had of such a corpus longwinded lucubrations at the utmost real action in such a matter none or will the kaiser his jesuits advising him interfere to do us justice kurmainz and the restit is everywhere one story everywhere unhappy protestantism getting bad usage and ever worse and no corpus evangelicorum or appointed watchdog doing other than hang its ears and look sorry for itself and us  the heidelbergers however had applied to friedrich wilhelm among others friedrich wilhelm who had long looked on these antiprotestant phenomena with increasing anger found now that this of the heidelberg catechism and heiligegeist kirche was enough to make ones patience run over your unruly catholic bull plunging about and goring men in that mad absurd manner it will behoove that somebody take him by the horns or by the tail and teach him manners teach him not by vocal precepts it is likely which would avail nothing on such a brute but by practical cudgelling and scourging to the due pitch pacific friedrich wilhelm perceived that he himself would have to do that disagreeable featthe growl of him on coming to such resolution must have been consolatory to these poor heidelbergers when they appliedhis plan is very simple as the plans of genius are but a plan leading direct to the end desired and probably the only one that would have done so in the circumstances cudgel in hand he takes the catholic bullshall we say by the hornsmore properly perhaps by the tail and teaches him manners     friedrich wilhelms methodproves remedial in heidelberg  friedrich wilhelms first step of course was to remonstrate pacifically with his serene highness on the heidelbergchurch affair from this he probably expected nothing nor did he get anything getting nothing from this and the countenance of external protestant powers especially of george i and the dutch being promised him in ulterior measures he directed his administrative officials in magdeburg in minden in hamersleben where are catholic foundations of importance to assemble the catholic canons abbots chief priests and all whom it might concern in these three places and to signify to them as follows  from us your protestant sovereign you yourselves and all men will witness you have hitherto had the best of usage fairplay according to the laws of the reich and evenmore with the protestants at heidelberg on the part of the catholic powers it is different it must cease to be different it must become the same and to make it do so you are the implement i have sorry for it but there is no other handy from this day your churches also are closed your public worship ceases and furthermore your revenues cease and all makes dead halt and falls torpid in respect of you from this day and so continues till the day may it be soon when the heidelberg church of the holy ghost is opened again and right done in that question be it yours to speed such day it is you that can and will you who know those high catholic regions inaccessible to your protestant sovereign till then you are as dead men temporarily fallen dead for a purpose and herewith god have you in his keeping mauvillon i 347 349  that was friedrich wilhelms plan the simplest but probably the one effectual plan infallible this plan if you dare stand upon it which friedrich wilhelm does he has a formidable army ready for fight a treasury or armychest in good order george i seconds according to bargain shuts the catholic church at zelle in his luneburg country in like fashion dutch too and swiss will endorse the matter

magdeburghamersleben people shrieked piteously not to friedrich wilhelm whom they knew to be deaf on that side of his head but to the kaiser to the pope to the serenity of heidelberg serene highness of heidelberg was much huffed kaiser dreadfully so and wrote heavy menacing rebukes to which friedrich wilhelm listened with a minimum of reply keeping firm hold of the tail in such bellowing of the animal the end was serene highness had to comply within three months kaiser serene highness and the other parties interested found that there would be nothing for it but to compose themselves and do

and jesuits till he can report that all is as it should be on that head karl philip felt so disgusted with these results he removed his court that same year to mannheim quitted heidelberg to the discouragement and visible decay of the place and in spite of humble petitions and remonstrances never would return neither he nor those that followed him would shift from mannheim again to this day     prussian majesty has displeased the kaiser and the king of poland  friedrich wilhelms praises from the protestant public were great on this occasion nor can we who lie much farther from it in every sense refuse him some grin of approval act and manner of doing the act are creditably of a piece with friedrich wilhelm physiognomic of the rugged veracious man it is one of several such acts done by him for it was a duty apt to recur in germany in his day this duty friedrich wilhelm a solid protestant after his sort and convinced of the nothingness and nonsensicality ungrund und absurditat of papistry was always honorably prompt to do there is an honest baconandgreens conscience in the man almost the one conscience you can find in any royal man of that day promptly without tremulous counting of costs he always starts up solid as oak on the occurrence of such a thing and says that is unjust contrary to the treaty of westphalia you will have to put down thatand if words avail not his plan is always the same clap a similar thumbscrew pressure equitably calculated on the catholics of prussia these can complain to their popes and jesuit dignitaries these are under thumbscrew till the protestant pressure be removed which always did rectify the matter in a little time one other of these instances that of the salzburg protestants the last such instance as this of heidelberg was the first will by and by claim notice from us  it is very observable how friedrich wilhelm hating quarrels was ever ready to turn out for quarrel on such an occasion though otherwise conspicuously a king who stayed well at home looking after his own affairs meddling with no neighbor that would be at peace with him this properly is friedrich wilhelms sphere of political activity among his contemporaries this small quasidomestic sphere of forbidding injury to protestants a most small sphere but then a genuine one nor did he seek even this had it not forced itself upon him and truly we might ask what has become of the other more considerable spheres in that epoch the supremest loudtrumpeting political activities which then filled the world and its newspapers what has the upshot of them universally been zero and oblivion no other while this poor friedrichwilhelm sphere is perhaps still a countable quantity wise is he who stays well at home and does the duty he finds lying there  great favor from the protestant public but on the other hand his majesty had given offence in high places what help for it the thing was a point of conscience with him natural to the surly royal overseer going his rounds in the world stick in hand however the kaiser was altogether gloomy of brow at such disobedience a kaiser unfriendly to friedrich wilhelm witness that of the ritterdienst our unreasonable magdeburg ritters countenanced by him on such terms in such style too and other offensive instances that could be given perhaps the kaiser will not always continue gloomy of brow perhaps the thoughts of the imperial breast may alter on our behalf or his own one day  nor could king august the physically strong be glad to see his director function virtually superseded in this triumphant way a year or two ago friedrich wilhelm had with the due cautions and politic reserves inquired of the corpus evangelicorum if they thought the present directorship that of august the physically strong a good one and whether he friedrich wilhelm ought not perhaps himself to be directorto which though the answer was clear as noonday this poor corpus had only mumbled some quieta non movere or other wisefoolish saw and helplessly shrugged its shoulders 17171719 when augusts kurprinz heirapparent likewise declared himself papist to the horror and astonishment of poor saxony and wedded the

jovial social kind of animal quite otherwise occupied in the world busy producing his three hundred and fiftyfour bastards there and not careful of church matters at allhad expressed his indignant surprise and now it would seem nevertheless though the title remains where it was the function has fallen to another who actually does it a thing to provoke comparisons in the public  clement the hungarian forger vender of false statesecrets is well hanged went to the gallows 18th april 1720 with much circumstance just two days before that heidelberg church was got reopened but the suspicions sown by clement cannot quite be abolished by the hanging of him forger indisputably but who knows whether he had not something of fact for his what with clement what with this heidelberg business the court of berlin has fallen wrong with dresden with vienna itself and important clouds have risen  there is an absurd flame of war blown out by admiral byng and a new man of genius announces himself to the dim populations  the poor kaiser himself is otherwise in trouble of his own at this time the spaniards and he have fallen out in spite of utrecht treaty and rastadt ditto the spaniards have taken sicily from him and precisely in those days while karl philip took to shutting up the heiligegeist church at heidelberg there was loud enough in all the newspapers silent as it now is a siege of

say anon for it was a fearful operation though a ludicrous one this of the poor kaiser and it tormented not the big nations only and threw an absurd europe into paroxysm after paroxysm but it whirled up in its wideweeping skirts our little fritz and his sister and almost dashed the lives out of them as we shall see which last is perhaps the one claim it now has to a cursory mention from mankind

preciseness if grounded here and there only on the sicvolo how could they be always kept except on the surface and to the eye merely the good duhan diligent to open his pupils mind and give nature fairplay had practically found it inexpedient to tie him too rigorously to the arbitrary formal departments where no natural curiosity but only order from without urges the ingenious pupil what maximum strictness in schooldrill there can have been we may infer from one thing were there no other the ingenious pupils mode of spelling fritz learned to write a fine freeflowing rapid and legible

course of his life but to spell much more to punctuate and subdue the higher mysteries of grammar to himself was always an unachievable perfection he did improve somewhat in after life but here is the length to which he had carried that necessary art in the course of nine years exertion under duhan and the subsidiary preceptors it is in the following words and alphabetic letters that he gratefully bids duhan farewellwho surely cannot have been a very strict drillsergeant in the arbitrary branches of schooling  mon cher duhan je vous promais promets que quand jaurez jaurai mon propre argent en

he would himself now and then regretfully discern in riper years with some transient attempt or resolution to remedy or help it seems to have come mainly by nature so likewise his stylus both in french and germana very fair style too in the former dialectbut as to his spelling let him try as he liked he never came within sight of perfection  the things ordered with such rigorous minuteness if but arbitrary things were apt to be neglected the things forbidden especially in the like case were apt to become doubly tempting it appears the prohibition of latin gave rise to various attempts on the part of friedrich to attain that desirable language secret lessons not from duhan but no doubt with duhans connivance were from time to time undertaken with this view once it is recorded the vigilant friedrich wilhelm going his rounds came upon fritz and one of his preceptors not duhan but a subaltern actually engaged in this illicit employment friedrich himself was wont to relate this anecdote in after life busching beitrage zu der lebensgeschichte denkwurdiger personen v 33 preuss i 24 they had latin books dictionaries grammars on the table all the contraband apparatus busy with

at the top of his speed and ended the latin for that time forster i 356  friedrichs latin could never come to much under these impediments but he retained some smatterings of it in mature life and was rather fond of producing his classical scrapsoften in an altogether mouldy and indeed hitherto inexplicable condition de gustibus non est disputandus beati possedentes compille intrare beatus pauperes spiritus the meaning of these can be guessed but tot verbas tot spondera for examplewhat can any commentator make of that festina lente dominus vobiscum flectamus genua quod bene notandum these phrases too and some three or four others of the like have been riddled from his writings by diligent men preuss i 24 furnishes the whole stock of them o tempora o mores you see i dont forget my latin writes he once  the worst fruit of these contraband operations was that they involved the boy in clandestine practices secret disobediences apt to be found out from time to time and tended to alienate his father from him of which sad mutual humor we already find traces in that early wusterhausen document not to be so dirty says the reproving father and the boy does not take to hunting at all likes

you are not born to be of the regimental band thinks friedrich wilhelm fritz is celebrated too for his fine foot a dapper little fellow altogether pretty in the eyes of simple female courtiers with his blond locks combed out at the temples with his bright eyes sharp wit and sparkling capricious ways the cockatoo locks these at least we will abate decides the paternal mind  and so unexpectedly

panzendorf for instance they were busy teaching friedrich religion rather a strange operation this too if we were to look into it we will not look too closely another pair of excellent most solemn drillsergeants in clerical black serge they also are busy instilling dark doctrines into the bright young boy so far as possible but do not seem at any time to have made too deep an impression on him may we not say that in matter of religion too friedrich was but illbested enlightened edictofnantes protestantism a cross between bayle and calvin that was but indifferent babes milk to the little creature nor could nolteniuss catechism and ponderous drillexercise in orthodox theology much inspire a clear soul with pieties and tendencies to soar heavenward  alas it is a dreary litter indeed mere wagonload on wagonload of shotrubbish that is heaped round this new human plant by noltenius and company among others a wonder only that they did not extinguish all sense of the highest in the poor young soul and leave only a sense of the dreariest and stupidest but a healthy human soul can stand a great deal the healthy soul shakes off in an unexpectedly victorious manner immense masses of dry rubbish that have been shot upon it by its assiduous pedagogues and professors what would become of any of us otherwise duhan opening the young soul by such modest gift as duhan had to recognize black from white a little in this embroiled high universe is probably an exception in some small measure but duhan excepted it may be said to have been in spite of most of his teachers and their diligent endeavors that friedrich did acquire some human piety kept the sense of truth alive in his mind knew in whatever words he phrased it the divine eternal nature of duty and managed in the muddiest element and most eclipsed age ever known to steer by the heavenly loadstars and so we must candidly term it to follow gods law in some measure with or without noltenius for company nolteniuss catechism or ghostly drillmanual for fritz at least the catechism he had plied wilhelmina with which no doubt was the same is still extant preuss i 15specimens of it in rodenbeck a very abstruse piece orthodox lutherancalvinist all proved from scripture giving what account it can of this unfathomable universe to the young mind to modern prussians it by no means shines as the indubitablest theory of the universe indignant modern prussians produce excerpts from it of an abstruse nature and endeavor to deduce therefrom some of friedrichs aberrations in matters of religion which became notorious enough by and by alas i fear it would not have been easy even for the modern prussian to produce a perfect catechism for the use of friedrich this universe still continues a little abstruse  and there is another deeper thing to be remarked the notion of teaching religion in the way of drillexercise which is a very strange notion though a common one and not peculiar to noltenius and friedrich wilhelm piety to god the nobleness that inspires a human soul to struggle heavenward cannot be taught by the most exquisite catechisms or the most industrious preachings and drillings no alas no only by far other methodschiefly by silent continual example silently waiting for the favorable mood and moment and aided then by a kind of miracle well enough named the grace of godcan that sacred contagion pass from soul into soul how much beyond whole libraries of orthodox theology is sometimes the mute action the unconscious look of a father of a mother who had in them devoutness pious nobleness in whom the young soul not unobservant though not consciously observing came at length to recognize it to read it in this irrefragable manner a seed planted thenceforth in the centre of his holiest affections forevermore  noltenius wore black serge kept the corners of his mouth well down and had written a catechism of repute but i know not that noltenius carried much seed of living piety about with him much affection from or for young fritz he could not well carry on the whole it is a bad outlook on the religious side and except in apprenticeship to the rugged and as yet repulsive honesties of friedrich wilhelm i see no good element in it baylecalvin with noltenius and catechisms of repute there is no religion to be had for a little fritz out of all that endless doubt will be provided for him out of all that probably disbelief of all thatand on the whole if any form at all a very scraggy form of moral existence from which the highest shall be hopelessly absent and in which anything high anything not low and lying will have double merit  it is indeed amazing what quantities and kinds of extinct ideas apply for belief sometimes in a menacing manner to the poor mind of man and poor mind of child in these days they come bullying in upon him in masses as if they were quite living ideas ideas of a dreadfully indispensable nature the evident counterpart and salutary interpretation of facts round him which it is promised the poor young creature he shall recognize to correspond with them one day at which correspondence when the facts are once well recognized he has at last to ask himself with amazement did i ever recognize it then whereby come results incalculable not good results any of themsome of them unspeakably bad the ease of crownprince friedrich in berlin is not singular all cities and places can still show the like and when it will end is not yet clear but that it ever should have begun will one day be the astonishment as if the divinest function of a human being were not even that of believing of discriminating with his godgiven intellect what is from what is not and as if the point were to render that either an impossible function or else what we must sorrowfully call a revolutionary rebellious and mutinous one o noltenius o panzendorf do for pitys sake take away your catechetical ware and say either nothing to the poor young boy or some small thing he will find to be beyond doubt when he can judge of it fever pestilence are bad for the body but doubt impious mutiny doubly impious hypocrisy are these nothing for the mind who would go about inculcating doubt unless he were far astray indeed and much at a loss for employment  but the sorest fact in friedrichs schooling the forest for the present though it ultimately proved perhaps the most beneficent one being well dealt with by the young soul and nobly subdued to his higher uses remains still to be set forth which will be a long business first and last     chapter xii  crownprince falls into disfavor with papa  those vivacities of young fritz his taste for music finery those furtive excursions into the domain of latin and forbidden things were distasteful and incomprehensible to friedrich wilhelm where can such things end they begin in disobedience and intolerable perversity they will be the ruin of prussia and of fritzhere in fact has a great sorrow risen we perceive the first small cracks of incurable divisions in the royal household the breaking out of fountains of bitterness which by and by spread wide enough a young sprightly capricions and vivacious boy inclined to selfwill had it been permitted developing himself into foreign tastes into french airs and ways very ill seen by the heavyfooted practical germanic majesty  the beginnings of this sad discrepancy are traceable from friedrichs sixth or seventh year not so dirty boy and there could be no lack of growth in the mutual illhumor while the boy himself continued growing enlarging in bulk and in activity of his own plenty of new children come to divide our regard withal and more are coming five new princesses wise little ulrique the youngest of them named of sweden and the happy swedish treaty whom we love much for her grave staid ways nay next after ulrique comes even a new prince august wilhelm ten years younger than friedrich and is growing up much more according to the paternal heart pretty children all of them more or less and towardly and comfortable to a fatherand the worst of them a paragon of beauty in comparison to perverse clandestine disobedient fritz with his french fopperies flutings and cockatoo fashions of hair  and so the silent divulsion silent on fritzs part exploding loud enough now and then on his fathers part goes steadily on splitting ever wider new offences ever superadding themselves till at last the rugged father has grown to hate the son and longs with sorrowful indignation that it were possible to make august wilhelm crownprince in his stead this fritz ought to fashion himself according to his fathers pattern a wellmeant honest pattern and he does not alas your majesty it cannot be it is the new generation come which cannot live quite as the old one did a perennial controversy in human life coeval with the genealogies of men this little boy should have been the excellent paternal majestys exact counterpart resembling him at all points as a little sixpence does a big halfcrown but we perceive he cannot this is a new coin with a stamp of its own a surprising friedrich dor this and may prove a good piece yet but will never be the halfcrown your majesty requires  conceive a rugged thicksided squire western of supreme degreeor this squire western is a hot hohenzollern and wears a crown royalconceive such a burly neplusultra of a squire with his broadbased rectitudes and surly irrefragabilities the honest german instincts of the man convictions certain as the fates but capable of no utterance or next to none in words and that he produces a son who takes into voltairism piping fiddling and belleslettres with apparently a total contempt for grumkow and the giantregiment sulphurous rage in gusts or in lasting tempests rising from a fund of just implacability is inevitable such as we shall see  the mother as mothers will secretly favors fritz anxious to screen him in the day of highwind withal she has plans of her own in regard to fritz and the others being a lady of many plans that of the doublemarriage for example of marrying her prince and princess to a princess and prince of the englishhanoverian house it was a pleasant eligible plan consented to by papa and the other parties but when it came to be perfected by treaty amid the rubs of external and internal politics what new amazing discrepancies rose upon her poor children and her fearfully aggravating the quarrel of father and son almost to the fatal point of that doublemarriage whirled up in a universe of intriguing diplomacies in the skirts of the kaisers huge spectrehunt as we have called it there will be sad things to say by and by  plans her majesty has and silently a will of her own she loves all her children especially fritz and would so love that they loved herfor the rest all along fritz and wilhelmina are sure allies we perceive they have fallen into a kind of cipherspeech

have risen in the berlin palace fountains of bitterness flowing ever wider till they made life all bitter for son and for father necessitating the proud son to hypocrisies towards his terrible father which were very foreign to the proud youth had there been any other resource but there was none now or afterwards even when the young man driven to reflection and insight by intolerable miseries had begun to recognize the worth of his surly rhadamanthine father and the intrinsic wisdom of much that he had meant with him the father hardly ever could or could only by fits completely recognize the sons worth rugged suspicious papa requires always to be humored cajoled even when our feeling towards him is genuine and loyal friedrich to the last we can perceive has to assume masquerade in addressing him in writing to himand in spite of real love must have felt it a relief when such a thing was over that is all along a sad element of friedrichs education out of which there might have come incalculable damage to the young man had his natural assimilative powers to extract benefit from all things been less considerable as it was he gained selfhelp from it gained reticence the power to keep his own counsel and did not let the hypocrisy take hold of him or be other than a hateful compulsory masquerade at an uncommonly early age he stands before us accomplished in endurance for one thing a very bright young stoic of his sort silently prepared for the injustices of men and things and as for the masquerade let us hope it was essentially foreign even to the skin of the man the

sphere and with all duhans goodwill was the opportunity extremely golden it cannot be said that friedrich who spells in the way we saw asteure for a cette heure has made shining acquisitions on the literary side however in the longrun it becomes clear his intellect roving on devious courses or plodding along the prescribed tramroads had been wide awake and busy all the while bringing in abundant pabulum of an irregular nature  he did learn arithmetic geography and the other useful knowledges that were indispensable to him he knows history extensively though rather the roman french and general european as the french have taught it him than that of hessen brunswick england or even the electoral and royal house of brandenburg which papa had recommended he read history where he could find it readable to the end of his life and had early begun reading itimmensely eager to learn in his little head what strange things had been and were in this strange planet he was come into  we notice with pleasure a lively taste for facts in the little boy which continued to be the taste of the man in an eminent degree fictions he also knows an eager extensive reader of what is called poetry literature and himself a performer in that province by and by but it is observable how much of realism there always is in his literature how close here as elsewhere he always hangs on the practical truth of things how fiction itself is either an expository illustrative garment of fact or else is of no value to him romantic readers of his literature are much disappointed in consequence and pronounce it bad literatureand sure enough in several senses it is not to be called good bad literature they say shallow barren most unsatisfactory to a reader of romantic appetites which is a correct verdict as to the romantic appetites and it but to the man himself this quality of mind is of immense moment and advantage and forms truly the basis of all he was good for in life once for all he has no pleasure in dreams in particolored clouds and nothingnesses all his curiosities gravitate towards what exists what has being and reality round him that is the significant thing to him that he would right gladly know being already related to that as friend or as enemy and feeling an unconscious indissoluble kinship who shall say of what importance towards all that for he too is a little fact big as can be to himself and in the whole universe there exists nothing as fact but is a fellowcreature of his  that our little fritz tends that way ought to give noltenius finkenstein and other interested parties the very highest satisfaction it is an excellent symptom of his intellect this of gravitating irresistibly towards realities better symptom of its quality whatever quantity there be of it human intellect cannot show for itself however it may go with literature and satisfaction to readers of romantic appetites this young soul promises to become a successful worker one day and to do something under the sun for work is of an extremely unfictitious nature and no man can roof his house with clouds and moonshine so as to turn the rain from him  it is also to be noted that his style of french though he spelt it so ill and never had the least mastery of punctuation has real merit rapidity easy vivacity perfect clearness here and there a certain quaint expressiveness on the whole he had learned the art of speech from those old french governesses in those old and new french books of his we can also say of his literature of what he hastily wrote in mature life that it has much more worth even as literature than the common romantic appetite assigns to it a vein of distinct sense and good interior articulation is never wanting in that thinflowing utterance the true is well riddled out from amid the false the important and essential are alone given us the unimportant and superfluous honestly thrown away a lean wiry veracity an immense advantage in any literature good or bad is everywhere beneficently observable the quality of the intellect always extremely good whatever its quantity may be  it is true his spellingasteure for a cette heureis very bad and as for punctuation he never could understand the mystery of it he merely scatters a few commas and dashes as if they were shaken out of a pepperbox upon his page and so leaves it these are deficiencies lying very bare to criticism and i confess i never could completely understand them in such a man he that would have ordered arrest for the smallest speck of mud on a mans buffbelt indignant that any pipeclayed portion of a man should not be perfectly pipeclayed how could he tolerate false spelling and commas shaken as out of a pepperbox over his page it is probable he cared little about literature after all cared at least only about the essentials of it had practically no ambition for himself or none considerable in that kindand so might reckon exact obedience and punctuality in a soldier more important than good spelling to an amateur literary man he never minded snuff upon his own chin not even upon his waistcoat and breeches a merely superficial thing not worth bothering about in the press of real business  that friedrichs course of education did on the whole prosper in spite of every drawback is known to all men he came out of it a man of clear and everimproving intelligence equipped with knowledge true in essentials if not punctiliously exact upon all manner of practical and speculative things to a degree not only unexampled among modern sovereign princes so called but such as to distinguish him even among the studious class nay many menofletters have made a reputation for themselves with but a fraction of the real knowledge concerning men and things past and present which friedrich was possessed of already at the time when action came to be demanded of him he was what we must call a wellinformed and cultivated man which character he never ceased to merit more and more and as for the action and the actionswe shall see whether he was fit for these or not  one point of supreme importance in his education was all along made sure of by the mere presence and presidence of friedrich wilhelm in the business that there was an inflexible law of discipline everywhere active in it that there was a spartan rigor frugality veracity inculcated upon him economy he is to study to the bottom and not only so but in another sense of the word he is to practise economy and does or else suffers for not doing it economic of his time first of all generally every other noble economy will follow out of that if a man once understand and practise that here was a truly valuable foundation laid and as for the rest nature in spite of shotrubbish had
