73555776	peter bell the third  by miching mallecho     is it a party in a parlour  crammed just as they on earth were crammed  some sipping punchsome sipping tea  but as you by their faces see  all silent and alldamned  peter bell by w wordsworth   opheliawhat means this my lord  hamletmarry this is miching mallecho it means mischief  shakespeare     dedication  to thomas brown esq the younger hf  dear tomallow me to request you to introduce mr peter bell to the respectable family of the fudges although he may fall short of those very considerable personages in the more active properties which characterize the rat and the apostate i suspect that even you their historian will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly legitimate qualification of intolerable dulness  you know mr examiner hunt wellit was he who presented me to two of the mr bells my intimacy with the younger mr bell naturally sprung from this introduction to his brothers and in presenting him to you i have the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is considerably the dullest of the three  there is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of the peter bells that if you know one peter bell you know three peter bells they are not one but three not three but one an awful mystery which after having caused torrents of blood and having been hymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres is at length illustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world by the nature of mr peter bell  peter is a polyhedric peter or a peter with many sides he changes colours like a chameleon and his coat like a snake he is a proteus of a peter he was at first sublime pathetic impressive profound then dull then prosy and dull and now dulloh so very dull it is an ultralegitimate dulness  you will perceive that it is not necessary to consider hell and the devil as supernatural machinery the whole scene of my epic is in this world which isso peter informed us before his conversion to white obi       the world of all of us and where      we find our happiness or not at all  let me observe that i have spent six or seven days in composing this sublime piece the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of its revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit driving you mad while it has retained its calmness and its splendour and i have been fitting this its last phase to occupy a permanent station in the literature of my country  your works indeed dear tom sell better but mine are far superior the public is no judge posterity sets all to rights  allow me to observe that so much has been written of peter bell that the present history can be considered only like the iliad as a continuation of that series of cyclic poems which have already been candidates for bestowing immortality upon at the same time that they receive it from his character and adventures in this point of view i have violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a conjunction the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being like the full stops at the end of the iliad and odyssey a full stop of a very qualified import  hoping that the immortality which you have given to the fudges you will receive from them and in the firm expectation that when london shall be an habitation of bitterns when st pauls and westminster abbey shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an unpeopled marsh when the piers of waterloo bridge shall become the nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers and cast the jagged shadows of their broken arches on the solitary stream some transatlantic commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of criticism the respective merits of the bells and the fudges and their historians i remain dear tom yours sincerely  miching mallecho  december 1 1819  pspray excuse the date of place so soon as the profits of the publication come in i mean to hire lodgings in a more respectable street     prologue   peter bells one two and three  oer the wide world wandering be  first the antenatal peter  wrapped in weeds of the same metre  the solongpredestined raiment                                 5  clothed in which to walk his way meant  the second peter whose ambition  is to link the proposition  as the mean of two extremes  this was learned from aldrics themes                         10  shielding from the guilt of schism  the orthodoxal syllogism  the first peterhe who was  like the shadow in the glass  of the second yet unripe                                      15  his substantial antitype   then came peter bell the second  who henceforward must be reckoned  the body of a double soul  and that portion of the whole                                   20  without which the rest would seem  ends of a disjointed dream  and the third is he who has  oer the grave been forced to pass  to the other side which is                                  25  go and try elsejust like this   peter bell the first was peter  smugger milder softer neater  like the soul before it is  born from that world into this                                 30  the next peter bell was he  predevote like you and me  to good or evil as may come  his was the severer doom  for he was an evil cotter                                      35  and a polygamic potter  and the last is peter bell  damned since our first parents fell  damned eternally to hell  surely he deserves it well                                     40     part 1 death   1  and peter bell when he had been  with freshimported hellfire warmed  grew seriousfrom his dress and mien  twas very plainly to be seen  peter was quite reformed                                       5   2  his eyes turned up his mouth turned down  his accent caught a nasal twang  he oiled his hair there might be heard  the grace of god in every word  which peter said or sang                                       10   3  but peter now grew old and had  an ill no doctor could unravel  his torments almost drove him mad  some said it was a fever bad  some swore it was the gravel                                   15   4  his holy friends then came about  and with long preaching and persuasion  convinced the patient that without  the smallest shadow of a doubt  he was predestined to damnation                                20   5  they saidthy name is peter bell  thy skin is of a brimstone hue  alive or deaday sick or well  the one god made to rhyme with hell  the other i think rhymes with you                            25   6  then peter set up such a yell  the nurse who with some water gruel  was climbing up the stairs as well  as her old legs could climb themfell  and broke them boththe fall was cruel                        30   7  the parson from the casement lept  into the lake of windermere  and many an eelthough no adept  in gods right reason for itkept  gnawing his kidneys half a year                                35   8  and all the rest rushed through the door  and tumbled over one another  and broke their skullsupon the floor  meanwhile sat peter bell and swore  and cursed his father and his mother                           40   9  and raved of god and sin and death  blaspheming like an infidel  and said that with his clenched teeth  hed seize the earth from underneath  and drag it with him down to hell                              45   10  as he was speaking came a spasm  and wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder  like one who sees a strange phantasm  he laythere was a silent chasm  between his upper jaw and under                                50   11  and yellow death lay on his face  and a fixed smile that was not human  told as i understand the case  that he was gone to the wrong place  i heard all this from the old woman                            55   12  then there came down from langdale pike  a cloud with lightning wind and hail  it swept over the mountains like  an oceanand i heard it strike  the woods and crags of grasmere vale                           60   13  and i saw the black storm come  nearer minute after minute  its thunder made the cataracts dumb  with hiss and clash and hollow hum  it neared as if the devil was in it                            65   14  the devil was in ithe had bought  peter for halfacrown and when  the storm which bore him vanished nought  that in the house that storm had caught  was ever seen again                                            70   15  the gaping neighbours came next day  they found all vanished from the shore  the bible whence he used to pray  half scorched under a hencoop lay  smashed glassand nothing more                                75     part 2 the devil   1  the devil i safely can aver  has neither hoof nor tail nor sting  nor is he as some sages swear  a spirit neither here nor there  in nothingyet in everything                                  80   2  he iswhat we are for sometimes  the devil is a gentleman  at others a bard bartering rhymes  for sack a statesman spinning crimes  a swindler living as he can                                   85   3  a thief who cometh in the night  with whole boots and net pantaloons  like some one whom it were not right  to mentionor the luckless wight  from whom he steals nine silver spoons                         90   4  but in this case he did appear  like a slopmerchant from wapping  and with smug face and eye severe  on every side did perk and peer  till he saw peter dead or napping                              95   5  he had on an upper benjamin  for he was of the driving schism  in the which he wrapped his skin  from the storm he travelled in  for fear of rheumatism                                         100   6  he called the ghost out of the corse  it was exceedingly like peter  only its voice was hollow and hoarse  it had a queerish look of course  its dress too was a little neater                              105   7  the devil knew not his name and lot  peter knew not that he was bell  each had an upper stream of thought  which made all seem as it was not  fitting itself to all things well                              110   8  peter thought he had parents dear  brothers sisters cousins cronies  in the fens of lincolnshire  he perhaps had found them there  had he gone and boldly shown his                                115   9  solemn phiz in his own village  where he thought oft when a boy  hed clomb the orchard walls to pillage  the produce of his neighbours tillage  with marvellous pride and joy                                  120   10  and the devil thought he had  mid the misery and confusion  of an unjust war just made  a fortune by the gainful trade  of giving soldiers rations bad                                125  the world is full of strange delusion   11  that he had a mansion planned  in a square like grosvenor square  that he was aping fashion and  that he now came to westmoreland                                130  to see what was romantic there   12  and all this though quite ideal  ready at a breath to vanish  was a state not more unreal  than the peace he could not feel                               135  or the care he could not banish   13  after a little conversation  the devil told peter if he chose  hed bring him to the world of fashion  by giving him a situation                                       140  in his own serviceand new clothes   14  and peter bowed quite pleased and proud  and after waiting some few days  for a new liverydirty yellow  turned up with blackthe wretched fellow                       145  was bowled to hell in the devils chaise     part 3 hell   1  hell is a city much like london  a populous and a smoky city  there are all sorts of people

when they came within the belt                              275  of his own nature seemed to melt  like cloud to cloud into him   4  and so the outward world uniting  to that within him he became

 at once circumference and centre  of all he might or feel or know                                295  nothing went ever out although  something did ever enter   8  he had as much imagination  as a

stagnant laguna   15  then peter rubbed his eyes severe  and smoothed his spacious forehead down  with his broad palmtwixt love and fear                     335  he looked as he no doubt felt queer  and in his dream sate down   16  the devil was no uncommon creature  a leadenwitted thiefjust huddled  out of the dross and scum of nature                            340  a toadlike lump of limb and

he proudly thought that his golds might  had set those spirits burning   20  and men of learning science wit  considered him as you and i  think of some rotten tree and sit                              360  lounging and dining under it  exposed to the wide sky   21  and all the while with loose fat smile  the willing wretch sat winking there  believing twas his power that made                             365  that jovial sceneand that all paid  homage to his unnoticed chair   22  though to be sure this place was hell  he was the deviland all they  what though the claret circled well

                        375  and peter noted what he said  standing behind his masters chair   2  he was a mighty poetand  a subtlesouled psychologist  all things he seemed to understand                             380  of old or newof sea or land  but his own mindwhich was a mist   3  this was a man who might have turned  hell into heavenand so in gladness  a heaven unto himself have earned                              385  but he in shadows undiscerned  trustedand damned himself to madness   4  he spoke of poetry and how  divine it wasa lighta love  a spirit which like wind doth blow                              390  as it listeth to and fro  a dew rained down from god above   5  a power which comes and goes like dream  and which none can ever trace  heavens light on earthtruths brightest beam               395  and when he ceased there lay the gleam  of those words upon his face   6  now peter when he heard such talk  would heedless of a broken pate  stand like a man asleep or balk                                400  some wishing guest of knife or fork  or drop and break his masters plate   7  at night he oft would start and wake  like a lover and began  in a wild measure songs to make                                 405  on moor and glen and rocky lake  and on the heart of man   8  and on the universal sky  and the wide earths bosom green  and the sweet strange mystery                                  410  of what beyond these things may lie  and yet remain unseen   9  for in his thought he visited  the spots in which ere dead and damned  he his wayward life had led                                    415  yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed  which thus his fancy crammed   10  and these obscure remembrances  stirred such harmony in peter  that whensoever he should

                            425  of lakes he had intelligence  he knew something of heath and fell   12  he had also dim recollections  of pedlars tramping on their rounds  milkpans and pails and odd collections                        430  of saws and proverbs and reflections  old parsons make in buryinggrounds   13  but peters verse was clear and came  announcing from the frozen hearth  of a cold age that none might tame                             435  the soul of that diviner flame  it augured to the earth   14  like gentle rains on the dry plains  making that green which late was gray  or like the sudden moon that stains                            440  some gloomy chambers windowpanes  with a broad light like day   15  for language was in peters hand  like clay while he was yet a

        510  he bought oblivion or renown  from gods own voice in a review   12  all peter did on this occasion  was writing some sad stuff in prose  it is a dangerous invasion                                      515  when poets criticize their station  is to delight not pose   13  the devil then sent to leipsic fair  for borns translation of kants book  a world of words tail foremost where

wellwhen i and you maam                   540  go as we shall do subter humum  we may know more than he   18  now peter ran to seed in soul  into a walking paradox  for he was neither part nor whole                              545  nor good nor badnor knave nor fool  among the woods and rocks   19  furious he rode where late he ran  lashing and spurring his tame hobby  turned to a formal puritan                                     550  a solemn and unsexual man  he half believed white obi   20  this steed in vision he would ride  high trotting over nineinch bridges  with flibbertigibbet imp of

found from thence                        560  much stolen of its accustomed flame  his thoughts grew weak drowsy and lame  of their intelligence   22  to peters view all seemed one hue  he was no whig he was no tory                                 565  no deist and no christian he  he got so subtle that to be  nothing was all his glory   23  one single point in his belief  from his organization sprung                                   570  the heartenrooted faith the chief  ear in his doctrines blighted sheaf  that happiness is wrong   24  so thought calvin and dominic  so think their fierce successors who                           575  even now would neither stint nor stick  our flesh from off our bones to pick  if they might do their do   25  his morals thus were undermined  the old peterthe hard old potter                           580  was born anew within his mind  he grew dull harsh sly unrefined  as when he tramped beside the otter   26  in the death hues of agony  lambently flashing from a fish                                 585  now peter felt amused to see  shades like a rainbows rise and flee  mixed with a certain hungry wish   27  so in his countrys dying face  he lookedand lovely as she lay                              590  seeking in vain his last embrace  wailing her own abandoned case  with hardened sneer he turned away   28  and coolly to his own soul said  do you not think that we might make                            595  a poem on her when shes dead  or noa thought is in my head  her shroud for a new sheet ill take   29  my wife wants onelet who will bury  this mangled corpse and i and you                             600  my dearest soul will then make merry  as the prince regent did with sherry  ayand at last desert me too   30  and so his soul would not be gay  but moaned within him like a fawn                              605  moaning within a cave it lay  wounded and wasting day by day  till all its life of life was gone   31  as troubled skies stain waters clear  the storm in peters heart and mind                             610  now made his verses dark and queer  they were the ghosts of what they were  shaking dim graveclothes in the wind   32  for he now raved enormous folly  of baptisms sundayschools and graves                        615  twould make george colman melancholy  to have heard him like a male molly  chanting those stupid staves   33  yet the reviews who heaped abuse  on peter while he wrote for freedom                            620  so soon as in his song they spy  the folly which soothes tyranny  praise him for those who feed em   34  he was a man too great to scan  a planet lost in truths keen rays                           625  his virtue awful and prodigious  he was the most sublime religious  pureminded poet of these days   35  as soon as he read that cried peter  eureka i have found the way                                   630  to make a better thing of metre  than eer was made by living creature  up to this blessed day   36  then peter wrote odes to the devil  in one of which he meekly said                                 635  may carnage and slaughter  thy niece and thy daughter  may rapine and famine  thy gorge ever cramming  glut thee with living and dead                                 640   37  may death and damnation  and consternation  flit up from hell with pure intent  slash them at manchester  glasgow leeds and chester                                    645  drench all with blood from avon to trent   38  let thy bodyguard yeomen  hew down babes and women  and laugh with bold triumph till heaven be rent  when moloch in jewry                                            650  munched children with fury  it was thou devil dining with pure intent     part 7 double damnation   1  the devil now knew his proper cue  soon as he read the ode he drove  to his friend lord macmurderchouses                           655  a man of interest in both houses  and saidfor money or for love   2  pray find some cure or sinecure  to feed from the superfluous taxes  a friend of oursa poetfewer                                 660  have fluttered tamer to the lure  than he his lordship stands and racks his   3  stupid brains while one might count  as many beads as he had boroughs  at length replies from his mean front                         665  like one who rubs out an account  smoothing away the unmeaning furrows   4  it happens fortunately dear sir  i can i hope i need require  no pledge from you that he will stir                           670  in our affairslike oliver  that hell be worthy of his hire   5  these words exchanged the news sent off  to peter home the devil hied  took to his bed he had no cough                               675  no doctormeat and drink enough  yet that same night he died   6  the devils corpse was leaded down  his decent heirs enjoyed his pelf  mourningcoaches many a one                                   680  followed his hearse along the town  where was the devil himself   7  when peter heard of his promotion  his eyes grew like two stars for bliss  there was a bow of sleek devotion                               685  engendering in his back each motion  seemed a lords shoe to kiss   8  he hired a house bought plate and made  a genteel drive up to his door  with sifted gravel neatly laid                               690  as if defying all who said  peter was ever poor   9  but a disease soon struck into  the very life and soul of peter  he walked aboutslepthad the hue                             695  of health upon his cheeksand few  dug betternone a heartier eater   10  and yet a strange and horrid curse  clung upon peter night and day  month after month the thing grew worse                         700  and deadlier than in this my verse  i can find strength to say   11  peter was dullhe was at first  dulloh so dullso very dull  whether he talked wrote or rehearsed                        705  still with this dulness was he cursed  dullbeyond all conceptiondull   12  no one could read his booksno mortal  but a few natural friends would hear him  the parson came not near his portal                            710  his state was like that of the immortal  described by swiftno man could bear him   13  his sister wife and children yawned  with a long slow and drear ennui  all human patience far beyond                                  715  their hopes of heaven each would have pawned  anywhere else to be   14  but in his verse and in his prose  the essence of his dulness was  concentred and compressed so close                             720  twould have made guatimozin doze  on his red gridiron of brass   15  a printers boy folding those pages  fell slumbrously upon one side  like those famed seven who slept three ages                    725  to wakeful frenzys vigilrages  as opiates were the same applied   16  even the reviewers who were hired  to do the work of his reviewing  with adamantine nerves grew tired                           730  gaping and torpid they retired  to dream of what they should be doing   17  and worse and worse the drowsy curse  yawned in him till it grew a pest  a wide contagious atmosphere                                   735  creeping like cold through all things near  a power to infect and to infest   18  his servantmaids and dogs grew dull  his kitten late a sportive elf  the woods and lakes so beautiful                              740  of dim stupidity were full  all grew dull as peters self   19  the earth under his feetthe springs  which lived within it a quick life  the air the winds of many wings                               745  that fan it with new murmurings  were dead to their harmonious strife   20  the birds and beasts within the wood  the insects and each creeping thing  were now a silent multitude                                    750  loves work was left unwroughtno brood  near peters house took wing   21  and every neighbouring cottager  stupidly yawned upon the other  no jackass brayed no little cur                                755  cocked up his earsno man would stir  to save a dying mother   22  yet all from that charmed district went  but some halfidiot and halfknave  who rather than pay any rent                                   760  would live with marvellous content  over his fathers grave   23  no bailiff dared within that space  for fear of the dull charm to enter  a man would bear upon his face                                 765  for fifteen months in any case  the yawn of such a venture   24  seven miles abovebelowaround  this pest of dulness holds its sway  a ghastly life without a sound                                 770  to peters soul the spell is bound  how should it ever pass away
